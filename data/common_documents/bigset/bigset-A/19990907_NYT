A SUMMER FAIR, A DEADLY GERM, A CHILD'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Saturday, Aug. 28, Rachel Aldrich was a vibrant, intelligent
3-year-old, relishing the delights of the Washington County Fair in
Greenwich, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sept. 4, Rachel Aldrich was virtually brain-dead,
spending the day that had been set aside for her fourth-birthday
party in the Albany Medical Center, bathed in the prayers of family
and friends to whom she was increasingly oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the savaging of her body and brain by a virulent
strain of E. coli bacteria, which health officials believe she and
more than 150 other people _ including her 2-year-old sister,
Kaylea _ ingested at the fair. Kaylea was listed in fair condition
Monday at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That day at the fair was Rachel's ``last day of fun in the
world,'' her father, Wayne Aldrich, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the outbreak may have been caused by surface
runoff passing a barn that housed cattle and then contaminated the
fair's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, when Rachel's family made the decision to
disconnect her life-support system, Rachel became the first, and so
far only, fatality attributed to the E. coli outbreak, which
officials are calling the largest in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Wayne Aldrich, 32, accompanied by his wife, Lori, 26,
recounted his daughter's last devastating days at a news conference
at the medical center. The family was speaking out, Aldrich said,
to warn others about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials issued warnings of their own, saying that they
had identified two cases of secondary infection _ people who were
not at the fair, but who share a household with someone who was.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent further spread of the disease, they urged anyone with
even mild diarrhea, one of the symptoms of infection, to take
precautions like washing their hands and avoiding activities like
food preparation. The authorities also advised them to avoid
settings like day-care or health-care centers where the bacteria
could easily spread.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rachel, health officials have identified 155
confirmed or suspected E. coli cases. Almost all of the victims,
who include at least five people from Vermont and Massachusetts,
visited the fair the weekend of Aug. 28 and 29. Forty-five people
are hospitalized. The incubation period for E. coli is one to nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims are children, who are particularly
vulnerable to the bacteria's toxic effects. Kaylea, while faring
far better than her sister, is not out of danger yet. Although she
was in fair condition, she suffered a few setbacks Sunday night,
her father said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hospital, in pediatric intensive care, is a
4-year-old boy who, like Rachel, has developed hemolytic uremic
syndrome, a disease that attacks the red blood cells and can
ultimately lead to kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the patients have E. coli 0157:H7, a
particularly toxic strain.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have identified ``massive E. coli
contamination'' at one well point at the fairgrounds, which has its
own water system, said a spokeswoman for the state Health
Department, Kristine Smith. They are performing tests to see if
0157:H7 is found at that well point, although Ms. Smith said it was
possible that more than one strain of the bacteria would be
present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said that a ``terrible convergence of circumstances''
_ first the drought, then a downpour, and the fair _ seemed likely
to blame for the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The working hypothesis is that after a major downpour on Aug.
26, the water probably swept surface runoff from a nearby barn,
which was housing 700 head of cattle for an agricultural exhibit at
the fair, into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the water likely leached into the aquifer, which was
at a very low level because of the drought. The low level meant
that instead of deeper, cleaner water being drawn up, the
contaminated surface water made its way into the well. It was then
supplied to 13 places on the fair's western side, where many of
those who got sick said they had eaten or drunk.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Contaminated water can expose people to bacteria in innumerable
ways, especially at a county fair playing host to tens of
thousands. It can go into ice, lemonade, even soda mixes. It can
also be used to wash lettuce. Rachel and Kaylea both drank water
from a hot dog stand. They also washed their hands thoroughly at a
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said that water samples from the fairgrounds have
always been found to be within Clean Drinking Water Act limit.
</P>
<P>
   For the Aldrich girls, who are from nearby Clifton Park, the
fair was pure joy, their parents recalled. They looked at animals
and rode the merry-go-round. They bounced in the big balloon castle
and ate hot dogs and french fries and fried dough.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, though, the girls, usually the best of friends, were
being unusually aggressive toward each other. By Monday, they were
scratching each other and trying to fight. Kaylea came down with a
fever, then Rachel did too. A pediatrician diagnosed the flu.
</P>
<P>
   The girls began sleeping excessively and developed bad cases of
diarrhea. Rachel's was so bad, Aldrich said, that she was going to
the bathroom every five minutes. She stopped sleeping, and was so
tired that she would fall asleep as she sat on the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   When the parents saw blood in the girls' stools, they took them
back to the doctor, who diagnosed salmonella and had them admitted
to Ellis Hospital in Schenectady. ``Kaylea recovered quite well,''
Aldrich said. ``Rachel started to fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   She could no longer walk. She was lethargic. Her speech was
slurred. Early Friday morning she was transferred to Albany Medical
Center. At one point, her heart failed, and the supply of oxygen to
her brain was cut off for seven minutes. She had kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   But she survived dialysis, and so the family had hope. Aldrich
went to sleep that night, and woke Saturday to learn that Rachel
was worse. Throughout the day, the girl's family stayed by her bed,
telling her to fight.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, it was clear that she was brain-damaged. Her
parents were undeterred. ``We loved her so much it didn't matter,''
Aldrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rachel's brain continued to swell, and soon all response was
gone. And so they said their goodbyes, told her how much happiness
she had brought them, and, at 3:30 p.m., had her life support
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the news conference, Aldrich stopped talking,
and simply cried. But then he continued. ``Now we have Kaylea,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aldrich said she and her husband were focused on their
younger daughter ``minute by minute,'' delighting when she urinated
because it signaled working kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich said he and his wife are relying on their Mormon faith,
and on their belief in a life to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pull all my strength from knowing that if I am a righteous
individual, I will get to be with her again,'' he said of Rachel.
``I have no doubt that by then she will be teaching me.''

   TONE-PRINCESS: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Is it possible to be a
billionaire Saudi princess, an aspiring sports mogul, a Kansas City
businesswoman with a string of bad debts and a fugitive from a
felony arrest warrant all at once? &QL; 
Yes. If you believe ``Princess Thara Baselia Saud.''But publicity
surrounding Saud's bid this summer to buy two Colorado sports teams
and a Denver arena has raised questions about her royal title. It
also has spotlighted her checkered business career in Kansas City,
where she's known as Latonett ``Tone'' Hollander. By MARK MORRIS
and JOYCE SMITH. Story will move in the ``a'' category.PRATT-EVOL:
PRATT, Kan. _ If state biologist Chris Mammoliti is successful,
public school students in this small Kansas community won't be
getting the same old Darwin next year. Mammoliti, who works for the
Kansas Wildlife and Parks Department, has asked two Pratt County
school boards to add ``intelligent design'' to their science
classes as a supplement to Darwin's theory of evolution and natural
selection. That is something no other school district in the nation
has done, according to the National Center for Science Education.
By JIM SULLINGER. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
PARKS-CONTAM _ EUREKA, Mo. _ For years, barricades protected the
curious from Times Beach's toxic threats. The guards at a
contaminated former Army plant in Weldon Spring were just as
foreboding. But soon, planners will complete an almost unimaginable
transformation, turning these danger zones into lush playgrounds
that welcome visitors. The Times Beach site, where more than
265,000 tons of dioxin-tainted dirt and debris were incinerated,
will be home to the 409-acre Route 66 State Park. The park will
open to the public on Saturday. The Weldon Spring plant, where the
Department of Energy is burying debris contaminated with
radioactive waste, will link to the popular Katy Trail and the
August A. Busch Conservation Area. By OSCAR AVILA. Story will move
in the ``a'' category.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was 1995, and the Rice Owls were doing the smart thing, which
might be redundant.
</P>
<P>
   But as Rice now is at a crossroads in its athletic history _ and
if you think it's anything but a crossroads, you're wrong _ the
moment deserves to be remembered again.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Conference had gone defunct, as Texas A&AMP;M, Texas,
Baylor and Texas Tech decided it was time they started spending
their football weekends eating at the big table. Rice and others
were left to fight over scraps at some rickety card table in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Few could blame the SWC's bigger powers for bolting, although
few also thought those big boys would immediately enjoy bright days
in the new Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   But the Owls latched onto the Western Athletic Conference and
promised never to let go. It seemed this high-integrity institution
was having the last laugh and taking quite a good turn for its
football program, all things considered.
</P>
<P>
   While the Aggies and Longhorns would bop around Waco, Ames and
Lincoln trying to find their way, the Owls would have to make do in
San Diego and Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   While cross-town rival Houston was in the midst of NCAA
probation and something called Conference USA, of which little was
known and even less expected, the Owls seemed to have solid footing
and a heck of a travel itinerary. Darn the luck, and pass the
SPF-25.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Owls were spurned again. The only truly attractive
television commodities that WAC football ever had _ Brigham Young
and Air Force _ decided the conference suddenly was beneath them.
They bolted out of the league to form the Mountain West Conference
with other defectors.
</P>
<P>
   So there were the Owls again. Ditched.
</P>
<P>
   And now come more whispers in the wind, with TCU and SMU
apparently on their way to Conference USA. This latest WAC shake-up
could be devastating for the Owls, certainly putting the Rice
athletic programs in tough financial straits. It also would all but
guarantee more check-cashing bloodlettings like the upcoming Rice
trips to Michigan and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the Owls probably have heard every excuse short of
``It's not you; it's me'' in all these breakups. They have been
mistreated, used, abused and then mistreated again.
</P>
<P>
   But as Rice athletic director Bobby May has said, ``What matters
is how you react.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. And what might matter most at this point is that Rice stops
reacting like a revered institution of higher learning and starts
acting like a school that cares about its football program. That
is, if it cares.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to respect Rice president Malcolm Gillis for
always wanting to do everything ``in honorable fashion,'' as he
said amid the TCU and SMU news.
</P>
<P>
   But why can't you be honorable and also start burning the phone
lines trying to make your way into C-USA, which seems like the most
logical choice for the Owls?
</P>
<P>
   The Owls need to look out for themselves, because clearly no one
else is looking out for them. Sure, Rice made a commitment to the
WAC and promised to be true, but how true has the WAC been to the
Owls?
</P>
<P>
   The Rice faithful needn't look any further than Saturday night's
game against Houston and the weekend's other area football results
to see how close things are to slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars didn't just belt the Owls. They showed them a
quaint, colorful revamped stadium and an energy around the program
that hadn't been felt in years.
</P>
<P>
   Among other C-USA wins over the weekend were impressive starts
by East Carolina, which beat West Virginia, and Louisville, which
knocked off Kentucky. Alabama-Birmingham also narrowly lost to
Missouri, and Memphis dropped a tough one to Ole Miss 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   C-USA is doing fine, thank you. In fact, it has the second-best
non-conference record in the nation after two weekends of football
(4-2), trailing only the Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   At game's end Saturday, the Coogs might as well have held up a
banner to the Owls fans that read, ``This could be you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls also can see that the Aggies and Longhorns are in fact
doing fine in the Big 12, having won a couple of conference
championships already. And among those former WAC teams that
departed this year for the Mountain West, Colorado State upset
Colorado, and Utah blasted Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls need to react to all this and react quickly. Find a
conference. Call C-USA. Start acting like a school with a big-time
football program, assuming you still want one.
</P>

CLEMENS FAILS, YANKS LOSE TO ANGELS, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If you believe in omens, this figured to be a
good day for the Yankees' Roger Clemens. His teammate Allen Watson
heard the song ``Rocket Man'' on three radio stations while driving
to Edison Field, and Joe Girardi cheerily returned after the birth
of his first child to catch Clemens, intending to pass out cigars
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And everybody recalled what great stuff Clemens had in his last
outing, his 98 mph fastball and his hard-bending slider. Surely
Clemens was ready for lasting excellence, some of his teammates
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Clemens had one of his worst outings of the
season, surviving just 4 2/3 innings Monday night with a decidedly
mediocre repertory and the same inconsistent command in a 5-3 loss
to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the way it is going to be in 1999. With less than
a month to go in the regular season, there is not enough time for a
true breakout from Clemens. The Yankees expected the Santa Claus of
pitching, and instead they are getting the plaid tie from Aunt
Mildred.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is not going to get any Cy Young award votes. He is not
going to win 20 games. He is not going to lead the league in
strikeouts. With about five starts remaining, he will probably not
generate any more than 15 victories.
</P>
<P>
   It is all about the postseason now. The Yankees' lead in the
American League East has been shaved to 6 1/2 games, but barring a
complete collapse, they are headed to the playoffs. At that time,
Clemens will be judged wholly on how he performs in October.
</P>
<P>
   By struggling this season, he has been unable to establish
credibility with Yankee fans. If he pitches effectively in the
postseason and the Yankees win, then he will have passed the
ultimate test of their fans. If he pitches poorly and the Yankees
lose, however, then the trade of David Wells to Toronto for Clemens
will be seen as the move that sank a team coming off a season of
125 victories and a championship. That is an unfair perception,
considering all the other circumstances of this season. But this is
the reality facing Clemens now.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably not a daunting prospect to him. Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, has been surprised at how
much Clemens likes challenges like this: He thrives on the prospect
of having runners on base, of pitching on the edge. And as
Stottlemyre has got to know Clemens, he is sure this is part of the
reason the right-hander has been so successful.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the season, however, Clemens has been unable to pitch
out of the trouble he creates. He had few real weapons to do so
Monday night. His fastball, so good last week when he pitched
against Oakland, was perhaps 4 to 5 mph slower than it was last
week, and his command in the first inning was awful. Darin Erstad
forced Clemens to a full count before grounding out, and then
Clemens walked the next two hitters, Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon, on
a total of nine pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Facing his former Boston teammate Mo Vaughn, Clemens threw a
fastball and Vaughn popped out foul. But then Clemens appeared to
hang a slider to the hulking third baseman Troy Glaus, who swung
and bashed the ball into the back of the Angels' bullpen beyond the
left-field fence. It was 3-0, just like that. About a third of the
88 runs Clemens has allowed this year have been scored in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens walked Jeff Huson to lead off the second inning, walking
about halfway between the mound and home plate to scream at umpire
Bill Miller over a ball-strike interpretation, perhaps the most
animated Clemens has been all year. He shut out the Angels through
the second, third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   But his pitch count was staggering _ 24 in the first, 19 in the
second and 26 in the third. He was near 100 in the fifth. Clemens
fell behind Erstad, two balls and no strikes, and allowed a single.
He threw two straight balls to Edmonds followed by a fastball that
Edmonds expected, and the Angels' center fielder launched it for a
two-run home run. Shortly thereafter, Clemens was relieved, having
allowed six hits, four walks and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens did not pitch well and his record fell to 12-8, but he
probably would not have won in any event for want of run support.
Jarrod Washburn, who was 0-3 with a 9.15 earned run average coming
into the game, stifled the Yankees' lineup. Shane Spencer got a run
back for the Yankees in the fifth inning, by slamming his first
home run since June, and in the seventh, Chili Davis pounded his
17th home run, his first since early August.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored again in the eighth, when Derek Jeter hit a
run-scoring single, but Troy Percival closed out matters in the
ninth.

 PRINCESS OR PRETENDER? fORMER KC BUSINESSWOMAN DODGES DEBTS, (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Is it possible to be a billionaire Saudi
princess, an aspiring sports mogul, a Kansas City businesswoman
with bad debts and a fugitive from a felony arrest warrant all at
once?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. If you believe Princess Thara Baselia Saud.
</P>
<P>
   But publicity surrounding her bid this summer to buy two
Colorado sports teams and a Denver arena has raised questions about
her royal title. It also has spotlighted her checkered business
career in Kansas City, where she's known as Latonett ``Tone''
Hollander.
</P>
<P>
   In late July the self-proclaimed princess mystified Denver when
she announced she was making a $450 million bid for a sports arena,
the Denver Nuggets basketball franchise and the Colorado Avalanche
hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   She backed up the bid attempt with a resume that claimed a
doctorate from the London School of Economics. She later claimed an
additional doctorate from the University of California-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period in late July, she was a fixture in the Denver
media. Columnists hooted at the prospect of a Saudi princess owning
an NBA team, and she was a featured item on cable sports channels.
</P>
<P>
   Her bid never was in serious contention, according to those
familiar with the sale. It fell $11 million short of the winning
proposal, and she never submitted financial statements or bank
guarantees to document her purported oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems have since surfaced. Schools where she claimed to
have done her doctoral work could not confirm that she earned the
degrees under the names she provided.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have arisen about her claims to a Saudi royal title.
They rest, she said, on her marriage two decades ago to a dashing
Saudi test pilot she met in a club at an Air Force base in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She said that before his death in a plane crash, they had a son.
That son, she said, is 20 years old today and worth more than $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview with The Kanas City Star,
Hollander, 47, defended her claim to a royal title but also
acknowledged that she once was a Kansas City businesswoman who
scooted out of town in 1994, facing lawsuits from angry creditors
and a felony bad check warrant from Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never hidden the fact that I am ... Hollander. I have
never denied that,'' she said. ``I have not always lived as a
princess. I've only used the `princess' since my son came back in
1996.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington said
diplomats there were unaware of a Princess Thara Baselia Saud or
any links to the kingdom's royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked on the situation, and the name is not familiar,''
said Jamel Nasef, director of the embassy's information office.
``We'd pay attention to the wife of a prince. I've never heard of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasef also said the embassy had no knowledge of a royal prince
coming to the United States, marrying Hollander or having a child.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hollander says her son is in the United States now,
attending college, she refused to say anything about him other than
his first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was married to a prince....And I got my son back in 1996,''
she said. ``His first name is Jamal, and I can't give any more
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi embassy doubts her claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one thing for sure: If there is a prince here in the
United States or living in the United States, we would know right
away, because they come through us,'' Nasef said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander's claims to a royal title haven't made much of a
splash with the Saudi government, but her work in Kansas City
created ripples in the business and arts communities.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known of her life before 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her four-page biography says she was born in the early 1950s in
the Rosedale area of Kansas City, Kan., and taken as an infant to
live with unidentified relatives in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander said her life's brightest moments came in Europe and
in her 1970s marriage to the Saudi prince after she had returned to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She said her darkest moments were tied to a series of failed
marriages and persistent ill health.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hollander offered few details that could be verified. She
acknowledged and defended the vagueness that permeated her own
accounts of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a devoted friend who respects the sanctity of private
relationships, I will always protect those with whom I have shared
my life,'' she said in a written statement to The Star. ``If this
may call into question the veracity of my identity, so be it.''

AT ESPN, THE REVOLUTION WAS TELEVISED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some revolutions are planned. ESPN's was not. There was no
intention of hijacking the sports world when a former hockey public
relations man bought satellite time to start showing Connecticut
sports on cable television 20 years ago Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution needed time to percolate, but ESPN showed viewers
that highlights need not be confined to 3 1/2 minutes appended to
the end of a local newscast, that the early rounds of the NCAA
men's basketball tournament contained many earthly delights and
that the National Football League draft offered the reward of
watching your team try to better itself before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is a global empire (part of Walt Disney Co.'s domain) built
on the proposition that fans can't get enough sports, that even if
you are supposed to cut down on cholesterol, you can binge on a
diet of baseball, football, college basketball, hockey, soccer,
golf, tennis and a morning block of fitness shows that are part
sweat, part rippling pectorals and part deep cleavage _ and beg for
more.
</P>
<P>
   Like Audrey II, the greedily hungry plant in ``Little Shop of
Horrors'' who demanded, ``Feed me!,'' ESPN has fed delightedly on a
sports diet, swallowing the cable rights to whatever it could and
birthing offspring like a fertility clinic. When one 24-hour
network wasn't enough, it started ESPN2, doubling the chance to
hear Dick Vitale. When that was inadequate to fit its needs, it
sprouted ESPNews. When the Classic Sports Network charmed
nostalgists with vintage oldies first seen before Chris Berman
coined a nickname, ESPN bought it if only to prove that Dick Schaap
has seen every sports event known to man.
</P>
<P>
   Escape from Planet ESPN is nearly impossible. It is
international (20 networks), online (ESPN.com), in publishing (ESPN
the Magazine and ESPN Books), themed dining (the ESPN Zone), radio
(ESPN Radio), interactivity (ESPN Digital Games), music, pagers,
pay-per-view and syndication _ and ample time is found to
cross-promote them all. The leverage provided by the ESPN networks
to push ESPN the Magazine into circulation of 850,000 has proved
incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN creates its own programs (the X Games, Winter X Games, ESPY
Awards), produces top-flight reports in ``Outside the Lines'' and a
brilliant series like the ongoing ``Sportscentury'' countdown of
the top 50 athletes of the past 100 years, and it informs (and
bedevils) with its ever present, continuous loop of
bottom-of-the-screen scores on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   With the ESPN Chilton Sports Polls, the empire can survey your
feelings about itself: Is Dan Patrick more handsome than Kenny
Mayne? Do you understand Stuart Scott's linguistic riffs? Should
ESPN2 be called ``the Deuce''? Should ESPNews be renamed ``the
Thrice''?
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday ESPN will start two new networks _ ESPN Extra, for
pay-per-view, and ESPN Now, for sports news and schedules.
Suddenly, we need more ESPN? Will we finally be full after these
two? No, because more will be fed into the maw next Tuesday when
the newest ESPN Zone restaurant opens on Broadway, with replicas of
ESPN's studio sets, enough television screens to fill a P.C.
Richard showroom and custom ``Zone-Throne'' viewing stations.
</P>
<P>
   The first ESPN Zone, in Baltimore, played host to ABC's ``Monday
Night Football'' halftime show, where Berman, the host, competed
over the din of chewing patrons and Frank Gifford looked as if he
were pushed into a soundproof booth on ``Win Ben Stein's Money.''
Berman will be host to ``Monday Night Football's'' halftime show in
the New York Zone, without visible on-air mastication.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth of ESPN as a multimedia kingdom, its heart
remains ``Sportscenter,'' a news show with a hummable theme song,
enormous breadth and creativity, stars like Patrick and Bob Ley
(backed by lesser-knowns plucked from stations nationwide or raised
on a highlight-rich regimen on the ESPNews ranch), and others who
believe a sports report cannot be justified without attempting a
joke or snide allusion every 30 seconds. Many are the ancestral
sons of Keith Olbermann, the wittiest sports anchor of all, who
left ESPN's nest in a huff and now seeks to whup ESPN from his Fox
Sports News perch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Sportscenter'' defined for ESPN a culture of studio shows. The
more you have, the more you make. Expensive game rights are
unnecessary for a studio show, which is the philosophy of CNN/SI,
essentially a 24-hour version of ``Sportscenter'' created by an
ESPN rival. Even though ESPN cannot carry the World Series or Super
Bowl, it is always on site, packing enough equipment and manpower
to cover an invasion. ESPN and ESPN2's studio mainstays include
``Baseball Tonight,'' ``NFL 2Night,'' ``NBA 2Night,'' ``RPM
2Night,'' ``NHL 2Night'' and ``College Gameday.'' But the biggest
of the shows are ``NFL Countdown,'' which expanded to two hours
last season, and ``Monday Night Countdown,'' which stretches to two
hours next week.
</P>
<P>
   You think ESPN didn't enlarge its shows to help pay its $600
million annual Sunday night tab to the National Football League?
</P>
<P>
   For those contemplating whether starting their own sports media
empire is a profitable idea, think of this: Media research firm
Paul Kagan Associates says the mother ship ESPN will pile up cash
flow of $506.2 million on revenue of $1.3 billion this year. The
Sanford C. Bernstein brokerage says ESPN is worth $15.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But beating ESPN and its huge headstart is tough. Fox Sports Net
is a national cable network built to appeal to hometown loyalties
by carrying local games that are followed by the national ``Fox
Sports News,'' which does not have a hummable theme song but alerts
viewers constantly to its Jumbotron highlights screen. ESPN tries
to ignore Fox, which is impossible because of its aggressiveness,
illustrated recently with its decision to create a one-hour NFL
show at 11 a.m. Eastern, starting next week to coincide with the
beginning of ESPN's ``NFL Countdown.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of distress for Disney's ABC television network _
which carries ``Sports Night,'' a ``dramedy'' based on
``Sportscenter'' _ ESPN and its spawn bring only joy to the
Burbank, Calif., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has encouraged ESPN's widened influence over ABC Sports:
A former ESPN executive, Howard Katz, is the president of ABC
Sports; talent like Berman, Mike Tirico, Robin Roberts and John
Saunders migrate there, and ABC has a new National Hockey League
deal because ESPN chose to put it there. ESPN paid more for Sunday
night football than ABC did for the more valuable Monday night
package.
</P>
<P>
   And Disney is doubtlessly cheered that ESPN.com is a hugely
popular part of its Go.com Internet portal, which sports a dozen
ways to celebrate ESPN's 20th birthday, including ``Celebs Say
Happy Anniversary to ESPN,'' a ``Q&AMP;A with Dick Vitale,'' and a
rundown of Tuesday night's three-hour special tracing ESPN's route
from modest dreams to empire.

GIULIANI POSES QUESTION FOR MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing a skirmish with his potential opponent for
the Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday that first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton should be asked why she had belatedly called
on her husband to withdraw his clemency offer to imprisoned members
of a Puerto Rican terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the mayor offered another round of sharp
condemnation of the president's decision last month to offer
clemency to 16 members of the Puerto Rican organization, the Armed
Forces of National Liberation. The group, known by its Spanish
initials FALN, was said to have been involved in more than 100
bombings in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to give clemency to people who are not
remorseful,'' Giuliani said. He pointed out that the president has
only rarely offered clemency in the past and said he should explain
his rationale more fully to both ``the American people and
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Clinton, the mayor said: ``I know she originally
strongly supported it, but now she strongly opposes it. She'll have
to answer questions on why she changed her position.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton triggered criticism over the weekend from Hispanic
political leaders in New York by calling on the president to
rescind the offer of clemency.

 PRINCESS OR PRETENDER? fORMER KC BUSINESSWOMAN DODGES DEBTS, (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After what she said was a serious illness in 1989, Hollander
returned to Kansas City from Europe to visit her grandmother. It
was then she met and began living with classical pianist David Y.
Hollander, whose name she now shares, and began planning an
ambitious new business venture.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances in Kansas City said Hollander was a vivacious,
larger-than-life character who helped her husband manage his Kansas
City Chamber Soloists music series and often introduced the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gordon, whose wife, Nina, played cello in some of David
Hollander's programs, said Tone Hollander's flamboyance always
seemed genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked attention, but not on a fraudulent scale,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992 the Hollanders bought a home on Greenway Drive
near that of David Hollander's father, cellist Norman Hollander,
and began winning over the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great neighbors, very friendly,'' recalled
bassoonist Marita Abner of the Kansas City Symphony. ``They
entertained a little. They were wonderful and entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to reach Norman Hollander were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Tone Hollander began laying the groundwork for a new
venture _ a nationally distributed opinion journal to be published
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in The Star, she outlined a proposal to publish a
newspaper consisting entirely of paid advertising containing the
opinions of the advertisers. Her promotional material included
glowing tributes from Lee Iaccoca, Barbara Jordan and former first
lady Barbara Bush. Spokesmen for each, however, said they were not
acquainted with Hollander.
</P>
<P>
   Within three weeks signs of trouble began to surface. The
newspaper never got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, David Hollander postponed a concert at the Folly
Theater, saying Tone Hollander had undergone heart surgery, a
newspaper item reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several months the Hollanders faced seven lawsuits
in Jackson County, alleging at least $33,415 in unpaid bills and
employee wages.
</P>
<P>
   That July the Jackson County prosecutors office issued a felony
warrant for Tone Hollander's arrest related to at least $1,400 in
bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollanders responded by disappearing, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Process servers trying to serve notice of the lawsuits on the
Hollanders found nobody at home on Greenway Drive. In one instance,
neighbors told the servers they thought the couple had moved to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   By February the couple had defaulted on their $40,000 home loan,
and by March the home had been sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, six of the seven lawsuits were dismissed by the
courts because the suing companies could not find the Hollanders.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Associate Circuit Judge Anthony Romano said state
courts were required to purge inactive lawsuits from their dockets
periodically. The lawsuits could, however, be refiled if the
Hollanders returned to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Tone Hollander is no longer in danger of being arrested on the
bad check warrant. The statute of limitations on that charge
expired in July, said Philip LeVota, an assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sears, Roebuck and Co. secured a court judgment against the
Hollanders, for $13,054. Court records show that has not been paid.
</P>
<P>
   In her biography, Hollander summed up this period in her life:
</P>
<P>
   ``We hosted a wonderful concert series and started a Kansas City
newspaper.''
Tone Hollander blames the financial trouble she and David Hollander
faced in Kansas City on a group of disloyal executives from their
newspaper who improperly gave themselves pay raises, draining the
company's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently about multiple surnames and Social Security
numbers linked to her in credit and real estate records, Hollander
responded that she had been married many times, so confusion over
names was inevitable. She blamed the multiple Social Security
numbers on relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different Social Security numbers have resulted from siblings
who are, sadly, victims of drug abuse and who, unfortunately, have
abused my kindness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander, who says she ``hasn't been living like a princess,''
now lives with David Hollander in Wilton, Conn. She understands
that some might ask why she doesn't pay off relatively small debts,
if she, indeed, is an oil-rich Saudi princess.
</P>
<P>
   The issue first arose, she said, after she learned in 1996 that
her dead fighter-pilot husband had established a substantial trust
fund to care for her and their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I had more than $200,000 in medical-related debts, I
was extremely hesitant to access this trust _ wanting my son to
know unequivocally that he, not any financial legacy, was most
important to me.''

EVOLUTION DEBATE HITS HOME IN ONE KANSAS COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRATT, Kan. _ If state biologist Chris Mammoliti is successful,
public-school students in this small Kansas community will not be
getting the same old Darwin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoliti, who works for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and
Parks, has asked two Pratt County school boards to add
``intelligent design'' to their science classes as a supplement to
Darwin's theory of evolution and natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   That is something no other school district in the nation has
done, according to the National Center for Science Education.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent design suggests that life is too complex to have
occurred by chance and that it is more likely the result of an
intelligent cause.
</P>
<P>
   While efforts such as Mammoliti's might achieve few results in
some communities, they are being taken seriously in this rural
southwest Kansas town of 6,300.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Mammoliti of trying to sneak religion into the
schoolhouse through the back door, and they fear he might succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pratt could be a tossup _ the test case,'' said former state
Sen. Fred Kerr, a Pratt farmer who opposes such a curriculum
change.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Mammoliti, who said he represented concerned
parents, was made about the same time the Kansas Board of Education
was making national news by de-emphasizing evolution in the state's
science standards.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, people in Pratt suddenly found themselves in
the middle of a national debate.
</P>
<P>
   Willa Beth Mills, Pratt school board president, was being quoted
in The New York Times. A crew for NBC was on Main Street doing
interviews. CNN, CBS and the Los Angeles Times were putting
together stories on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has brought more attention to Pratt than anything in its
history,'' said Kerr, who worries that all the publicity is hurting
the town's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day I can read about my hometown in The New
York Times,'' an embarrassed 1965 Pratt High School graduate living
in Ohio wrote to The Pratt Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been blown way out of proportion,'' said Chamber
of Commerce President Jerry Bohn, whose wife is a school board
member. ``I don't see the big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers such as Joyce Depenbusch, a math and science teacher in
Pratt County's Skyline district, worry that the publicity will
overshadow all the good education that occurs in a community that
prides itself on high-quality schools.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have stopped talking to reporters. Kerr said the
issue had even strained relationships between neighbors. Mills
declined a request for an interview, saying she could not add
anything to a statement issued by the board.
</P>
<P>
   That statement lists the steps in arriving at a new science
curriculum and said the process normally took a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt Superintendent Ken Kennedy said he expected final board
action as early as February.
</P>
<P>
   While the new state science standards affect only what goes on
state assessment tests, each district has a curriculum guide that
directs what is taught in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   State standards often influence the way district guides are
written. Kennedy said Pratt postponed work on its science guide
because of the delay by the state Board of Education in approving
its standards.
</P>
<P>
   The current Pratt science guide, written almost nine years ago,
contains the following references to evolution:
</P>
<P>
   - Sixth grade _ ``Explain how similarities in body chemistry and
development show evidence of evolution. Describe the basis of
(French naturalist) Lamarck's and Darwin's explanations of
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   - Tenth-grade biology _ ``Summarize the history and the
development of the theory of evolution. Contrast the work of
Lamarck and Darwin.''
</P>
<P>
   Mammoliti said that he was not trying to dump Darwin or
evolution but that he wants to add the book Of Pandas and People to
the curriculum guide as a supplement to the study of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   He said science textbooks presented evolution as a fact. The
Pandas book, he said, presents another viewpoint, intelligent
design, and questions some of evolution's assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used together with your other text, it should help to balance
the overall curriculum,'' the authors state in the book's
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   But is this science, or religion in disguise?
</P>
<P>
   Mammoliti, who served on Pratt's science-curriculum review
committee, said that the book was ``pure science'' and that those
who wanted to keep it out of the classroom were using religion as a
means of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who support the use of this book who have no
church affiliation whatsoever,'' said Ernie Richardson, a Pratt
lawyer who accompanied Mammoliti when he made his presentation to
the local boards.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoliti and Richardson said they were surprised at the media
attention their effort garnered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want this to be a divisive issue in the town,''
Mammoliti said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics and splits have arisen.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Larry A. Carver, vicar for Episcopal churches in Pratt
and several other towns, said the Pandas theory suggested an
``intelligent designer,'' which would be interpreted by most people
as God.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, brings religion into science class. The U.S.
Supreme Court has said that teaching Bible-based creationism in
public-school science classes violates the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoliti said the Pandas authors did not reach any conclusion
about the designer because it was impossible to show scientifically
who or what it was. He said some people, for example, believe that
life on earth was ``seeded'' by extraterrestrial beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get real concerned when people try to limit the boundaries
of science,'' he said. ``We found that only evolution was taught,
and only information that supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pandas book is promoted by those who support creationism.
But Mammoliti said it had nothing to do with that theory. He said
those who hoped his effort would end the teaching of evolution also
might be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ashley, a 17-year-old senior at Pratt High School, is
editor of the school newspaper and plans her first editorial next
week in support of Mammoliti.
</P>
<P>
   She said that many students did not understand the issue and
that media coverage had left a negative impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they understand it better, they'll see that it only
broadens their knowledge,'' Ashley said. ``What's bad about that?''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is closely watching a
situation in Burlington, Wash., where a teacher uses the Pandas
book in his high school biology class. The teacher, Roger DeHart,
said he wanted only to give students a balanced view of a
scientific debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a smoke screen for creationists who have lost in the
courts,'' said Doug Honig, the Washington chapter's public
education director.
</P>
<P>
   He said the overwhelming number of scientists backed evolution
as the underpinning of biology and did not accept arguments put
forth by advocates of intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the ACLU's Kansas and
Western Missouri chapter, said his office was monitoring the
situation in Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ACLU was prepared to move if the Pratt or Skyline
districts added intelligent design.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens, we'll be ready,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas-National Education Association also is watching
school districts across the state. Organization officials said
Pratt was their main concern.

   EUREKA, Mo. _ For years barricades protected the curious from
Times Beach's toxic threats.
</P>
<P>
   The guards at a contaminated former Army plant in Weldon Spring
were just as foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   But soon planners will complete an almost unimaginable
transformation, turning these danger zones into lush playgrounds
that welcome visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Beach site, where more than 265,000 tons of
dioxin-tainted dirt and debris were incinerated, will be home to
the 409-acre Route 66 State Park. The park will open to the public
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Weldon Spring plant, where the Department of Energy is
burying debris contaminated with radioactive waste, will link to
the popular Katy Trail and the Busch Conservation Area.
</P>
<P>
   Planners know the projects will be a tough sell to residents who
have grown up wary of the sites and skeptical of government
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deer are plentiful; the birds are plentiful. It's very
green. I want to enjoy it,'' said Diane Warhover, superintendent
for the Route 66 State Park. ``But some people probably aren't
going to let their kids play here. Some people you're never going
to convince.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to avoid the ghosts of Times Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The town once served as a working-class resort on the Meramec
River. Only floods interrupted the town's tranquil existence off
Interstate 44.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s a waste hauler used a chemical mix to oil the
streets of Times Beach and other Missouri sites to control dust.
</P>
<P>
   The oil contained dioxin, a chemical that some scientists
believe can cause cancer and developmental disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 federal officials evacuated Times Beach's 2,242
residents. Many did not even have a chance to take their
belongings. Some doubted the chemical's danger and begged to stay.
The dispute over the buyout reached the White House and sparked
congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 planners agreed to incinerate dioxin-contaminated
material from more than 20 Missouri sites at Times Beach. The
cleanup, which cost an estimated $200 million, ended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When the Department of Natural Resources took over the land,
officials promised to turn the site into a state park.
</P>
<P>
   The town is abandoned now. Daffodils and peonies grow, leftovers
from home gardens. Oak, maple and white pine trees reach to the
skies. Treetops were lopped off to avoid hitting power lines and
interfering with the incinerator. New trees are being planted.
</P>
<P>
   As Warhover drives on the park's winding roads, a deer emerges
from the vegetation near a grass-covered mound of incinerated dirt.
A picnic area is planned near a mound of crushed debris buried
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Park planners do not plan to hide Times Beach's past.
</P>
<P>
   In a visitors center once home to Environmental Protection
Agency staffers, photographs of the cleanup hang near pictures of
the blue heron and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Planners also will install a few old street signs as reminders
of the addresses residents once called home. The park also will
contain a restaurant, a gift shop and seven miles of trails that
will connect with other paths in the Meramec Greenway and city
trails in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Route 66 will be the star of the park.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be Missouri's largest monument to the historic
highway known for stretching from Chicago to Los Angeles. Devotees
have donated signs and photos, and the park has received worldwide
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Route 66 spans the Meramec River inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Powell, founder of the Route 66 Association of Missouri,
remembers when Times Beach made national news like Three Mile
Island and Love Canal.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his members will flock to the park, despite that
history. If anything, they feel more secure because of the
environmental monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the cleanest ground in the United States,''
he said. ``I'm convinced you could eat that dirt and it wouldn't
hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials discovered new dioxin sites in eastern
Missouri, but they say Times Beach has been thoroughly searched.
The new dioxin was transported to an incinerator in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists also raised concerns about dioxin
emissions from the Times Beach incinerator, but EPA officials say
there is no risk.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Leistner, the last mayor of Times Beach, has seen
neighbors suffer cancer and lose babies. Others blame the dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say they believe the park is safe, but Leistner
did not want to say whether she agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not answer that question,'' she said. ``I'm pleased
for the people who want to go back. I'm just not quite sure how I
feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's time to turn the page, time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant at Weldon Spring is another toxic scar on a lush
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch Conservation Area nearby is home to hawks, foxes,
beavers and other wildlife. The Katy Trail, a statewide path for
bikers and hikers, winds through south St. Louis County, connecting
with local exercise paths.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's paths are cordoned off so bulldozers can move
contaminated dirt. Visitors must pass through tight security.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II the Army produced TNT here. In 1955 the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission began processing uranium ore for nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the plant closed in 1969, a variety of chemicals had
contaminated soil and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After the EPA declared Weldon Spring a ``superfund'' site, the
Department of Energy in 1986 began a cleanup that will not end
until 2002. A private firm is dismantling buildings, storing rubble
and treating contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag is creeping toward $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup has created what project manager Steve McCracken
calls ``the stigma of glow-in-the-dark, two-headed frogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than defensively fight the perception, the Energy
Department is confronting it. Instead of abandoning the site,
officials are launching a public-relations effort to bring in
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Bill Richardson went to Weldon Spring and proclaimed
it a ``Department of Energy success story.''
</P>
<P>
   One environmentalist agrees that Times Beach and Weldon Spring
planners are making the best out of a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, we wouldn't have pollution. Realistically,
we have it,'' said Claralyn Price-Bollinger of the Eastern Missouri
Sierra Club. ``We're glad to see these areas being re-used for a
good purpose, but in a way, the cows are already out of the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy plans to leave one building at Weldon
Spring and make it an interpretive center. Detailed accounts of the
cleanup will share space in the center with exhibits on the area's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Planners, working with the state Department of Natural
Resources, also plan a new trail to connect the 250-acre site with
nearby trails.
</P>
<P>
   In the department's boldest plan, visitors will be able to walk
to the top of a facility that will store 1.5 million cubic yards of
radioactive waste, layered with 8 feet of clay and aggregate
material.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, the vault will resemble a small hill, covered
with rocks. Visitors will enjoy a vantage point to rival any in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   As with Times Beach, planners will have to convince a skeptical
public that they should not worry about climbing a vault of
radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure at first thought, they'll think there must be
something about it that isn't right,'' McCracken said. ``But I'm
willing to bet that most people will go up. Even if they're not
sure, they'll do it out of curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Leistner hopes Times Beach residents can leave the past
behind, Glenn Hachey looks forward to riding his bike from his St.
Charles County home, down the Katy Trail to the top of the waste
vault.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Weldon Springs Citizens Commission, a
watchdog group, Hachey has prodded the government to leave the
plant site in good shape. Now instead of seeing waste pits, he will
see green countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a big fence around something and cordon it off,
there's always going to be a sense, rational or not, that there's
something dangerous about it. Well, it's not. We just want to put
it behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road. What people need to recognize is that
this is a historic point,'' he said. ``It's a happy ending.''

BUNION NOTWITHSTANDING, PERIPATETIC `GRANNY' EN ROUTE TO MEMPHIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Echoes of the civil rights movement have spurred
Doris ``Granny D.'' Haddock along the Arkansas stretch of her
cross-country trek for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The 89-year-old, who set off from Pasadena on New Year's Day,
spoke from the steps of Central High School in Little Rock, where
in 1957 African-American students broke the segregation barrier.
She spoke to the congregation of the city's First Baptist Church,
where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired many.
</P>
<P>
   Still modest despite gaining national attention since setting
out on her journey, Haddock's next major appearance is Tuesday in
Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   After leading a walk joined by activists, including comedian and
hunger striker Dick Gregory, Haddock will join a program at the
National Civil Rights Museum. The museum is housed in the motel
where King was felled by an assassin's bullet 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is civil rights territory. That's why we thought it might
be a chance to do something,'' said Haddock, who is from southern
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Like King and other civil rights leaders, Haddock said she is
walking to Washington, D.C., to seek justice for Americans. Haddock
cares about the many people she says don't have the money to gain
access to government and suffer economically from subsidies and tax
breaks favoring special interests.
</P>
<P>
   She said as much to the Little Rock congregation: ``We are
walking together on the high road of history. We are on even ground
now because so many sacrifices have been made behind us. We have
nothing to lose that we care about, and our shared freedom to
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock's journey attracted interest long before her speeches
sharpened over more than eight months on the road.
</P>
<P>
   One fan who began following accounts of her journey before she
strode into the South was Gregory. The 67-year-old
comedian-activist-nutrition guru said he will be in Memphis to
support her _ ``one agitator to another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the real Super Bowl. And she won't have 100,000 people
in the stands cheering for her. There's one person, God, in the
stands clapping and saying thank you,'' he said. ``It's right
against wrong, and there's no contest there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory appreciates the struggles Haddock faces, having crossed
the country himself on a 1976 run from Los Angeles to Washington,
D.C., to raise awareness about hunger in the United States and the
rest of the world. He has urged her to change socks and shoes often
to battle sweaty feet, drink plenty of water and eat lots of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her age, that's the amazing thing. She's not 89, she's a year
from 90. Them is basketball scores,'' Gregory said. ``I think she
will make it.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the people who have offered Haddock meals, lodging and
good wishes in towns and cities from Texarkana on the
Texas-Arkansas border to West Memphis near the Arkansas-Tennessee
border.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore get-togethers in Hope and Arkadelphia were memorable
occasions for Haddock to meet Arkansans. Haddock also recalled a
huge turnout in front of a Benton auto dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's amazing. I thought it was a real rare opportunity,''
said Nancy Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Ralph, welcomed Haddock and walk
coordinator John Anthony into their home on a cotton farm east of
Little Rock for three days and two nights. The couple also had
Haddock's support crew, then numbering three, over for a spaghetti
dinner and homemade vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   How they met is another tale of recognition and hospitality
Haddock has counted on during her journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and his family in Little Rock were coming out here for
breakfast, and he passed her on the street. He had heard her
interviewed on the radio, and he stopped and talked with them and
said you've just got to stay with my mom and dad,'' Nancy Mashburn
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen her on `Good Morning America,' but I had forgotten
who she was. I didn't realize she was in Arkansas,'' she said. ``I
didn't think she would make it, but I have no doubt she will make
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people far from Haddock's route who would love to join her
but probably won't meet her have been inspired to lead solidarity
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Cooley organized a group of concerned taxpayers in
Muncie, Ind., for a recent 10-mile walk _ matching the length
Haddock completes daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, man, this gal was really something. I liked her
statement that sometimes you just have to put your body there for
some causes,'' Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 people turned out for the walk along a railway bed
converted to a walking trail. Cooley said it gave the group energy
for future activism, and campaign finance reform will be one of
their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, she did give that effort energy,'' Cooley said.
``One person can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a nagging bunion on Haddock's left big toe can slow
her. She acknowledges some trouble with it, but heavy taping and
massage ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock, on her third pair of supportive walking shoes, isn't
going to stop after walking more than 2,000 miles through mostly
rural reaches of the nation's Sunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the minnow ponds, rice and cotton fields, and woods of
Arkansas, Haddock has enjoyed the green and yellow expanses. Even
the sometimes stifling heat, which has her on the road by 5:30 a.m.
and calling it a day about five hours later, hasn't been the
relentless brand she faced in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely walk. Arkansas is flat, flat, flat. Their roads
are good,'' she said.
</P>

ALSUP GETS BY WITH HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A.J. Alsup drove all the way from his North
Carolina home and hired a pit crew of racing novices to compete on
the streets of Los Angeles this weekend, so he figured that one
more gamble couldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto all weekend was `Roll the dice' '' said Alsup, whose
final risky move resulted in his first NASCAR Southwest Series
victory Monday in the featured event of the Ford L.A. Street Race.
</P>
<P>
   Alsup, who started 19th, took his pit stop on lap 38 of the
125-lap race, hoping that a yellow flag would soon follow, keeping
him close to the leaders and allowing him to make a move once the
other drivers pitted later in the race. The move played out
perfectly as Alsup took the lead on lap 58, when a full-course
yellow flag sent the rest of the drivers to the pits for their only
stops of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Alsup came out shead and never surrendered the lead in the final
68 laps, holding off Craig Raudman in the final laps to claim
victory and a $17,715 check. Series rookie Eric Holmes finished
third, followed by R.K. Smith and pole-sitter Greg Pursley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided early on to pit under the green flag and just take
two tires and gas,'' Alsup said. ``We knew it would cost us a lot
of track position right then, but we thought we could make it up
and grab the lead once everybody had their stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some buddies come out and help me on the pit crew, and
some of them had never even touched an air gun for the tires
before. It's a good thing we won, because otherwise I'd probably
have some credit-card companies at my door tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursley led the early part of the race but was passed on lap 20
by Kevin Harvick, who led the next 35 laps until Pursley regained
the lead. Pursley stayed in front until the pit stops, when Alsup
took over.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers handled the two hairpin turns near the start/finish
line without incident, but a sharp turn 1, coming off the longest
straightaway on the course, claimed several cars. Fifty-one of the
125 laps were run under caution.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially embarrassing situation for event organizers was
resolved before the race. Ken Schrader and Kenny Irwin, the two
Winston Cup drivers flown in to compete in the Southwest event,
apparently decided Monday morning that they would not race.
</P>
<P>
   Their cars were qualified in the morning by Ross Thompson and
Jon Zaretzky, respectively, but before race time Schrader and Irwin
changed their minds, although both started at the back of the field
as a penalty for changing drivers after qualifying. Schrader never
contended and crashed on lap 64, but Irwin took the lead briefly on
lap 79 before falling back to fourth and later hitting the wall.

THOUSANDS IN EAST TIMOR FLEEING AS MILITIAS ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS Monday to Tuesday in 5th graf) (See also TIMOR-U.N.) 
(th) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In what is evidently a planned campaign of
savagery, militias backed by the Indonesian military continued
their attacks on the people of East Timor on Monday, burning homes,
killing residents and forcing many thousands to flee into the
barren hills for safety.
</P>
<P>
   One week after an overwhelming vote of independence from
Indonesia by the 800,000 people of the tiny territory, the military
appears bent on leaving behind a bloodied, ravaged, broken land,
where they have fought against a separatist insurgency since
invading in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports reaching here, the militias burned the home
of Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, evicting 6,000 people who
were taking refuge there and forcing the bishop, who shared the
Nobel Peace Price in 1996, to flee. The militias fired at the
Australian Consulate and at the Australian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   A major operation appeared to be under way to force many
thousands of people to flee into neighboring West Timor, which is
part of Indonesia. Unlike the rest of the Indonesian archipelago,
which won independence from the Dutch in 1949, East Timor was a
Portuguese colony until 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Tuesday, President B.J. Habibie brought East Timor
under martial law, a move that would potentially allow the military
to deploy thousands of soldiers across the territory. The move
raised hopes abroad that Indonesia would now act to bring order to
the teritory. But it is not clear whether the soldiers will be used
to quell the current violence or to battle pro-independence forces
that have remained hunkered down in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, armed militias burned the home of the Roman Catholic
bishop, Carlos Belo, evicting 6,000 people who were taking refuge
there and forcing the bishop, who shared the Nobel Peace Price in
1996, to flee. The militias fired at the Australian Consulate and
at the Australian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   A major operation appeared to be under way to force many
thousands of people to flee into neighboring West Timor, which is
part of Indonesia. Unlike the rest of the Indonesian archipelago,
which won independence from the Dutch in 1949, East Timor was a
Portuguese colony until 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported that large numbers of people in Dili, East
Timor's capital, were being loaded onto trucks, and authorities
said 15,000 people had already arrived in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows every sign of being planned and coordinated
beforehand,'' said Sidney Jones, the Asian director for Human
Rights Watch, who is an expert on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian army may be trying to teach a lesson not only
to the East Timorese but to the people of Aceh and Irian Jaya,''
Ms. Jones said, referring to two other provinces with strong
separatist movements. ``The lesson is: if you seek separation from
Indonesia, even if support for separation is overwhelming, we will
destroy you, and no outside power will come to your aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence in East Timor appears to reflect the reluctance of
the Indonesian military to let go of the territory after fighting a
guerrilla war against the independence movement there since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As demands from around the world for foreign military
intervention mounted, given the failure of Indonesian forces to
keep order, representatives from the U.N. Security Council were
preparing to come to Jakarta to confer with the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Australia put troops on emergency alert, reducing the time it
would take to send peacekeeping forces to East Timor from 72 hours
to 24, Defense Minister John Moore said. He said peacekeeping
forces could be deployed only with the agreement of the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia has taken an adamant position that it will not
accept foreign troops. For weeks, Indonesia has promised to take
action against the violence in East Timor, but it has done little.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's open defiance of international opinion was
particularly striking at a time when it is dependent on billions of
dollars of international aid to rescue it from a devastating
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which is heading a $43-billion
rescue program, issued a statement on Monday saying that it was
``closely watching the situation in East Timor'' and ``notes with
concern the violence that continues to mar the process.'' But much
of the aid has already been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. special envoy for East Timor, raised
the international concerns at a meeting on Monday with President
B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Marker said, ``It is very clear today that
the Indonesian government has failed in its responsibility to
maintain adequate security.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by reporters at a separate news conference, Habibie
said: ``Come on, come on. What we have achieved right now is one
thing: we have achieved the fact that we had a transparent,
peaceful ballot, and that _ don't take that for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati Sukarnoputri, the front-runner to succeed Habibie when
Indonesia selects a new president in November, blamed Habibie's
government for the situation and apologized on Indonesia's behalf
to the people of East Timor for a quarter-century of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters the situation in East
Timor ``is not as simple as you have described it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often our police have to wait for reinforcements in the
face of an overwhelming presence of armed, unruly elements,'' he
said. ``They have continued to exercise great persuasive powers,
and in many cases they were able to prevent things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the military backing, and, according to some
accounts, taking part in the militia violence, police were
sometimes placed in an impossible position. In many cases in the
last two weeks, the police were observed to be working hand in hand
with the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the Indonesian military formed the irregular
militia groups, made up of local toughs and unemployed youths, to
conduct a campaign of intimidation that appeared to be aimed at
skewing or derailing the referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
   That failed when nearly 99 percent of eligible East Timorese
turned out to vote on Aug. 30 and 78.5 percent of the voters chose
independence.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems evident that the next step in the strategy was to
remove foreign witnesses to the current wave of terror. Most
foreign reporters, election observers, aid groups and foreign
workers for the United Nations have now fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a systematic attempt not to kill journalists
but to chase them away from the story, because without the media
there nobody will know what happens,'' said Lin Neumann, the Asia
representative for the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which administered the referendum, was
evacuating nearly 200 members of its staff on Monday. A spokesman,
David Wimhurst, said shots had been fired at one of three
evacuation convoys heading for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   According to other reports from East Timor, virtually all of the
U.N. workers stationed outside the capital have fled to the town of
Baucau, in the eastern part of the territory, where the militias
seem to be less virulent.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack on his residence, Belo, who shared the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1996 with the pro-independence activist Jose Ramos
Horta, was also flown to Baucau in a police helicopter _ possibly
to remove him, as a respected figure for moderation, from the
center of action.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who had sought protection in his home were taken to
police stations at gunpoint, witnesses said, along with about 2,000
people who had sought protection at the nearby headquarters of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which was also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports said the military was trucking many thousands of
such refugees and others across the border to neighboring West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a deliberate forced displacement of people on
a very large scale,'' said Ian Martin, the director of the U.N.
mission in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-independence leaders have spoken recently about the
possibility of creating a separate pro-Indonesian enclave adjacent
to West Timor. Although the United Nations and Indonesia have
dismissed that notion in the past, the current campaign could be
aimed at dividing the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an organized military operation by the Indonesian
military to cleanse East Timor of pro-independence supporters,''
said Gillian Flies, co-director of operations in East Timor for the
Atlanta-based Carter Center. ``We've heard about this type of plan
for the past two months, that this was their plan if the vote went
for independence.''
</P>
<P>
   For foreigners who remain in East Timor, the atmosphere of
threat is constant. Much of Dili is a ghost town, residents said,
apart from armed young men roaming about on motorcycles and groups
of refugees seeking safety.
</P>
<P>
   There is no certainty of protection in any quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Liam Phelan, a freelance reporter who has remained in Dili, said
that when armed men threatened the Turismo Hotel on Monday, he took
shelter with about 15 people in a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the military say: `Go in and get them. Go in and get
them,''' Phelan said. ``Those were the people who were supposed to
be guarding us.'' He said he had managed to escape and later flee
to the U.N. compound, where the only protection is provided by the
same security forces.

NO EASY CURE FOR MONDESI'S WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Long after the Dodgers had accepted Monday's 8-6 loss to
Florida and gone home, Raul Mondesi sat alone in the clubhouse, the
unhappiest guy to ever hit two home runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, the only player in Dodgers history to get 30 homers and
steal 30 bases in a season, is not concerned that he is approaching
those numbers for the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   All he thinks about is getting away from a year that has gone so
terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The player Latin scout Ralph Avila called ``quite a loner'' now
seems more alone than ever. He won't talk about the tirade he threw
three weeks ago at management. He won't say if he has rescinded his
loud request to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have ruined my season,'' he said. ``All I want to do now is
finish up, try to relax and worry about the future later.''
</P>
<P>
   The second of Mondesi's two home runs, a two-run shot that cut
the Marlins' lead to 7-6 with one out in the eighth, was his 28th
of the season. He also has 27 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Mondesi has broken out of an offensive
slump that lasted almost three months.
</P>
<P>
   He has run the bases aggressively and has three home runs in the
first four games of the Dodgers' six-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that matters now,'' he said quietly. ``What has
happened cannot be put aside. It would just be nice to win a few
games and forget about everything else until after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi sat on a clubhouse sofa for more than an hour as
teammates filed by and into the Florida night.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in a 65-72 season, dwelling on losses seems almost
foolish, except for maybe manager Davey Johnson, who looked as
though he still was anguishing through a rain delay that held up
the game for two hours and 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the target for much of Mondesi's anger. Johnson
moved the slumping right fielder around in the lineup until Mondesi
figured he was being blamed for the Dodgers' lousy season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also was put in charge by club president Bob Graziano of
nurturing Mondesi through the low spots, even though the two have
known each other for less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense his mood has improved,'' Johnson said. ``I think the
recent success (12 wins in 17 games) has picked up everyone. No,
I've liked what I've seen in Mondy. I think things have improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's teammates disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that two home runs is not going to change,''
said Eric Karros, who also hit a home run. ``This is something
between Mondy and management and only they can work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder Trenidad Hubbard, who dresses next to Mondesi
at home and on the road, is probably closer to him than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard worried last month when Mondesi became unnerved by
reports that he might be traded at the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Hubbard had seen the usually cheerful
Mondesi so sad. And the boos by the once adoring home fans still
stung Monday even though Mondesi was playing 3,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of hurt there,'' Hubbard said. ``You
would think hitting two homers after all he's been through would
help. But maybe time is the only way.''

CITY EXPANDS PESTICIDE CAMPAIGN AGAINST DANGEROUS MOSQUITOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES `suspected' to `possible' in 2nd graf) (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials battling an outbreak of St. Louis
encephalitis expanded their campaign of aerial pesticide spraying
Monday to hundreds of acres of Bronx parkland along the East River
and Long Island Sound up to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded spraying effort, which until Monday had included
the scattering of pesticides across parts of northern Queens and
the South Bronx, came as the number of possible cases of St. Louis
encephalitis in the city rose Monday to 37 from 34, and the number
of confirmed cases held at five.
</P>
<P>
   Two elderly people have died of the mosquito-borne viral disease
and three other elderly people stricken with it remain in serious
but stable condition in city hospitals, city health officials said.
So far, the virus has afflicted people only in northern Queens. It
is possible that cases exist in the Bronx, but no cases have been
confirmed there, or in any other parts of the city or nearby
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani tried to ease residents' concerns about
the spread of both the virus and the spraying on Monday, calling
the broadened effort a preventive step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next couple of days we'll be doing some additional
spraying in the northern part of the Bronx,'' the mayor announced
at the emergency center the city has established near the
Bronx-Whitestone Bridge to help residents of the area. ``Caution
dictates that it would be better to continue to go further north
toward the Westchester border along the water.''
</P>
<P>
   But anecdotal evidence suggested Monday that public unease about
the spread of the virus was growing as people returned to the city
from the holiday weekend. City officials said an emergency phone
number they established to answer questions about the outbreak has
received over 11,000 calls _ the most of any such number in the
city's history.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The virus also became a political issue Monday with the Bronx
borough president, Fernando Ferrer, blaming budget cuts by the
Giuliani administration for eliminating mosquito spraying that
might have prevented the current outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of years ago there was spraying that was stopped in
the Soundview section of the Bronx,'' said Clint Roswell, a
spokesman for Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Mullin, a city Health Department spokeswoman, said that
officials with knowledge of past spraying in the Bronx were not
available Monday. But she said that the Giuliani administration had
made efforts to control the mosquito population with pellets that
release a bacteria that kills the larvae in stagnant water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Health Department does respond to complaints about
mosquito problems,'' she said. ``Pellets are dropped in pools of
stagnant water.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that most mosquitoes did not carry the virus and
that the illness was not always fatal. In general, it was the very
young and the elderly who were most susceptible to the virus, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new aerial spraying in the Bronx on Monday night focused on
all parks between the Hutchinson River Parkway and the East River
and Long Island Sound, Giuliani said. By far the most spraying
occurred in the sprawling, 2,764-acre Pelham Bay Park, which
borders Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Although city officials said that malathion, the pesticide being
used, posed almost no health threat to people or pets, they
instructed residents of areas bordering the parks not to go outside
during the spraying, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Residents were to turn
off their fans and set their air conditioners so that air only
exits their home.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Queens and Bronx neighborhoods where aerial
spraying took place Friday and Saturday _ Whitestone, Auburndale
and College Point in Queens and Soundview, Classons Point, Harding
Park and Ferry Point Park in the Bronx _ city officials directed
their attack Monday against pools of stagnant groundwater where
mosquito larvae can hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters surveyed the area for stagnant family swimming pools
and officials offered to haul away used tires, in which water can
also pool and stagnate. Officials said that water should be emptied
from lawn decorations, jars, cans and clogged gutters and that
window screens should be checked for holes.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of anxious residents streamed into the command center
Monday that the city's Department of Emergency Management has set
up in College Point to explain the outbreak and hand out mosquito
repellent. By late afternoon, a tent that had held hundreds of
cases of repellent was nearly empty as city officials handed out
instructions in English, Chinese, Korean and Arabic on how to
combat the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been bitten by mosquitoes will not know for 10 to
15 days whether they have contracted the virus, according to city
officials. The symptoms can involve only a slight fever and a
headache. Or they can be far more serious, with severe headaches,
high fever, coma, convulsions, paralysis and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said they were frightened by both the disease-carrying
mosquitoes and the pesticides sprayed across the neighborhood. John
Didio, 43, who grew up in College Point and has a 7-year-old
daughter and a 5-year-old son, said he was frightened by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn off your fans and stay inside,'' he said, paraphrasing
instructions residents were given during the spraying. ``It's kind
of like germ warfare.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A nervous Enrica Naccarato, 45, a sixth-grade schoolteacher who
moved to the neighborhood last summer, said she was having her
8-year-old daughter stay at her mother-in-law's house in Long
Island until school begins on Thursday. ``It's a little scary,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another worried mother asked whether the bug repellent she had
put on her children in the morning would last through their
recesses at school. (City officials said it would.)
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cantatore, who arrived with her daughter Diane to pick up
bug spray and instructions, said she was bitten twice on Saturday.
``It's just scary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter blamed the city for not stopping the outbreak
before it started. ``They never come to spray,'' she said. ``They
should've come a lot sooner.''

ANGELS' COOPER HAS ROOTS AT SHORTSTOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ If Brian Cooper had his way, he'd be playing shortstop
for the Angels tonight instead of pitching. It's nothing against
the Angels' current shortstop, Gary DiSarcina, it's just that
Cooper misses playing every day.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a 1992 graduate of Glendora High, will make his
major-league debut tonight against the Chicago White Sox. If all
goes as planned, Cooper could be in the Angels' starting rotation
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, though, was a shortstop when he started as a freshman at
Citrus College, but Owls manager Skip Claprood moved him to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not happy about it at all,'' Cooper said. ``I went from
an everyday player to once every five days. I liked getting my
uniform dirty. But I guess (Claprood) saw something in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper concedes Claprood was right. Cooper was a combined 12-6
at Double-A Erie and Triple-A Edmonton this season, earning his
promotion. But it hasn't always gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at Double-A Midland, Cooper was 8-10 with a 7.13
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I not only wondered if I'd even get here, but if I'd
play baseball again,'' Cooper, 25, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper worked on his confidence and a mechanical flaw, and
here he is. He said he'll leave about 20 tickets for friends and
family but is leaving the distribution up to his parents, Brian and
Kathy, who have had season tickets in Anaheim over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming to games here for years,'' Cooper said. ``We
were 10 rows up, so now I'll just be 10 rows closer to the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a library: Interim manager Joe Maddon, who says he averages
reading one book a week, says he likes the atmosphere in the
clubhouse now that the televisions are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're reading magazines, books on The New York Times
best-seller list, there are round-table discussions . . .'' Maddon
said, tongue-in-cheek. ``It's very stimulating right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar line: Mario Mendoza, the longtime Angels coach who
managed at Single-A Lake Elsinore this season, has joined the
big-league staff to help with pregame preparation now that the
Storm's season is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza has been made famous because of his hitting _ or lack
thereof. A batting average of .200 has become known throughout
baseball as the ``Mendoza Line.'' Those in the Angels organization
say Mendoza isn't particularly fond of the reference.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Leon Durham, a coach at Triple-A Edmonton, will join the
big-league staff today. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The MRI exams on pitcher Chuck Finley and right fielder Tim
Salmon were normal. Both have had sore backs. Finley is scheduled
to make his next start Friday at Minnesota. Salmon was in the
lineup Monday as the DH.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ Phillies pitchers didn't strain their neck muscles
watching home runs sail over the wall with record frequency Monday
night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson capped a six-run rally with a three-run pinch-hit
homer as the Astros won their fourth straight game, beating
Philadelphia 6-5 before a Labor Day crowd of 12,223 at Veterans
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Missing for five innings Monday, the Astros' bats woke up just
long enough in the sixth to gift-wrap Jose Lima's National
League-best 19th victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros maintained a 2{-game lead over the Cincinnati Reds in
the NL Central. The Reds, who beat the Cubs 6-3, have not been able
to gain ground on the Astros in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get anything tonight,'' said Astros manager Larry
Dierker, whose club fell behind 4-0 and had five of its six hits in
the sixth inning. ``We only hit in one inning.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be just enough. After the Astros took a 6-4 lead,
their bullpen limited the Phillies to one run over the final four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Astros hit for the cycle during the six-run
sixth. Six straight batters reached base in the inning, five via
hits off Phillies lefthander Randy Wolf (5-7).
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti tripled, Derek Bell singled, Matt Mieske doubled,
Tony Eusebio singled and Ricky Gutierrez walked before Johnson,
hitting for Lima, sent a 1-1 hanging curve over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never pinch-hit until I got to the big leagues,'' said
Johnson. ``It's been a learning process in a hurry for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' staff has allowed 15 homers in its last three
games, including an NL-record nine Saturday in a 22-3 loss to the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took a 1-0 lead in the second when Marlon Anderson
hit a one-out triple and Alex Arias followed with a single to left
field. In the third, former Astro Bobby Abreu, second in the NL
batting race, added a towering bases-empty home run to the upper
deck in right field off Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who allowed only one hit through five innings and had a
4-0 lead, unraveled in the sixth as the Astros matched their
highest one-inning output of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf allowed six runs and six hits over six innings. Since
beginning his career 5-0, the rookie has lost seven straight
decisions. He has an 8.73 ERA during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, whose outing was his shortest in nearly a month, allowed
four runs and eight hits over five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' said Lima (19-7), who moved within one victory
of becoming the first Astros pitcher to win 20 games since Mike
Scott in 1989. ``I didn't have my best stuff, but the team played
great defense behind me, the bullpen did a good job and Johnson hit
a great pinch-hit home run. Sometimes four-run (deficits) are
nothing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros clinging to a two-run lead, reliever Brian
Williams immediately ran into trouble in the sixth inning when
Arias singled and pinch hitter Rob Ducey doubled him to third.
Williams battled back, striking out Doug Glanville looking and
getting Ron Gant to fly out to right field with the runners
holding. With Abreu at the plate, pitching coach Vern Ruhle met
with Williams and instructed the righthander to give the torrid
lefthanded hitter nothing to hit. Williams struck out Abreu on an
81-mph curveball to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there in that situation, we just wanted to try and stay
away, make him hit my pitch,'' Williams said. ``I threw some good
pitches on the outer half (of the plate). When I got two strikes on
him, I tried to still stay out there and not give him anything to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies had another scoring opportunity in the seventh when
Williams loaded the bases with nobody out. He hit Kevin Jordan to
lead off the inning before Rico Brogna singled up the middle and
Mike Lieberthal walked. Reliever Jose Cabrera retired Anderson on a
called third strike and nearly got out of the inning without
allowing a run. But Arias beat out what could have been a double
play, allowing Jordan to score and slice the lead to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very nerve-racking game with the Phillies having so
many opportunities once they got the lead,'' Dierker said. ``It was
developing into a game that wouldn't have been that hard to lose,
the way things were going.''
</P>
<P>
   A baserunning blunder in the eighth cost the Phillies a scoring
opportunity. Glanville led off with a double into the right-field
corner but was gunned down trying to stretch it into a triple on a
perfect relay throw to third by Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner retired the side in order in the ninth for his 34th
save.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ If it had been Olympic diving, he'd have done a
belly-flop off the high board. If it were figure skating, he'd have
been skidding across the ice with a cold, damp bottom. If he'd been
hammering nails, well, let's just say he'd have sore thumbs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jose Lima became the National League's first 19-game winner
Monday but did not show much in the way of style points. Or dugout
decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Through five rhythmless innings, Lima looked like a guy with two
left feet, giving up eight hits, four runs and a homer to the
Phillies' Bobby Abreu that probably showed up on some satellite
photographs at NASA.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Lima got to dance the merengue once more because
Russ Johnson put some jitterbug into a three-run pinch homer and
the Astros held on for a 6-5 win over the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day. How fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the Astros, still mostly out of kilter at home plate
but able to come up with their fourth straight win because they
piled up all of their runs in one big inning.
</P>
<P>
   Here was Lima, never really bearing down during his short stint
on the mound and yet getting to put another notch on his belt when
Johnson bailed him out just moments after Lima threw another one of
his dugout tantrums over being lifted. He also snapped at Stan
Javier after a bloop double allowed a run to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' said manager Larry Dierker philosophically.
``He (Lima) was lucky. That's about all you can say. He's pitched
some good games and not given up much at times this year and come
away with no decision. Any time you have a year when you win a lot
of games, you're going to have some lucky ones. This fell into that
category. So you just put it away and figure that things have a way
of evening themselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the joy and spontaneity Lima brings to the game,
there are times when you wonder if he ever stops to try to figure
anything out. This was a night when he did not bring his best stuff
to a funereal Veterans Stadium against a Phillies team that has
plummeted in the standings in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lima was getting his pitches up in the strike zone and allowing
the Phillies to get in some good rips right from the start. None
more than the one Abreu took in the third inning to launch his solo
homer into the upper deck in right field. It was only the 15th time
in the 28-year history of the stadium a batter had reached those
heights in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed the Phillies to pick up single runs in the second,
third, fourth and fifth innings and appeared unable to stop that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Astros' bats finally came around in the sixth
inning _ a triple by Ken Caminiti, a single by Derek Bell and a
double by Matt Mieske followed by Tony Eusebio's single and a walk
to Ricky Gutierrez _ Lima was not ready to admit he could use some
help when Dierker sent Johnson to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The dugout cameras once again caught Lima in a snit. He shook
his head and stomped his feet. He complained, and he protested and
did everything except a few flamenco steps to let everyone know he
was unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Lima, the live wire, the exposed nerve ending, who
has put together this wonderful season. But there could come a time
soon in the playoffs when somebody might wonder when a little bit
too much of livin' la vida loca isn't just that. Too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to help my team win,'' Lima said. ``I go to the
mound every time thinking that I have to get into the seventh or
the eighth inning and then turn the game over to Billy (Wagner). To
just go five, that isn't me. I don't like to come out. I didn't
like it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, not until Johnson cleared the wall, finishing off his
teammates' rally from a 4-0 hole, and suddenly set him up with five
chances to win his 20th game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, Mr. Stumpy, the Ice Cube, that's what we call him in
here,'' Lima said. ``This was his night to be the hero. I will have
other nights. If I get to 20, that will be mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Dierker thinks it might not be so much a case of
Lima putting too much pressure on himself to win 20 that bogs him
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be thinking that he's on such a roll out there this
year that he gets too comfortable and doesn't concentrate enough,''
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Lima, Brian Williams and Jose Cabrera did bear
down in the sixth and seventh when the Phillies put five runners on
base with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Lima, Bell, Craig Biggio and Caminiti teamed up on a
perfect relay play after Doug Glanville opened the eighth with a
double into the right-field corner and tried to go to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a team game,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   And the merengue dancer would be wise to remember that.

   SEATTLE _ The contractor who was supposed to repair the rot in
the back of your house doesn't show up. Your babysitter cancels at
the last moment. The person driving your carpool oversleeps.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Jimy Williams and the Red Sox, you call for pitcher
Bryce Florie. His credentials as a short-notice savior were
immortalized the day he stepped in for a tardy Pedro Martinez on
national TV three weeks ago. They were embellished Monday
afternoon, when he replaced an injured Kent Mercker and earned his
first win in a Red Sox uniform, a 3-2 decision over the Seattle
Mariners that gave the Sox the last three games of this four-game
set and a roaring start to this 12-game, four-city test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this trip coming in as make or break for us,''
said Florie, the first in a quartet of Sox relievers who held off
the Mariners in a game decided by a sixth-inning sacrifice fly by
Jason Varitek, who also singled and hit his third home run in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks on the road against four of the best teams out
there, so going 3-1 was huge,'' Florie said. ``It's not going to
get any easier, but they can't take these three wins away,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker's afternoon was suddenly shortened when he collided with
rookie third baseman Wilton Veras while they were in pursuit of
Charles Gipson's fouled bunt attempt in the third inning. Veras
caught the ball. Mercker caught a big piece of the husky Veras (not
to be confused with Butch Huskey, who doubled in the go-ahead run
and scored the game-winner). The lefty wound up with a bruised
chest that forced his exit an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit in the ribs, it tightened up on me, and I was having
trouble following through,'' said Mercker, who was ahead, 1-0, but
had just given up a one-out double to Edgar Martinez and had a
2-and-1 count on Jay Buhner when Williams took him out. ``It was a
good decision. You don't want to change your mechanics there and
get hurt. It's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics didn't change, but a pitcher almost as anonymous
as a plumber was called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think of myself as that,'' said Florie of his
emergency stints. ``Unfortunately, Kent got injured. And the time
before? Well, a swingman does it all, and I guess I can do that,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. I've been here a month and a week, and I'll get
used in a situation like this, then not pitch for a week. I'm still
trying to figure out exactly what my spot is out there (in the
bullpen). But the guys are all throwing well, so I was just glad to
get into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Sox were glad to have him. Florie lost Buhner, finishing
the walk, but the sinkerballer induced pinch hitter Raul Ibanez to
roll into an inning-ending double play. The Mariners scored in the
fifth on a walk, infield out, and error by first baseman Mike
Stanley, and again in the sixth on a two-out infield hit, a wild
pitch, and Russ Davis's base hit, but Florie struck out Dan Wilson
to end the inning, his day's work done.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the day before, the bullpen had been squeezed
for 6 2/3 innings of work, Florie's effort Monday not only led to a
win but kept Williams from having to overtax his relief corps.
</P>
<P>
   Rheal Cormier, whose back spasms were so bad Sunday he was
praying that Williams wouldn't have to use him, got the first two
outs in the seventh, aided by a running catch by Troy O'Leary that
may have been as fine a catch as the left fielder has made this
season. ``Got lucky again,'' said O'Leary, whose sixth-inning
single followed Huskey's double and put him in position to score on
Varitek's fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball was headed for the gap for sure,'' said center
fielder Damon Buford. ``I knew I wasn't going to get it, and I
thought there was no way Troy was going to get there. A great
play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cormier, working carefully, walked Ken Griffey, it was time
for another pitching change. Rod Beck, who had gotten last call in
his first two Sox appearances, this time answered a much earlier
summons, as Williams figured Beck was more rested than co-closer
Derek Lowe, who already had pitched twice in this series.
</P>
<P>
   After Griffey stole second, Beck walked Alex Rodriguez on a full
count, then fell behind Edgar Martinez, 3-and-0, before coming back
to strike him out. The Mariners, who stranded 11 runners, left two
more on in the eighth when rookie Donnie Sadler managed to glove
Tom Lampkin's smash that exploded at his feet and would have ripped
his head off if Sadler's leather hadn't intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe required just nine pitches to finish off the Mariners on
three ground balls for his second save in two games and No. 12 this
season.

HE'S AT THEIR BECK AND CALL &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Closer. Set-up guy. Middle man. Maybe Rod Beck can
start a game before this wild-card ride is over.
</P>
<P>
   He is the Walrus. He is the Eggman. Coo, coo, ca-choo.
</P>
<P>
   Beck is 31 years old and doesn't look a day over 40. All hair
and mustache, he's a widebody righty who has been in just about
every relief situation you, Bill James, or Bob Costas can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   So it really wasn't any big deal Monday when seat-of-the-pants
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams summoned newcomer Beck with one on
and two outs in the bottom of the seventh. The Sox were a little
strapped in the pen and Jimy needed an out. Beck isn't going to
turn down any opportunity to help.
</P>
<P>
   The big guy ambled in from the pen for the third time since the
Sox traded for him last week. He pitched to Alex Rodriguez while
Ken Griffey stood on first base, representing the tying run in the
final game of a four-game series. Beck walked A-Rod after Griff
stole second and then went to 3-and-0 on Edgar Martinez. Jay Buhner
was on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Beck may be new to the American League, but everyone in baseball
knows that the dysfunctional Mariners have a loaded lineup. You
have to be careful to every hitter or the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Walrus got out of it. He came back to throw three
consecutive strikes to Martinez, fanning him to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen these guys in spring training over the years,'' said
Beck. ``In that situation, a one-run game, I ain't going to let
them beat me with one swing. I had the shadows in my favor. I've
never seen Edgar swinging like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Beck hit Buhner with the first pitch. Brian
Hunter ran for Buhner. Beck induced a couple of ground outs, then
walked Dan Wilson to create more trouble. Pinch hitter Tom Lampkin
was next and hit a rocket one-hopper that exploded into the chest
of second baseman Donnie Sadler. Those are the kind of relief
appearances that made Oriole manager Earl Weaver smoke a full pack
when Don Stanhouse was on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, setup guy Beck turned it over to Derek Lowe.
1-2-3. Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used five pitchers today,'' said Williams. ``I brought Beck
in before Lowe because I felt I only had one inning left in Lowe. I
thought Beck could maybe go more than an inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck was not offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't closing in Chicago,'' he said. ``They were taking it
easy on me. On a day like this, you don't get the save, but games
are won or lost in that situation. I'm here to pitch when they want
me to pitch, and maybe help Derek Lowe. Whatever they want me to
do. It doesn't make any difference at this point. As long as we
have an opportunity to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Lowe was impressed by the veteran with more than 250
saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough situation, but he stuck to his game plan,''
said the man who got the save. ``He's not going to get rattled out
there late in the game. I don't think anybody cares who wins and
who gets the save.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. Your 1999 Red Sox. You can almost hear Dan
Duquette singing, ``We Are Family.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that the Sox are tempting the fates by
bringing an ex-Cub into the mix at this juncture. In baseball lore,
it is written that the team with the most ex-Cubs on its roster
will always lose the World Series. Bill Buckner was an ex-Cub.
Remember?
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces pitched seven games for the Cubbies in 1995. Beck's
presence gives the Sox two ex-Cubs, actually closer to three
ex-Cubs if you consider aggregate body mass.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the Sox have figured out a way to counter the ex-Cub
factor. Jimy Williams had a Baby Ruth candy bar on his desk before
and after every game of the Seattle series. Jimy never unwrapped
the treat. He touched it only once, holding it in the air,
contemplating its meaning and announcing, ``This is the curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. The Curse of Baby Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy should bring the candy bar to Oakland. For more good luck.

YANKEES BRING OUT BEST IN ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The New York Yankees got on their team bus after
Monday's game and left town, and there wasn't a single Angels
player who attempted to let the air out of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have every reason to want the Yankees to stay,
considering their freakish behavior when playing the defending
World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels actually play well against the Yankees. Monday's 5-3
victory at Edison Field completed the season series between the two
teams, with the Angels winning six of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Anaheim was the only team in baseball with a winning
record against the Yankees. This year made it four seasons in the
past five the Angels have come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to have the boys visualize the
Yankees when other teams come in,'' Angels interim manager Joe
Maddon said. ``They bring out the best in us. Why? It's who they
are. But we have to maintain that attitude against other teams in
the league. The attitude was good the past four games.''
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger is the fact the Angels beat Roger Clemens,
knocking him out of the game after 42/3 innings, his shortest
outing in three months. Clemens (12-8) entered the game with a
lifetime record of 25-7 with a 2.37 ERA against the Angels but gave
up two big hits that cost him the game.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus hit his team-leading 25th homer of the year with two
on and two out in the first inning to give the Angels a 3-0 lead.
In the fifth, Jim Edmonds went the opposite way, hitting a two-run
homer _ his third of the year _ over the left-center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens also had a big hit of his own _ he nailed his friend and
former Red Sox teammate Mo Vaughn with a pitch on the right
forearm. The pitch appeared headed for Vaughn's head, but he got
his arm _ covered with protective padding _ up in time to deflect
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' said Vaughn, who has been hit a team-high
10 times this season. ``I didn't feel it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The five runs were enough for starting pitcher Jarrod Washburn
(1-3), who had his best performance of the season and maybe of his
major-league career. Washburn gave up three runs and five hits in
72/3 innings, the longest outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant turnaround _ in his first four starts this
year he was 0-3 with a 11.57 ERA. He's a candidate for next
season's starting rotation, but he wasn't helping his cause until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be afraid if I get behind in the count to throw a
breaking ball or a changeup,'' Washburn said. ``That keeps the
hitters off balance. Before, I was throwing fastballs in those
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up solo homers to Shane Spencer in the fifth and Chili
Davis in the seventh. In the eighth, Derek Jeter drove in the third
run with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up I loved the Yankees,'' Washburn said. ``But I
really wanted to beat them. Right now it doesn't matter if it was
the Yankees, Twins or Indians, I just needed a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Magnante replaced Washburn and got the final out of the
eighth, setting the stage for Troy Percival in the ninth, who
finished it off by striking out Darryl Strawberry, who represented
the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Percival had been in a horrible stretch _ in his previous 10
appearances, he was 1-2 with a 12.91 ERA and four blown saves in
five opportunities. But he corrected the mechanical flaw in his
delivery and earned his 27th save, five of which have come against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Percival slowed down his delivery and was able to regain his
ability to pinpoint his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I was definitely back to where I am when I'm on top of
my game,'' Percival said. ``I went back to working pitch by pitch
instead of trying to blow it by people. It was the first bad
stretch I've ever had in my career. I've had bad outings, but never
a bad streak.''

TOLEDO WON'T CHANGE QB PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Bruins coach Bob Toledo watched the game film
and saw second-string quarterback Cory Paus outplay starter Drew
Bennett. He saw Paus' leadership skills, saw Paus make big plays
and direct two first-half touchdown drives. . . and yet, Toledo is
sticking with his plan to rotate the quarterbacks Saturday at Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both guys are going to play in the first two games,'' Toledo
said Monday. ``After we come home (from Ohio State), we'll evaluate
everything. We may or may not decide (on a starter). We may go into
the Fresno State game (Sept. 18) and have them compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do this thing for the long haul. It'll be for
the league, and it may have a big impact on our future. . . . If I
pick one guy now, the other guy doesn't get game experience. And if
(the starter) falters or gets hurt, we have to start all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, Toledo is impressed with Paus, the redshirt
freshman who completed 12 of 18 passes against Boise State for 128
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's Paus' charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's his tight spiral and soft touch.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it's simple familiarity. Paus' leadership and
confidence _ and the mistakes that stem from his confidence _ are
reminiscent of a young Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In scrimmages, I hear (Paus) talk, and I'm really impressed
with his leadership in the huddle,'' Toledo said. ``He'll say,
`Hey, it's third-and-1, let's get the first down.' Or, `I'm
changing the snap count.' He's constantly talking and saying, `Good
job.' I'm impressed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not impressed enough to make a change _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Turner update: Senior defensive end Travor Turner will miss the
rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee in the third quarter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was the second-string weakside end (behind freshman Rusty
Williams) and UCLA's best pass rusher. To replace Turner, the
Bruins will use third-stringer Steve Sua, defensive tackle Pete
Holland and outside linebackers Santi Hall and Ali Abdul Azziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travor is a spiritual leader, that's why I made him captain
(for the opener),'' Toledo said. ``We'll miss him. Two years ago, I
wouldn't have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer update: Receiver Danny Farmer was in uniform Monday for
the first time since spraining his left ankle Aug. 21. He
participated in non-contact drills and was upgraded from doubtful
to questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: The Bruins received two oral commitments this
weekend, pushing their total to nine. The latest to commit are
Carlsbad High teammates Steve Vieira, an offensive lineman, and
linebacker Brandon Chillar.
</P>
<P>
   Who played well: Toledo cited the defensive line's
aggressiveness and pursuit as significant developments in the
opener. Sophomore tackle Ken Kocher was named defensive player of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two first-time starters in the secondary, freshman cornerback
Joe Hunter and senior safety Joey Strycula, were impressive, as was
reserve cornerback Ricky Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Chris Griffith, who made a 37-yard field goal, was named
special teams player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Randy Hakes was the standout offensive player.
</P>
<P>
   And who did not: As expected, the walk-on fullbacks and
inexperienced offensive line struggled with communication and
blocking assignments, which limited the running game.
</P>
<P>
   Two veterans, cornerback Jason Bell and safety Jason Stephens,
also performed poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jason (Stephens) wants to keep his job, he needs to play
better,'' Toledo said. ``He missed a couple tackles.''

THOUSANDS IN EAST TIMOR FLEEING AS MILITIAS ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS grafs   2 thru 6 with release of rebel leader, DELETES grafs

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In what is evidently a planned campaign of
savagery, militias backed by the Indonesian military continued
their attacks on the people of East Timor on Monday, burning homes,
killing residents and forcing many thousands to flee into the
barren hills for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, President B.J. Habi-H bie brought East Timor
under mar- tial law, a move that would potential- ly allow the
military to deploy thou- sands of soldiers across the territo- ry.
The move raised hopes abroad that Indonesia would now act to bring
order in East Timor. But it is not clear whether the soldiers will
be used to quell the violence or to battle pro-independence forces
that have remained hunkered down in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Goverment re- leased Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the
rebel leader who was arrested seven years ago and who is seen as
the potential leader of a new East Ti- morese nation.
</P>
<P>
   After signing release papers at the Ministry of Justice he was
handed over to the protection of the United Nations in Jakarta.
Because of the situation in East Timor, a spokes- man said Gusmao
would not immediately travel to the territory, where he has been
warning of what he called genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise as a free man I will do everything I can to bring
peace to East Timor,'' Gusmao said.
</P>
<P>
   One week after an overwhelming vote of independence from
Indonesia by the 800,000 people of the tiny territory, military
elements now in East Timor appear bent on leaving behind a
bloodied, ravaged, broken land, where the Indonesian military has
fought against a separatist insurgency since invading in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports reaching here, the militias burned the home
of Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, evicting 6,000 people who
were taking refuge there and forcing the bishop, who shared the
Nobel Peace Price in 1996, to flee. The militias fired at the
Australian Consulate and at the Australian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   A major operation appeared to be under way to force many
thousands of people to flee into neighboring West Timor, which is
part of Indonesia. Unlike the rest of the Indonesian archipelago,
which won independence from the Dutch in 1949, East Timor was a
Portuguese colony until 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported that large numbers of people in Dili, East
Timor's capital, were being loaded onto trucks, and authorities
said 15,000 people had already arrived in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows every sign of being planned and coordinated
beforehand,'' said Sidney Jones, the Asian director for Human
Rights Watch, who is an expert on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian army may be trying to teach a lesson not only
to the East Timorese but to the people of Aceh and Irian Jaya,''
Ms. Jones said, referring to two other provinces with strong
separatist movements. ``The lesson is: if you seek separation from
Indonesia, even if support for separation is overwhelming, we will
destroy you, and no outside power will come to your aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence in East Timor appears to reflect the reluctance of
the Indonesian military to let go of the territory after fighting a
guerrilla war against the independence movement there since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As demands from around the world for foreign military
intervention mounted, given the failure of Indonesian forces to
keep order, representatives from the U.N. Security Council were
preparing to come to Jakarta to confer with the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Australia put troops on emergency alert, reducing the time it
would take to send peacekeeping forces to East Timor from 72 hours
to 24, Defense Minister John Moore said. He said peacekeeping
forces could be deployed only with the agreement of the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia has taken an adamant position that it will not
accept foreign troops. For weeks, Indonesia has promised to take
action against the violence in East Timor, but it has done little.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's open defiance of international opinion was
particularly striking at a time when it is dependent on billions of
dollars of international aid to rescue it from a devastating
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which is heading a $43-billion
rescue program, issued a statement on Monday saying that it was
``closely watching the situation in East Timor'' and ``notes with
concern the violence that continues to mar the process.'' But much
of the aid has already been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. special envoy for East Timor, raised
the international concerns at a meeting on Monday with President
B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Marker said, ``It is very clear today that
the Indonesian government has failed in its responsibility to
maintain adequate security.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by reporters at a separate news conference, Habibie
said: ``Come on, come on. What we have achieved right now is one
thing: we have achieved the fact that we had a transparent,
peaceful ballot, and that _ don't take that for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati Sukarnoputri, the front-runner to succeed Habibie when
Indonesia selects a new president in November, blamed Habibie's
government for the situation and apologized on Indonesia's behalf
to the people of East Timor for a quarter-century of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters the situation in East
Timor ``is not as simple as you have described it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often our police have to wait for reinforcements in the
face of an overwhelming presence of armed, unruly elements,'' he
said. ``They have continued to exercise great persuasive powers,
and in many cases they were able to prevent things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the military backing, and, according to some
accounts, taking part in the militia violence, police were
sometimes placed in an impossible position. In many cases in the
last two weeks, the police were observed to be working hand in hand
with the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the Indonesian military formed the irregular
militia groups, made up of local toughs and unemployed youths, to
conduct a campaign of intimidation that appeared to be aimed at
skewing or derailing the referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
   That failed when nearly 99 percent of eligible East Timorese
turned out to vote on Aug. 30 and 78.5 percent of the voters chose
independence.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems evident that the next step in the strategy was to
remove foreign witnesses to the current wave of terror. Most
foreign reporters, election observers, aid groups and foreign
workers for the United Nations have now fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a systematic attempt not to kill journalists
but to chase them away from the story, because without the media
there nobody will know what happens,'' said Lin Neumann, the Asia
representative for the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which administered the referendum, was
evacuating nearly 200 members of its staff on Monday. A spokesman,
David Wimhurst, said shots had been fired at one of three
evacuation convoys heading for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   According to other reports from East Timor, virtually all of the
U.N. workers stationed outside the capital have fled to the town of
Baucau, in the eastern part of the territory, where the militias
seem to be less virulent.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack on his residence, Belo, who shared the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1996 with the pro-independence activist Jose Ramos
Horta, was also flown to Baucau in a police helicopter _ possibly
to remove him, as a respected figure for moderation, from the
center of action.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who had sought protection in his home were taken to
police stations at gunpoint, witnesses said, along with about 2,000
people who had sought protection at the nearby headquarters of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which was also attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports said the military was trucking many thousands of
such refugees and others across the border to neighboring West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a deliberate forced displacement of people on
a very large scale,'' said Ian Martin, the director of the U.N.
mission in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-independence leaders have spoken recently about the
possibility of creating a separate pro-Indonesian enclave adjacent
to West Timor. Although the United Nations and Indonesia have
dismissed that notion in the past, the current campaign could be
aimed at dividing the territory.
</P>
<P>
   For foreigners who remain in East Timor, the atmosphere of
threat is constant. Much of Dili is a ghost town, residents said,
apart from armed young men roaming about on motorcycles and groups
of refugees seeking safety.
</P>
<P>
   There is no certainty of protection in any quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Liam Phelan, a freelance reporter who has remained in Dili, said
that when armed men threatened the Turismo Hotel on Monday, he took
shelter with about 15 people in a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the military say: `Go in and get them. Go in and get
them,''' Phelan said. ``Those were the people who were supposed to
be guarding us.'' He said he had managed to escape and later flee
to the U.N. compound, where the only protection is provided by the
same security forces.

OSTEEN SAYS VALDES WAS UNPREPARED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Ismael Valdes was gone after three innings Monday night,
pitching his worst game in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of factors that contributed to his role in the
Dodgers' 8-6 loss to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a first-inning grand slam to Mark Kotsay and an
upper-deck homer by Preston Wilson in the third.
</P>
<P>
   And when he did not come out for the fourth, Valdes, who entered
the game with the fifth-lowest ERA in the National League, had his
quickest hook since Sept. 19, 1998 vs. San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, an 18-4 Dodgers loss, Valdes allowed seven runs
and nine hits. Monday was nearly as bad.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen said Valdes' biggest problem was
not just sitting through a two-hour, 26-minute rain delay at the
start of the game. Osteen said it was the way Valdes did not
prepare to pitch in steamy 93-degree weather after the long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to a place like this with all the humidity and the
first thing you want to do when you get to the mound is sit down
and go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out of the clubhouse when they said play ball and he
wasn't ready. In weather like that, you have keep moving, get your
circulation going. It's tough, but pitchers have to learn to go
through things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons learned: Tom Lasorda, the former Dodgers manager and now
a senior vice president, first saw right-hander Eric Gagne at
Olympic Stadium in Montreal in August 1995 after the Quebec native
was signed by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne, the Texas League Pitcher of the Year, makes his
major-league debut tonight against the Marlins. He had a good
fastball, but in that visit four years ago, Lasorda helped teach
him a breaking ball that now is his signature pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few pitchers we've brought up from Double-A
who could pitch right away,'' Lasorda said. ``(Tom) Niedenfuer,
Fernando (Valenzuela), Steve Howe. You can tell when they are
special. I think this kid will be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne got tonight's assignment after striking out 11 in his last
start for San Antonio. Mike Judd originally was scheduled to pitch
after going 3-1 in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Judd's defense: Judd is not conceding his place in the starting
rotation just because Gagne is here.
</P>
<P>
   After his stock dropped in 1998, Judd had four impressive
outings. Judd, who took over for Valdes and allowed one hit and
three walks Monday, said the difference for him is working as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I've always been and I've gotten used to the
routine. You pattern your days and your throwing knowing when you
are going to pitch. When you are used to that, it is easier to stay
that way than getting two minutes to warm up and then going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping an eye out: Today's return of Florida outfielder Cliff
Flord, who has missed 10 weeks with a torn right Achilles tendon,
is well-timed, since the Dodgers are very interested in the
left-handed hitting outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who had 22 homers and 90 RBI last year, also missed the
first three weeks this season after arthroscopic surgery on his
right knee. He is in the first season of a four-year, $19 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Gary Sheffield continues to hit the ball hard with
little to show for it. He went 0 for 5 Monday and now is 1 for 15
on the trip. But in the fifth inning, he hit a 430-foot drive to
the deepest part of Pro Player Stadium that was caught by Preston
Wilson at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who was booed soundly by his former fans in Florida,
is making $9.5 million this season, more than the entire Marlins
starting lineup Monday. . . .
</P>
<P>
   One of the more entertaining moments Monday night was a 13-pitch
at-bat by Marlins shortstop Luis Castillo against Dodgers reliever
Matt Herges. Castillo fouled off seven consecutive pitches before
Herges struck him out. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotsay, who hit a first-inning grand slam, was a late
addition to the lineup after right fielder Danny Bautista broke his
nose Sunday. Bautista will have surgery Wednesday. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth made his first appearance on the road trip
and lined to short to end the eighth.

TWO CHILDREN DIE IN PARADE, PINNED BY VAN AND TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CLARIFIES sex of children in 6th graf; ADDS 2nd fatal accident in
grafs 15-18) (th) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two 11-year-old children were killed and another
child was injured Monday afternoon when a minivan lurched out of
control at the annual Caribbean parade in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The van, which was covered with feathers and was carrying
costumes and supplies, struck the children as they danced in the
streets, pinning them against a mammoth sound truck ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The accident came at the peak of a West Indian American Carnival
parade, casting a pall over a festival that offers the city's West
Indian immigrants a joyful release from the worries of daily life.
Police did not have a crowd estimate Monday night, but in previous
years the parade has drawn 2 million people, making it the largest
parade in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities delayed, but did not stop, the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   As the sky cleared Monday afternoon, nurses and cooks,
housekeepers and lawyers donned sequined and feathered costumes for
the procession along Eastern Parkway. Vendors served jerk chicken,
curried goat and the cool juice of sorrel while flags from every
Caribbean nation doubled as head scarves and sarongs. Spectators
squeezed against each other, mostly unaware of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The two 11-year-olds, a boy named Dawn Joseph and a girl named
Zacehel David, were taken to Kings County Hospital, where they were
pronounced dead. A third child, Kara Charles, 10, suffered neck and
back injuries and was in stable condition Monday night. Four others
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the crash, which occurred shortly before 2 p.m.,
appeared to have been an accident. The driver of the van and that
of the truck, carrying a soca band called Caribbean Magic, were
both tested for alcohol and were not intoxicated, said Inspector
Michael Collins, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims appeared to be dancing between the van and the
truck,'' he said. ``It doesn't appear to be alcohol-related or
mechanical failure. It just looks like an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The van, a black Astro, was carrying costumes and supplies for
the dancers and performers ahead. Just before the accident, police
said, the driver, Ashton P. Gertton, 71, of Brooklyn, had stepped
out of the van to help some of the dancers with their costumes.
When he returned to the driver's seat, he apparently lost control.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck ahead, Winston G. Scott, also of
Brooklyn, was arrested for having a suspended driver's license, but
he was not cited in connection with the accident, police said.
</P>
<P>
   For a little more than two hours, police officers blocked the
westbound lanes of Eastern Parkway, near the corner of Nostrand
Avenue, where the accident had occurred. The parade continued on
the two other lanes, and a cadre of police officers tried to keep
an increasingly frustrated crowd within police barricades. Those
who witnessed the accident described it as a momentary flash of
horror, almost soundless in the boisterous celebration.
</P>
<P>
   James Charles, 43, of Paterson, N.J., was standing in the shade
of a tree near the intersection when, he said, he saw the minivan
inexplicably speed ahead. ``It just picked up speed all of a sudden
and rammed into the truck, said Charles, a maintenance man and a
native of Trinidad. ``The people were pinned in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of others, he jumped over the barricade, he said, in
an effort to help. A woman was pumping a little girl's chest, he
said. Another was trying to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Paramedics arrived within minutes, he said, and police blocked off
the area.
</P>
<P>
   A jumble of white and pink feathers along with crushed plastic
bottles lay on the street Monday afternoon, marking the spot of the
accident. After police cleared the area and reopened the eastbound
lanes of the Parkway, a sound truck bearing the Trinidadian band,
Krosfyah, sang their version of Bob Marley's ``Redemption Song.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, as revelers were dispersing after the parade, an
18-year-old man was struck and killed by a sound truck along the
parade route, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The second fatal accident yesterday occurred about 8 p.m., after
the parade had ended but before all the sound trucks had been
cleared off the parkway, the police said. Kevon Donovan, 18,
apparently got his clothing caught in the wheel of a
tractor-trailer truck near the corner of Brooklyn Avenue and was
dragged under it, said Officer Valerie St. Rose, a police
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Donovan, of Clarkson Avenue in East
Flatbush, had backed into the street along with several other
people when someone in the crowd brought out a large yellow snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy came through with a snake and that's what I guess got
him shook,'' said Ryan Girard, a friend of Donovan's who was
mourning him outside Kings County Hospital, where he died at 9:25
p.m. ``Everybody started pushing. I tried to pull him out from
under the truck, but I couldn't do nothing. He looked at me and
called out my name.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time the Caribbean parade has been marred
by fatal accidents. A parade spectator was struck by a vehicle and
killed in 1997, police said, and another man was crushed by the
wheels of a float in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, the parade has become the major
event for Labor Day in the city, eclipsing the procession organized
by union leaders, who this year held their Labor Day parade on the
Wednesday before Labor Day.

   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-NUKE (Undated) _ American bomb makers visiting China in
1979 were startled by a series of questions that suggested the
Chinese were hot on the trail of the secret to building a modern
nuclear arsenal, miniaturization. China succeeded in September
1992. Was China's advance the result of espionage, hard work or
some mix of the two? Experts agree that spying occurred, but clash
on what impact it had on Beijing's advance, if any. A review of the
dispute, based on interviews and disclosures of weapon and
intelligence secrets, suggests that the congressional report went
beyond the evidence in asserting that stolen secrets were the main
reason for China's breakthrough. The review also bolsters a point
of agreement among feuding experts: that the federal investigation
focused too soon on the Los Alamos Laboratory and one worker there,
Wen Ho Lee. A Special Report by William J. Broad.

   SCI-DIABETES (Undated) _ With rates of diabetes soaring, experts

predisposed to the disease and looking at ways to control
cardiovascular problems in people who already have diabetes. By

   GUNS-POLICE-CHIEFS (Boston) _ Chiefs of police across the nation
are turning to gun control as a key factor in crime control
programs and are now pushing for tougher gun laws. A group of
chiefs will meet in Washington this week to lobby for gun laws. By
Fox Butterfield. 1,100 words.

<P>
   NY-ANCIENT-SKULL (New York) _ An intriguing fossil skull,
presumably from a Homo erectus and possibly a revealing piece of
evidence for understanding human evolution, has been found, not on
a parched hill in Africa or along a river in Java, but at a little
shop in Manhattan. Paleoanthropologists have concluded that it is a
genuine specimen from Indonesia and could be critical in
determining the place of the Homo erectus species in East Asia on
the human family tree. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-TSIEN-MOUSE (Undated) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: The
world has been frenetically beating on the door of Joe Z. Tsien,
the biologist who announced last week he had created a smarter
strain of mouse. Within this enveloping chaos, Tsien has spun
around himself a small bubble of protective serenity. He calmly
describes the remarkable journey that led him from Wu Shi, a small
town near Shanghai, to the position of having made a significant,
maybe decisive, contribution to understanding the nature of memory.

<P>
   SCI-ELECTRON-BONDS (Undated) _ Of the roughly 20 million
chemical substances scientists have catalogued, nearly all are
assemblages of atoms linked together by electronic bonds. The quest
to understand these tiny bonds _ the very glue of material
existence _ is the heart of chemical science. A step in this quest
was reported last week with the publication of the sharpest direct
images ever made of electronic bonds, known as orbitals. The shapes
revealed by these images _ doughnut-like rings, dumbbell-shaped
lobes and arrays suggestive of butterfly wings _ confirmed
theoretical predictions of what these bonds should look like in the
particular molecule under study. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEANDERTHALS (Undated) _ Based on detailed examination of
bone fragments from remains of Neanderthals found in Croatia,
scientists have determined that overall they were a healthy lot. By

</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.)

<P>
   SCI-CREATIVITY (Undated) _ Scientists trying to program
creativity discovered that when they fed a formula into a computer,
it generated advertising concepts judged more original and
appealing than equivalent advertisements spawned by a group of
humans. The program demonstrates what many creative people know
intuitively: that the land of the imagination is a country like any
other, with laws, rituals and a tireless police corps that must be
obeyed if one hopes to retain citizenship there. By Natalie Angier.

<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items of the
way bees spread the word about food sources, how traffic moves, a
test of Cassini camers and the potency of catnip. By Henry
Fountain. (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column. Coffee
lovers take heed: For the sake of your health, you might consider
switching at least some of those daily cups of java for tea. Not
herbal tea but ``real'' tea _ green tea, black tea, Chinese tea,
fruit-flavored tea, with or without caffeine, lemon, milk or sugar.
As long as the leaves come from the plant Camellia sinensis, tea
will contain potent antioxidant chemicals that have been linked to
protection against major diseases like cancer and heart disease.
Even the caffeine in tea may be somewhat beneficial, emerging
evidence suggests. By Jane E. Brody. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DNA-VACCINE (Undated) _ Scientists at Stanford University
have found that a simple solution of DNA and water applied to the
skin of mice can induce an immune response comparable to one from
traditional intramuscular injection. The DNA vaccine was apparently
taken up through the hair follicles of the mice; nude mice (mice
without hair) did not show the same reaction. By Anne Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-INDIANS (Undated) _ Some health experts say they fear
that AIDS is about to explode among the 500 Indian tribes in the
United States. Last year on the Navajo reservation, AIDS cases grew
by 25 percent, health officials there said. By David France. (1000
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-WAKEBOARDING (Undated) _ Wakeboarding is the fastest
growing water sport, requiring skills similar to surfing,
skateboarding or snowboarding, combined with elements of water
skiing while being pulled behind a boat with a rope tow. By Julie
Walsh. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-LOSS Ads for two new diet supplements promise quick
and efficient weight loss without exercise. Experts say there may
be some small amount of fat absorption, but very small. By Liz
Neporent. (625 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Night eating syndrome afflicts an estimated 3.8 million
Americans and now is being linked to a vicious cycle of seratonin.
(350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ No one is talking about a cure, or even any improvement in the
very near future, but researchers are reporting some promising
progress in the field of lupus, a serious autoimmune disease
affecting about 1.5 million people in the United States. (280
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study from the American Psychological Association last
month indicates that under some circumstances otherwise reasonable
adults may adopt the karmic explanation of illness that what goes
around comes around and the an illness might be a punishment for
misdeeds. (255 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PAIN (Undated) _ Researchers at the University of
California/San Francisco think that in the case of an inflamed
joint, that ache may be the body's way of telling its most
aggressive defenders, ``Enough already, you're hurting me!'' By
John O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Since I seldom
see mosquitoes in daylight, can I avoid bites by going out only in
the sunshine? Unfortunately, no. (290 words)

<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>

   KIDS-FASHIONS (Undated) _ While very young children have always
used fashion to fit in with their peers, their desire to match the
clothing popular among older siblings and even adults is on the
rise. Their tastes are no longer for cute and innocent _ like
T-shirts with hearts and teddy bears. Instead, the desire is for
the culturally clued in _ like the henna-style tattoo necklaces
that ape the stencils worn by Madonna. By Leslie Kaufman.

   IRIDIUM-OUTLOOK (Phoenix) _ Iridium LLC, the global satellite
telephone venture that was supposed to offer communications ``with
anyone, anytime, virtually anywhere in the world,'' is in trouble,
but don't tell that to Raymond Leopold. He and two colleagues at
Motorola Inc. dreamed up the global telephone service here in the
Arizona desert more than a dozen years ago. And now, even as the
venture hobbles through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, he remains
optimistic. By David Barboza.

their vast operations last month was far easier than the monumental
task they now face in consolidating three of the country's biggest
banks under one roof. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;B-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Since its founding in the 1840s, Dun
&AMP; Bradstreet Corp. has employed four men who became president and
built two of the more envied franchises in finance: Its
credit-information operation and Moody's Investors Service. Such
strong businesses have always attracted long-term shareholders. But
for the biggest of them, patience with D&AMP;B has run out. By Richard
A. Oppel Jr.

   ART-MARKET (New York) _ Like Broadway, baseball and big-game
hunting, the art trade has always had a season. It began in
mid-September, rose to heights each fall and again each spring,
then tailed off at the end of June, when rich collectors headed for
a summer of leisure at their country homes. But not last year, and
especially not this year. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

   CHINA-THEATER (Beijing) _ Chinese officials have settled on a
stark modern French design for China's new national theater complex
here. The design is a titanium and glass bubble-shaped structure
that sits in the middle of a vast lake and is entered via an
underwater tunnel. It will quickly redefine the landscape in the
sedate, conservative political heart of Beijing, adding the first
touch of modern Western architecture. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

GOV. BUSH AND CANDIDATE BUSH HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Someone
needs to teach GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush what the
First Amendment means. As governor of Texas, he hasn't paid much
attention to free speech rights of Texas demonstrators, the right
to petition, or the religious liberty of those who live in his
state. Now that he seeks the highest elected office in the land, he
should be required to sign up for a course on the U.S. Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gov. Bush told the peaceful environmental
protesters demonstrating outside the governor's mansion, that ``the
rules have changed'' and ordered the protesters arrested. The
governor seems to think he can, by fiat, simply hack away ``the
right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the
government for a redress of grievances,'' to quote a portion of the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The public sidewalk outside the grounds of the Texas governor's
mansion has a long tradition of being a place for rallies, protests
and even press conferences. But in March, Gov. Bush ordered law
enforcement officials to warn protesters that they were subject to
arrest. In April, the police began arresting demonstrators. On at
least four occasions, citizen groups were arrested when they did
not disperse quickly enough to suit state police officers,
according to the American Civil Liberties lawsuit filed on behalf
of the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   These groups were protesting state policies that they think
encourage industrial pollution. They urged the passage of clean air
laws. Their lobbying efforts _ their right to petition the
government to correct the situation _ were abruptly ended by police
action. During this same period, clean air legislation lost by a
slim margin in the Texas Legislature. It is quite possible that the
governor's action stymied protesters' goal to educate Texas
legislators on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the demonstrators were arrested and held overnight and
then released without being charged _ as there was no violation of
any existing Texas law. They weren't blocking access to the
governor's mansion or causing a traffic safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, these demonstrators were warned they would be
arrested and jailed again if they continued in their protest.
Apparently, peaceful expression of opinion and criticism of the
governor's policies is not allowed in Texas _ under the
administration of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called rule changes that Gov. Bush announced in April
have never been published or made public. They remain secret rules.
Anti-democratic rules. The ACLU complaint states: ``These hidden
rules that essentially give unlimited police discretion to exclude
and arrest critics, when they make criticism public, violate Texas
Constitutional rights to free speech, petition, equal protection,
due process, and freedom from unreasonable seizures.'' Not to
mention a violation of the U.S. Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bush, author of ``compassionate conservatism,'' isn't
so compassionate to critics of his state's policies. His secret
rules are obviously designed to intimidate Texas citizens who
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this man as president of the United States. Criticism of
the federal government is endemic to the American people. It's our
great strength as a nation. We all feel we have a right and even a
duty to debate public policy, proposed legislation and the path our
leaders take. We believe in the right to protest, criticize and
encourage change in polices we think are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The American people can even protest U.S. Supreme Court
decisions on the sidewalk in front of the court building. The same
is true of demonstrators in front of the White House, as long as
they are behind the concrete barricades. Would Bush seek to
``change the rules'' if he were president?
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush pushed for a school voucher law in Texas in his state
address in January. His voucher law would have used taxpayer money
to support religious private schools. Again, a violation of the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court
has already held that taxpayers cannot be forced to support
religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the state Legislature is wiser than Bush and failed
to pass a voucher bill.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2 in Los Angeles, candidate Bush said that schools
receiving Title I money _ those schools in the poorest
neighborhoods _ should no longer be federally funded if they can't
meet certain standards. The money instead would be given to the
parents to use to send their children to private schools. Private
schools include religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature was wise enough not to buy Gov. Bush's
school voucher plan. And the American people are certainly savvy
enough not to buy candidate Bush's plan, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan, instead of trying to improve public schools in
poorer districts, strips Title I federal money from them and from
our children of poverty. It's an illusion foisted on the poor that
the tax dollars they would receive would be sufficient to send
their children to good private schools. In reality, the money they
would receive would be thousands of dollars too little each year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few decades, California has drained money and
resources from its public schools. The result has been to transform
one of the best public school systems in the nation into one of the
worst. Bush's remedy would only repeat California's tragic error
and spread it nationwide. And, let us not forget, it violates the
First Amendment, too.
</P>
<P>
   We should remember, this is the same presidential candidate who
has tried to stop all parodies of him, his candidacy and his
political stances on the World Wide Web. This is the same candidate
who said in a televised news conference, ``There ought to be limits
to freedom.'' His political track record in Texas, though short,
shows that his statement wasn't a gaffe, but truly reveals his
motivations and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the man who wants to be the leader of the nation
which represents the world's great hope for liberty?

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE EVOLUTION OF JANE &LR;  By Cathleen Schine. Plume, $12.95. This
clever novel uses the principles of natural selection to illuminate
the life of its heroine, a young American woman visiting the
Galapagos Islands. ``The book is a beautifully descriptive
travelogue ... loaded with mini-lectures on natural history,
evolutionary theory and Darwiniana, wrapped around a rollicking
family saga,'' Barbara Kingsolver wrote last year in The New York
Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT TOMORROW WE WILL BE KILLED WITH OUR
FAMILIES: Stories From Rwanda &LR;  By Philip Gourevitch. Picador USA,
$15. A New Yorker writer chronicles the massacre of as many as
800,000 Tutsis by the Hutu majority in Rwanda in 1994, examining
both the roots and the consequences of a genocidal crime carried
out not by soldiers but by neighbors, co-workers and relatives. His
ghastly account, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review, is filled with the
testimony of survivors, participants and witnesses. ``A grim book
this, and a burden on world conscience,'' Wole Soyinka wrote. ``It
closes the habitual avenue of escape _ anonymity _ for collective
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA: A BIOGRAPHY OF THE CONTINENT &LR; , by John Reader (Vintage,
$17), digs deep into prehistory to track the emergence of Homo
sapiens and Africa's extraordinary diversity of life and terrain,
as well as the modern woes of the sub-Saharan region. Last year the
reviewer Thomas Pakenham called this ``a masterly synthesis of the
geological, climatological and paleontological discoveries of the
last decades.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOLDEN CHILD &LR;  By Penelope Fitzgerald. Mariner/Houghton
Mifflin, $12. In the author's first novel, a stodgy London museum
is thrown into disarray when a wildly popular exhibit of an ancient
African king is found to be possibly fraudulent. The result is ``a
classically plotted British mystery ... leavened with a wicked
sense of rapierlike humor,'' Newgate Callendar wrote in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Fitzgerald's novels,
 &UR; AT FREDDIE'S &LR;  ($12), which takes place at a famous school for
child actors run by a formidable old woman renowned in the London
theatrical world. In 1985 the reviewer Roxana Robinson was
generally unimpressed but called this a ``well-mannered,
well-written'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art &LR;  By Phoebe Hoban. Penguin,
$15.95. A magazine journalist traces the hype-saturated rise and
fall of the charismatic painter who went from graffiti artist to
Warhol collaborator and art-world phenom before burning out on
drugs at the age of 27. Last year Patricia Bosworth called this a
``compulsively readable'' biography.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT THE OWL WOMAN SALOON: Stories &LR;  By Tess Gallagher. Scribner,
$12. The poet's second prose collection is grounded in blue-collar
realism, often involving characters struggling to make do in the
logging camps and faded beauty parlors of the Pacific Northwest. In
1997 the reviewer Sarah Ferguson called these tales ``a bittersweet
mixture of deflated New Age wisdom and tired wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HONOR'S VOICE: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln &LR;  By
Douglas L. Wilson. Vintage, $15. This understated portrait starts
not with Lincoln's greatness as president but with the sources of
that greatness when he was between the ages of 22 and 33, searching
for identity and finding his way into law and politics. The book
``establishes Wilson as the leading historian of the young and
private Lincoln,'' Gabor Boritt wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE HAND CLAPPING &LR;  By Anthony Burgess. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $11.95.
Janet Shirley is a mild-mannered British housewife who is vaulted
into a world of luxury, courtesy of a loving husband with a
photographic memory who parlays his winnings on a television quiz
show into a fortune. Needless to say, it's a mixed blessing. ``Read
this witty and shrewdly joyful novel,'' Richard P. Brickner wrote
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WORLD TRANSFORMED &LR;  By George Bush and Brent Scowcroft.
Vintage, $16. The former president and his national security
adviser recount the Bush administration's major foreign-policy
challenges, including the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
Persian Gulf war. Their ``remarkably frank, intelligent'' account
is ``the most important book yet written about the end of the Cold
War,'' Fareed Zakaria wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIVER WARREN &LR;  By Kent Meyers. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
This first novel borrows from ``Our Town'' and ``Rashomon'' in
exploring how the fatal crash of a trucker and his wife shatters
the tranquillity of a Midwestern farming town. The author ``moves
cleanly from the event itself to an insightful inspection of local
life and its discontents,'' James Polk wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST OF MYLES &LR;  By Flann O'Brien (Myles na Gopaleen). Dalkey
Archive, $13.95. This selection of newspaper columns published in
The Irish Times from 1939 until the author's death in 1966 pokes
fun at everything from Gaelic revivalists to plumbers, and displays
a finely tuned ear for common Dublin speech. In 1968 the reviewer
Benedict Kiely praised the ``humorous, satirical, learned,
grave-faced, crazy writing.''

ARMS CONTROL IS DYING. UNLESS IT'S REVIVING.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By many measures, international arms control seems
to be on the verge of unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   A global treaty banning all nuclear testing is bottled up in the
U.S. Senate. Another pact to reduce the atomic arsenals of Russia
and the United States is stalled in the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, Iran and North Korea are racing to build new biological,
chemical, nuclear weapons or long-range missiles, U.S. intelligence
analysts say. Finally worn down by Iraqi noncooperation, the United
Nations has dismantled its efforts even to monitor Iraq's
terror-weapons programs. And India and Pakistan are menacing each
other with nuclear-tipped missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heading downhill,'' said Michael Krepon, president of
the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, a group that researches
arms control and international security. ``All of the major fault
lines of nuclear danger are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then are many arms control advocates echoing the bullish
declaration of Adm. Stansfield Turner, a past director of Central
Intelligence: ``This is the most opportune moment in the past 40
years for nuclear arms control''?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple: Russia, which is still the only country
that can claim parity with America's own nuclear arsenal, has
serious reasons for wanting to cut back its stock of warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's strategic forces are declining fast and Moscow lacks
the money to pay for new systems. It badly wants a new strategic
arms reduction agreement, Start 3, that could take both countries
down to 1,500 long-range nuclear warheads from more than 6,000
currently; from the Russian point of view, that would at least
allow Russia to keep even with the United States despite all its
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such a deal argue that it would have advantages
for the United States as well: It would shrink the nuclear
stockpile of the country that still harbors the single biggest
threat to U.S. security, and from which U.S. security officials
fear that terrorists may even now be shopping for nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   And with instability engulfing Russia, including growing public
cynicism toward the government, rising corruption with allegations
of Russian laundering of billions of dollars through the Bank of
New York and the economy shakier than ever, time may be running
short to strike a bold new arms deal before both countries hold
presidential elections next year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a way to secure extremely deep cuts, and make them
verifiable and irreversible,'' said Krepon. ``In return for doing
Russia that favor, which is a favor to ourselves, we can get a
number of things we want.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is proceeding gingerly, still insisting
that Russia's communist-dominated parliament first ratify the Start
2 treaty, which brings both nations' strategic forces to 3,000 to
3,500 warheads, before seriously negotiating any follow-up pact to
further reduce the weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Cold War is over, the logic of nuclear arms
control has detractors. The Pentagon and many conservatives fear
that dipping much lower than 3,000 warheads would jeopardize the
U.S. nuclear advantage over the rest of the world, and encourage
other countries to seek the status of first-tier atomic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Washington's insistence that the Russian parliament
act on Start 2 may have backfired, angering many Russian lawmakers
who complain of U.S. coercion. ``They are trying to portray us as a
country unwilling to divest itself of nuclear arms, a kind of
nuclear monster that does not want to disarm,'' Roman Popkovich,
chairman of the defense committee of Russia's lower house of
parliament, said in August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hurdle is the strained relationship between Moscow
and Washington, frayed most recently by the air war in Kosovo.
``Things are at such a low level of credibility with Russia right
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``A lot of work has to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the
administration's top Russia expert, plans to fly to Moscow this
week to try to smooth out differences in advance of a more
important meeting in Washington on Sept. 17 with Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedev.
</P>
<P>
   Against long odds, Talbott is trying to broker a deal to modify
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States
to build a limited national defense against long-range missile
attacks _ in exchange, perhaps, for a Start 3 agreement. Russia has
long opposed such a shield, fearing it could lead to a broader
``Star Wars'' space-based defensive system.
</P>
<P>
   But missile defenses are a top foreign-policy priority of Senate
Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whose Foreign
Relations Committee is likely to hold the nuclear-test ban treaty
hostage until President Clinton submits two other treaties that
Helms wants to kill, including amendments to the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's deliberate approach illustrates a shift in
the politics of arms control, which became the lifeblood of U.S.
foreign policy during the last half of the Cold War, arms control
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a few years ago that Clinton presided over the
extension of a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and
signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Those accomplishments
capped an astonishing 10-year period for U.S. arms control policy
that included landmark strategic arms reductions treaties
negotiated by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, arms control advocates say, has lost the momentum
created in during his first term. Gone is the initiative of
president's first four years, they say, replaced by drift and a
reluctance to challenge Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very timid approach and time is running out,'' said
Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, a
research and advocacy group. ``They've had a failed policy in
dealing effectively with the Senate, because of a feeling that a
confrontation on this would hurt the rest of their domestic
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   If the administration is to pull off one more arms control
victory in its waning months, it can expect little or no help from
Senate Republicans, who are moving away from the arms control
legacy of the Bush and Reagan administrations, to push for national
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to unnecessarily antagonize the Russians, but
they are not the Soviet Union,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a
member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ``They're not the threat
they once were. The threat is more dispersed now.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ ``One country. One people. One language.''
</P>
<P>
   As a national credo, displayed on banners and placards, it
sounds simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   But in this scattered archipelago of 13,000 islands, roiling
with an untamed mix of cultures, ethnic groups, histories,
rivalries, gods and spoken tongues, it begins to seem almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some people say it is.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with well
over 200 million people, is deep in a crisis of economics, politics
and national identity. Its leaders and institutions have lost much
of their popular standing and legitimacy. The forces that most
overtly held Indonesia together _ the grip of a dictator and the
harshness of his military _ have retreated since the forced
resignation 15 months ago of Suharto as president.
</P>
<P>
   A country so unsure of its unity that it has made oneness an
obsession is being forced to rediscover the logic of its
nationhood. The challenge as it steps gingerly into an era of
democracy is to want to be a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence that ravaged the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor last week as it was voting for independence from Indonesia
came as a reminder to the outside world of the diversity and
tenuousness of this scattered nation. Perhaps the fears it has
aroused _ of centrifugal forces that could pull Indonesia apart _
are exaggerated. Still, it points up the counterproductiveness of
enforced union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to have an Indonesia in which the constituent
parts sit happily together as a republic and not because they are
held together by bayonets, you are going to have to have a system
where the constituent parts come together because they want to be
together,'' said James Dunn, a former Australian diplomat who is an
expert on Indonesia. ``Since the founding of Indonesia, the
military has seen itself as the guardian of national integrity. In
a democracy national integrity has to be held together by the
national will.''
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, the post-Suharto government _ which is
still taking shape _ is exploring ways to devolve some economic and
political control to the provinces. An extreme possibility, one
that would demand a constitutional amendment, would be to shift
power into a federal structure.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian rule has sometimes been likened to a colonial
structure, with the dominant Javanese on their relatively small
island asserting their rule over the larger and more resource-rich
outer islands. A fairer distribution of the national wealth along
with greater political empowerment could go a long way toward
mollifying Indonesia's restive provinces.
</P>
<P>
   But the loosening of a grip always carries the risk of loss of
control. After 32 years of Suharto's policy of enforced national
harmony, the vacuum created by his departure and the humbling of
the military has been quickly filled by all the repressed passions
of political, religious and ethnic differences that strain
Indonesia's fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, separatist movements have been energized in
several areas, highlighted by East Timor, which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 but which never accepted integration as the country's 27th
province.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta _ and particularly in
the military _ fear that freedom for East Timor could be the start
of a process of national disintegration. Other analysts point to
that territory's unique place as a national afterthought and argue
that a line can be drawn between East Timor and the rest of
Indonesia. It is the only part of the country to have been
colonized by the Portuguese rather than by the Dutch and it is the
only part to have been been dragged into union by invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially destabilizing separatist movement is in the
strongly Islamic, natural gas-rich province of Aceh, where the loss
of life this year has been far greater than in East Timor. A former
Islamic kingdom with its own proud past, Aceh is an integral part
of Indonesia's history and self-definition and its loss could deal
a severe blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very worried,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``If
Aceh begins to take off, they will really have problems with the
integrity of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   A smaller, less unified separatist movement has flared in the
remote mountains of Irian Jaya, whose primitive people are as
strange and exotic to residents of modern Jakarta as they are to
New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Vicious bloodletting has also continued in the Moluccas (the
former Spice Islands that first attracted traders to the
archipelago) and in West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. But
these eruptions, for the moment at least, have more to do with
local feuds, and with Jakarta's inability to impose order, than
with serious separatist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may not pull the nation apart, the declarations of
individuality by the separatists offer a reminder that Indonesia is
an artificial geographical conglomeration inherited from its Dutch
colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant, taciturn princes of Java seem to have little in
common with the otherworldly dancers of Hindu Bali, the long-eared
Dayak tribesmen of Borneo, the seagoing pirates of the Spice
Islands or the Chinese traders who control the country's ports and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   What brings them all together as Indonesians?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an idea, as in other big, diverse countries like
India and the United States,'' said James Clad, a professor of
Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown University. ``It is an idea
of an archipelagic country, a concept that goes back to pre-Islamic
times.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ ``One country. One people. One language.''
</P>
<P>
   As a national credo, displayed on banners and placards, it
sounds simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   But in this scattered archipelago of 13,000 islands, roiling
with an untamed mix of cultures, ethnic groups, histories,
rivalries, gods and spoken tongues, it begins to seem almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some people say it is.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with well
over 200 million people, is deep in a crisis of economics, politics
and national identity. Its leaders and institutions have lost much
of their popular standing and legitimacy. The forces that most
overtly held Indonesia together _ the grip of a dictator and the
harshness of his military _ have retreated since the forced
resignation 15 months ago of Suharto as president.
</P>
<P>
   A country so unsure of its unity that it has made oneness an
obsession is being forced to rediscover the logic of its
nationhood. The challenge as it steps gingerly into an era of
democracy is to want to be a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence that ravaged the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor last week as it was voting for independence from Indonesia
came as a reminder to the outside world of the diversity and
tenuousness of this scattered nation. Perhaps the fears it has
aroused _ of centrifugal forces that could pull Indonesia apart _
are exaggerated. Still, it points up the counterproductiveness of
enforced union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to have an Indonesia in which the constituent
parts sit happily together as a republic and not because they are
held together by bayonets, you are going to have to have a system
where the constituent parts come together because they want to be
together,'' said James Dunn, a former Australian diplomat who is an
expert on Indonesia. ``Since the founding of Indonesia, the
military has seen itself as the guardian of national integrity. In
a democracy national integrity has to be held together by the
national will.''
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, the post-Suharto government _ which is
still taking shape _ is exploring ways to devolve some economic and
political control to the provinces. An extreme possibility, one
that would demand a constitutional amendment, would be to shift
power into a federal structure.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian rule has sometimes been likened to a colonial
structure, with the dominant Javanese on their relatively small
island asserting their rule over the larger and more resource-rich
outer islands. A fairer distribution of the national wealth along
with greater political empowerment could go a long way toward
mollifying Indonesia's restive provinces.
</P>
<P>
   But the loosening of a grip always carries the risk of loss of
control. After 32 years of Suharto's policy of enforced national
harmony, the vacuum created by his departure and the humbling of
the military has been quickly filled by all the repressed passions
of political, religious and ethnic differences that strain
Indonesia's fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, separatist movements have been energized in
several areas, highlighted by East Timor, which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 but which never accepted integration as the country's 27th
province.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta _ and particularly in
the military _ fear that freedom for East Timor could be the start
of a process of national disintegration. Other analysts point to
that territory's unique place as a national afterthought and argue
that a line can be drawn between East Timor and the rest of
Indonesia. It is the only part of the country to have been
colonized by the Portuguese rather than by the Dutch and it is the
only part to have been been dragged into union by invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially destabilizing separatist movement is in the
strongly Islamic, natural gas-rich province of Aceh, where the loss
of life this year has been far greater than in East Timor. A former
Islamic kingdom with its own proud past, Aceh is an integral part
of Indonesia's history and self-definition and its loss could deal
a severe blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very worried,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``If
Aceh begins to take off, they will really have problems with the
integrity of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   A smaller, less unified separatist movement has flared in the
remote mountains of Irian Jaya, whose primitive people are as
strange and exotic to residents of modern Jakarta as they are to
New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Vicious bloodletting has also continued in the Moluccas (the
former Spice Islands that first attracted traders to the
archipelago) and in West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. But
these eruptions, for the moment at least, have more to do with
local feuds, and with Jakarta's inability to impose order, than
with serious separatist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may not pull the nation apart, the declarations of
individuality by the separatists offer a reminder that Indonesia is
an artificial geographical conglomeration inherited from its Dutch
colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant, taciturn princes of Java seem to have little in
common with the otherworldly dancers of Hindu Bali, the long-eared
Dayak tribesmen of Borneo, the seagoing pirates of the Spice
Islands or the Chinese traders who control the country's ports and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   What brings them all together as Indonesians?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an idea, as in other big, diverse countries like
India and the United States,'' said James Clad, a professor of
Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown University. ``It is an idea
of an archipelagic country, a concept that goes back to pre-Islamic
times.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Indonesia as a union of islands took firm root
during the struggle for independence _ which was proclaimed in 1945
_ and flourished under the founding president, Sukarno. His
successor, Suharto, also made national unity the core of his tenure
with a philosophy called Pancasila, in which Indonesia's Babel of
differences were crushed whenever they asserted themselves too
strongly.
</P>
<P>
   This fear of the power of diversity may have been one of
Suharto's most destructive legacies. Its melange of identities
denied, its passions forcefully repressed, Indonesia seethed. The
hard work of celebrating the country's differences while finding a
common ground in which all could thrive together was made all the
more difficult for Suharto's successors.
</P>
<P>
   The last and most unwilling participant in this nationwide
humiliation was East Timor, where Javanese teachers were imported
to teach Indonesian history to schoolchildren in the Indonesian
language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Indonesian unity is so elemental that it is defined
as much as anything simply by the superimposition of a common
tongue, the Malay language of the ancient seagoing traders who
first brought Indonesia's islands together.
</P>
<P>
   But among older or more assertively separatist East Timorese,
the Portuguese language has persisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the small East Timorese town of Baucau, Indonesia's
government has built a monument, literally, on the three pillars of
the revolutionary 1928 student oath, a sort of Pledge of Allegiance
for Indonesians: ``One country. One people. One language.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it a misguided supporter of unity with Indonesia or a sly
opponent who painted on its base the graffito ``Unidades''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity,'' indeed _ but in Portuguese, the language of East
Timorese separatism.

<P>
   Now that researchers have shown that mice can be made smarter, a
whole world of opportunities opens up. Those long-neglected
inventors of smarter mousetraps will at last get their calls
returned. Smarter cats will be needed. And everyone will have a
list of humans who might benefit, starting perhaps with the
baseball umpires or, in the case of most evolutionists, with the
Kansas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant as it may be to contemplate a smarter world, there are
serious quandaries in enhancing human abilities, as well as in
trying to raise the intelligence of animals, possibilities raised
last week by Princeton biologist Joe Tsien and his colleagues when
they announced they had developed a genetically smarter strain of
mice.
</P>
<P>
   In mice, monkeys and probably humans, nature has engineered a
deliberate fading of memory with age. The brain cell receptor that
helps associate two events _ the basic mechanism of memory _ is
made of components that change over a life span, making the
receptor less efficient in older animals. It is this process that
was counteracted in Tsien's mice. He genetically engineered the
mice so that their brain cells produced more copies of the youthful
component of the memory receptor, thus enhancing its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The receptor was souped up in brain cells throughout the mice's
forebrain and hippocampus, a brain module that helps mice remember
places (and humans to recall places and faces). The altered mice
did better than normal mice on six standard tests of rodent
intellectual performance, like remembering where to find a hidden
platform when dropped into a bucket of murky water, or recognizing
new objects. Because the improvement was consistent in all the
tests, for which the mice had to use many different areas of the
brain, Tsien concluded that in improving the basic mechanism of
memory he had also enhanced the mice's learning ability and general
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien and other scientists are far from sure that tweaking the
memory receptor would be similarly helpful in the more complicated
human brain. After all, with too retentive a memory you might
clutter up your mind with all kinds of things you'd be better off
forgetting. Still, scientists agree that the receptor is a
promising place for intelligence enhancement to start.
</P>
<P>
   But would the improvement of human acumen dangerously flout
nature's wisdom? After all, intelligence is so precious for
survival that surely nature makes every animal as smart as possible
without transgressing some pivotal balance.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't seem to be the case, however, at least with
laboratory mice. Tsien's strains are smarter than their normal
cousins, without any visible drawback. And behaviorally, modern man
is so new a species _ 50,000 years is the blink of an eye in
evolutionary time _ that perhaps the forces of natural selection
have scarcely had the chance to make the most of the human brain's
capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, genetic engineers must surely pause at the fact that
nature has designed memory to become less retentive with age. The
danger of tampering with this system is that the brain's memory
storage room could quickly be overwhelmed if learning were to
continue at the same rate in adult life as in youth, suggests Dr.
Charles Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in La
Jolla, Calif. He believes the brain's capacity, vast as it is, must
have limits. The human brain has 100 billion neurons, and each
neuron makes about 1,000 connections with other neurons, giving a
potential 100 trillion units of memory. ``So there is enormous
storage capacity, but we don't know how much we need,'' Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the limit of that storage capacity is never reached in a
human lifetime, the increasing access time needed to scan a growing
store of knowledge may be one reason why nature arranges for
information to be acquired more slowly once the youthful thirst for
knowledge has passed. What a powerful threat to deploy against
one's children _ learn it or lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risk of running out of space on one's mental hard
drive, the temptation to try to enhance intelligence by promoting
the youthful form of the memory receptor will doubtless prove
irresistible. Drugs might be developed to target the nerve cell
system that Tsien altered by genetic means. Gene therapy could one
day supply smart genes to an embryo _ or even to adults, since the
hippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain that generates new
cells throughout adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Three categories of people might benefit: the medically ill, the
elderly and everybody else. Ethicists see no problem in trying to
treat memory deficits in patients with brain diseases, which would
be no different from any other medical intervention. Helping older
people remember better is also likely to be uncontroversial,
``because in our culture we see old age as something like a disease
rather than as natural life process,'' said Dr. Victoria Sharpe, a
bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A drug to enhance the intelligence of healthy individuals sounds
great for job interviews or quiz programs. But if the smart pill
were costly, it could worsen social inequities. And such a drug
could easily be abused by parents. ``I think we will have to think
through our social policies very carefully so we don't get into an
enhancement race among parents and don't in effect develop a new
kind of child abuse,'' said Dr. Leroy Walters, director of the
Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Walters said it would be ``a plausible and morally justifiable
application of genetic techniques'' to raise the intelligence of a
child with very low IQ scores, because that could be regarded as
remedial, but enhancing the IQ of someone at or above the mean
would be much more controversial, in his view.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical implications extend beyond humans. Well before
anyone tries to increase human intelligence, the technique will be
tested in monkeys or chimpanzees. A smarter chimp might help answer
the enduring question of whether animals are conscious or whether
consciousness is only attained by brains with the capacity for
language. But how much smarter can chimpanzees get before they
merit, or even demand, special rights?
</P>
<P>
   ``Say we produce a chimp that is more intelligent than people,''
said Sharpe. ``I think we would probably just try to enslave it
rather than welcome it into the human community. It may be a
cynical view but I don't think we are very good at according moral
status to nonhumans.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneers like Tsien are eager to explore the new possibilities
created by genetic engineering. Nature may be wise, but it often
doesn't act in the individual's best interest, he notes. The body's
cells don't have to rust and wear out like cars: they could renew
themselves indefinitely. Since nature lets us die, Tsien believes,
it may also have neglected to make humans as smart as they can be .
</P>
<P>
   He finds it hard to understand the recent flurry of apprehension
about human cloning, because a clone, being an exact genetic copy,
adds nothing new to the world. But making an individual more
intelligent would be novel and interesting. ``Everyone wants to be
smart,'' he said.

DIANA'S DUBIOUS LEGACY: LAND MINE BAN HAS TROUBLE GETTING OFF THE
GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly
negotiated in Oslo. Many say her efforts to draw attention to the
fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her
greatest legacies.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of legacy is it?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use,
production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be
as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of
civil war in Kosovo. So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were
fighting. Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks
against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan
(and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping
some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
</P>
<P>
   Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India
and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil
wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to
Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that
governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines
in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it
officially went into force. Among those were three that signed the
treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country
Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major
countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United
States, Russia and China, most of the nations in the Middle East
and many in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the
coordinator of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
</P>
<P>
   She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to
write off the treaty as a failure. On the contrary, they point to
progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide
production of mines and their availability in the international
arms market, according to arms control monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service
in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban
have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the
treaty was written two years ago. Even countries that have so far
refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia
_ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain
kinds altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public
perception. Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans,
of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a
minefield in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one
thought about it,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``Everybody is aware that
mines were used in Kosovo. The treaty is setting a new
international standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the
eradication of mines another.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are cheap and durable and deadly. In Yugoslavia, which has
not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes
along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the
Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that
forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav
fire. Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked
Albanian homes to keep refugees from returning home. (Many returned
anyway, and died as a result.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty _ the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
Their Destruction _ went into effect March 1, 1999, six months
after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force.
</P>
<P>
   There is no governing organization to oversee it and no
mechanism to punish those who violate it. It essentially relies on
member states to monitor themselves and honestly report on what
stockpiles they have and the efforts they are making to destroy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope that global peer pressure will gradually force
nations to comply. ``You don't expect everybody to stop using mines
overnight,'' said Caleb Rossiter, an analyst now conducting a study
on mine strategy in Korea for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``Treaties like this take a long time to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that
the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States
won't sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite once advocating a ban, President Clinton bowed to
pressure from Pentagon commanders opposed to the treaty's
restrictions. They insist they need the most common type of land
mines _ those left buried in the ground _ to protect South Korea
from North Korea. They also want to keep using ``smart''
anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct
after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not
prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough
to trigger them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future
_ but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a
process critics say has moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody questions the fact that we would be much
further along if the United States was not only a participant in
the treaty, but an active one,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
one of the most ardent advocates of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.S. support, Leahy added, ``a lot of countries will
say, `Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful
country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land
mines?'''

   Walters said it would be ``a plausible and morally justifiable
application of genetic techniques'' to raise the intelligence of a
child with very low IQ scores, because that could be regarded as
remedial, but enhancing the IQ of someone at or above the mean
would be much more controversial, in his view.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical implications extend beyond humans. Well before
anyone tries to increase human intelligence, the technique will be
tested in monkeys or chimpanzees. A smarter chimp might help answer
the enduring question of whether animals are conscious or whether
consciousness is only attained by brains with the capacity for
language. But how much smarter can chimpanzees get before they
merit, or even demand, special rights?
</P>
<P>
   ``Say we produce a chimp that is more intelligent than people,''
said Sharpe. ``I think we would probably just try to enslave it
rather than welcome it into the human community. It may be a
cynical view but I don't think we are very good at according moral
status to nonhumans.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneers like Tsien are eager to explore the new possibilities
created by genetic engineering. Nature may be wise, but it often
doesn't act in the individual's best interest, he notes. The body's
cells don't have to rust and wear out like cars: they could renew
themselves indefinitely. Since nature lets us die, Tsien believes,
it may also have neglected to make humans as smart as they can be .
</P>
<P>
   He finds it hard to understand the recent flurry of apprehension
about human cloning, because a clone, being an exact genetic copy,
adds nothing new to the world. But making an individual more
intelligent would be novel and interesting. ``Everyone wants to be
smart,'' he said.

DIANA'S DUBIOUS LEGACY: LAND MINE BAN HAS TROUBLE GETTING OFF THE
GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly
negotiated in Oslo. Many say her efforts to draw attention to the
fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her
greatest legacies.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of legacy is it?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use,
production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be
as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of
civil war in Kosovo. So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were
fighting. Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks
against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan
(and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping
some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
</P>
<P>
   Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India
and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil
wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to
Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that
governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines
in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it
officially went into force. Among those were three that signed the
treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country
Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major
countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United
States, Russia and China, most of the nations in the Middle East
and many in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the
coordinator of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
</P>
<P>
   She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to
write off the treaty as a failure. On the contrary, they point to
progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide
production of mines and their availability in the international
arms market, according to arms control monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service
in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban
have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the
treaty was written two years ago. Even countries that have so far
refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia
_ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain
kinds altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public
perception. Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans,
of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a
minefield in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one
thought about it,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``Everybody is aware that
mines were used in Kosovo. The treaty is setting a new
international standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the
eradication of mines another.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are cheap and durable and deadly. In Yugoslavia, which has
not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes
along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the
Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that
forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav
fire. Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked
Albanian homes to keep refugees from returning home. (Many returned
anyway, and died as a result.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty
itself.
</P>

Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
Their Destruction _ went into effect March 1, 1999, six months

   When Snoopy isn't out stalking the Red Baron, he can usually be
found atop his doghouse tapping out a novel that invariably begins,
``It was a dark and stormy night.'' What most people don't realize
is that those words are actually the first sentence of the 1830
novel ``Paul Clifford'' by the eminent Victorian Sir Edward
Bulwer-Lytton. Since 1982, Sir Edward has achieved eponymous infamy
as the patron saint of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, an annual
competition held by the English department of San Jose State
University. The challenge is simple: ``to compose the opening
sentence to the worst of all possible novels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulwer-Lytton contest, open to anyone, now attracts
thousands of entries from around the world, competing not only for
the top prize _ $250, a ``pittance,'' the sponsors acknowledge _
but for dubious honors in such genres as romance and fantasy. Here
is a selection from this year's winners and also-rans, announced
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Overall
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the gathering gloom of a late-October afternoon, along
the greasy, cracked paving-stones slick from the sputum of the sky,
Stanley Ruddlethorp wearily trudged up the hill from the cemetery
where his wife, sister, brother, and three children were all
buried, and forced open the door of his decaying house, blissfully
unaware of the catastrophe that was soon to devastate his life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. David Chuter, Kingston, Surrey, England
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Romance
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil made their skin glisten as their bodies moved in slow
synchronous rhythm on the beach, the water gently flowing up around
their legs, birds floating in the surf accompanying their moans
with songs of pain and despair, otter and seal carcasses washing
ashore around them, and it frightened her and exhilarated her at
the same time that their love under the open sky might be
discovered by a Sierra Club cleanup volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Chappell, Blanchardville, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Science Fiction
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining astronauts strung out on the long tether could
only wonder at a universe full of eerie contrasts _ brilliant stars
against the velvety blackness of space, the hot flare of their
comrade's meteoric plunge into the atmosphere against the cool-blue
ocean below, the man's frenzied screams on the radio as he was
roasted by the heat of re-entry against the icy calm voice of
mission control as they grilled the astronaut on the far end of the
tether, and how hilarious it had all seemed when he first yelled
``Crack the whip!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Strong, Winnipeg, Manitoba
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Purple Prose
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain _ violent torrents of it, rain like fetid water from a
God-sized pot of pasta strained through a sky-wide colander, rain
as Noah knew it, flaying the shuddering trees, whipping the
whitecapped waters, violating the sodden firmament, purging purity
and filth alike from the land, rain without mercy, without
surcease, incontinent rain, turning to intermittent showers
overnight with partial clearing Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   _ David Hirsch, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Adventure
</P>
<P>
   ``The woods held danger at every dark, haunting corner, and
Indiana Jones decided it was too risky to continue; he had already
been attacked by a mound of fire ants, had a brush with poison ivy,
and faced a terrifying encounter with the Forest Ranger's vicious
beagle, Muffin.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Christine Sullivan, Melbourne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Vile Puns
</P>
<P>
   ``Forced by rising costs and lagging demand to make their
leading product out of a cheaper metal, Hoosier Love, Inc. found
that a special treatment process was needed to clean and coat their
Indy 500 memento, a tiny fake-jewel-studded replica of an
Offenhauser engine on a jeweler's chain, to protect it from the
corrosive effect of chlorine, a process that appeared in the ISO
9000 Manufacturer's Manual under the title, ``The Dechloration of
Indy Pendants.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Rohde, Minneapolis
</P>
<P>
   Winner: `Dark and Stormy' Division
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Independent Counsel emerged each night from the
adjourned closed-door proceedings, reporters assessed how zealously
he was currently prosecuting from his facial expression, which on
one night might be that familiar affably light smile, while on
another night it could be a menacingly dark scowl; and so, as our
story begins, they surmised he was playing hardball, for it was a
dark-Ken Starr-mien night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Snow, Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The Also-Rans
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the overall category:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the regal bearing of a TV weatherman, his hair
twinkling like the crystals in Ivana Trump's chandelier, his teeth
white and snappy like high-starch boxers, his jaw strong and sharp
as a Canadian high-pressure system, and an El Nino just itching to
wreak havoc in her trailer park.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elayne Roman, West Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dishonorable mention'' (third place) in the romance category:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie had become so very attached to Butch these last few
years, not so much like a remora on the side of a shark, nor even
handcuffs in the night, but almost, but not quite, like an
inoperable, yet benign, tumor, crenulating and bifurcating in the
love-struck center of his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vance Atkins, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the ``dark and stormy night'' category:
</P>
<P>
   ```Just look, ya bloomin' idiot,'' Eleanor
Rugglesby-Bobsyeruncle, the world-famous cockney art collector,
screamed at her assistant, Ivan Ivanovich, illegitimate son of the
Secret Czar, Ivanovichi, ``ya packed me priceless Don Quixote
paintin' in with a sack of bloody Spam, it was the darn cans tore
me knight!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Allan D. Burrows, Mississauga, Ontario
</P>
<P>
   A miscellaneous dishonorable mention:
</P>
<P>
   ``Night was a mere threat on the quivering lip of the sky and
the golden tongue of the sun still licked the recesses of the
bridle path, when suddenly, an unnatural shriek emanated from the
dark throat of the forest, causing stiff fingers of fear to march
firmly down the spine of the motionless maiden.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Annette O'Neill, Pacifica, Calif. &QR;
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the first line from a putative novel, ``A Tale of
Two Statisticians'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best of times; it wasn't the worst of times; it
was the times you'd get if you arranged all possible times
(including even fictional times in which the nights were usually
dark and stormy) in order from worst to best on the real number
line from 0.0 inclusive to 1.0 exclusive and then used a really
good uniform random number generator to pick a value in that range
thus choosing the corresponding times _ that's the times it was.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dale Dellutri, Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: A ``lyttony'' with more tortured constructs is
available at the Bulwer-Lytton Web site, www.bulwer-lytton.com.
Penguin has also published five collections of dross from the
competition, including ``Bride of It Was a Dark and Stormy Night.''

AFTER WACO: DEJA VU _ AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL

   WASHINGTON _ Barely weeks after the independent counsel law died
and was bid good riddance by everyone from President Clinton to
Kenneth Starr, Washington is astir with calls for a new round of
independent investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On controversial matters like the 1993 government raid on the
compound of the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Democratic
fund-raising, and the possible diversion and laundering of
international relief money by the Russians, the administration's
critics have renewed demands for special counsels.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute: Aggressive outside investigations were
supposed to be out of favor after the nation's experience with
Starr's prolonged Whitewater inquiry, which encompassed the
president's sex life and led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that things are back to normal in Washington now,
even if the legal mechanics have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was supposed to take politics out of
investigations of the government, but didn't. It gave power to a
three-judge panel to appoint and oversee independent counsels,
taking from the Executive Branch the power of investigating itself.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Whitewater inquiry and other investigations of the
Clinton administration, the law became a popular target of
criticism. Democrats claimed it was being used for partisan ends,
while Republicans said the White House and its allies had resorted
to political attacks to taint legitimate inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   So the law was scrapped, and now the American tradition of
outside inquiries continues, with the risk of political taint at
least as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure over disclosures that the FBI had withheld
evidence of the use of incendiary grenades in the Waco siege,
Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday announced her intention to
appoint an independent lawyer to re-examine the government's
handling of the Branch Davidians. The inquiry would not directly
involve the same kind of independent counsel that has been used to
investigate Clinton and members of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the type of investigation, calls for
independent inquiries even after the expiration of the law were
entirely predictable, say former prosecutors and officials. The
Justice Department's credibility is at a new low after the Waco
disclosures, on the heels of its failure to get to the bottom of
the campaign finance questions. ``There is a lack of confidence
over the ability of the Justice Department to do its job,'' said
Paul Curran, a special counsel during the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno made greater use of the independent counsel law than
any other attorney general since its enactment after the Watergate
scandal, she was besieged by critics urging its wider use, and
seemed relieved by its lapse this year. In its place, she issued
new rules giving her broad discretion over the appointment of
outside counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The rules do nothing to resolve the problem of an outside
counsel's autonomy. To be credible, an outside prosecutor should
generally not be accountable to another member of the Executive
Branch, like the president or one of his appointees. But in being
unaccountable, a prosecutor may abuse his power and become
partisan, as Democrats have charged lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is always going to be there,'' said Terry
Eastland, who was a Justice Department official in the Reagan
administration and who has long been critical of the law. ``It
always has been there from the beginning and it is embedded in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ulysses S. Grant had the dubious distinction of
appointing and then dismissing the nation's first outside
prosecutor. The lawyer, John B. Henderson, was named to examine the
relationship between the administration and what became known as
the St. Louis Whiskey Ring, a group of Midwestern liquor distillers
and federal revenue agents who cheated the government out of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no guilty man escape!'' Grant exclaimed as he opened the
investigation in 1875. But Henderson was dismissed after his
inquiry focused on Orville E. Babcock, the president's private
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman were among those
who later appointed outside counsels. And one of Truman's attorneys
general also fired an outside prosecutor, after that prosecutor
decided to investigate the Justice Department. Truman, shaken by
that decision, promptly replaced his attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But the most infamous incident was the Saturday Night Massacre
in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon dismissed the special
Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox, named by his Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   That action ultimately led to the adoption of the independent
counsel law. But, as is obvious today, it did little to quell the
political controversies surrounding sensitive government
investigations.

   And the Hippo Begat the Whale
</P>
<P>
   How did nature ever get the idea of making a whale? Biologists
have found the answer by analyzing the DNA of whales and their
nearest terrestrial relatives, the artiodactyls, or even-toed
ungulates.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was an ancestral artiodactyl, this Just So story
goes, but its descendants did not get along with the bad-tempered
camel, which split off from the rest to become a separate species.
</P>
<P>
   The pig and peccary family was the next to depart, according to
the evidence of their genes, followed by giraffes and the deer
family.
</P>
<P>
   That left the hippo, a creature so aquatic that it gives birth
underwater. Sooner or later some hippos ventured down their river
estuary to the open sea, shed their hind limbs and shaped their
forelimbs into flippers.
</P>
<P>
   That, my children, is how nature fashioned the whale, and if you
don't believe it, you may consult the learned article by Dr.
Norihiko Okada and colleagues in this month's Proceedings of the

   Cars for the Credit-Challenged
</P>
<P>
   Detroit car dealer Mel Farr doesn't mind leasing used cars to
people with bad credit, as long as they don't mind driving around
with a gizmo on the dashboard that keeps their cars from starting
if they miss a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lease from Farr must pay up weekly in order to get a
code to punch into the device on the dashboard. Anyone who is late
paying can still drive around, but once they turn the car off,
they'll find it won't start again.
</P>
<P>
   With lobbying help from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and financial
help from Wall Street, Farr, a former Detroit Lions football
player, said he was helping those who otherwise couldn't afford a
car. Critics, including Ralph Nader, worry that the devices could
prove unsafe, and said the interest rates of up to 25 percent take
advantage of the desperate. Farr counters that the high prices
reflect his risk.

   Israelis and Palestinians Agree to Agree
</P>
<P>
   After shuttling between both sides, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced that Israel and the Palestinians had concluded
an agreement to implement the land-for-peace accord they reached
nearly a year ago at the Wye River resort in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which provides for more Israeli redeployments
from the West Bank, set a deadline of early next year for the
parties to create a framework for final negotiations and of next
September for a final settlement. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has expressed hope that negotiations will also resume with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Among the final sticking points was the question of how many
Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Also,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had wanted the right to declare a
Palestinian state, but the Israelis were opposed to any
``unilateral action.''

   Deaths on a Roller Coaster
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state investigators removed four cars from a roller
coaster in Ocean City to determine why a woman and her daughter
died on the ride. The woman, Kimberly Baily, 39, of Pomona, N.Y.,
and her daughter Jessica, 8, were at Gillian's Wonderland Pier when
the car they were riding slipped backward down a steep incline,
made a 90-degree turn and ejected them. There have been six deaths
on rides at American amusement parks so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Beef Over Burger King
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to relish the idea of the humble Whopper
innocently entangled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no laughing matter to the parties involved, and
least of all to Burger King International, which somehow did not
realize that, through an Israeli franchise holder, it had opened a
restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials said the Israeli franchise holder misled
them into thinking the settlement, Maale Adumim, was located in
Israel, and company officials apparently never consulted a map.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Arab-American protests, the company ordered the
Burger King name removed. The franchise holder refused. And now the
Burger King of Maale Adumim has become another contested fact on
the ground in the disputed territories.

   A Teachers' Strike in Detroit
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in Detroit's public schools went on strike, refusing to
work without a contract. That left 178,000 students on an extended
summer vacation, and many of their parents scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement may prove slow in coming. Rank-and-file teachers
took a harder line than their Detroit Federation of Teachers,
rejecting the union leadership's recommendation to go back to work
with a 10-day bargaining extension.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are concerned that a new school board is not taking
their views into account as it struggles to improve student
performance in a district where half the students don't graduate
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   They also object to being paid less than their suburban
counterparts. So far, many parents in this union town are
supporting the teachers.

   Fewer Applications For Medical School
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure why, but the number of people applying to medical
schools in the United States is slipping. A study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 12 percent
drop since 1996 in applications to the 125 schools accredited by
the American Medical Association. But there is still no shortage of
candidates. The 41,004 applicants last year vied for 16,000 spots.

therapies are benefiting many people infected with the AIDS virus,

AIDS, experts said. They urged renewed efforts at prevention to

   Chardonnay's Shameful Past
</P>
<P>
   The long arm of DNA that reached back into Thomas Jefferson's
family history has drawn attention to another scandalous liaison,
but this time in the family history of the chardonnay, one of the
world's best-known grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a DNA fingerprinting technique, geneticists at the
University of California, Davis, have shown that chardonnay is not
a kind of pinot, as believed by some experts, but rather is a cross
between pinot and gouais blanc.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing is surprising because pinot is a highly regarded
grape but gouais, common in the Middle Ages, became so despised
that it is no longer cultivated in France. The geneticists
discovered that 15 other French wines are also the progeny of the
pinot-gouais liaison, including gamay, the grape from which
beaujolais is made, and melon, the source of muscadet.

   Bush Outlines Plan To Fine Failing School

campaign to sound conservative but pragmatic, a line he tried to
toe again in his first major address on education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush excoriated most federal education programs as ineffective,
but he also called for a big expansion of the Education Department.
He said schools should be controlled by local boards, but insisted
on federally mandated testing of children.

<P>
   Bush refused to use the word ``voucher,'' but said federal money
should be taken from public schools where children perform poorly
and given to parents to use at private or other schools. ``Public
funds must be spent on things that work,'' he said.

   There's more than one approach to Washington. There is the high
road. There is the low road. And there is what's stuck in the road.
Washington's hot asphalt streets happen to be just the right stuff
for turning the gleaming treasures that drop on them into instant
fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, it isn't exactly the Great Rift Valley. The treasures
mashed into the streets tend to be the homely remnants of advanced
capitalist society: watch-strap buckles, combs and runaway baby
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to modern fossilization, the conditions
don't get much better than this. The asphalt in Washington is hot
and impressionable. The traffic is relentless. And the roads are
seldom repaved, which means an urban fossil has a good chance of
lasting a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Crowley, a staff photographer for The New York Times who
has made a hobby of documenting the city's flattened refuse, says
he regularly passes fossils he photographed years ago, including a
coffee stirrer from McDonald's pressed into I Street and an old
spoon planted on 16th Street that still clearly says ``Stainless
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the laws of fossilization is that the things that get
mired in the streets tend to be common objects. In other words, the
plastic comb and the family of pull-tabs from a six-pack represent
thousands more like them.
</P>
<P>
   So surely there must be signs of government crushed somewhere in
the streets. Alas, a tiny charm of the Capitol is the sole
governmental fossil, unless you count that plastic stirrer from
McDonald's, which could have been dropped by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: overinterpretation is a hazard of archaeology. If
you think that little piece of plastic left after a car accident
looks like the Washington Monument, or you're imagining that the
hood ornament resembles something in the Air and Space Museum,
maybe you've been in Washington a little too long.

player, said he was helping those who otherwise couldn't afford a
car. Critics, including Ralph Nader, worry that the devices could
prove unsafe, and said the interest rates of up to 25 percent take
advantage of the desperate. Farr counters that the high prices
reflect his risk.

   Israelis and Palestinians Agree to Agree
</P>
<P>
   After shuttling between both sides, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced that Israel and the Palestinians had concluded
an agreement to implement the land-for-peace accord they reached
nearly a year ago at the Wye River resort in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which provides for more Israeli redeployments
from the West Bank, set a deadline of early next year for the
parties to create a framework for final negotiations and of next
September for a final settlement. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has expressed hope that negotiations will also resume with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Among the final sticking points was the question of how many
Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Also,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had wanted the right to declare a
Palestinian state, but the Israelis were opposed to any
``unilateral action.''

   Deaths on a Roller Coaster
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state investigators removed four cars from a roller
coaster in Ocean City to determine why a woman and her daughter
died on the ride. The woman, Kimberly Baily, 39, of Pomona, N.Y.,
and her daughter Jessica, 8, were at Gillian's Wonderland Pier when
the car they were riding slipped backward down a steep incline,
made a 90-degree turn and ejected them. There have been six deaths
on rides at American amusement parks so far this year.

   A Beef Over Burger King
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to relish the idea of the humble Whopper
innocently entangled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no laughing matter to the parties involved, and
least of all to Burger King International, which somehow did not
realize that, through an Israeli franchise holder, it had opened a
restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials said the Israeli franchise holder misled
them into thinking the settlement, Maale Adumim, was located in
Israel, and company officials apparently never consulted a map.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Arab-American protests, the company ordered the
Burger King name removed. The franchise holder refused. And now the
Burger King of Maale Adumim has become another contested fact on
the ground in the disputed territories.

   A Teachers' Strike in Detroit
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in Detroit's public schools went on strike, refusing to
work without a contract. That left 178,000 students on an extended
summer vacation, and many of their parents scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement may prove slow in coming. Rank-and-file teachers
took a harder line than their Detroit Federation of Teachers,
rejecting the union leadership's recommendation to go back to work
with a 10-day bargaining extension.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are concerned that a new school board is not taking
their views into account as it struggles to improve student
performance in a district where half the students don't graduate
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   They also object to being paid less than their suburban
counterparts. So far, many parents in this union town are
supporting the teachers.

   Fewer Applications For Medical School

<P>
   Nobody is sure why, but the number of people applying to medical
schools in the United States is slipping. A study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 12 percent
drop since 1996 in applications to the 125 schools accredited by
the American Medical Association. But there is still no shortage of
candidates. The 41,004 applicants last year vied for 16,000 spots.

   Big Drop in AIDS Deaths Begins to Slow

   The substantial decline in AIDS deaths that began after newer
combinations of drugs were introduced nearly four years ago has
slowed _ to 20 percent from 1997 to 1998 compared to 42 percent
from 1996 to 1997, federal health officials reported. The newer
therapies are benefiting many people infected with the AIDS virus,
but have led many others to think that drugs alone will wipe out
AIDS, experts said. They urged renewed efforts at prevention to
overcome the complacency.

   Retiring the Beanie Babies
</P>
<P>
   In what toy industry experts say may be a publicity stunt, Ty
Inc., the maker of Beanie Babies, announced on its World Wide Web
site that ``all Beanies will be retired'' as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   No one really believes that Beanies Babies will go the way of
the pet rock.
</P>
<P>
   The company may have made the announcement to drum up sales for
a product that has lost some of its appeal as youngsters have moved
on to other toys, such as Pokemon. The announcement created a
frenzy on Web site chat rooms and left customers confused. The
company, which has been known to ignore customers and retailers (Ty
even has an unlisted phone number), has declined to comment on the
announcement.

   Chardonnay's Shameful Past
</P>
<P>
   The long arm of DNA that reached back into Thomas Jefferson's
family history has drawn attention to another scandalous liaison,
but this time in the family history of the chardonnay, one of the
world's best-known grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a DNA fingerprinting technique, geneticists at the
University of California, Davis, have shown that chardonnay is not
a kind of pinot, as believed by some experts, but rather is a cross
between pinot and gouais blanc.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing is surprising because pinot is a highly regarded
grape but gouais, common in the Middle Ages, became so despised
that it is no longer cultivated in France. The geneticists
discovered that 15 other French wines are also the progeny of the
pinot-gouais liaison, including gamay, the grape from which
beaujolais is made, and melon, the source of muscadet.

   Bush Outlines Plan To Fine Failing School
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has worked hard in his presidential
campaign to sound conservative but pragmatic, a line he tried to
toe again in his first major address on education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush excoriated most federal education programs as ineffective,
but he also called for a big expansion of the Education Department.
He said schools should be controlled by local boards, but insisted
on federally mandated testing of children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to use the word ``voucher,'' but said federal money
should be taken from public schools where children perform poorly
and given to parents to use at private or other schools. ``Public
funds must be spent on things that work,'' he said.

   There's more than one approach to Washington. There is the high
road. There is the low road. And there is what's stuck in the road.
Washington's hot asphalt streets happen to be just the right stuff
for turning the gleaming treasures that drop on them into instant
fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, it isn't exactly the Great Rift Valley. The treasures
mashed into the streets tend to be the homely remnants of advanced
capitalist society: watch-strap buckles, combs and runaway baby
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to modern fossilization, the conditions
don't get much better than this. The asphalt in Washington is hot
and impressionable. The traffic is relentless. And the roads are
seldom repaved, which means an urban fossil has a good chance of
lasting a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Crowley, a staff photographer for The New York Times who
has made a hobby of documenting the city's flattened refuse, says
he regularly passes fossils he photographed years ago, including a
coffee stirrer from McDonald's pressed into I Street and an old
spoon planted on 16th Street that still clearly says ``Stainless
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the laws of fossilization is that the things that get
mired in the streets tend to be common objects. In other words, the
plastic comb and the family of pull-tabs from a six-pack represent
thousands more like them.
</P>
<P>
   So surely there must be signs of government crushed somewhere in
the streets. Alas, a tiny charm of the Capitol is the sole
governmental fossil, unless you count that plastic stirrer from
McDonald's, which could have been dropped by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: overinterpretation is a hazard of archaeology. If
you think that little piece of plastic left after a car accident
looks like the Washington Monument, or you're imagining that the
hood ornament resembles something in the Air and Space Museum,
maybe you've been in Washington a little too long.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Best bar mitzvah, bar none
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I traveled to Austin on a recent
Saturday to attend a cousin's bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   Distant cousin, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I read once that we're all at least 40th cousins, such is the
family of man.
</P>
<P>
   I feel special kinship to the parents of the young man who was
celebrating his bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   They're Sharon and Ken Herman, both of whom write for the Austin
American-Statesman. When I was editor of the Lufkin Daily News,
more than 20 years ago, I gave Ken his first job as a reporter. He
in turn gave the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize for an investigation
into the recruitment death of a Lufkin Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I introduced Ken and Sharon. I was speaking at a press
club get-together in Dallas on how we'd won the Pulitzer Prize _
Ken and I split it right down the middle; he did all the work and I
took all the credit. At a reception afterwards, Sharon introduced
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the conversation she mentioned she was Jewish. I
told her, ``Have I got a deal for you,'' took her by the hand, led
her through the crowd and presented her with Ken.
</P>
<P>
   I was one of Ken's groomsmen when they married, which was the
first time I was ever in a synagogue, and their son Jeremy's bar
mitzvah was my first bar mitzvah. We Baptists don't get out that
much.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind I couldn't understand all of what was going on, most
of the ceremony being in Hebrew. But the psalms, which were
translated in English on facing pages of the Hebrew book of
prayers, read the same as the ones recited in Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how often do you have the opportunity to participate in
a ritual that dates back thousands of years? No doubt it's evolved
somewhat. For one thing, I doubt there were marshmallows in Old
Testament times.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we pelted the young man with at the conclusion of
the bar mitzvah, marshmallows individually wrapped in silver paper
and tied with a bow. It's to wish him a sweet life.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing the marshmallows was one of my favorite parts of the
service.
</P>
<P>
   But what I liked best, and what meant the most to me, came later
during the regular Sabbath worship when the rabbi read a letter he
had received from members of the University Baptist Church in
Austin. Here's what it said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the undersigned, gathered at the University Baptist Church
for worship this August 15, 1999, reach out in affection to our
Jewish brothers and sisters in Austin and around the world
</P>
<P>
   ``_ to deplore the violence committed in a California Jewish
community center this week by a man belonging to several hate
groups;
</P>
<P>
   ``_ to reject the hatred expressed and the violence committed
against the Jewish people through history by anyone, but especially
by those who did so in the name of Christianity;
</P>
<P>
   ``_ to speak our gratitude for the gifts and contributions the
Jewish people have brought to us, to our nation, and to all
humankind;
</P>
<P>
   ``_ to recognize that Judaism and Christianity are kindred
faiths and that we are all brothers and sisters, children of the
one God;
</P>
<P>
   ``_ and to express our solidarity with you, our desire for
friendship, and our commitment to your safety in the places where
you live, work, and worship. Because acts of violence have been
committed in the name of Jesus whom we call Christ, as Christians
we feel it important to make this expression of solidarity,
appreciation, and commitment to friendship in the name of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   It made me proud to be a Baptist. It made me proud to be a
Baptist attending a Jewish service. Such is the family of God.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Israelis perplexing about murderers
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 8, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The just-concluded agreement between the Israelis and
Palestinians _ another in an infinite number of agreements that
will be violated or ignored in various ways by one or both sides _
drew my attention, not so much for the brittle peace it is supposed
to bring, but for how the Israelis feel about murder.
</P>
<P>
   My conclusion: It all depends upon who gets murdered.
</P>
<P>
   An inflexible point of the Israeli position vis-a-vis an
agreement with the Palestinians was that it would not release any
Palestinians who had murdered Israelis. There are somewhere in the
vicinity of 45 in that category.
</P>
<P>
   And I wouldn't let them go, either _ no matter who they
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last weekend, this caveat appeared to be the singular
most bitter difference between the Israelis and Arabs, and for a
while it looked like the broader agreement would collapse as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians blinked _ or were poked in the eye by a
visiting U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis prevailed on the murderer issue and negotiated on
others they felt negotiable to where they and the Palestinians
signed on the dotted line so that Madeleine Albright's big trip
would be a congenial photo-op.
</P>
<P>
   But here's my sticking point. Israel, which feels so strongly
about murderers of its own people, apparently does not feel that
strongly about murders of others. In this case an American.
</P>
<P>
   Not many days before Israel forced their hard line on murderers
of Israelis, a young American who fled to Israel two days after he
murdered, burned and dismembered a person in Maryland in 1997
admitted his guilt and appears headed for a 24-year sentence, with
release possible after just 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   What Samuel Sheinbein was running away from was the technicality
that Maryland has the death penalty; Israel does not, unless you
happen to be Adolf Eichmann or those of his ilk. While Maryland
sentences people to death _ 19 are under such judgment _ World
Almanac data shows it hasn't carried out any.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Israelis, it must be noted that many of them,
including legislators, feel Sheinbein should have been extradited
to the United States. But the issue found its way to the Israeli
Supreme Court, which used a broad anti-extradition law to deny the
U.S. an opportunity to try this American for the murder of an
American in America.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's ambiguous connection with Israel is that his father
has Israeli citizenship. Seventeen years old at the time, Samuel
beat it over to Israel and hid behind an Israeli law that says
17-year-olds cannot be tried as adults. In the U.S., especially in
the case of an appalling crime, they can.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the Georgia 15-year-old who shot six school
students but didn't kill anyone; he has been ordered by a judge to
be tried as an adult. The maximum a juvenile can serve in Georgia
is 60 months. As an adult, T.J. Solomon could be sentenced to life
in prison, which is a lot longer term than what Sheinbein, who
killed, burned and mutilated, is going to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sheinbein and his father cleverly maneuvered Israeli law,
created _ the Israelis say _ not to safeguard juvenile murderers
but to protect Israelis from anti-Semitism elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to modify the law the Sheinbeins manipulated, it
stands. American authorities who energetically sought extradition
are enraged.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea how long each of the Palestinian murderers of
Israelis have been in prison, but I've got a notion that many of
them have been there for more than the 14 years Sheinbein will
likely serve.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Israel will reshape its extradition law so that it
cannot be used as a haven for young murderers who happen to be
Jewish. It also is my hope that Samuel Sheinbein, a savage murderer
with no stated remorse, won't be released after just 14 years but
will be required to remain in prison for the full term of his
sentence; then deported.

 &HT;    Personalities, money overshadow parties
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the enormous money advantage of the front-runners and the
jackrabbit pace of the primaries, it was reasonable to expect the
field of presidential contenders to narrow considerably by Labor
Day, the traditional start of the political earnest season.
</P>
<P>
   But as the last few campaign staffers hurry back from their
beach vacations and the candidates, like dying leaves, begin their
autumn descent upon New Hampshire, politics is taking a different
direction.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a couple of early casualties in the overcrowded
Republican field: Rep. John Kasich of Ohio acknowledged reality
early on and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander fell victim to
the Iowa Straw Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making it more focused, however, the overdetermined
quality of the presidential race up to now is causing it to broaden
out, past traditional party boundaries, into a perplexing mixture
of alternative candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is weighing his options, and appears likely to bolt
to the Reform Party by the end of the month. If he does, a
candidate with different views on social issues would likely
emerge, giving the party of Ross Perot its first real nomination
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who first left
the Republican Party to seek the Taxpayer Party nomination, then
announced he'd run as an independent, then considered dropping out
altogether because of his wife's health, has declared himself back
in the hunt now that her condition has improved.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats haven't generated any third-party candidates, but
they have their own intriguing spin-off in actor Warren Beatty, who
has let it be known he might be serious about pursuing that party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   All this extracurricular presidential energy may not amount to
much in the end. But if nothing else, it seems to bespeak a
collective dissatisfaction with the predictable nature of the
presidential campaign in the early going, and a further loosening
at century's end of the ties that bind voters to their party of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same thing might be said about the candidacy of former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who according to a Boston Globe poll
has pulled into a dead heat with Vice President Al Gore in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of rank-and-file Republicans will tell you,
in an off-handed way, that they could vote for somebody like
Bradley. Such a sentiment would be unlikely to survive a
well-financed effort by the GOP to remind its voters of Bradley's
Democratic voting record, but it says something about the
willingness of even self-identified party members to look past
conventional labels.
</P>
<P>
   This loosening of party loyalty is occurring at a time when the
evolution of money politics continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush's phenomenal fund-raising success has
deflected attention from the continuing growth of soft money
donations, but it is continuing at record pace. Common Cause
reported last week the two national party committees raised more
than $55.1 million in the first six months of the year, 80 percent
more than the amount raised in the same period four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Indianapolis Colts have formed a political action
committee, according to The Washington Post. And maybe by season's
end, they'll have a candidate.
</P>

 &HT;    Mustang Ranch news gives Uncle Horseface last laugh
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Now the government has gone and done it.
They've shut down the Mustang Ranch _ 440 acres and a brothel, just
east of Reno, Nev. The Feds say it's because the original owner
paid off local officials and skirted taxes. My Uncle Buddy would
say it's sour grapes because those IRS guys were so inept they
couldn't make out in a house of horizontal refreshment with a
hundred dollar bill and a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Buddy had nothing against the IRS personally, he just
didn't like Walton P., his brother-in-law who happened to work
there.
</P>
<P>
   Walton P. (or Uncle Horseface as the family had nicknamed him
due to his captivating manner) had married Edna Parker, Buddy's
older sister (my aunt), later in life. Before that, he'd been
living at home with his widowed momma, Mrs. Walton P. Sr., a dour
lady who appeared not to like any of us, (SET ITAL)particularly(END
ITAL) my Aunt Edna _ a divorced woman known to relish a good laugh
and a pitcher of martinis, and not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year or so, the Parker family would have get-togethers
in their home. Everyone was expected to show up and stay a week: my
mother (their daughter, Doris), my father and I; Uncle Buddy (their
youngest son who seemed to spend an inordinate number of years in
one military school after another); Aunt Edna and Uncle Horseface
and, of course, Mother Walton P. Sr., who was always included in
the family outings (or maybe more appropriately, innings).
Grandmother Parker referred to it as a family appreciation week. My
father called it a re-enactment of the Civil War because it always
turned into one hell of a battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Parkers were not a close family, and to add to the misery,
nobody could ever tell when Mother Walton P. Sr., was having fun
because none of us had ever seen her smile. In fact we'd never seen
her do much of anything other than read the flip side of her dinner
plate to check out who made the china. Once my little cousin
Malcolm poked at her with a toy fire engine, but nothing happened.
His momma said it was because Mother Walton P. Sr., wore a cast
iron corset.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Uncle Buddy would make an effort to liven up the
gatherings, but his ideas of fun left a lot of folks wondering why
his momma hadn't drowned him at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy's favorite trick was to hide out in one of the closets
that connected many of the bedrooms in Mrs. Parker's old Riverside
house. He'd wait patiently in the dark for an unsuspecting victim
to come looking for either a change of clothes or a shortcut to the
next room and then, mid-closet, he'd whisk the hangars apart,
groan, and fall to the floor, gasping that ``Big Al'' and his boys
had gotten him.
</P>
<P>
   The family was pretty much used to Buddy's antics and had worked
up its own system for dealing with the closet troll. In fact, until
I was old enough to go to slumber parties at other girls' homes, I
thought it was perfectly normal to pick up the little broom from
beside the bedroom fireplace and bang on the closet door before I
opened it. It was kind of fun because Mrs. Parker had given us
permission to hit Buddy with the broomstick if we found him in our
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Once, at the height of WW2, my father was in the bathroom
shaving when Buddy, with his hair slicked back and wearing a phony
moustache and parts of Grandaddy's old WW1 uniform that he'd found
in the attic, kicked open the door and yelled, ``HEIL HITLER!''
Daddy swore he'd come that close to cutting his (own) throat and
that he'd get even.
</P>
<P>
   Payback came a few days later. It had something to do with
Buddy's favorite pudding and a bottle of ipecac.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Buddy was allowed to live to maturity, but he never got
over making jokes about Uncle Horseface's profession. Too bad he's
not around to savor the Mustang takeover. His comments would have
been choice.

 &HT;    Beauty queen's penalty sounds like Columbine-sized overreaction
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's mighty dangerous to be a Texas cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   We digested with discomfort the case of the Channelview mom who
cooked up an aborted hit on a pompom rival of her daughter. Now we
have the whole cheering squad of Frenship High in Lubbock, Texas,
reportedly scurrying for cover from a menacing beauty queen. To
gauge the punishment, she must have borrowed her designs from
(ITALIC) Carrie. (END ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   Roni Lowe, who has resigned her Miss Lubbock Teen USA title, was
assigned to an alternative school for three months for making a
threat. She pulled out of school rather than face this music.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she deserved it. More evidence could frame this matter
better. However, nothing reported thus far would indicate that what
Roni said was anything more than garden-variety lip-flapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to kick your butt, and everybody's going to know
what happened'' is what Roni said she said to a cheerleader. That
was wrong and stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cheerleaders will disappear from the face of the
earth, and everyone will know who did it'' is how Frenship
officials paraphrased her.
</P>
<P>
   Frenship ISD said Roni's punishment was in keeping with its
zero-tolerance discipline policy, devised in light of the Columbine
shootings. Threats will be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, one can only say, darned right. Bring students in
and have them account for their threats.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm also thinking: If every student who said, ``I'm going to
kick your butt'' or something similar went to the alternative
school for three months, we might have to shut some schools down.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe that unless a girl like Roni, who obviously has
some worthy qualities, had a history of making threats, she
couldn't have been summoned by the assistant principal, ordered to
explain her statement and told, ``One more outburst like that,
Roni, and it's alternative for you.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago Waco schools realized that a
zero-tolerance policy that sent students to the alternative school
for a single fight was hard to defend. For one thing, it was
sometimes impossible to know if one child was simply defending
himself or herself in a scuffle. For another, sometimes the
incident was the result of a reflexive elbow, or low blood sugar,
or just kids being playful and getting too rough. Alternative
school for any and every fight? WISD thought better eventually, and
good for it.
</P>
<P>
   This year WISD continued to find degrees of reason in
alternative school placement. Students who previously were sent
there because of truancy now will be handled on campus with the
advisory that they and their parents will see a judge if it
continues. Students who previously were placed in alternative
school for offenses away from school _ underage drinking, say _
will be dealt with in the court system and kept on their campuses
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The ironic result: While some school districts are packing more
students off to alternative campuses under heightened,
Columbine-inspired zero-tolerance, Waco likely will be sending
fewer students this year, reserving room for the most serious and
chronic problems. That's the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   I asked WISD coordinator for special programs Marcia Anderson if
Roni Lowe would have gotten three months in alternative school in
Waco for what she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said she wouldn't engage in conjecture or second
guessing, saying only that the WISD policy would be to get the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to everyone to investigate the situation and not
overreact, because you can ruin someone's life, or a good portion
of it, by overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Waco has a zero-tolerance plan, but no policy of automatically
removing someone from a campus for making a threat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Roni Lowe got what she deserved. Or maybe a hair-trigger
system has made one more child pay too dearly for the acts of
Columbine's monsters.

 &HT;    Manager likes large companies for his fund
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best way to make money in the market is to stick with big
companies that have the power to grow even bigger, says Fritz
Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   He is co-manager of a 14-month-old, large growth mutual fund
that racked up a total return of 45.3 percent in the 12 months
ended July 31. The S&AMP;P 500 index was way behind, at 20.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He set that record on a very short track, that's true. But his
record at the Invesco Growth and Income fund makes him worth
listening to when he talks about stock picking. It is a large
growth fund, despite the two-part name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the record high price-earnings ratio of the market, we
think growth stocks are logically valued,'' Meyer said last week.
``We're paying a richer price, but these companies are better
managed and faster growing. Corporate America has seemingly greater
growth opportunities than it ever had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The record of large growth funds tends to back him up. Sort of.
Over the last 10 years, the funds recorded an average annual return
of 16.4 percent. As Meyer notes, that beat the 14 percent
performance of large-company, value-oriented funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the same database from funds researcher Morningstar also
reports that the S&AMP;P 500 index topped both of them, with returns of
17.4 percent. The rankings are the same over five- and 15-year
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer looks for his best stocks among about 200 with market
capitalization of more than $10 billion. Capitalization is the
number of shares of company stock times the price of each share,
which tells you how much the market thinks the company is worth.
</P>
<P>
   His fund keeps 70 percent to 80 percent of its money in stocks
of those big, big companies. The remainder goes into midsize
companies that Meyer and co-manager Trent E. May believe will grow
to big-cap size.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is concentrated. It owned only 55 stocks at the end of
July, indicating just how picky the two managers are.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer talked in an interview about the three factors he
considers in his search for the most promising stocks:
</P>
<P>
   _ Growing revenue. He means increases that are driven by unit
volume _ the number of products sold _ rather than price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a sign that the company has something unique and
proprietary and is in an excellent place, at the right time, for
its industry,'' Meyer said. ``Therefore the chances are that the
company's growth is sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks for revenue growth substantially better than the
average for all companies in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improving profit margins. He looks at after-tax profit
margins, searching for higher profit rates or at least for rates
that are steady and higher than the margins of comparable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That typically is a sign that management is good at holding
the line on costs while revenue increases,'' Meyer said. It also
indicates a strong demand for the company's products or services,
he said, and suggests continued, faster-than-average growth in
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Healthy cash flow. Meyer wants companies that bring in enough
money to cover the costs of building the business in the future.
The other options for growth capital are issuing more stock, which
hurts existing shareholders, or borrowing money, which increases
the risks that the company and its shareholders must cope with.
</P>
<P>
   So what are Meyer's favorites right now?
</P>
<P>
   The best indicator may be what the Growth and Income fund owns.
As of July 31, the biggest holdings were IBM, 4.4 percent of the
$61 million portfolio; Intel, 4.1 percent; Microsoft, 3.8 percent;
Harrah's Entertainment, 3.8 percent; and GE, 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those represent purchases in the past, of course. They don't
tell you whether those five stocks are still good buys. That's a
question an interested investor would have to answer for himself.

WACO AND THE DAVIDIANS' RELIGIOUS RIGHTS

<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most news stories -- particularly those involving religion --
have a short shelf life. But six years after the fact, Waco is
still news.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears the FBI may not have been as innocent in the 1993
siege of the Branch Davidian compound as we were led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians, founded in 1934, is a sectarian group of
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. In 1987, David Koresh became one
of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians believed themselves to be a separate spiritual
nation headed by a prophet. They expected the imminent return of
Christ. Their special status, as forerunners of the Second Coming,
created tension with the surrounding society.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Davidians identified the United States as
``apostate.'' They anticipated a violent confrontation between
themselves and the evil powers.
</P>
<P>
   The government depicted Koresh and the Branch Davidians as a
dangerous ``cult'' akin to Jim Jones and the People's Temple.
Koresh was stockpiling weapons and, most damning, abusing children.
If not stopped, they would commit mass suicide or attack the
surrounding community. Thus, Koresh's religion justified the
government's siege of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd about the scenario is not Koresh's religion. What is
odd and deeply troublingis what the government did about that
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and his followers were Christians. They certainly were
not Presbyterians or Baptists, but they believed everything more
mainstream Christians do. And like other Christians do, they
embellished parts of the tradition. The Branch Davidians emphasized
the Book of Revelation, separating themselves from the sinful world
as distinct people. Koresh was their prophet (not a new Messiah)
who helped them interpret scripture and prepare them for their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Among their more particular beliefs were that Koresh needed to
father 24 children and that the government would one day attack
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians are best understood as a nonconventional
religion. Such religions are generally the offspring of more
traditional groups. They tend to overemphasize some part of the
tradition, thus creating a ``super pious'' group within the older
institution. Eventually the tension causes them to form a new
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, nonconventional groups have spun
off of nearly every mainstream religion. But Protestantism has been
especially susceptible to the process. And the line between
``mainstream'' and ``nonconventional'' has often been thin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s, for example, Presbyterian minister Charles Finney
led a spectacular series of revivals that resulted in hundreds of
thousands of conversions. Finney's manipulative methods often
produced unusual manifestations such as instantaneous healing and
tongues speaking. Although controversial in his practices, Finney
stayed on this side of the theological law and never significantly
deviated from traditional Protestant doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   One of Finney's followers, John Humphrey Noyes, however,
modified both Christian practice and theology. Noyes believed that
Jesus' Second Coming had already occurred and that Christians had
achieved sinless perfection. Noyes instituted ``biblical
communism'' among his followersincluding the practice of ``complex
marriage'', where everyone in his commune was married to everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The group, known as the Oneida Community, survived for almost 50
years. They experienced legal persecution (Noyes was indicted on
adultery charges) and informal persecution from neighboring
Christians. But they carried out their religious experiment in
relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   Other 19th-century groups could tell similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   Nonconventional religions, like the Mormons and Shakers, were
often construed as dangerous especially regarding sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   America's valued ``religious freedom'' only grudgingly welcomed
non-mainstream, non-Protestant religions. Even Roman Catholics and
Jews were persecuted. But violence against them was generally
sporadic, local, and not directed by a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the difference with Waco. David Koresh did exactly
what hundreds of American religious leaders had done before him.
For nearly four centuries, Americans have embellished upon
theological traditions, experimented with marriage and
childbearing, formed isolated communes, started new religions, kept
firearms to insure their safety, and challenged political and
cultural norms. At least theoretically, the government protected
the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot defend Koresh theologically. I think he and his
followers were tragically wrong. But unless they were breaking the
law--and it is not altogether clear they were -- the Davidians'
religious rights should have protected them from a military assault
on distasteful theology.
</P>
<P>
   One need not be a paranoid anti-government fanatic to think
something went terribly wrong at Waco. Government agents shouldn't
throw bombs (i.e. ``pyrotechnic canisters'') at churches --
especially with children inside.
</P>
<P>
   If the line between mainstream and nonconventional is indeed
thin, Presbyterians and Baptists -- indeed those of all faiths
--must remember Waco.

THE HORRIFYING REALITY OF SLAVERY IN AFRICA TODAY

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In September 1829, a black American named David Walker published
his ``Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World.'' In it, he
condemned the ``inhuman system of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians credit him with inspiring Americans to greater
radicalism in abolishing slavery.
</P>
<P>
   True freedom, Walker claimed, ``shall never be fully
consummated'' until ``the entire emancipation of (the) enslaved
brethren all over the world'' is accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, Walker's appeal is as relevant today as it
was 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a United Nations committee is gathering to discuss
slavery. Not the slavery of David Walker's time, but slavery in
today's world, especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary slavery takes many forms-- forced prostitution and
sweatshops included. Few instances are as horrifying as Sudan's
slave trade, where women and children are sold as chattel.
</P>
<P>
   According to the human rights group Christian Solidarity
International (CSI), Sudanese slavery ``is not merely a fading
relic of the past, but has undergone a revival as a result of
encouragement from the ruling National Islamic Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the largely Muslim north has waged a civil war
against the Christian and animist south. When the government tried
to Islamize the south, the southern Sudanese rebelled, forming
their own army.
</P>
<P>
   During the last sixteen years, 2 million people have died from
either famine or violence.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this military campaign, northern ``defense'' forces
have reintroduced the ancient practice of slavery in Sudan. As
war-booty, tens of thousands of women and children have been sold
into bondage. Human rights advocates report widespread
brutalityincluding torture, sexual abuse,and genital
mutilationamong the slaves. In addition, the slaves ``are forced by
their masters to change their cultural identity and become
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   The western media has been largely silent regarding contemporary
slavery. For years, however, conservative Christian journalists
have covered this story, inspiring their co-religionists to take up
the anti-slavery cause. As a result, organizations such as
Christian Solidarity International and Christian Freedom
International have developed sizable programs to free the slaves
and press for international awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream media outlets may have hesitated to report African
slavery because of the pro-Christian and anti-Islamic polemics of
these organizations. That bias, however, does not change the fact
that the northern Sudanese,no matter what their religion, appear to
have deprived thousands of citizens of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the apparent atrocities, according to A.M. Rosenthal
of The New York Times, the United Nations is not meeting to condemn
the Sudanese government. Instead, it plans to discuss penalties
against Christian Solidarity International for violating UN
procedural rules. Not surprisingly, Sudan brought charges against
CSI. CSI's credentials as a UN nongovernmental organization have
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations response to CSI resembles,historically at
least, the American government's defense of southern slaveholders.
When a slave fled to freedom, American law punished the slave and
any persons offering help. The government refused to condemn
slavery or the slaveholders. Do not blame the ``inhuman system of
slavery.'' Blame its victims.
</P>
<P>
   CSI may not have followed the rules. Certainly, some of their
policies are controversial. They sponsor a ``slave redemption''
program through which contributors can buy slaves for $50 each.
Since the program's inception, CSI has freed almost 8,000 slaves,
with the most dramatic contribution coming from some elementary
school children in Aurora, Colo., who raised $50,000 to purchase
1,000 slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the human-rights efforts in Sudan, CSI's program has
finally raised international concern regarding slavery. No wonder
the Sudanese government would like CSI condemned by the UN.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever good CSI does, however, slave redemption is not a
solution. Other groups have accused CSI of unintentionally fuelling
market demand for slaves by giving money to an oppressive regime.
In 1829, David Walker accused the American Colonization Society
(founded in 1817) of doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Like CSI, the ACS raised money to purchase slaves and send them
home. Although ACS freed nearly 2,000 slaves, they put cash into
the hands of slaveholders who, in turn, bought more. Slave
redemption does not work.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, Christian Solidarity International best serves
the slaves by working for peace and reconciliation in Sudan between
the Arab north and the black African south. We can be grateful to
them for witnessing to these atrocities while most of the world
looked away. As with Muslims in Bosnia, Americans can ill afford
silence when religion is used to serve oppression.
</P>
<P>
   As David Walker wrote 170 years ago, slavery threatens God's
``WHOLE human family.'' Americans should appeal to the United
Nations -- indeed the world -- to remember his ``Appeal.''

</P>
<P>
   In September 1829, a black American named David Walker published
his ``Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World.'' In it, he
condemned the ``inhuman system of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians credit him with inspiring Americans to greater
radicalism in abolishing slavery.
</P>
<P>
   True freedom, Walker claimed, ``shall never be fully
consummated'' until ``the entire emancipation of (the) enslaved
brethren all over the world'' is accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, Walker's appeal is as relevant today as it
was 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a United Nations committee is gathering to discuss
slavery. Not the slavery of David Walker's time, but slavery in
today's world, especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary slavery takes many forms-- forced prostitution and
sweatshops included. Few instances are as horrifying as Sudan's
slave trade, where women and children are sold as chattel.
</P>
<P>
   According to the human rights group Christian Solidarity
International (CSI), Sudanese slavery ``is not merely a fading
relic of the past, but has undergone a revival as a result of
encouragement from the ruling National Islamic Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the largely Muslim north has waged a civil war
against the Christian and animist south. When the government tried
to Islamize the south, the southern Sudanese rebelled, forming
their own army.
</P>
<P>
   During the last sixteen years, 2 million people have died from
either famine or violence.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this military campaign, northern ``defense'' forces
have reintroduced the ancient practice of slavery in Sudan. As
war-booty, tens of thousands of women and children have been sold
into bondage. Human rights advocates report widespread
brutalityincluding torture, sexual abuse,and genital
mutilationamong the slaves. In addition, the slaves ``are forced by
their masters to change their cultural identity and become
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   The western media has been largely silent regarding contemporary
slavery. For years, however, conservative Christian journalists
have covered this story, inspiring their co-religionists to take up
the anti-slavery cause. As a result, organizations such as
Christian Solidarity International and Christian Freedom
International have developed sizable programs to free the slaves
and press for international awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream media outlets may have hesitated to report African
slavery because of the pro-Christian and anti-Islamic polemics of
these organizations. That bias, however, does not change the fact
that the northern Sudanese,no matter what their religion, appear to
have deprived thousands of citizens of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the apparent atrocities, according to A.M. Rosenthal
of The New York Times, the United Nations is not meeting to condemn
the Sudanese government. Instead, it plans to discuss penalties

FINDING WORK IN A `KNOWLEDGE-BASED' WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Labor Day weekend was a good time to think
about all the lousy jobs we've had, especially for those of us
facing possible career changes.
</P>
<P>
   They don't make lousy jobs like they used to.
</P>
<P>
   I looked through the job ads last week and saw the demands of
our ``knowledge-based'' economy. Jobs called for knowledge of
mysterious things like Unix and HTML, as well as qualities like
being a ``self-starter'' and ``team player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-starter'' seems to mean there won't be many of you on the
team, at least to judge by all the things required in the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Webbies I know, my guess is that team members have to
self-start early in the morning 7 days a week, and not complain
about repetitive stress injury caused by cruddy keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through the want ads, I couldn't find anybody asking for
good old American qualities like ``willingness to follow arbitrary
and stupid orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity with ``Dilbert'' is assumed.
</P>
<P>
   There were only two ads for laborers, a job for which I have the
knowledge base, even though my muscle base has gone to pot. The ads
didn't ask for self-starters with shovels, but one had a typical
'90s demand, calling for a ``drug-free workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough job must be handing little paper cups to laborers
outside the Port-a-Potty.
</P>
<P>
   My first job, at age 17, was as a laborer in a mill, sweeping
the floor and getting high on cotton dust while swaying to the beat
of power looms. You can't get weave-room jobs anymore, unless your
inner child laborer tells you to move to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   My next three summer jobs taught me valuable life skills:
</P>
<P>
   _ As a gold miner, I learned not to stand near guys crimping
blasting caps with their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a seaman, I overcame a fear of heights by chipping paint
from the mast.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a cab driver, I learned how to terrify Boston drivers even
at rotaries.
</P>
<P>
   They were all great lousy jobs.
</P>
<P>
   There were no gold-mining or mast-climbing jobs listed in the
newspaper classifieds, but there was one ad for cabdrivers. It
didn't call for a knowledge base of San Francisco streets but,
amazingly, it called for a ``neat appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a notable thing about the new economy: The newspaper was
full of ads offering worthy but low-paying jobs for teachers and
teachers' aides, and restaurant workers of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms are overflowing and so are dining rooms. Kids have to
be taught to read specials-of-the-day to diners to keep the Bay
Area economy booming. And there are many hard vocabulary words,
like ``foie gras,'' ``tiramisu'' and ``I wouldn't recommend that.''
</P>
<P>
   People can combine teaching and waiting on tables to make maybe
half the rent they need to live in the Bay Area. Think of the
psychic rewards of dealing with both kids and adults who treat you
like a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   I've had plenty of experience in both education and
food-service, as it's called in places where you don't want to
serve the food, much less eat it.
</P>
<P>
   In a fancy hotel kitchen I was forced to boil rotten chickens to
make chicken salad. I have the skills it takes to be a team player
in food service, and the stomach to patrol school cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teaching jobs called for computer skills and
teaching credentials, however. There wasn't anything about
knowledge of English, mathematics or history.
</P>
<P>
   Schools seem to want people who have sat through awful courses
on educational ``methodology,'' a word that should be red-penciled
for suggesting that an art is a science.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not bitter. I looked at ads for teachers' aides, where I
started in the education business 30 years ago. I saw the words
``supportive environment'' and knew what was coming: ``$9 per
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   That means about $300 a week before taxes to learn, on the job,
the methodology of keeping Johnny from crayoning walls.
</P>
<P>
   In my day, you only saw ads for busboys and dishwashers. All the
good jobs as waiters and bartenders were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the classifieds are crammed with ads for such skill
positions as head cooks, sous chefs, pastry chefs, line cooks,
managers, ``host(esses),'' ``servers'' and even ``barista.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I see what jobs are available, I'm glad I can't afford
to dine out at all the great restaurants. I wouldn't want to eat in
a place that would hire me to work in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But I was one heck of a good bartender. All that separates a
columnist from a bartender is a foot of varnished wood.

CREATIONISM VS. EVOLUTION: SEPARATE AND NOT EQUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL MECHANIC  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ For years, with little success, Christian
fundamentalists have used pseudoscience to argue that creationism
should be reinstated as part of the public school science
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Thwarted by the courts, they have embarked on a new tack: If the
Bible must go, then so must Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   First it was warning stickers like those on Alabama science
texts proclaiming that evolution is an unproven belief and ``should
be considered a theory.'' Then, recently, Steve Abrams, a
creationist member of the Kansas Board of Education, moved to
delete references to macroevolution from that state's science
curriculum, arguing that it, like the Biblical creation, is
``unproven.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in an embarrassing affront to established science,
the Kansas board voted to no longer test children's knowledge of
evolution in statewide standardized tests. Although teachers may
still address the subject in class, the absence of testing on
evolution will make it a low teaching priority.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, lawsuits to quash this action are in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   The board, whose members have no scientific training, has
succeeded in publicly dismissing long-established theories of
evolution that are accepted by nearly every scientist on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-numbing,'' says Ned Johnson, a professor of
integrative biology at the University of California at Berkeley who
specializes in the evolution of birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence for evolution is so overwhelming in every last
detail that it is severely retrogressive to deny its existence. I'm
really flabbergasted that this kind of thing could happen as we
approach the millennium. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledges that there are missing pieces to the puzzle
of how humans evolved from other species, but evolution from one
species to another is clearly demonstrable from the fossil record
and the powerful new dating techniques used to interpret it.
</P>
<P>
   Microevolution, a phenomenon even the Kansas board couldn't
discount, is used literally every day in science labs around the
country as the basis for experiments in molecular genetics.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, scientists can put selective pressures on
populations of fruit flies that will, over several generations,
lead to adaptive changes in the flies that are reflected in the
flies' DNA. Such changes can be observed in a variety of species _
from humans to moths, plants to bacteria _ both in the lab and in
the wild, where we can watch animal and insect populations evolve
to blend into their surroundings, making them less susceptible to
predators.
</P>
<P>
   The classic human case is the prevalence of the mutant gene that
causes sickle-cell anemia in areas where malaria is a major killer.
Sickle cell is common in these areas because carriers of a single
copy of the gene are protected from malaria, making them more
likely to survive to have children. It's the classic example of
Darwinian evolution _ a mutation that helps an individual adapt and
survive to reproduce under a given set of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time the fundamentalists have
misinterpreted science. Creation proponents have long used a flimsy
argument based on the second law of thermodynamics to support the
idea of a supreme creator. This physical law says that, absent the
input of energy from the outside, all natural systems will proceed
toward a state of increasing disorder, or entropy.
</P>
<P>
   If you drop an egg, for instance, it'll break (increasing
disorder). But you can wait for a million years, and the egg will
never come together again.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful argue that creation of a human from raw materials _
molecules from air, water, and food _ proceeds from disorder to
order, violating the inscrutable second law. Clearly, they say,
this is due to the hand of The Creator.
</P>
<P>
   But any physics or chemistry student could render that argument
nonsense. This law applies to the overall system, not merely the
growing human body. During the apparent procession from chaos to
order, the system is actually becoming more chaotic. Energy is
expended to break down food, to convert it into usable building
blocks and to propel biochemical reactions; heat liberated from
chemical processes is expelled to the exterior; waste products are
released. No natural laws are being violated here.
</P>
<P>
   What the creationists don't seem to grasp is that there really
isn't competition between creation and evolution, nor do they
preclude one another. Creationism is a matter of faith; it cannot
be proven.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, on the other hand, is provable as a matter of fact,
based on what human beings construe as fact. If an all-powerful
being created the universe, this creator also devised the process
of evolution, or at least created an unassailable body of evidence
that supports it, perhaps even as a test to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   But if we allow such politicization of science to prevail, and
let other fundamentalist school board members discount sound
science and adopt retrogressive tactics to promote their own
religious beliefs, we might as well eliminate science from the
curriculum entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For if we discount fact in favor of faith, we will be no longer
have any rational basis to distinguish truth from falsehood.

MUSIC VIDEO TAKES MEDIUM INTO NEW REALM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In this age of post-music MTV, one seldom looks to
music videos for compelling visuals. But based on what has been
shown at a couple of primo special-effects gatherings, one good
place to look for cutting-edge special effects is the work of
Bjork, the quirky Icelandic sylph of a singer.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``All Is Full of Love'' video, which languorously ends in a
lesbian robot embrace, was one of about 50 computer-generated
shorts showcased at the SIGGRAPH convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork's face was superimposed seamlessly onto the head of one
robot, moving sinuously through the futuristic scene.
</P>
<P>
   And Bjork's ``Hunter'' video, showing her head twitchingly
transforming into a cyberbear, was one of the more striking tidbits
that special-effects wizards showed at a recent American Film
Institute salon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hunter'' shoot was a major headache for the visual-effects
gurus from Digital Domain (James Cameron's firm) who created it.
Bjork insisted that a) she would appear bald and b) that she
wouldn't shave her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup couldn't hide the forehead seam left by the skin cap she
wore, especially given the close-up shots and her snakily moving
head.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they had to digitally erase the problem in every single
frame of video during post-production. It took weeks to clean up
footage that only lasts a few minutes. But the results are
fabulous. &QL;

NET NOTES
</P>
<P>
   Among the many companies launching a splashy new enterprise on
Thursday's 9/9/99 date is Spike Radio, the latest creation of one
of the Net's more intriguing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the view that, in the youth-oriented space we're
targeting, we need to be trend-setting, taste-making. And the live
component is crucial,'' said Spike CEO Chris O'Hanlon. ``Actions
that are provoked by on-air content, the ability to communicate
live with the audience, these are paradigms that haven't been
explored by the new media.''
</P>
<P>
   What O'Hanlon _ a blunt, blocky Australian with an entertaining
take on the Web _ means is that most Internet ``radio'' is either
human-free digital music (think Spinner.com) or a straight feed of
what's playing on some broadcast station (say, KCRW-FM).
</P>
<P>
   Spike tries to be more like broadcast, but freed of over-the-air
limitations. The station's prime attraction is its 27 DJs (O'Hanlon
calls them ``iJays''), drawn from Los Angeles' techno scene, with
guest jocks from London and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think not enough attention is paid to the live experience
in the Internet experience,'' O'Hanlon said. ``The
unpredictability, the surprise is something even the best Web site
can't produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The DJs play a lot of stuff you won't hear elsewhere (except
maybe in those clubs), some of it with language and attitudes
you'll never hear on broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone would argue that the best DJs aren't
performers,'' O'Hanlon said. ``They're really able to perform in
many ways like they are in clubs. When it's at its best, it has the
immersive experience of the Web but also has the best of the club
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In listening to the site over several evenings, I've found it
wonderfully challenging and engaging. That's particularly so
because sometimes what the DJs choose just doesn't work, as
O'Hanlon freely admits.
</P>
<P>
   Spike's first stab at a stand-alone player has flaws, but
O'Hanlon promises it will be replaced on Launch Day with a more
robust application that allows chat, access to archives and more.
You can also listen by pointing your browser to www.spikeradio.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Landmark Theaters is celebrating its 25th anniversary with an
online poll of people's favorite foreign films at
www.LandmarkTheaters.com.
</P>
<P>
   Pick through a list of 600 films (plus any write-ins) that were
not made in the United States or in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   It has way too many worthy films to make choosing just five
submissions easy, especially given my own weaknesses for Kurosawa,
Kieslowski, Godard, and Claude Berri's magnificent ``Jean de
Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want a quick primer on the best the world has to
offer, take the list to a site such as the All-Movie Guide
(www.allmovies.com) and start studying up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Duffy, himself a quadriplegic, has set up a terrific Web
site to help the disabled and elderly find home health-care workers
and vice versa. Both the workers and the employer can place their
ads for free on the site (at www.pca-hha.com), which emphasizes
that it exists to help connect people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mothers Day. Fathers Day. Secretaries Day. National Techies
Day?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't quite roll off the tongue, but CNET, techies.com, FedEx,
Compaq and others want to honor our favorite technofreaks with a
day of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This national event ... is intended not only to recognize the
important contributions tech professionals make to all of our
lives, but to bring attention to the pressing need for educational
programs that interest young people in seeking tech jobs and offer
them the specialized training they need to prepare for tech
careers,'' wrote CNET CEO Halsey Minor in an e-mail.
</P>

to www.techiesday.org for activity packs to get your company and
city involved. &QL;

FALCONS HEAD COACH KNOWS FIRSTHAND ABOUT HEART DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves knew the burning
sensation in his chest and racing heartbeat could mean trouble, but
he figured he'd work through the discomfort and get it checked out
at the end of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   All his life he'd conquered problems by sheer will _ a
philosophy that carried him to eight Super Bowls as player and
coach and helped him win more games than any other coach in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   This time that attitude nearly got him killed.
</P>
<P>
   The burning sensation was his body's warning that he had
advanced heart disease. In the end, Reeves did the right thing. He
mentioned the pain to a team doctor after a Dec. 13 game in New
Orleans. The doctor insisted on an immediate exam, and the disease
was found before a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had blockage of 95 percent in two arteries and almost 100
percent in another one,'' Reeves said. ``That was a heart attack
waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery in
Atlanta. True to form, the tough coach was back on the sidelines in
only four weeks _ leading the Falcons to his ninth NFL championship
game, Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   The near miss also gave Reeves a new philosophy on life.
</P>
<P>
   As he works to get the Falcons into shape for the 1999 season,
Reeves also is concentrating on controlling stress, eating right,
exercising and keeping close tabs on his cholesterol levels _
leading by example in the fight against cardiovascular diseases,
America's No. 1 killer. The American Heart Association estimates
diseases of the heart kill more than 959,000 Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you feel like you're getting ready to put a
tombstone over your head, or your life could be just starting,''
Reeves said of his close call. ``This is like a second lease on
life. I've still got the heart disease. It's still in me. They've
just bypassed it. I've got to do something to change it: exercise,
diet and medication _ and hope to try to handle stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who'd had problems with high cholesterol and some
blockage in his arteries back in 1990, was surprised at what he
didn't know about heart disease. He knew he should be watching his
cholesterol, but it turns out the information he had was badly
outdated. It's a common problem, and it inspired the 54-year-old
coach to spend his off-season touring the country and talking about
the dangers of high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a crash course in cholesterol basics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) _ also known as ``bad''
cholesterol _ can build up on artery walls, causing plaque that
hampers the body's ability to transport blood. Reduced blood flow
can cause a heart attack or a stroke. LDL cholesterol levels should
be kept at no more than 100 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter) for
people with diagnosed heart disease and 160 mg/dl for people with
few or no heart disease risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   _ High-density lipoprotein (HDL) _ or ``good'' cholesterol _
cleans dangerous fats out of the bloodstream. Doctors say everyone
should shoot for an HDL cholesterol level greater than 35 mg/dL.
</P>
<P>
   Many people watch their total cholesterol _ a combination of LDL
and HDL _ but doctors now say it's best to keep track of both good
and bad individually because it gives a clearer picture of what's
going on inside the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling cholesterol is simple _ in theory anyway. It comes
down to a healthy diet and regular exercise, a medical litany many
Americans continue to ignore despite the risks. In fact, Americans
can add up to 10 years to their life expectancy simply by avoiding
fatty foods (such as red meat, fried foods, avocados, gravy and
butter) and boosting their heart rates with 45 minutes of exercise
a few days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even doctors aren't getting the cholesterol message.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. P.K. Shah, director of the division of cardiology at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said many doctors
aren't up to date on the latest research, especially concerning the
benefits of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Shah said research
conducted in the last five years shows the drugs can be lifesavers
for patients who can't or won't control cholesterol through diet
and exercise. But not everyone is getting the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the problem,'' Shah said. ``Of all the patients in this
country that could benefit from cholesterol-lowering medications,
less than a third are actually receiving them. Of those that are
receiving them, less than half are receiving them in enough
quantities to bring their cholesterol down to a target level. There
is a huge gap. And this gap is what we're trying to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedars-Sinai has tripled its use of cholesterol-lowering
medications in the last year and is working with Reeves and Merck &AMP;
Co. pharmaceuticals to spread the word on a national level. Their
program focuses on cholesterol because it is the most common risk
factor in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said while doctors should be up to date on research,
patients shouldn't count on someone else to watch out for their
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to recognize, a doctor has many patients, but a
patient has only one body to worry about,'' Shah said. ``They
really need to take some responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves agreed. He moved three times in the last decade _ from
coaching the Denver Broncos to the New York Giants and then to
Atlanta to coach the Falcons _ and changed doctors each time. He
got regular checkups but didn't ask about cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to keep up to date,'' Reeves said. ``If you've
ever had a heart problem, or you have some of those risk factors _
if someone in your family has had it, you have diabetes, or smoke
or have high cholesterol _ get checked out. Know what the latest
research tells you about heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at it, over 300,000 people a year die from heart
attacks,'' he added. ``It's a silent killer. They didn't know what
the symptoms were or it was the first time they had the symptoms
and all of a sudden they're gone.'' &QL;

   The American Heart Association says cardiovascular diseases kill
one person every 33 seconds in the United States. Coronary heart
disease accounts for half of those deaths. Many never even knew
they had a problem. Here are some questions to ask your doctor:
</P>
<P>
   _ Am I at risk for heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   _ What is my total cholesterol level? What is my good (HDL) and
bad (LDL) cholesterol level?
</P>
<P>
   _ What are my cholesterol goals? LDL? HDL? Total?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should I be taking medication?
</P>
<P>
   _ What can you tell me about the latest research? If you don't
understand the answers or the doctor won't answer the questions to
your satisfaction, don't be afraid to talk to another doctor.
</P>
<P>

APPLE LAWSUIT TARGETS A SPIFFY MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc., which once sued the
Microsoft Corp. for allegedly stealing the ``look and feel'' of the
seminal Macintosh, is now suing a company that recently introduced
an iMac look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged culprit is eMachines Inc. of Irvine, Calif., which
recently introduced the eOne that uses Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, accuses
eMachines of ``illegally copying the industrial design of Apple's
award-winning iMac computer.'' The lawsuit also seeks to enjoin
eMachines from distributing the eOne and seeks actual and punitive
damages resulting from such illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unlimited number of designs that eMachines could
have created for their computers, but instead they chose to copy
Apple's designs,'' Steve Jobs, the interim chief executive of
Apple, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pattie Adams, a spokeswoman for eMachines, said: ``The eOne was
not designed to be a clone of the iMac. It's all-in-one, it's
translucent and it's blue. Other than that, it's an entirely
different system.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac and the eOne both are all-in-one machines with their
silicon innards and monitors contained in a single, plastic shell.
In other words, no separate tower comes with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by a 433-MHz Celeron chip (with a 128-kilobyte cache)
and sporting 64 megabytes of RAM, the eOne has a retail price of
$799, after a mail-in rebate. The company has an exclusive sales
deal with Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the iMac, the eOne offers plug-and-play accessibility.
It took me less than 10 minutes to pull it from the box, plug in
the keyboard and mouse and to start up.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne comes equipped with plenty of features, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A front-loading 24x CD player that will play music whether or
not the computer is running
</P>
<P>
   _ Built-in stereo speakers
</P>
<P>
   _ A 56K modem
</P>
<P>
   _ A 15-inch monitor with 1024-by-768 resolution and a dot pitch
of .28
</P>
<P>
   _ A 3.5 floppy drive
</P>
<P>
   _ An 8-megabyte advanced graphics AGI board
</P>
<P>
   _ An Ethernet port for networking purposes
</P>
<P>
   _ Video and audio in/out cables that let you watch TV on the
monitor
</P>
<P>
   _ An ATI board for video editing.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner, weighing in at 38.1 pounds, the iMac has
won rave reviews for its groundbreaking industrial design and
technical performance since its introduction in August 1998. The
company upgraded the machines in early 1999, leaving it with the
following specs:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 333-MHz PowerPC G3 processor
</P>
<P>
   _ An internal, 6-gig hard drive
</P>
<P>
   _ Two high-speed, USB ports
</P>
<P>
   _ A 15-inch, .28 dot pitch monitor
</P>
<P>
   _ Two built-in speakers
</P>
<P>
   _ An ATI Rage Pro Turbo graphics controller
</P>
<P>
   _ Tons of killer Apple software.
</P>
<P>
   Among the iMac's prime selling points are its cool colors:
strawberry, lime, tangerine, grape or blueberry. It costs $1,199.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to peripherals, the eOne actually offers more
flexibility than the iMac. While the iMac exclusively uses
universal serial bus (USB) technology to connect such things as
printers and scanners, the eOne comes equipped with two USB ports
(one on the front of the machine) as well as standard parallel
ports for extras such as hand-held organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The eOne has a nifty game/MIDI port so gamers can plug in their
joysticks, game pads, steering wheels and other goofy extras.
</P>
<P>
   The peripheral connections are all easily accessible on the
right side of the eOne. In other words, no blind groping behind
your computer when you're trying to plug in the printer.
</P>
<P>
   All-in-all, it's one of the best sub-$1,000 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The only real negatives with the eOne are common to all-in-one
computers. Basically, with the hard drive and monitor confined in
one box, if one goes kaput you're out of luck. Why? If you open the
case, eMachines' warranty is void. Of course, you can always send
the whole thing in to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The other big question is: Will eMachines be able to weather
Apple's legal barrage? The experts are not too worried about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All-in-one's have been around for a long time,'' said Stephen
Baker of PC Data, a market research firm in Reston, Va. ``To me,
all they've done is create an all-in-one and add color. I'm not
sure how that infringes on Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spadaccini, independent trademark business lawyer based
in San Francisco, questions whether Apple will be able to convince
a judge that eMachines has infringed on its ``trade dress,'' or
look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to prove a likelihood of confusion between the
primary user (the claimant) and the secondary user (the alleged
infringer).
</P>
<P>
   ``People who buy computers research the various models
carefully,'' Spadaccini said. ``To prove likelihood of confusion,
it becomes very difficult when the buyers are very thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonplused by Apple's attack, eMachines announced recently that
it plans to raise as much as $200 million through an initial public
offering. EMachines is a joint venture funded by Korea's TriGem
Computer Inc. and Korea Data Systems America Inc. America Online
has also invested in the company and will own 8.7 percent of the
company's common shares before the offering.

POP COMPOSER HAS HIS CRITICS AND A MUSICAL THEATER HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: ``Today'' in factbox is Tuesday, Sept. 7  
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frank Wildhorn is used to tough critics, but
typically they don't scream and carry on quite this loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll betcha this is the first interview you've ever done from
a hospital room,'' says the musical composer, speaking by phone
from the upstate New York maternity ward where his wife,
singer-actress Linda Eder, gave birth last week to Jake Ryan
Wildhorn, a squawking bundle of inchoate desires with enough lung
power to fill a small Broadway house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Linda and (my) first (child),'' Wildhorn continues,
unperturbed by his son's atonal background interjections, ``and, as
always, it's a miracle and it reminds you of all the amazing and
wonderful possibilities in the world, you know? Which always brings
me back to the theater ...''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Broadway shows (BEGIN ITAL)are(END ITAL) sort of like
babies: Until they start walking around and making noise, you can't
be sure whether you've created a monster hit, or just a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn, whose frighteningly successful ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' opens
a two-week run tonight at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, would
know all about that.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the hottest composer in the American musical theater
right now, Wildhorn was a commercially successful pop tunesmith,
whose songs had been recorded by the likes of Whitney Houston and
Julie Andrews, when he seemed to come out of right field three
years ago with his first big show, ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's slim gothic novel about a
brilliant London physician whose backfiring medical experiments
turn him into a bestial alter ego, ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' is now in its
third year on Broadway after opening in New York to some murderous
reviews. The New York Times described it as a ``plastic monster
assembly kit of a musical,'' along with such other choice
adjectives as ``leaden'' and ``solemnly campy.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that point, ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' _ fresh off a pre-Broadway
national tour _ was already a cult phenomenon, with a score that
had sold some 250,000 copies. After originally developing the show
at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Wildhorn had overseen a recording
of ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' that was released months before its Broadway
debut.
</P>
<P>
   With a book and lyrics by Broadway and Hollywood journeyman
Leslie Bricusse (``Victor/Victoria''), ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' has
spawned the kind of musical-theater cult following usually reserved
for ``Les Miz'' and anything by Andrew Lloyd Webber (its most
passionate followers are known as ``Jeckies'').
</P>
<P>
   To Broadway audiences reared on Celine Dion and Garth Brooks
rather than Stephen Sondheim, Wildhorn has been a godsend, a young
(40) composer whose melodies traffic in larger-than-life emotions
and simple, catchy pop hooks. As evidence of the show's appeal, one
of its songs, ``This Is the Moment,'' was used at the Olympics, the
Miss America Pageant and the 1996 Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn makes no bones that he wants his songs to be
``accessible'' to large audiences. His own musical influences were
eclectic, he says, and he sees nothing wrong with writing show
tunes that acknowledge the existence of rock 'n' roll and
electronic instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to pin me down to one thing,'' says Wildhorn, a
native New Yorker who studied at the University of Southern
California. ``I always loved theater as much as I loved classical
music, as much as I loved jazz, or as much as I loved Eric Clapton.
I don't have any particular influence. It really is kind of the
rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   What first attracted him to musical theater, Wildhorn says, was
seeing the movie versions of ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``West
Side Story'' one weekend when he was 15 and home with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just when I was getting into music and writing and
all that stuff,'' he recalls. ``And in that 4{ hours of those two
movies back-to-back, again the possibilities seemed endless to me.
The musical vocabularies that you heard in those two movies go from
jazz to classical, from rock 'n' roll to Latin. And I just felt
that, `Wow, this is amazing.' If I had to pinpoint something, it
really was seeing (those movies) back-to-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn's decision to try writing a Broadway show himself
happily coincided with another blooming romance. When the composer
met his future second wife, in 1988, Linda Eder was wrapping up a
spectacular run on the national talent-show TV program ``Star
Search.'' A mutual friend who was a consultant on the show phoned
Wildhorn in Florida, where he was recording an album.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `There's a beautiful, tall girl who's literally off a
horse farm in Minnesota, and she keeps winning every week,' ''
Wildhorn recalls. ``And he said that she had a lot of pop in her
theater voice and a lot of theater in her pop voice. And he said,
`Frank, knowing your passions' _ because he knew obviously where I
was going _ he said, `I think you two should get together.' So we
did. That was 12 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Eder went on to star in her husband's work as Lucy, the
prostitute who brings out the animal in Jekyll-Hyde, winning strong
notices for her powerful voice and voluptuous stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely half a year later, Wildhorn opened a second musical,
``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' based on Baroness Orczy's tale of a
swashbuckling hero who rescues innocent victims of the Reign of
Terror from the guillotine. Again, the New York critics savaged the
show.
</P>
<P>
   But after ``Scarlet Pimpernel'' was stripped down and remounted
with different producers, several prominent scribes started
whistling a different tune, praising the revamped show's
lighthearted, operetta-like qualities.
</P>
<P>
   (``Scarlet Pimpernel'' will have its L.A. debut May 3 at the
Ahmanson Theatre.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Wildhorn's third musical, ``The Civil War,'' opened
last April, the pattern was well-established. Most critics trashed
it, and the show closed after two months with a loss estimated at
$8 million. But two CD recordings of the score _ one country-based,
the other gospel and r&AMP;b _ attracted such artists as Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish, Trisha Yearwood, Dr. John, Betty Buckley and Patti
LaBelle to perform cover versions.
</P>
<P>
   If Wildhorn minds the dual-faced treatment accorded his work,
he's not showing it. For now, it seems, the only voice that really
matters anyway is his son's high-pitched one, still going strong in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to a guy who, if you asked me what is my least
favorite quality in a human being, I would say bitterness,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just turned 40, so I still feel very much of a baby in this
game. But there are older-generation writers I've met, so many of
them are so bitter about going through the (show-biz) wars and
stuff, and I write it because I love to, and I write it because of
the joy that it is. And you fight to hold onto those idealistic
things. And if you can win those battles and hold onto it, I think
the quality of your life is a lot better.'' &QL;

`TIEMPO' ALBUM BEING CALLED YEAR'S BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In any conversation with politically aware salsa
star Ruben Blades, poetry is bound to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen when you least expect it, such as when Blades, who
is not only a musician but an actor and longtime social critic of
Latin American dictatorships, speaks of the end of his marriage
during the making of his cinematic new record, ``Tiempos,'' in
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard because so many emotional things were going
on,'' Blades admitted. ``I became aware of the impossibility of
developing from an emotional point of view. I was out of the house
for long periods of time. It was very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bird falls in love with a fish, where do they live? It
was one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The poetic image of birds and fish sparks the thought that
maybe, despite the surge of interest in all things Latino, Blades
and mainstream success might be star-crossed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Blades is the other side of the Latin explosion you've heard so
much about. He doesn't make summery dance-pop a la Ricky Martin and
has even less in common with frothy diva Jennifer Lopez. Instead,
Blades' carefully wrought, emotive music represents some of the
farthest places a Latin beat can be taken. And he's been doing it
for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Stone and other publications are calling ``Tiempos''
(Sony Tropical) the finest Latin-music album of the year. Often
dubbed ``the Latin Bruce Springsteen,'' Blades is one of the few
salsa stars to give his music a political edge.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Panama City and trained as a lawyer before moving to New
York and completing a master's degree in international law at
Harvard, Blades launched his own political party and ran for
president of Panama in 1994, placing third out of 27 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we created a party from scratch signaled a new
beginning for Panamanian politics,'' says Blades (pronounced either
``blades'' or ``blah-dess''). ``I always believed the point wasn't
to win but to create a party that was not nurtured by the left or
right, that was not built with money from special interests, and
was not an offspring of traditional political parties who've been
fighting for power since the country's inception.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades can sound suspiciously like a full-time politico with his
ability to communicate several sides of an issue, and he offers a
similar slant on the media's fixation with such contemporary Latin
stars as Martin and Lopez, who've scored chart-topping success with
danceable English-sung material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope it will lead people to explore the music,''
Blades, 51, said. ``The most important thing is the barriers are
falling, meaning commercial radio play and the inclusion of Latin
musicians in programs throughout the country, especially in places
that haven't played Latin music often. The success of these people
calls attention to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early and it all depends on the quality and
consistency of these artists. Maybe this type of music shouldn't be
considered Latin music at all but should instead be called urban
pop. There's a big difference between Buena Vista Social Club and
Los Van Van and what Lopez and Martin are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades appears Friday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood
along with the acclaimed Colombian band Bloque. Meanwhile, Spanish
network Telemundo has joined forces with MTV Latin America to
produce ``MTV en Telemundo,'' a weekend look at new Latin music. It
debuts at 11:30 p.m. Friday and 11 p.m. Saturday on
Spanish-language station KVEA-TV (Channel 52).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this (the Latin explosion) won't become one of
those hyped moments we've experienced in the past,'' Blades warns.
``We have to remember that (percussionist and band leader) Ray
Barretto went into the Top 40 in 1963 with `El Watusi' and Latin
music was very, very popular in the '40s and '50s. But what's
happening today is a lot of young people are coming into the mix.
It's all about consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades knows what he's talking about. As a member of Barretto's
band in the mid-'70s, he performed with salsa trombonist and
producer Willie Colon and the Fania All-Stars while writing for
other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Colon in 1978, Blades cut ``Siembra,'' the
biggest-selling salsa disc of all time. His critically acclaimed
1984 release, ``Buscando America'' (``Searching for America''),
featured songs dealing with the murder of a Salvadoran priest and
the ``disappeared'' of Latin American dictatorships. Blades also
spent time in the studio with Elvis Costello, Lou Reed and Sting.
</P>
<P>
   For the just-released ``Tiempos'' (``Time''), however, Blades
reinvented himself again, moving beyond salsa, the sizzling merger
of Cuban, Puerto Rican and big-band jazz born in the Latin barrios
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   For this moody, sometimes purely instrumental new sound, Blades,
who splits his time between New York and his native Panama,
traveled to Costa Rica to collaborate with the jazz group Editus on
pieces that resemble film music and classical composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these musicians are classically trained, the
instrumentation is very much the type that will provoke a return of
a memory,'' said Blades, who has roles in forthcoming films by Tim
Robbins and Billy Bob Thornton. ``It's emotional music. It's not
just an album to address with your feet, but a very intimate
experience. I think it's got the passion you find in Afro-Cuban
music, but the introspection and inner exploration you find in
classical and jazz. I've had real salsa fans listen to the record
and two people told me they weren't sad but felt like crying and
didn't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with music, Blades has a successful film acting career
that includes ``City of Angels,'' ``The Milagro Beanfield War,''
``Mo' Better Blues'' and ``Crossover Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Latino to win an ACE (Award for Cable Excellence)
award for his portrayal of a death-row inmate in ``Dead Man Out,''
Blades composed music for Sidney Lumet's ``Q &AMP; A.''
</P>
<P>
   The artistic success of ``Tiempos'' has sparked Blades to
consider exploring other international sounds in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very interested in the influence of European culture
on popular music,'' he said. ``I want to introduce bagpipes, more
accordion and violin. These are European instruments, but I want to
use them in an Afro-Cuban context. And, of course, we can record
anywhere now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planet is becoming more proficient in terms of technology,
so we can make music with something to offer anywhere in the world
and the product can be competitive. That's called progress.'' &QL;

ON IMPEACHMENT ISSUE, A BIPARTISAN PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's been only six months. But the impeachment
trial of President Clinton might as well have been six years ago,
if the fledgling congressional campaigns for next year's elections
are any sign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gleeful predictions from Democrats this year that
Republicans could lose their majority control of the House on the
strength of anti-impeachment sentiments, the issue has all but
disappeared. Democrats have backed off plans to campaign against
Republicans on their role in impeachment. In the halls of Congress,
the word ``impeachment'' is rarely uttered.
</P>
<P>
   Even in congressional districts where impeachment seemed like an
obvious campaign touchstone, Democrats appear to be willing to
mention the issue only subtly. In Florida, a Democratic candidate,
Lori Edwards, hasn't mentioned impeachment in her campaign, and
says people are ``sick of hearing about it'' _ even though the
departing incumbent, Representative Charles T. Canady, was a
Republican House manager during the president's Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, Adam Schiff, who is challenging
Representative James E. Rogan, says he wants ``to focus on local
needs'' rather than concentrate on Rogan's record as a House
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Rogan is in trouble for reasons that have nothing to do
with impeachment,'' said Schiff, a California state senator. ``I
think a lot of people are unhappy that Jim Rogan has ignored the
district for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' he added, ``I think'' impeachment will be raised
``more in the context of people saying, `We want a representative
who is more focused on the quality of life in our schools and
neighborhoods than on engaging in partisan politics.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the elections for all 435 House seats and 33 of the
Senate's 100 seats are still more than a year away. Political
analysts warn that as time passes, a Democratic candidate suffering
in the polls might decide to zero in on controversial elements of
an opponent's record, including impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Several strategists also caution that the issue will vary widely
from district to district. Regions where voters largely agreed on
impeaching the president are unlikely to hear about it at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential race, candidates from both parties have
restricted themselves mostly to veiled allusions to Clinton's
impeachment or to the sex scandal involving the White House intern,
Monica S. Lewinsky. Both Democratic candidates are implying that
Republicans are out of touch with the voters, and several
Republicans are focusing on ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   But at both the presidential and congressional levels,
impeachment is loaded with negative meaning for both parties,
strategists said. Vice President Al Gore has made a tremendous
effort to distance himself from the president, and the leading
Republican candidate, George W. Bush, has portrayed himself as a
centrist, implicitly distancing himself from the more conservative
Republicans who drove the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   According to several Democratic strategists, neither the
Democrats who supported Clinton nor the Republicans who voted to
impeach him escaped the ordeal untainted, making it a tricky issue
for either side to capitalize on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll, for example, found that
among Democrats, Gore's loyalty to Clinton throughout the
impeachment process would make 29 percent more likely to vote for
Gore and 21 percent less likely to do so. The survey had a margin
of error of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment story is ``Saturday's news,'' said Michael
Goldman, a Boston-based strategist now working on behalf of a
Democratic presidential candidate, former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley. ``To the degree that people are angry about it and
remember it, you've got them anyway. The other people, you're going
to win them or lose them on much bigger issues _ guns, health care,
and Social Security. And that's the mantra the Democrats need to
use. They need to stay on message.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, which raises money to get Democrats elected to
the House, disagreed. ``I think impeachment is a viable argument to
make as one element in part of a much larger argument, which is
that this Congress is under extremist leadership. You see that
whether it's cutting Medicare or shutting down the government or
impeaching the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the approach Schiff is taking in California for the seat
that includes suburban Glendale, Burbank, and Pasadena, where the
race is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is not being completely ignored. Both Schiff and
Rogan have reminded voters of it in direct-mail campaigns, and they
have discussed their opposing stances on impeachment in interviews
practically since the trial ended in February.
</P>
<P>
   In a fund-raising letter, Rogan raised the specter of
impeachment by asking potential donors: ``Are we going to let them
get away with it? . . . Am I going to fight this battle against
Bill Clinton alone?''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Schiff nor Rogan says he he is raising the
impeachment issue; each says he is merely responding to remarks
made by the other. Schiff, in a telephone interview, said
impeachment is part of the campaign because ``Jim Rogan has been
championing it as the only reason to support his reelection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it's a poor issue for him to run on, since
the vast majority of our constituents did not support
impeachment,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan aides insist that Schiff is the driving force behind any
discussion of impeachment. Anyway, said Rogan's campaign manager,
Jason Roe, ``it is not an issue people are going to vote on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to run on issues in the district, without needing
to mention impeachment,'' Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides also point out that Rogan won reelection in November 1998,
right in the middle of the House impeachment process. And that
could be one reason that impeachment ultimately fades on the
campaign trail nationwide. House members weathered the impeachment
storm in last year's elections; there was a net loss of five seats
for the Republicans, who still managed to retain control of the
House. In many cases, though, GOP members won support from voters
in favor of Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where the atmosphere during the impeachment trial
was far more subdued than in the House and where the entire process
ended with Clinton's acquittal, Democrats seem uninterested in
trying to play up the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt you'll see any ads about impeachment per se,'' said
Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee. ``Political impressions are built brick by
brick, and as evidence of Republicans being vindictive and partisan
and out of touch,'' impeachment ``is the keystone . . . But I
haven't seen any campaign plans or message plans that say, `Topic A
is to discuss so-and-so's stance on impeachment.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And in Florida, where two of the House managers are vacating
their House seats, Democratic candidates say they would rather not
mention impeachment at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the district where the Republican incumbent, Bill McCollum,
is leaving his seat to run for the Senate, Linda Chapin, his
Democratic rival, has left the impeachment issue untouched. Chapin,
a former chairman of the Orange County Democrats, is focusing on
``health care, education, business development, the economy,''
according to her campaign manager, Terry Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is something that really isn't on people's minds
anymore,'' Beckett said. ``Either they have bad feelings about the
Republicans in the House of Representatives, or they don't. But I
think it's gone below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing was Edwards, the Democratic candidate for the Florida
seat that Canady is vacating because of his term-limits pledge:
``People aren't talking about it. It's history now.''

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard and Motorola have recommended it to their
customers. At McKinsey &AMP; Co., it turned up last month on a list of
the four most-frequently ordered books. The second edition quickly
sold out its first 10,000 copies last summer; now it is riding high
at about 500th place on the Amazon.com list of bestsellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essential Guide to Telecommunications'' is not exactly
bedside reading. But it has catapulted a Massachusetts woman into
prominence among authorities on the industrial organization of the
digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And it illustrates a comforting fact about the modern world: It
is still possible for a hard-working, plain-spoken reporter to
produce a supremely lucid overview of an industry in an advance
state of turmoil. To a sufficiently disciplined inquiring mind,
apparently there are answers for every question _ and more pointed
questions for every answer.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a reconnaissance that started out little more than a
decade ago as a course on voice mail at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Annabel Z. Dodd was fledgling consultant then, New England
Telephone-trained, with eight years behind her as
telecommunications manager for Dennison Manufacturing Co. In the
mid-1970s at Simmons College, with three school-age daughters at
home, she had retooled as an MBA. Now she was ready to strike out
on her own.
</P>
<P>
   A one-page newsletter sent regularly to a couple hundred clients
served Dodd as a marketing tool. (You can see for yourself at
www.doddontheline.com.) The NU course _ it produced a certificate,
not credit for a degree _ kept her attentive to changing demand.
</P>
<P>
   When voice mail technology became widely understood, for
example, she moved up to teaching data communications. ``I learned
what people want to know at Northeastern,'' she says. ``I would
say, `OK, list all the words you want to understand.' '' The number
of words was proliferating rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, an editor who had seen her newsletter asked
whether she wanted to write a book. Michael Meehan of Prentice Hall
PTR figured there was a place for a comprehensive nontechnical book
about telecommunications for a business audience. He commissioned
the book and Dodd produced it _ 18 months late, but clear as the
sound of one of those Sprint pins.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or two, ``The Essential Guide'' had become a
runaway success.
</P>
<P>
   The second edition goes well beyond the first. It still begins
with the basics _ the differences between analog and digital
signals, the meaning of bauds, bits, bytes, and codes, significance
of bandwith, of protocols and architectures. Compression and
multiplexing are explained. LANs, MANs, and WANS (local-, wide- and
metropolitan-area networks) are sorted out. Various sorts of
switching apparatus are described.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dodd traces the evolution of the industry: the Bell System
before and after 1984; the strange twilight of local competition
that unfolded in the dozen years after divestiture; the complicated
consequences of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (It helps that Dodd remains in close touch with the staff of US
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts and
principal architect of the telecommunications act. She never sinks
to sycophancy, though; she still has to talk to all those
companies. Markey, in turn, lauds the Framingham woman for ``having
cogently untangled the wires and switches and technobabble'' of the
digital revolution.)
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the book is its second half: a matter-of-fact tour
of the various advanced technologies _ frame relay, anyone? or
asyncronous transfer mode? _ that are changing present-day
telephony faster than citizens' ability to understand it, along
with surveys of the Internet and various wireless services that are
also driving the nearly mystical ``convergence'' of these traffic
types.
</P>
<P>
   So if you wondered, as I did, what it might have meant for
Bernard Schwartz's Globalstar when Motorola's Iridium project filed
for bankruptcy last month; or what exactly it is that a ``cookie''
or a ``bluetooth'' does; or whatever happened to Gopher and Archie,
it's all here. With jargon-free definitions, clear schematic
drawings, and its steady narrative drive, ``The Essential Guide to
Telecommunications'' is reassuring testament to the human ability
to comprehend and communicate at some fundamental level even the
most bewildering technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now if someone will just do the same for the American health
care system.

UNPARDONABLE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a time, the bombs seemed to explode without letup.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, they bombed Marshall Fields, Bonwit-Teller, the
police headquarters, the Holiday Inn on Lake Shore Drive, the
Merchandise Mart, the County Building, a military recruiting
center, the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, and the Standard Oil
of Indiana building. They even bombed the Woodfield Mall in
suburban Schaumburg. ``Capitalists understand it more,'' the
terrorists said, ``when they feel it in their pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, they blasted the Gulf &AMP; Western Building and the
Chrysler Building. On Jan. 24, 1975, one of their bombs tore
through the Fraunces Tavern in the heart of the city's financial
district. Windows shattered, stairs collapsed, blood spewed
everywhere. Four diners were murdered, 57 others were wounded. They
bombed Mobil's offices on East 42d Street, fatally driving shards
of glass into a young newlywed named Charles Steinberg. Three
officers were maimed for life when a bomb exploded at the New York
City police headquarters on New Year's Eve, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the 16 Puerto Rican terrorists whose sentences Bill
Clinton has offered to commute were responsible, along with their
comrades, for some 130 bombing attacks between 1974 and 1983. At
least six people were killed and more than 80 were wounded in those
attacks, and property owners sustained millions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   And that only covers the violence they unleashed within the
United States. In Puerto Rico itself, they wrought even more bloody
mayhem, beginning with the murder of a police officer in 1978. In
December 1979, they ambushed a Navy vehicle in Sabana Seca, killing
two of the 17 passengers and badly wounding nine. In January 1981,
they bombed the Air National Guard base in Carolina and destroyed
nine fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   And all this savagery was committed in the name of Puerto Rican
independence, a cause that the overwhelming majority of Puerto
Rico's people have rejected for decades. In a 1993 plebiscite on
Puerto Rico's future, only 4.4 percent of the voters favored
independence. In another plebiscite last winter, the independence
vote was even more insignificant _ barely 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread assumption that Clinton's offer to pardon
the Puerto Ricans is designed to advance his wife's expected Senate
candidacy in New York. Will anyone be surprised if this suspicion
turns out to be true? All the same, a host of worthies have
petitioned for the terrorists' release, among them Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, Coretta Scott King, Cardinal John O'Connor, and
several members of Congress. Their strongest argument is that the
prison terms to which the 16 were sentenced _ some of them were
given more than 60 years _ are out of proportion to their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that none of these terrorists was convicted of
murder. But that doesn't mean they weren't guilty of murder. The
killings they were tied to were not federal crimes in the '70s and
'80s, says Carlos Romero-Barcelo, the former governor of Puerto
Rico, who now represents the island in Congress, so trying them for
murder (in federal court) wasn't an option. Instead they were tried
on lesser charges: seditious conspiracy, interstate transportation
of firearms with criminal intent, armed robbery, conspiracy to
create bombs. But the judges and juries were not deceived about the
true scope of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King, Cardinal O'Connor, and the others can be
forgiven for not being aware of that legal nicety. But what excuse
can they offer for having more compassion for the terrorists than
for their victims? And what possible explanation can they make for
demanding not only that Clinton release them, but that he do so
unconditionally?
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson says the terms of the president's commutation
offer are ``humiliating.'' What are those terms? That the prisoners
sign a statement renouncing violence and that they not associate
with other criminals. So far, none of the 16 has agreed to those
trifling stipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposed clemency deal is indeed humiliating, but not
to the Puerto Rican terrorists. No: It is a slap in the face to the
widows and children of the men these butchers killed. It is a
stinging insult to those whose bodies were permanently mangled by
the bombs these sociopaths set off.
</P>
<P>
   US representative Louis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, is
among those demanding that the prisoners be released with no
strings attached. ``They've done hard time,'' he says. ``They are
serving what is in effect a life sentence . . . and a life sentence
is unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez ought to look Anthony Senft in the eye and say that.
One eye is all Senft had left after the 1982 New Year's Eve
explosion at the New York police headquarters. ``I have a life
sentence,'' Senft says. His fellow officer, Salvatore Pastorella,
has a life sentence, too: He was blinded in both eyes and lost the
fingers on his right hand. A third cop, Rocco Pascarella, had to
have his right leg amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Where is their clemency? Where is the clemency for Joe and
Thomas Connor, whose father was murdered when the Fraunces Tavern
was bombed in 1975. ``Not a day passes without our feeling the void
left in our lives,'' they wrote last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton can bring the victims' punishment to an end, it
will be time to talk about letting the terrorists walk. Until that
day comes, they can rot in their cells.

HOW OFTEN DO CHICKENS LAY EGGS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do chickens really lay an egg every day?
</P>
<P>
   D.D., Norfolk, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Just about. They average an egg every 25 hours. The average
laying hen produces 250 eggs a year.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know which came first, the chicken or the egg, but we
do know the first step in the egg-making process. The hen is born
with a supply of 3,000 or so ova. When she reaches chicken puberty
at about 20 weeks, one at a time each ovum develops into a fully
grown yolk. It grows in the ovary inside a little sac which feeds
the developing ovum.
</P>
<P>
   When the sac breaks, the yolk drops into the oviduct where the
albumen, the egg white, grows around the yolk. When that's done the
albumen-yolk drops further down, where two shell membranes grow
around it. That's not the hard shell yet. The membranes are the
thin transparent skin just inside the shell.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 5 or 6 hours to get to this point. Then the hen coats
the membranes with a protein matrix, like the grid of reinforcing
steel rods they lay in cement. Over the next 18 hours or so calcium
chloride builds up in layers around that protein matrix and the
shell forms.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about 25 hours after the process started, the hen lays
the finished product, gives a little cluck, waits 15 to 30 minutes,
and goes back to work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do chickens get fertility drugs to enhance egg laying. If
not, why are we seeing more eggs with double yolks?
</P>
<P>
   Ames, Iowa &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Chickens get a diet of corn and soy, and a few vitamins, but
no fertility-enhancing hormones, according to the American Egg
Board. Their diet is enhanced only with food containing
xanthophyll, a yellowish pigment, to give the yolk a consistent
color. Sometimes they use marigold petals.
</P>
<P>
   Double yolk eggs come from young hens just starting to lay that
release two ova at a time down into the oviduct. As they get older,
they only release one ovum at a time. Only about percent of the
eggs produced are double yolked.

   Q. Is there any difference between brown and white eggs?
</P>
<P>
   G.F., Omaha, Neb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Just the color, which is so thin on the outside of a brown
egg that you can rub the brown away with sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quiz. Which came first, the brown egg, or New England?
Ours is the only region where brown eggs are preferred and common.
Of the 270 million laying hens in America, only about 10 -15
percent are the brown feathered birds that lay brown eggs. With
names like Rhode Island Reds, New Hampshires, even Plymouth Rocks,
these breeds are bigger and eat more than the White Leghorn that
lays most of the eggs in America. So brown eggs can cost more, but
taste tests and nutrition research shows thatinside the shell brown
and white eggs are identical.

$25,000 FOR A TULIP? MAYBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM _ Would you pay $1,000 for a single tulip bulb?
</P>
<P>
   Not very likely, not if you've got a little Scottish blood in
your veins and common sense in your head. Nor if you're a
hard-boiled newspaperman. How to expense that?
</P>
<P>
   But during the great tulip fever of the 17th century, history
has it that at least one silly Dutchman gave that much for the
promise of a prize bloom represented in a dingy root.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fever broke and prices plummeted. But by then, tulips,
though originally imported from Turkey by Dutch diplomats, had
become the national flower.
</P>
<P>
   So would you pedal two hours to see acres of tulips ablaze in
color?
</P>
<P>
   This is a more interesting question. Perhaps you would if you
are obsessed with strange challenges. If, for example, you've ever
said to yourself: I wonder if there's a way to make my rear end so
sore I will barely be able to sit down on the plane ride home?
</P>
<P>
   Or, more likely, if some of the following conditions had been
obtained:
</P>
<P>
   1. You hadn't known ahead of time that the Dutch had already
harvested their vast fields of blossoms in the weeks before you
arrived; and
</P>
<P>
   2. Your wife were an aspiring water colorist who wanted to paint
tulips and whom you had promised to take on a pedal of the petals;
and
</P>
<P>
   3. You had previously assured the aspiring water colorist that
because she had planned most every previous trip you had been on
that you would take over the duties on this short vacation;
</P>
<P>
   4. She had previously expressed her doubts about your abilities
in that regard;
</P>
<P>
   5. You were already on a train to Leiden before you learned the
interesting and not inconsequential detail of the date of the tulip
harvest from a guidebook;
</P>
<P>
   6. You knew of Keukenhof, the famous tulip park, from the
``Eyewitness Travel Guide to Amsterdam,'' whose brilliant idea of
replacing long gray passages of text with pictures and terse
captions has won it the allegiance of the detail-impaired
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And so we rented bikes at the Leiden train station and struck
out on the long winding path for the world's premier flower park.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting historical note before we leave Leiden behind:
From 1573-74, the Spanish laid siege to this city, a siege broken
only when William the Silent breached the dikes and came sailing
across the fields in his ships.
</P>
<P>
   Later, William offered the residents of the town a choice in
recompense for their troubles. They could be free from taxation or
they could have, in their town, Holland's first university. Today
the University of Leiden is one of the country's best.
</P>
<P>
   And now, a word about an infamous Dutch punishment. In the 17th
century, Dutch prisoners were put to hard labor, and those who
refused are said to have been subjected to a most Kafka-esque sort
of treatment. Englishman Thomas Bowrey, who came to Amsterdam in
1698, reported that laggardly knaves were ``put into a Cellar in
which the water runs and there is a Pump. If they will Pump Hard,
they will keep the water Low; if not, it rises and drowns them,''
Derek Blyth reports in ``Amsterdam Explored.''
</P>
<P>
   What, you ask, has this to do with a tulip tour? Is it a grand
metaphor for a nation that has painstakingly created itself in a
never-ending battle with the sea, a struggle that demands hard work
and eternal vigilance against an ever-present peril?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. It's just that the very man who designed the drowning
room also seems to hold the patent on Dutch bicycles. Although the
rest of the mechanized world now enjoys approximately as many
bicycle gears as there are cable TV channels, Dutch bikes have one
speed. Pit that gear against the sort of wind that sweeps across
low, flat countries, and at times you have to pedal like the very
devil just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bike paths are wide and pleasant and generally
separate from the road itself, and once you arrive at Keukenhof,
which translates to kitchen garden, from its former function as a
royal herbal garden, it all becomes worthwhile. Once the herbal
garden of the Countess Jacqueline of Hainault, who married often
and died young, since 1949 it has been a garden park run by
Holland's bulb growers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world's largest flower park, comprising almost 70
acres, with an estimated 6 million flowers planted each year, laid
out like a ramble in a wooded meadow. Mostly it is a tribute to
tulips, with numerous gardens and motifs, and more varieties of the
flower than one would have believed existed. At other points, the
gardens are formed around small pools and fountains. Almost 100 of
Holland's leading growers participate in planting the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Here you will find almost 1,000 types of tulips, from your
(American) garden-variety reds and whites and yellows to exotic
purples and blacks and striped reds and whites. Some stand straight
and erect as soldiers, while the stems of others snake and twist as
though hit by a windstorm. Some are classic tulip shape, rising in
a perfectly even cup, others looking as though they were the jaws
of a fox.
</P>
<P>
   And the park has done a fascinating job of juxtaposing the
colors, and you'll see them all here, side by side in different
combinations, contrasting and complementary colors and hues.
There's the Semper Augustus, the Aladdins, the China Pinks, the
Queen of the Nights, the Viceroys, and all their assorted cousins
and court, plus hyacinth, narcissus, and azalea. It's enough to
persuade you that a tulip by any other name would seem just as
lovely.
</P>
<P>
   And it's almost enough to fortify you for the ride home.
Alternatively, bus tours leave from Central Station in Amsterdam as
well as other locations. The gardens are open from late March until
late May, daily from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tulips, of course, are not the only thing people come to Holland
seeking. The college kids in Amsterdam head for the coffeeshops
with their ubiquitous rastafarian emblems of the sweet smell of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Single men prowl the Red Light district, with its live sex shows
and bored prostitutes on display in the crimson glow of darkened
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of school kids congregate in front of Rembrandt's
``Night Watch'' in the Rijksmuseum.
</P>
<P>
   But most, of course, come here to contemplate the intersection
of the fine arts of revenue-raising and house-building. A city that
grew up along the canals and thrived on trade held its waterways
dear indeed. Taxes were levied according to the linear feet a home
or warehouse occupied on the canal.
</P>
<P>
   And everything flowed from there, in a succession of logical
steps that gave birth to some of Europe's most interesting
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Taxation based on width naturally discouraged wide homes, since
the revenue arm of the city rested more lightly on narrow
buildings. But with one dimension constrained, the others were
distorted. Wealthy merchants in search of suitably grand quarters
went deep and high.
</P>
<P>
   Those choices had just as logical ramifications. Building four-,
five-, and six-story homes on mushy canal land carries obvious
risks of settling. The huge floor-to-ceiling windows most canal
homes have were not just to transmit light, but to lighten the
structure by filling the front with glass, rather than heavier
bricks or sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   The windows had another purpose as well. A tall, narrow home
means steep, cramped stairways, making moving a nightmare. Now the
policy that limited the bottom of each home carried through in
effect to the top. A beam and pulley hook sits atop most every
facade, the better to hoist furniture through the home's wide
windows as an alternative to the narrow stairs.
</P>
<P>
   But that system meant bumping and scraping precious pieces on
the home front. Thus the houses started to cant toward the canals
to accommodate the use of rope and pulley. If the tilt canal-ward
is mostly planned, the lists in the other direction are not. That's
the result of tall homes settling in soft soil: The final
unintended consequence of a tax policy designed to preserve
precious canal frontage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would that Petrus Josephus Hubertus Cuyper's Central Station
displayed the same tax-averse behavior. The station is so wide and
massive, it all but blocks any view of the IJ. Still, the traveler
who pops out the back can ride a free ferry across to the opposite
shore for a better view of what was once one of the world's leading
ports, a harbor that made the Dutch the world's preeminent maritime
power.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, Amsterdam was aswarm with sailors, and it had the
tolerant atmosphere of a port grown accustomed to the vices of men
suddenly ashore after long months at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many vexing afflictions those vices caused, one of the
more mundane was fleas. One of the few remaining wooden houses in
the city, dating from the 1550s, was built as a seamen's hostel,
whose proprietor allowed broke roomers to pawn exotic pet monkeys
when they couldn't produce cash to square their accounts. Guests
there would leave scratching flea bites, and gave the city an
expression some guidebooks claim is current to this day. Someone
who looks particularly down on his luck is said to be ``staying in
the monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   For a better idea of a seafarer's lot, one should visit the
Maritime Museum, where a replica of the Amsterdam, a 17th-century
vessel that sank on its maiden voyage, lives on in replica. In its
small quarters, as many as 200 sailors would live during the long
months at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing was then among the world's most dangerous professions.
Of a crew of 200, estimates are that from a quarter to as many as
two-thirds might never return, instead falling victim to the
clutches of the sea or the ravages of disease. No wonder, then,
Schreierstoren, the brick defense tower that is a remnant of an
early city wall, has lived in history as a widow's outpost known as
the Weepers' Tower. One story is that its name comes because wives
of sailors would come to its battlements to watch their husbands'
ships disappear over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The tower itself boasts a stone tablet of a woman looking
seaward and weeping. Or is she? Another interpretation is that the
artist was having a sly joke with the city, for some think the
woman's hand, drawn across her lower face, really hides a smile.
With her husband safely gone _ perhaps never to return _ she can
now take a lover.

BOARDING CARD EQUALS A MISSED FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was just beginning to like Southwest Airlines when I got
bumped last week.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't thought through what the airline meant when it said
that besides low air fares it also provided seat assignments.
Southwest doesn't offer seat assignments; you just show up, stand
in line and receive a numbered boarding card. When it comes time to
board, those holding low numbers, say 1 through 25, are allowed to
board first, then others by the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This worked fine for me the first time, in fact better than
expected. I was flying alone and found a seat right up front.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, though, and we were on a tight schedule. We couldn't
arrive at Green Airport in Rhode Island until 40 minutes before the
flight and we had to be on a cruise ship by 3:30 p.m., about an
hour and half after the plane would arrive at Orlando. We missed
the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest oversold the flight by 14 people. Even though we had
valid tickets, and were in line in adequate time, when those
boarding passes are given out, that's it. We were among the 14
``overbooked'' passengers. Not enough people took Southwest up on
its volunteer offer to fly later for flight incentives. While
Southwest did work to find later flights for others who were
overbooked, for us, it was good bye cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is that if you are on a tight schedule
and cannot arrive early enough at the airport to gain a low number
boarding pass, don't fly Southwest, fly a line with a seat
assignment, we would have made it on that line. Southwest did give
us a choice of a voucher for a future flight or our money back. I
took the money. Our luggage, however, did make it to Orlando and
back all on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has a 10-minute rule - if you're not there 10 minutes
before the flight they can give away your sea. Other airlines have
similar rules, but they have seat assignments and don't give away
your seat until that time.

THE LISTENER 
A Psychoanalyst Examines His Life 
By Allen Wheelis. Norton. 256 pp. Illustrated. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the appointed hour, the psychotherapist listens and says
little, except toward the end, usually, where some synthesis issues
forth in apercu. He or she withholds the self so as not to confuse
or distract the patient. It is so unlike the help one gets from a
friend, where one's knowledge of the friend's own agonies makes his
good will and wisdom even more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In this strange, beautiful, awkward puzzle of a book, San
Francisco psychiatrist Allen Wheelis, 82, approximates the story of
his life. Not the life itself in close detail, except the childhood
parts, but the story; that is, a view of a sampling of meaningful
relationships and events, from great to small, with which he forges
his withering, bleak outlook on existence. Sex, death, and love, he
writes, ``is the text of my life, this unruly trio.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a small town in West Texas, Wheelis and his mother
and sister lived under the iron thumb of his father, a country
doctor dying of tuberculosis. The father was the sort who thinks no
son of his should get any break he himself did not get, and he had
got none _ worked for everything he had. So any hint of weakness or
self-indulgence his son shows must be ruthlessly stamped out. When
Wheelis, age 7, brings home a poor report card, his punishment is
to cut the grass with a razor, and not to be able to play ball with
his friends until the job is done. It takes all summer.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Morris, died at age 43 in 1925, after the kind of
horrific decline no child should have to witness. When breath
stopped, Wheelis's mother let out a blood-curdling scream, and that
scream continued to sound and echo in her son's heart the rest of
his life. After his father's death, Wheelis grew up and went on to
medical school, served as a surgeon in the Pacific theater in World
War II, and eventually became a psychiatrist and writer (he has
written 12 other books, including his best known, ``How People
Change'').
</P>
<P>
   Olive Wheelis, a resourceful and sturdy wife and mother,
gradually slipped into a kind of infantilism: When her son became a
successful physician, she began to idealize him and denigrate his
less-accomplished sister, June. As the decades passed, his mother's
coquettish infatuation with her son became more pronounced on the
occasions when she would visit. She lived 100 years, and in the
last demented hours before her death, in about 1989 (the date isn't
made clear), she suggested to her son that they be married.
</P>
<P>
   The book is episodic, anecdotal, somewhat choppy. Wheelis leaps
from youth to middle age thus: ``Marriage, two children, Mark and
Vicki; Topeka, merciless sun, the streets melt in August; years,
Stockbridge, Massachusetts, the crimson woods, the deep snows, the
Austen Riggs Center, psychoanalytic training; years; divorce. A
second wife, another child, Joan, San Francisco, the far edge. A
new life.'' In the chapter entitled ``Wife,'' he reveals his own
self-preoccupation, his inability to connect with, be available to,
his life partner (Ilse, to whom the book is dedicated). He
acknowledges that he has a powerful kinship with his daughter Joan,
though this fact seems to puzzle him.
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle notwithstanding, Wheelis does not analyze himself
in this book, except to say in passing that ``I have always been
too guilty to be happy. Guilt such as mine threatens life itself.''
The amateur analyst, however, might suspect that the inability of
his parents to control or accept their fates drove into their son,
like a stake in the heart, a sense of futility, of the immovable
irony of human aspiration. His father's inflexible principles and
iron will could not save him from professional failure and early
death. And his mother, Wheelis writes, dedicated to her loved ones,
``enslaved herself to those who would leave her.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheelis, the listener, makes a career of hearing and trying to
mitigate the pain of others, but his own grievance with existence
is a raw sore that cannot heal. Over and over he coughs up the
unbearable. Of romantic relationships he writes, ``I believe that
we . . . are locked within the prison of self, that in this prison
we yearn for release by fusion with another. And I have come to
believe that this fusion, this transcendent love and oneness, is an
illusion, that it can be achieved, if at all, only briefly . . .
that we have to live in the solitary confinement of our tiny cell,
and that, should we briefly escape this cell, we will soon be back
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is old, but he has not learned the one thing he seeks to
know: how to live. And as for meaning in life: ``What we deny is
not death but the awareness that, before we die, nothing is going
to happen. That big vague thing, that redemptive fulfillment, is an
illusion, a beckoning bribe to keep us loyal. A symphony has a
climax, a poem builds to a burst of meaning, but we are unfinished
business. No coming together of strands. The game is called because
of darkness.'' He feels not a shred of religious consolation; the
possibility is not even considered.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the book, Wheelis imagines the old woman who
once owned the summer house he and his wife now own on an island in
Puget Sound, coming back after death and looking for familiar
faces, but finding only strangers. Then he imagines himself
returning after death, decades in the future, and likewise finding
strangers, including an old woman, ancient like his mother, in a
wheelchair; he realizes it is his daughter Joan.
</P>
<P>
   On and on: At his mother's graveside service, he sings her
praises, but thinks as he does so that most of it is sentimental
lies. When he uses his intellect to understand life, existence,
love, meaning, he finds nothing but vanity, dust, and futility.
</P>
<P>
   Grim as his outlook is, there is something beautiful and
touching about the heart of Allen Wheelis, at least as far as we
can see it in his own testimony. He assails the capacity of the
mind to master and understand life; in that case, why should the
bleak outlook be more credible than its opposite? His view is
paradoxical in the fashion of such a statement as ``I am lying.''
Some such pessimists are driven to cruelty, rage, or indifference.
Others, such as Mark Twain or Allen Wheelis, never lose their
tenderheartedness, their sense of the pathetic beauty of the human
desire for union and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A horrifying childhood experience haunts the book: Wheelis once
saw a butcher at an outdoor market grab a pigeon, hold it down,
chop off its feet and toss it into the air. Late in the book he
imagines the bird trying to land, flying upward again desperately,
finally dying of shock and exhaustion. The poor bird appears to be
a figure of created life, perhaps Wheelis's own; it has the power
of flight, to strive, to rise. But it can never light, never find
rest. Elsewhere he holds a dialogue, apparently with himself, in
which one voice dismisses the butcher's act as insignificant
compared with the horrors of the Holocaust, argues that the butcher
probably went home that night and dandled his granddaughter on his
knee. But the other internal voice, the unintellectual one,
replies: ``He may dandle her on his knee till hell freezes over and
still I'll hate him for what he did to that bird. I will never
forget, will never forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that voice, so full of pity and sadness and compassion,
not unlike the voices of Job or Ecclesiastes, that glimmers through
this poignant and unhappy book like an unquenchable ember: ``We
live by attachment,'' Wheelis writes in his final pages, ``not by
reason. That's why love is primary: there is no value without
caring, and caring is loving. . . . That's the point: one's own
life has value only because one cares for others. And one cares
without a reason! Without reflection, without the weighing of
profit or loss. The caring that justifies everything is itself
without justification. It is a leap.''

FALL TV: EXTREME YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday, a scrupulous TV executive will launch the Fogey
Network, with programs skewed for the over-35 population, also
known as Generations S, U, and V. The lineup will include ``Muffy
the Credit Card Payer,'' a horror series about the working mom of
the high school fashion plate, and ``Dawson's Creek's Freaks,'' in
which a clique of Cape 50-somethings struggle with the alienation
of meaning less than zero to American advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, TV viewers of all ages will need to reckon with
prime time 1999, a Humbert Humbert of a season that is unabashedly
obsessed with youth. When the bell rings on the week of Sept. 20,
the networks will officially set loose some 13 new sitcoms and 21
new dramas, and an unprecedented predominance of them will depend
on characters who, like one teen on Fox's ``Get Real,'' put Paul
Newman in the same category as Mrs. Butterworth and Chef
Boy-ar-dee. The impulse that sparked in 1990 with ``Beverly Hills
90210'' and caught fire last year with ``Dawson's Creek'' is now
bringing us a veritable conflagration of baggy-jeaned dramas that
revel in the strains of being a teen or 20-something in America.
It's the season of Generation Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that, creatively speaking.
Despite the copycat overtones, the fall youth series are not all
that bad. While ``young'' means shiny, happy coifs and expressions
like ``That is so fill in the blank,'' it can also mean innovative,
clever, playful. Remember: Lesson No. 1 in marketing to the
post-MTV, post-Internet generation is ``Don't talk down to them.''
That rule is why many of these shows are so keenly observed,
smartly written, and mercifully low in cheap, ``Afterschool
Special''-ized moralism. And, thanks to the success of ``Ally
McBeal,'' they confidently shake up the formal conventions of TV
drama with fantasy sequences, breaks through the fourth wall,
omniscient singers in the manner of Vonda Shepherd, and a hybrid
tone that has become known as dramedy. They may suffer from bouts
of precociousness, but that is far from the worst problem in an
entertainment world dominated by Adam Sandler. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Teen caste system &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fall's most imaginative youth pilots include NBC's
affectionate ``Freaks and Geeks,'' the WB's atmospheric
``Roswell,'' Fox's serpentine ``Manchester Prep,'' and the WB's
savvy ``Popular,'' which introduces this tart schoolyard putdown:
``Cancel my subscription: I'm over your issues.'' These shows are
overrun with children of divorce, children of narcissists, children
of money and no love. The heroes and heroines are traumatized by
the teen caste system, that timeless hierarchy of jocks, freaks,
geeks, and, now, goths. With shades of Columbine, a few of the
pilots portray high school as a front line where Teen Everyboy must
face down the School Bully, or Teen Everygirl must do battle with
the Blond Cheerleader Bitch. And there's no shortage of alienation,
of course, with ``Roswell'' literally turning its teens into aliens
in the way that ``Buffy'' appropriates horror conventions for its
teen torment. The truth is out there, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the biggest misfire of the young guns is
``Wasteland,'' an ABC offering from Kevin Williamson, the
celebrated youth marketeer behind ``Dawson's Creek'' and
``Scream.'' His attempt to transform ``Friends'' into an hourlong
angst-a-thon is a forced product rigged to steal young viewers from
NBC on Thursdays at 9. A chronicle of ``the pre-30 wasteland,'' as
one character puts it, the show has the same self-conscious feel as
the film ``Reality Bites.'' ``Freaks and Geeks'' is a more natural
and charming hour, shunning the glamour of the ``Dawson's'' crowd
as it lays bare the internecine social wars of a suburban high
school in 1980. The casting is spot on _ particularly of the pimply
class outcasts _ and it giddily recaptures that dreaded walk
through the cafeteria in search of a table. Unwisely, NBC is
dumping ``Freaks and Geeks,'' which recalls ``Welcome to the
Dollhouse,'' into the TV wasteland known as Saturdays at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The less distinctive under-30 premieres include NBC's ``Cold
Feet,'' a punchy romantic comedy with three couples at different
stages of intimacy; Fox's uneven ``The Badland,'' about a hunky
19-year-old cop whose girlfriend is in college; and the WB's ``Jack
&AMP; Jill,'' an unfocused hour about a foiled love affair. Two youth
spinoffs with potential _ ``Angel'' with David Boreanaz from
``Buffy,'' and ``Time of Your Life'' with Jennifer Love Hewitt from
``Party of Five'' _ were unavailable for preview.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new family series have the scent of teen spirit about
them. And it's not just because they're as riddled with sexual
situations as the youth shows, or because they, too, depend on
soundtracks lifted from the Billboard Top 10. In 1999, family
product like Fox's fun, frenetically hip ``Get Real,'' the WB's
soggy Gregory Harrison vehicle ``Safe Harbor,'' and ABC's annoying
sitcom ``Odd Man Out'' are presented primarily from the kids' point
of view. The parents are on hand, but mostly as self-involved adult
children, or as comic relief. On Fox's ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a
family sitcom that could flourish with less willfully anti-PC
humor, Dad does little more than stand naked in the kitchen so Mom
can shave his body hair. The heart of the show is the school daze
of middle child Malcolm, a certified genius. No Jan Brady, he.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this kid consciousness Hollywood's response to Columbine,
an attempt to offer electronic group therapy to America's
disenfranchised youth?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. In Hollywood, greedy minds think alike: Young
viewers spend millions of their parents' dollars every year, and
they're willing to blithely change brand names. The networks want
to deliver these purchase-happy people to advertisers, and they
also want to attract young viewers as an investment in their own
futures. Plus, shows starring unknowns are cheaper to produce,
because newer actors are more affordable. (They're also more likely
to become heavily hyped teen idols.) During the summer, when both
the NAACP and the annual TV critics' convention rightly blasted the
networks for previewing a profoundly vanilla TV season, they won a
promise for more characters of color as the fall unfolds. But
network honchos would surely be less malleable on the subject of
ageism, as the financial gains of youth programming are far too
immediate, and far too great.

8 YEARS LATER, SELES STILL   TOO MUCH FOR CAPRIATI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who are these two old ladies in tennis shoes? Haven't
we seen them before somewhere? They seem familiar. So familiar that
some curious bystanders (about 18,000 of them) decide to pass the
time by taking a look.
</P>
<P>
   It is 11 a.m. Monday as the two walk into a public park called
Flushing Meadow for a game. Maybe for old times' sake. Hit a few
and see what happens. After all, it's been eight years since they
last bumped into each other in New York. Eight years, and they've
put on a lot of mileage, gone through a few wringers, and could
compare horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   But here are Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati, defying
decrepitude, moving without assistance at the advanced ages of 25
and 23, trying to see who will be thrown into the US Open kiddies
den, the quarterfinals, with the brassy basher, Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Jennifer were the kiddies back in 1991, belting out
an electrifying semifinal of such dynamite shotmaking that it
echoed for years. It was a time when Desert Storm was fresh, the
Dow cow hadn't yet jumped over the moon, and the only famous Monica
was Seles. Capriati came within two points of winning that
screamer, but Seles took it, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), and went on to
the first of her pair of US titles.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, Capriati arrived at Flushing clutching her
newly won Olympic gold medal, but her tailspin had begun. She faded
early against Patricia Hy, and was never a US Open presence again _
losing 1996-97-98 opening rounders _ until this year.
</P>
<P>
   She wept after the high-powered loss to Seles in 1991,
emotionally emptied by a magnificent performance. And she wept
again Monday, prematurely washing out a strange press conference
that followed another Seles victory: this time, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting something,'' Seles is saying about the
budding, concussive teenage rivalry, the firepower that set them
apart. ``Jennifer had beat me the tournament before in California.
She beat me at the Lipton in '92, and then I beat her at the
French. But then you know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles got stabbed, and Capriati took a stab at drugs and
``mistakes I made by rebelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe an exciting rivalry has been rekindled and maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both hitting the ball so hard then people were
amazed,'' said Seles. ``We're still hitting hard, but there are
five girls around now stronger than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sequel, their battle gripped the crowd for an hour and a
quarter in Ashe Stadium. But, like many remakes, it didn't measure
up to the original, the thrilling thunder of '91 when you knew the
victor would claim the title in the final against a deteriorating
Martina Navratilova. Moanin' Monica is still grunting, big-time,
but as a woman in the audience said, ``It's a more mature grunt,
even sultry. Not the shriek of a demanding child.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Seles has grown up. She is a genuine, self-reliant 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got over the what-might-have-beens that haunted me for a
while,'' she said. ``I got stabbed when I was No. 1 (1993), winning
all the tournaments. No other player had that happen. For whatever
reason, that's what I got to deal with. I don't like to go back
there. But right now I'm happy where I am, and playing good tennis.
What's past is past.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is fragile, still having trouble getting past the past.
When she took the stand, to face us inquisitors, she couldn't quite
get through a present that she said she had thought about for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, she said she would read a prepared statement, one
that had been evolving, a sort of declaration of independence from
the past and her well-publicized troubles. Though a sincere mea
culpa, a cri de coeur, it was naive.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati asked that her past be tucked into an envelope and
buried. Totally impossible for a person in public life. You'd have
to hire an arsonist to do away with all the reference libraries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   As someone with more comebacks on her resume than Nixon,
Capriati has done a terrific job this time with her latest coach,
the understanding but no-nonsense Harold Solomon, the human
grindstone of his era as a pro. She's seldom benefitted from much
thoughtful guidance. As a parentally pushed cash calf, she is a
monument to mangled childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was careful. I didn't want to wind up like Jennifer,'' the
champ, Lindsay Davenport, used to say on her way up.
</P>
<P>
   That stuff hurt. ``I'm tired of, like, every time I read
something about myself, I always read that little tidbit about my
past,'' said Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for her, as it should be for every athlete still in
competition: Don't read about yourself. Billie Jean King's father
gave her that good advice when she was a kid: ``They'll write
either too sweet or too sour. Your mother will make a scrapbook you
can read later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Monica,'' said Capriati. ``She had no control over
what happened to her. I did. Mine was self-inflicted. I have had a
lot of anxiety about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough already on her part. She's paid enough for really not
much transgression. She ought to read about Darryl Strawberry
sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see the media as your adversary?'' someone asks.
</P>
<P>
   She begins to cry, and can't stop, mumbling, ``I just wish I
didn't have to talk about this stuff all the time . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't. ``No comment,'' will suffice at the private
moments. Does she need a little help? I think so, someone to
convince her that she's been forgiven by the public long ago.
People want her to succeed, to get on with life and become a happy
old lady in tennis shoes.

REPORTER TRIES TO LEARN WHAT DAD DIDN'T SAY ABOUT WWII SUB DUTY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by info box, SUB SERVICE-HAMMERHEAD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They knew him as ``Alby.''
</P>
<P>
   His real name was Arthur L. Baker. In 1942, he was 18 and
gangling, with dark, thick, wavy hair and an angular jaw. ``Alby''
is what his buddies called him, and my dad stenciled that name onto
his sailor's cap.
</P>
<P>
   He served about three years in the Navy as a torpedoman on the
USS Hammerhead, a 312-foot submarine, with about 70 other enlisted
men. Dad's job was to slide the torpedoes into the tubes and launch
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I romanticized my dad's years in the Navy and his
adventures beneath the South China Sea. I loved to open a glass
bank to look at the foreign currency and tiny wartime snapshots
he'd stuffed in there.
</P>
<P>
   It was heady stuff. My old man _ a Chevrolet dealer in Odessa,
Mo., a town on the edge of the tall-grass prairie, about 40 miles
east of Kansas City _ sinking Japanese ships, dodging depth charges
and swimming in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   But other than a few funny stories he liked to tell, all I had
from Dad's war years were those fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   He was a quiet, introspective man who didn't talk about the war.
When he died of lung cancer more than 11 years ago _ passing away
three hours after the birth of my son, Ben _ he took his stories
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and my daughter, Johanna, who was born three years later,
ask about Grandpa Baker. To them, he's an abstraction _ a
photograph on a bookshelf, a guy my mom talks about when we visit
her in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   So when a friend told me the U.S. Submarine Veterans of World
War II were holding their annual convention in Fort Worth this
year, I decided to stop by _ to see if I could answer a few
questions about my dad for my kids.
</P>
<P>
   And for myself.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   During a stroll around the Radisson Plaza Hotel last week, a
visitor could pick up snatches of war stories from the more than
1,600 submariners who attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
   When they served nearly 50 years ago, they were young and strong
and in the prime of life. Now they are in their 70s and 80s, their
once-clear skin mottled with age spots, their hair silver or gray.
Two of the veterans were tethered to oxygen tanks. One used a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing bright yellow-and-blue vests festooned with Navy
insignia and embroidered with their boats' names, the men scanned
the faces and the names on the vests, looking for long-lost
shipmates. There were gleams of recognition, slaps on the back,
emotion-heavy conversations as they recalled adventures and lost
friends of a half-century past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard stories about me in the Navy I haven't heard,''
joked Pete Cook, 78, of Eaton Rapid, Mich., who was a motor
machinist on the Sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find someone who knew my dad, I went to a table that
held three-ring notebooks containing sign-in sheets for the boat
crews. No names appeared on the sheet for the Hammerhead.
</P>
<P>
   There were crew members from the Amberjack, Guardfish, Seacat,
Bowfish, Sculpin and Sailfish. But no one who sailed with my dad on
the Hammerhead's first three war patrols, from June 1944 to January
1945, had registered so far.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the registration desk, Joe Allison of Fort Worth wore
a gimme cap emblazoned with the name of his boat, the Silversides.
Allison, a 75-year-old retired trucking company transportation
manager, wore a button on his vest showing him in his Navy uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was about 25 then,'' Allison laughed, lifting up his
hat. ``I had hair back then, too. It was a long time ago, you know
it. ...''
</P>
<P>
   From Allison and retired Rear Adm. Corwin ``Mendy'' Mendenhall
of Benbrook, Texas _ who was selling his book ``Submarine Diary'' _
I learned something of what my dad's life was like aboard the
Hammerhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of submarine service was silence and secrecy; long
stretches of tedium and waiting, interrupted occasionally by brief
periods of excitement, terror and peril,'' Mendenhall writes in his
book. ``From the standpoint of public visibility and wartime
recognition, the role of the submarine navy was scarcely
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   They lived in steel tubes with passageways so narrow that
sailors had to sit down or flatten themselves against a bulkhead to
allow others to pass by. A submarine's groaning metal skin was so
thin that crewmen could hear the clicks of the firing pins in the
depth charges before they exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The subs' torpedoes were inferior and sometimes didn't work.
They didn't have advanced radar; equipment was known to jam or
malfunction. Most of the officers were in their 30s; many enlisted
men were still in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   One war correspondent wrote that submarines _ called boats from
the German word ``unterseeboot'' _ slid into harbor ``salt-caked,
battered and ugly.'' Personal hygiene was an expendable luxury. The
men reeked after months of washing _ and then infrequently _ with
oily-smelling water collected from the condensation on pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Handpicked and psychologically tested, 16,000 sailors served on
288 U.S. submarines during World War II. They made up about 2
percent of the nation's naval force but are credited with about 55
percent of the Japanese ships sunk during the war. Self-described
``night crawlers,'' they did most of their work in the dark,
without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   They were a tight-knit, clannish bunch. And they died in record
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality rate for the Navy overall was about 2 percent. But
on submarines, 22 percent of the sailors _ or more than one in
every five _ did not come home. Fifty-two submarines were lost; 375
officers and 3,131 enlisted men died.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought we were crazy. I don't know if it was
romantic,'' said Malcolm Cross, 76, of Fort Worth, an ensign on the
Tench. ``Once you left Pearl Harbor, you were going west and into
Japanese hunting grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison served as a yeoman on the last four patrols of the
Silversides. He said there were many moments when he was ``scared
as hell,'' one of them when a ``running hot'' torpedo got stuck in
the launch tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``And about that time we got our first depth charge, and I
thought the torpedo went off,'' Allison recalled. ``I jumped out of
my wits.''
</P>
<P>
   Silversides safely ejected the torpedo later.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Fletcher, 74, who lives near San Antonio, told of a daring
daylight attack by his boat, the Blowfish. The sub followed a small
Japanese tanker into a harbor, waited for it to reach port, and
then fired two torpedoes into it.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``We sank a ship, a big crane and the dock,'' Fletcher said with
a laugh. ``And then we headed for deep water, so we could submerge
to avoid attacks by aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked these men why my father never told me his stories,
Allison recalled his time as a typist during shore duty on Midway
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I typed the letters of commendation and condolences to the
next of kin for 75 to 80 men,'' Allison said, boasting of his
typing skills. ``It didn't mean as much to me then. I was young,
and it was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he choked up and dabbed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never told ``my own wife and my own child'' how he
feels now about typing the letters to the names on that list.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Allison shied away from joining veterans groups,
except the one for submarine vets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people ask me, `Did you see any action?' I tell them, `If
anyone served on one patrol, you saw all the action you wanted to
see.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of that made me want to know even more about my dad.
</P>
<P>
   But when I passed by the sign-in books again on my way out,
still, no one from the Hammerhead had registered.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's a habit I inherited from my father.
</P>
<P>
   I get up late at night to read and think. Dad did the same
thing. Many a time, I tried to sneak in late _ after a night of
doing things I shouldn't _ only to find him sitting at the kitchen
table.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights this past week, I read over the Hammerhead's war
patrol reports. A friend obtained them for me years ago from the
Navy's archives. The reports were written by Capt. J.C. ``Jack''
Martin, skipper of the Hammerhead on the first three of its seven
war patrols.
</P>
<P>
   I try to imagine my father in the torpedo room, or standing
watch on the conning tower, as he experienced the events recounted
in the archives.
</P>
<P>
   The first patrol lasted 72 days, including the voyage from Pearl
Harbor to Fremantle, Australia, and then 33 days in action near the
island of Formosa.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1944, at 8:53 a.m., the submerged Hammerhead fired
three torpedoes from its stern tubes at an oiler. The torpedoes
missed, and the sub ``went deep'' to avoid bombs and depth charges
until the ``screws faded out.''
</P>
<P>
   Early the next day, the Hammerhead encountered a 15-ship convoy.
Sunup was only about an hour away, but Martin ordered a surface
attack. A large black rain cloud provided some cover; nevertheless,
Martin wrote, he had ``a very naked feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   After firing six torpedoes, and hearing four explosions, Martin
knew the Hammerhead had hit its target _ a large freighter. The sub
fired four more torpedoes from its stern tubes, probably sinking a
second ship, then submerged.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerhead scored no more kills before returning to
Fremantle on Aug. 17. But there is a lighthearted entry about the
initiation rite administered to crewmen crossing the equator for
the first time: ``51 polliwogs entered the domain of Neptunus Rex
with appropriate costumes, haircuts and slight medical and
electrical treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerhead's second war patrol in the South China Sea lasted
54 days. Martin, my dad and the rest of the crew attacked two
Japanese convoys _ on Oct. 1 and Oct. 20. They sank five cargo
ships and damaged other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper writes that in the second attack, two ships ``broke
out in flames ... casting a bright glow over that portion of the
horizon. We started cheering, and the two ships started falling
back from the rest of the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next page, Martin notes: ``Incidentally, none of the
escorts helped the two crippled ships nor made any effort to pick
up what few survivors there might have been. I doubt if there were
any.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad's third war patrol lasted 53 days. The Hammerhead attacked
several convoys and damaged a Japanese oiler but sank no ships. The
seas were rough, and this may have hurt their chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   During a surface passage through the Lombok Strait in Indonesia,
Martin writes, a Japanese patrol boat attacked the submarine. ``It
was interesting watching all those of us left on the bridge trying
to dig foxholes in the decking as the shells landed,'' the skipper
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerhead returned to Australia from its third patrol in
January 1945. My Dad had already left the boat at Subic Bay in the
Philippines and finally returned to the United States to marry my
mother. After the war ended in August, my parents lived briefly in
California, but they were back home in Missouri by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I telephoned my mom after reading the war patrol reports. She
recalled that my dad didn't join the submarine veterans
organization when it was established in 1955 and that he ``didn't
trade war stories much.'' But years later, after my dad retired, he
helped form a Missouri chapter of the submarine veterans
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to this,'' Mom said. ``They laugh about it among
themselves. ... But they don't tell war stories to other people. It
is hard to drag out of them. They don't care about sharing all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two men who served on the Hammerhead signed the
registration book.
</P>
<P>
   But when I telephoned 80-year-old Art Rawson in his hotel room,
the Hammerhead's former executive officer said sadly that he and
the other man didn't serve with my dad. Nevertheless, he agreed to
meet me in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good boat. They weren't as lucky as some of the other
subs. We didn't get some of the contacts that some did,'' said
Rawson, a tanned, impish, vivacious man, an Annapolis grad who also
commanded surface ships.
</P>
<P>
   Rawson said that my dad, as part of his job as a torpedoman,
would have checked the fuel level in the torpedoes, made sure the
propellers weren't sticking, and loaded them into the bow and stern
tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also may have made what they called `gillie,' or alcohol,''
Rawson said with a laugh. ``When we wanted to have a party, they'd
take this torpedo alcohol and strain it through bread to take out
the impurities. It was awful stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawson said he could only guess why my dad didn't talk more
about his wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this as a team effort, rather than an individual
effort,'' Rawson said. ``We all stood watch.''

IN NEW TOWN, PARKS ARE FOR ONE, NOT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH _ The New Town section here is widely admired for
containing the world's most impressive collection of Georgian
architecture, ornate buildings accentuated by a sprinkling of green
parks, their lawns finely trimmed, their trees offering shade on
those rare sunny days in Scotland's capital.
</P>
<P>
   But like the buildings, the bucolic parks that stretch from
Charlotte Square to St. Andrew Square can only be admired from the
outside. The parks, like the buildings, are privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   As a couple and their two young sons walked around the perimeter
of one of the parks recently, perplexed by the locked black
wrought-iron gates, Pat Cunningham, an Edinburgh resident, took
pity on them and stopped to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get in. Those gardens belong to the people who live
there,'' she said, pointing to a row of Georgian townhouses
overlooking the park.
</P>
<P>
   In a society like Scotland that prides itself on its
egalitarianism, the dozen private parks in the capital are
something of an anachronism. But that may soon change with the
reinstatement of a Scottish parliament after nearly 300 years of
direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   Newly empowered members of the Scottish parliament, who are
determined to get rid of many of the feudal laws that guard
privilege, are demanding that the parks be opened up. The issue
will be one of the first tackled by the parliament when it
reconvenes this month.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the winding, narrow roads of the Old Town, the New Town
was laid out two centuries ago with neat, parallel streets, broken
up by a series of parks and squares, a tribute to the Scottish
Enlightenment. But the concept behind private parks, keeping the
riff-raff from the Old Town out so that the New Town rich could add
luster to the city, is now widely viewed as being less than
enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Sheridan, the Scottish Socialist who took his oath to
parliament with a raised fist rather than defer to the presence of
Queen Elizabeth II, is among those who say the parks should be
opened up or taken back by eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to be opened up,'' said Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrew Square Gardens is owned by the 15 financial firms
that line George Street, Scotland's Wall Street. Sheridan and
others think it is outrageous that bankers can stroll the gardens
and ordinary Scots cannot.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Robert Louis Stevenson sailed his toy boats in the
pond at Queen Street Gardens. But the public is barred from
admiring either the park or the pond island that was the
inspiration for Stevenson's ``Treasure Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the small private parks that dot parts of Manhattan, or
even Beacon Hill's Louisburg Square, Edinburgh's parks are in some
cases huge. Queen Street Gardens, for example, stretches across 28
acres of New Town.
</P>
<P>
   The parks are opened up for special occasions, but Sheridan and
other activists say that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is somewhat embarrassing for Donald Dewar, Scotland's
new first minister. By law, the Charlotte Square Gardens are open
only to him. Dewar and the rest of the Labor Party majority in
parliament have yet to embrace the ``open the parks'' movement, but
there is growing pressure on them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham admits she would love to see Queen Street Gardens
opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read `Treasure Island' as a girl, and my mother told me
about the island in the pond and all, but do you know, I've never
seen it?'' she said.

HOW THE RICH GOT RICHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ What follows is for the benefit of the
economically smug, the financially complacent, the politically
myopic:
</P>
<P>
   --Since 1977, the average household income for the least
well-off fifth of the American public _ after taxes and inflation _
has gone down, by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Over the same neatly bipartisan period _ Carter and Clinton,
Reagan and Bush Pere _ the average household income for the middle
fifth of the populace _ after taxes and inflation _ has risen all
of 8 percent, or a whopping 0.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   --Also since '77 the average household income for the best-off 1
percent has more than doubled, up by 115 percent.What goes for
income, moreover, goes nearly double for wealth.
</P>
<P>
   --As of 1995, the last year for which full Federal Reserve
numbers are available, the top 20 percent of households, while
receiving more than half the after-tax income, were holding 84
percent of the wealth _ meaning stock portfolios, home equity and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   --The bottom 80 percent owned 16 percent of the wealth. That was
less than half the wealth owned by the wealthiest 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The 1-percenters, while getting 13 percent of all the
household income, were holding a share three times as large in
assets. And all these numbers on the concentration of wealth showed
a larger set of disparities than at any time since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers, and tons more, were disgorged over the weekend by
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the economic analysis
shop for progressives, but an odd bird famous for using
conservative data that shreds conservative myths. The household
income numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office, and are
the most broadly defined around for both the rich and poor; the
wealth stuff is from a study compiled from raw material at the
Fed's surveys of consumer finance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the center's famously understating head, Bob
Greenstein, there are at least three analytical conclusions to be
drawn just five months before the economic expansion of the 1990s
becomes the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth ever:
</P>
<P>
   --The growth, to put it extremely mildly, has been very uneven.
</P>
<P>
   --The gaps between rich and poor, between middle-class and rich,
are as wide as they have ever been in our statistically recorded
history.
</P>
<P>
   --Tax cuts benefiting the already well-off along with wage
erosion hurting those who already struggle have been at the
causative center of the trends.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein's co-author for the center's study, Isaac Shapiro,
makes an additional point of importance. The CBOs conservative (as
usual) projections for this year strongly suggest that the
continuing expansion and the tax cuts in the 1997 budget agreement
will act to widen the income and wealth disparities.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were much sharper during the fiscally insane '80s.
But the data shows that the positive changes in the '90s (tax
increases on the very wealthy, a huge expansion in the earned
income tax credit for the working poor, a higher minimum wage after
1996, and the tax credit for families with children) did not stop
the trend. On taxes alone, the study shows that for the top 1
percent of households, the average tax cut received since '77 was
worth $40,000-plus. That is nine grand above the entire, after-tax
income for the average household in the middle-fifth of the
spectrum today.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, in other words, the widened income disparity is
such that the best-off 1 percent will have as much after-tax income
as the bottom 38 percent combined; that 2.7 million people will
have the same combined income as 100 million people. The mere rise
in income at the top will exceed the total income of the bottom 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond taxes and the explosion in asset values, Greenstein also
points at two developments that have clearly hurt the poor
considerably: the erosion in pay from downsizing, job-exporting,
and a largely stagnant minimum wage; and the plunge in the value of
welfare assistance in the late '70s and early '80s because of high
inflation and the cruel nonresponses from the states.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statistics also have obvious political and policy
implications. The most obvious:
</P>
<P>
   --There is no justification left, none, for even a dollar more
of rich-tilted, across-the-board income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   --To would-be Reform Party convert Pat Buchanan: Your famous
brigades need more than pitchforks and protectionism. They need
more income, starting with a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   --To Bill Bradley and especially Al Gore, to celebrate the
economy is to celebrate numbers more than reality. The reality is
that most households have to struggle simply to get by. What has
happened in the '90s is in many respects a miracle, but it is also
just a start.
</P>
<P>
   --To Bradley and especially Gore, to focus too much on policy
topics like health insurance availability and poverty among
children is to take a commendable detour, but still a detour. The
bigger issue is economic security for working families. Big
thinking is what's called for.

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES PLAY IT SAFE ON ABORTION POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON -- Here's an example of ``moderation'' on abortion
in George W. Bush's Texas, signed into law by the governor just
this year:
</P>
<P>
   A teenager becomes pregnant and has what lawyers call a
justifiable fear of abuse if she goes to her parents. So she goes
to her grandparents, and they take her to a state where abortions
services are confidential. The grandparents have now committed a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of reasoned substantive, discussion of
abortion in the nascent campaign for the Republican presidential
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes is on the trail, explaining his conversion as an
anti-government crusader into a down-the-line advocate of
government regulation of pregnancy. Up pops a right-to-lifer in his
small audience, armed with the latest facts circulating in circles
where conversions are suspect. Why is it then, he asks, that the
foundation set up by your business has given contributions to
Planned Parenthood?
</P>
<P>
   Forbes gets that look on his face that indicates he's only
answered this question a hundred times before. The foundation is
like the business, he says; it's controlled by his family, and he
has siblings with whom he doesn't always agree on funding issues,
including this one.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes clearly considers his answer responsive and dispositive.
But the right-to-lifer just as clearly is worried about trusting a
presidential candidate with independent-minded siblings.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's John McCain, who as far as I can tell is the
only person in the race who has shown any evidence of thought on
the issue. For two weeks, the Arizona senator and career-long
opponent of abortion has been taking modest guff from the
true-believers for suggesting care in advocating the junking of the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said in an interview, as have Bush and Elizabeth Dole,
that ``repeal'' is politically impossible for the foreseeable
future. But McCain also said repeal might be a bad idea if it leads
to state laws outlawing abortion that would drive it back to the
dangerous underground of pre-1973.
</P>
<P>
   When the guff came from the antiabortion orthodoxy that retains
its vice-grip on his party, McCain pulled back at once. Now, in
addition to affirming his 17-year record in Congress of voting
pro-life, his sole signal of ``moderation'' is (like Bush and Dole)
a refusal to commit to an antiabortion running mate or to ask
Supreme Court possibilities how they would rule on Roe.
</P>
<P>
   But when I asked him in Los Angeles recently what he thought
could happen during an eight-year presidency, McCain didn't speak
of ``repeal'' or of legislative fights. Instead, he spoke of a
possibly changed climate in the country, especially if prosperity
and economic security continued to spread. Even after getting
burned some, McCain's first political instinct was to think of
influencing the people who don't agree with him, as opposed to
preening for those that do. They call that governance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, McCain likes to say when campaigning
that given his broad views on constitutional questions and on the
Supreme Court, that he can't imagine picking a potential justice
who shares those views. And that tends to undercut McCain's
concerns about the prochoice majority in the country, because with
the prospective retirement of three justices in the near future
(two of them pro-Roe), a constitutional right to abortion services
based on a constitutional right to privacy could easily be toast
during a McCain presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different with George Bush. The justice he has picked
out of the crowd to call his model is Antonin Scalia, the most
relentlessly prolife of the current nine. Among the true believers
on the right, Bush's antichoice views and his detailed, anti-choice
record are regularly vouched for by the likes of Jerry Falwell,
Ralph Reed, and other leaders. The occasional barbs from
competitors like Forbes, Gary Bauer, and Pat Buchanan are
demonstrably inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   And more than Roe is involved. Since Ronald Reagan's election in
1980, there has been a steady chipping away at the right to choose,
especially for poor and young women and teenagers. There is not one
of these onerous, often mean-spirited policies _ from banning
public funds for the poor to regulating doctor-patient
conversations, to mandated waiting period and exposure to
government-written propaganda _ that Bush or all the other
candidates haven't supported.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan-Bush era was a time of gag rules, bans on
disease-fighting research using fetal tissue and a Supreme Court
that just 10 years ago was on a clear path to junking Roe. But for
Bill Clinton's election, it probably would have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all those stakes will return. The fact is that all abortion
views in the Republican contest must be written on litmus paper,
and all the candidates know they must pass. They already have.

   Facts about USS Hammerhead:
</P>
<P>
   _ The boat, a Balao-class submarine, is named after a type of
shark with a hammerlike head.
</P>
<P>
   _ After a month of sea trials and training on Lake Michigan, the
Hammerhead was placed in a floating dry dock and towed down the
Mississippi River to New Orleans, where it arrived April 8, 1944.
The sub then went to Balboa, Canal Zone, for further crew training,
and then to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning June 6, 1944, the Hammerhead participated in seven
combat patrols during World War II, sinking 11 vessels totaling
35,635 tons. The submarine received seven battle stars and a Navy
Unit Commendation.
</P>
<P>
   _ All seven patrols were designated successful by the War
Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Hammerhead was decommissioned in 1946 and placed in fleet
reserve at Mare Island, Calif. It was brought out of reserve in
1952, during the Korean War, for training duty on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earmarked for loan under the military assistance program, the
Hammerhead was recommissioned in 1954 and transferred to the
Turkish navy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Hammerhead name returned to the Navy on April 14, 1967,
when SSN 663 was launched. The new vessel, a Sturgeon-class nuclear
submarine, was commissioned June 28, 1968.

INJECTING CONSCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft mogul Bill Gates recently pledged to spend $750
million over the next five years to buy vaccines for millions of
children in poor countries. In a single breath, he ignited the
hopes of despairing prents in underdeveloped nations who can only
watch helplessly as their sons and daughters die of diseases that
barely touch children lucky enough to be born in rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this from the Economist: ``Of children who die before
their fifth birthday, 98 percent are in the developing world. Of
the millions who die prematurely of tuberculosis, malaria, measles,
tetanus, and whooping cough, all but a few thousand live in the
poor world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' generosity is aimed at creating a market for vaccines to
entice the behemoth pharmaceutical companies to deliver products to
those who desperately need them. If the drug makers could be
convinced that a market does _ or will _ exist, then perhaps they
might be willing to develop remedies for diseases common to poor
nations instead of focusing their research almost exclusively on
rich-world afflictions. The World Health Organization says that $56
billion is spent each year on health research, with less than 10
percent going to diseases that afflict 90 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
   One scourge in particular, malaria, continues to plague the poor
nations of the world because those who produce vaccines see no
possibility of a profit.
</P>
<P>
   It seems there is no other motive for a drug company. Don't
bother mentioning the words ``social conscience'' to a
pharmaceutical bigwig. He'll look at you with a glare that's the
visual equivalent of a lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I was doing my usual volunteering on Sunday
morning at the Soup Kitchen for Corporate Executives Who Were
Stupid Enough to Speak From the Heart, when I bumped into an old
acquaintance. He had, by diligence and degrees, climbed the ladder
at a well-known pharmaceutical giant. I couldn't imagine how he had
fallen on such hard times. As I ladled breakfast gruel into his tin
bowl, I could see he needed to talk. So I sat down with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a crazy idea,'' he began, ``so I wrote a memo to my
boss. I told him, `Let's do it! Let's do something for the common
good of man! Did you know that 200 million people suffer from
schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease of the intestines or bladder _
and hardly any of them are in the United States or Europe? Another
120 million suffer from lymphatic filariasis, another parasitic
ailment that causes painful, disfiguring swelling. And what of
malaria, river blindness, AIDS? Darn, I said, we're a drug company.
We can do something about this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, it makes good business sense,'' I pointed out. ``I
reminded him that countries plagued by bad health can't develop
economically. After all, companies need healthy workers to turn
healthy profits. If we can improve life for these people, we can
build our own market, create our own demand. As people get
healthier and more prosperous, they will have the money and desire
for more and better drugs of all kinds _ and here we are to supply
them. Imagine, everyone wins!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple enough proposition,'' I told my down-at-the-heels
acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too simple,'' he said. ``My boss scribbled me a note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Offered a few ideas of his own?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke for the entire drug industry,'' my acquaintance
muttered, adding, the note said, ``Too much trouble. Profit's not
there. Let them die. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' I said. ``Not very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote one more thing: `P.S. You're fired.' ''

   BOSTON -- When two prominent Boston businessmen reached a deal
with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1996,
their aim was to save the government $40 million a year in energy
costs. Now, the company run by Fred A. Siegel and Alan M. Leventhal
is suing HUD for more than $35 million over what they say was a
breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the case, scheduled to go to trial next month in Boston, is
not just about a contract. It also paints a harsh portrait of HUD
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, accusing him of making verbal threats and
sacrificing efficiency at the agency for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo has faced trouble in Boston before. In May, Cuomo released
a report accusing the city of racial discrimination, infuriating
Mayor Thomas M. Menino and prompting accusations of
headline-grabbing. This time, however, Cuomo is accused not only of
jeopardizing the goodwill of local leaders but also the good
standing of HUD, which could face severe costs if the plaintiffs
win their case.
</P>
<P>
   According to legal documents filed in the case last week in
Boston federal claims court, Cuomo abruptly canceled a contract
with Energy Capital Partners after an article in The Wall Street
Journal implied that the company's principals had won the contract
through political connections. Siegel and Leventhal are both major
fund-raisers for the Democratic Party and supporters of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper ran a correction three days later, and HUD has
admitted it was liable for canceling the contract. But Cuomo, the
legal brief alleges, did not back down from his initial action and
at times resorted to verbal threats to rid himself of the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Some time after Energy Capital filed its lawsuit in April 1997,
a HUD lawyer, Howard Glaser, called lawyers for the company and
``threatened to file a pleading that would falsely raise the
specter of a criminal investigation,'' the latest document charges.
Glaser also suggested that the plaintiffs ``consider the
ramifications publicly resulting from such an answer in deciding
whether to proceed with litigation,'' the filing says.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Cuomo allegedly called Leventhal. ``Secretary
Cuomo threatened Mr. Leventhal, stating in the strongest possible
terms'' that Energy Capital ``should drop the litigation and
warning of potential adverse ramifications to him and his business
interests from any failure to do so,'' the court document says.
</P>
<P>
   HUD has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and the agency's
lawyer in the case declined to comment last week. HUD's director of
public affairs, Ginny Terzano, said the latest ``finding of fact''
filed with the court is ``undoubtedly frivolous,'' comparing it to
the plaintiffs' earlier failed attempts in the case to force Cuomo
to give a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a frivolous attempt to drag the secretary away from
his duties into a litigation matter,'' she said. ``They have tried
this before, and the judge quashed it. This is old hat, and this
new attempt by the lawyers will be treated the same way by the
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Edward Damich is scheduled to begin hearing the case on
Oct. 5 in Boston federal claims court for a week, then the trial
will move to Washington the following week. The trial could move
back to Boston if it carries on longer.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Cuomo will testify. Last week, the lawyers
for Energy Capital notified HUD by letter that Cuomo would be
subpoenaed to testify. Cuomo is expected to contest that subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the trial is expected to focus on Cuomo's actions
not only in canceling the contract but also by allegedly
threatening the plaintiffs. Throughout the court document, the
company's lawyers contend they hold Cuomo personally responsible
for the dispute, saying, ``The termination of the contract was a
cynical exercise in political maneuvering determined at the very
top of the agency with absolutely no regard being shown'' for the
rights of Energy Capital or the ``best interests of the taxpayers,
the tens of thousands of low-income residents of energy-inefficient
apartments, or the property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This termination speaks volumes about the public's cynicism of
the operation of the federal government,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   The contract at the center of the case involved a program
designed by Energy Capital Partners, started in 1994 by The Beacon
Companies real estate development company and an affiliate of
Harvard Private Capital Group Inc., which manages Harvard
University's $13 billion endowment.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as the Affordable Housing Energy Loan
Program, or AHELP, would have financed purchasing and installing
energy systems in some of the nation's 4 million publicly
subsidized units. HUD determined that thousands of units subsidized
by HUD or financed through the Federal Housing Authority are
``energy-inefficient and consume more energy'' than if they were
equipped with more modern systems used in commercial buildings, the
court filing says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the document, HUD and the Energy Department
concluded in 1996 that some $5 billion in energy costs for
subsidized housing were the result of inefficient systems. The plan
by Energy Capital would loan money to building owners so they could
modernize their energy systems, then repay the loan from the
savings in energy costs. Improvements ranged from replacing
electric heating with natural gas to installing water-saving
toilets and were expected to cost about $4,000 per apartment.
</P>
<P>
   HUD announced the program on Sept. 11, 1996, and Energy Capital
launched a marketing effort and training program. In the months
that followed, the company said it spent $1.3 million to put AHELP
together.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 6, 1997, Cuomo learned that The Wall Street Journal
was planning to run an article about the Democratic fund-raising by
Leventhal and Siegal, implying they won the HUD contract as a
result of their efforts to assist Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo ordered the contract terminated one day before the article
appeared. Assistant HUD Secretary Nicolas P. Retsinas carried out
the order, writing a letter to Siegel a week later. Retsinas wrote
that the ``FHA entered into that agreement to promote the financing
of energy conservation measures in HUD-supported multifamily
housing'' _ not as the result of any political influence by Siegal
or Leventhal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court document, Cuomo told Terry McAuliffe, a
fund-raiser and friend of President Clinton, that Energy Capital
``would have made tens of millions of dollars'' from the HUD
contract. The conversation occurred, the document says, while Cuomo
and McAuliffe, who is putting up $1.35 million to help the Clintons
buy a house in New York, were watching the Oscar awards ceremony at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Capital claims Cuomo refused to meet with company
officials regarding the contract cancellation, ignoring their
denials of wielding political influence. In fact, Energy Capital
says Cuomo had other motivations for canceling the deal. When the
Journal article appeared, Cuomo knew he was under investigation by
HUD's inspector general for awarding other contracts, the court
filing alleges. ``In order to advance his own political ambitions
and to forestall any heightened inquiry of his own actions,
Secretary Cuomo caused the AHELP contract to be terminated because
of the impending article,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   In the Journal's correction, the newspaper said it had ``failed
to note that no one has said that HUD officials knew that the two
men were major Democratic fund-raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal and Siegel could not be reached for comment. But the
lawyer for Energy Capital Partners, Michael S. Gardener, said the
suit is in some ways as much for the public interest as for the
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program would have reduced energy costs by $40 million a
year for tens of thousands of residents of publicly subsidized and
insured housing,'' Gardener said. ``In fact, the program did not
require a penny of public funds and would have saved the taxpayers
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Gardener said, the company was left with no choice
but to sue, having been ignored by HUD despite repeated attempts
for meetings, both immediately after the newspaper article ran and
after the filing of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never desirable to have to sue our government,'' he
said. ``But in this case, we were left with no other choice. Even
more regrettable is the loss to the residents and the taxpayers
caused by HUD's contract termination.''

HOW THE COLOR OF BIG MONEY WILL SHADE CAMPAIGN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A mere eight months ago, when the last year of
the 20th century began, the ground rules for presidential politics
were well-established and well-understood.
</P>
<P>
   Nomination fights were getting costlier, but they still were run
on modest budgets, in many cases much less than Fortune 500
companies spend to roll out new household products.
</P>
<P>
   Small states like New Hampshire and Iowa, holding to their
heritage of personal politics, would require candidates to conduct
intimate, evocative campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Minor candidates still faced difficult odds, but the early
political contests offered them (and their new ideas) at least a
platform _ and a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for the presidency and the clash over issues, which
a team of British journalists once described as ``an American
melodrama,'' constituted one of the most riveting spectacles in the
nation's civic life.
</P>
<P>
   All that was still part of the American political tradition when
1999 began. None of it holds true as we near 2000, and the climax
of a race for the White House that is also a race for the record
books.
</P>
<P>
   No presidential nomination fight ever cost as much as the 2000
campaign will. None revved up so early as this campaign did. None
could end as abruptly as the current campaign. And none has been
about so little, with so little debate, so little disagreement, so
little at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign that marks the end of the 20th century also marks
the end of a political era, providing ample evidence that the
politics of the next century _ more expensive, more sterile, more
inscrutable to the average American _ will be different in profound
ways from anything that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   The whole political world _ all the assumptions that lie beneath
it, all the actions that animate it, all the factors that shape it
_ has been altered.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of much of this is money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen this much money this early have this much
impact and replace to such an extraordinary degree real voters,''
said Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, a group
that monitors fund-raising practices. ``The danger is that big
money may have chosen the candidates even before the voters get a
chance to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the midsummer reporting period, George W. Bush, the
Texas governor, had raised more than $37 million for his GOP
nomination campaign, nearly double the impressive amount (almost
$20 million) that Vice President Al Gore raised for his Democratic
campaign. The $10.6 million that Bush raised in Texas alone was
more than nine other presidential candidates raised in the entire
country. In addition, magazine publisher Steve Forbes raised nearly
$10 million and can draw upon his own fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race marks a substantial change,'' said Anthony Corrado,
a Colby College political scientist who is an expert on campaign
finance. ``It has generally been the case in the last few elections
that money has played the role of being the first primary. What's
different about this race is that George W. Bush has not only won
the money primary, but he's the only one in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That has implications not only for the process of picking a
nominee, but also for the result. Business school professors from
the University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business and
Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management
published a study in the journal Economics and Politics last year
suggesting that candidates who raise large sums do more than fill
their coffers. They also lead voters to conclude that they have
large amounts of popular support.
</P>
<P>
   That theory is borne out in two important test groups this year.
The first group is New Hampshire Republicans, who, according to a
new Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll, are flocking to Bush's side. The
second is a savvy group of insiders, Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Bush has the support of about two-thirds of GOP House members, an
astonishing achievement given the innate caution of elected
officials who themselves must face the voters next November.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the financial arms race for the 2000 election is
far greater than it was even recently.
</P>
<P>
   Only a dozen years ago, in 1988, the Republicans and Democrats
stretched to gather a group of donors who would contribute
$100,000. By the last election, in 1996, the target group was
$250,000 donors. Four years ago, the Republicans were able to
persuade only two companies to contribute more than $1 million in
the unregulated party funds known as ``soft money.'' In the 2000
campaign, GOP leaders are hoping to attract 100 such donors _ and
the Democrats have vowed, somewhat less convincingly, to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of money-raising hasn't escaped public attention;
eight of ten New Hampshire voters surveyed in the latest Boston
Globe/WBZ-TV poll said they considered it somewhat or very
important to have a candidate who stresses the issue of
campaign-finance overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the two national parties raised more than $55 million
in soft money in the first half of this year, compared with about
$31 million in the first six months of 1995. The
telecommunications, securities, insurance, and real-estate
industries each donated more than $3 million in the first six
months of the year, according to Common Cause, the self-styled
citizens' lobby.

<TEXT>
<P>
   But the big change is a result of more than simply the scale of
the finances. It is a result also of the pace of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, presidential elections begin slowly, with much of
the maneuvering _ the jousting for positions, the jostling for
influential backers and workers, the jockeying for public attention
_ occurring beneath the surface. Political professionals, knowing
that the campaign season began with contests in Iowa and New
Hampshire in February and concluded with primaries in New Jersey
and California in June, inevitably counseled candidates to think of
the race as a marathon, not a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   This primary campaign is a sprint. It begins in late January or
early February with caucuses in Iowa, followed probably eight days
later by a primary here in New Hampshire, with contests only 28
days later in the huge and expensive states of California and New
York, which are to hold their primaries on March 7. On that day,
votes are scheduled for important states such as Connecticut,
Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Ohio, which in the past held
critical but separate primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The result is like a prime racing day at Rockingham: a fast
track and a firm turf.
</P>
<P>
   This works to strengthen the position of a candidate who opens
up a lead quickly, but it also may make it easier for a
well-positioned contender to make a late kick. In the Democratic
race, the clustered primaries that appeared to be a big edge for
Gore might instead be a disadvantage, for it would be more
difficult for him to respond in 2000 to a poor early showing
against former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who, according
to the Globe/WBZ-TV poll, is breathing down Gore's neck in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a millennial campaign,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at California's Claremont Graduate University.
``Everything is speeded up to warp speed, so why not the
presidential campaign? As difficult as it was for people who are
unknown and not rich in the past, it is more difficult than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign schedule had the unintended effect of increasing
the importance of campaign money, rewarding the strong and
punishing the weak, and thus a process that once was performed by
voters is instead, increasingly, dictated by the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front loading worked in a different way we expected,
because it allowed the money to be the winnower,'' said Thomas D.
Rath, the New Hampshire GOP committeeman and a prominent campaign
adviser to former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander, who left the
race last month. ``Everyone understood that if you didn't have
money you couldn't play. But if you couldn't show any strength you
couldn't get the money. It was circular.''
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Alexander conducted a textbook campaign, visiting
small-town newspaper editors, pausing in suburban living rooms,
gaining a vision of the American landscape that comes from the seat
of a tractor in an Iowa cornfield. He stuck to that strategy even
as the rules were changing, penalizing rather than rewarding him
for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander is not alone. Other underdogs have found it almost
impossible to win attention, support, or even faint signs of
encouragement in the new atmosphere _ all factors that nudged
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio out of the Republican race in
early summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sense the discouragement of the minor candidates,''
said Charles Weed, a political scientist at New Hampshire's Keene
State College. ``The Republicans this time have fund-raisers
instead of open houses. The Democratic race doesn't seem as open as
earlier races were. It's exclusive, in part because there are only
two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a different character for the New Hampshire
primary, which once was a chance for voters to encounter
candidates, for candidates to have campaign-trail epiphanies, for
Americans to gauge the mettle and take the measure of presidential
contenders in everyday settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Hampshire primary used to be about kicking the tires
and shaking the hands, and this time it is kind of like a beauty
pageant _ and it isn't even a pageant, because there is only one
beauty,'' said Deborah Arnesen, a Democrat who ran for governor in
New Hampshire in 1992. ``George W. Bush comes here not looking for
the state's support but to create the illusion that there's a
primary that he in the end will win. It's a game, but it's
political Monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The money race and the fast pace of the campaign have stoked a
struggle but not a debate. The two Democratic candidates are out of
the New Democrat mold and give priority to issues such as economic
growth, racial reconciliation, environmental protection, and
continued support of Social Security. The Republican candidates
differ on little, with general agreement on taxes (lower and
generally flatter), abortion (opposition) and gun control (modest)
and with the only skirmishes occurring on matters of nuance and
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there has been surprisingly little conflict on matters
of policy, in part because the views of some of the leading
contenders, including Bush and former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole, have not been refined at this stage in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the summer of 1987, seven months before the first
political contests of the 1988 Democratic campaign, Representative
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Governor Michael S. Dukakis of
Massachusetts were sparring over trade matters, with the two
actually debating the issue at an Iowa forum. There has been no
similar confrontation in either party thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncomfortable fact is that people who duck issues maintain
popularity, and that is happening in both parties to some extent,''
said former Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, a Democratic
presidential contender in 1988. ``And in the case of Gore, he's
putting out so many issues that nothing is sticking.''

THE ADMAN IS A PC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are computers more creative than humans?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps _ at least when it comes to developing ad concepts,
according to an experiment comparing ideas that a specially
programmed computer generated with those dreamed up by humans.
</P>
<P>
   To convey that a particular brand of computer is user-friendly,
for instance, the computer came up with the notion of having a
bouquet of flowers come out of a computer screen. The human
concept, on the other hand, called for a lipstick imprint on the
screen, as if a woman had kissed it. The computer's idea was judged
better by a panel of ordinary people, not trained in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   An essay titled ``Creative Sparks'' reports the findings in the
current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the exercise was not to minimize human creativity,
or to compare computers with humans, but to explore the mechanical
aspects of creativity, so that what makes humans human can be
better understood, said Sorin Solomon, a physics professor at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He co-authored the report with
marketing colleagues Jacob Goldenberg and David Mazursky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in ourselves, we hope that humans are really something
special. I still believe we are,'' said Solomon, a particle
physicist by training, in a telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And the way Solomon and his colleagues are trying to prove that
is through a process of elimination, by seeing what aspects of
human endeavor can be performed just as well by computers and which
can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these efforts of reductionism of mine are not because I
really believe that everything can be reduced to physics, to
mechanics. It's in order to take away what can be reduced, and
leave in all the splendor the things that cannot be reduced,''
Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his work as a particle physicist, studying the
natural rules that govern microscopic particles, Solomon became
intrigued with trying to find similar rules that might explain
human activities, if they are broken down into small enough parts
to be studied. He calls this effort ``microscopic representation.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the advertising experiment, he and his colleagues worked
with advertising professionals and analyzed award-winning ads
(designed by humans), to come up with discrete formulas to explain
what makes a great ad.
</P>
<P>
   These formulas, or algorithms, were then plugged into a
computer, which then came up with ad concepts of its own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common formulas for an award-winning ad, for
instance, turns out to be what the researchers call the ``pictorial
analogy template,'' in which a symbol, like a bouquet of flowers,
is put on a product, like a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The humans who came up with ad ideas for the experiment were
highly educated people like professors and scientists, but not
necessarily advertising professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ideas from both computers and humans were given to
artists to turn into advertisements. The judges compared those ads
with each other, as well as to some of the human-made award-winning
ads that had served as the basis for some of the computer formulas.
</P>
<P>
   All hope is not lost for humans, though. Even though the
computer-generated ideas beat out those dreamed up by humans in the
experiment, the judges found the best ads to actually be the
award-winning ones (created by humans) that served as the basis of
the computer-formulated ones.
</P>
<P>
   And advertising officials in Boston scoffed at the notion that a
computer could ever take the place of the most talented
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put our best creative minds against computers any time,''
said Bethany Kendall, president of the 7,000-member Advertising
Club of Greater Boston, the largest advertising and communications
trade group in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holliday, one of the founders of ad agency Hill Holliday
Connors Cosmopulos and now an assistant professor of mass
communications at Boston University, said, ``There's an awful lot
of dumb, boring advertising that a computer could probably do just
as well, but the really great advertising takes in a lot of factors
that I don't think a computer can.''

BUDGET SHOWDOWN IS NOT ALL SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- While taxpayers do a slow burn, two powerful and
ambitious Democrats appear to fiddle on a State House balcony.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts budget is more than two months late, and the
battle-hardened egos of House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham have become public enemy number one
for many.
</P>
<P>
   But issues are embedded along with ambition in the glacial
negotiations that occur above the hundreds of hassled bureaucrats
who scurry across Beacon Hill. And, in Birmingham's and Finneran's
minds, the decisions they make will set the state's course for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are education funding, the MBTA, tax relief, the
senior pharmacy program, and how best to use the state's share of
the national tobacco settlement. Six delegates from the House and
Senate have met for hundreds of hours since late June, poring over
hundreds of line items in a $20.8 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   But, their work largely done, they have not met for more than
two weeks. Instead, two men face each other in a political chess
match to advance, in each case, a philosophy of government and,
possibly, a winning gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The differences concern how to manage government in robust
economic times. In many ways, trying to reconcile those differences
may be more difficult than it would be in a fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For Finneran, the approach is a cautious one that uses the
swelling revenue stream to tame ``budget busters'' like the MBTA,
reduces the income-tax burden, and avoids the temptation to
dramatically expand social services. For the speaker, the lessons
of recession are still fresh a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   For Birmingham, flush economic times allow the state to offer
more services to those in need. Instead of cutting the tax rate,
Birmingham would use a substantial portion of that money for social
purposes, with dramatically increased drug benefits for seniors
being one example.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, morale is low among the staff who crunch the
numbers and await a Vatican-like smoke signal from Birmingham's
balcony. ``Without a high-tech listening device, it's tough to tell
what's happening,'' said one overworked State House source who can
see the meetings from his window.
</P>
<P>
   The endgame, however, might be near. The conference committee of
three negotiators each from the House and Senate is scheduled to
meet again this week, following optimistic comments from key
lawmakers last week that a breakthrough could be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But to break the impasse, Birmingham and Finneran will have to
yield on one or more issues that each man has deemed crucial. For
the Senate president, that issue is education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham and his Ways and Means chairman, Senator Mark C.
Montigny of New Bedford, have pledged $245 million to fully fund
the final year of the Education Reform Act of 1993. Such a
commitment is vital, the senators say, to maintain the momentum
that has narrowed the funding disparity among districts and has
bolstered education resources across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran and his Ways and Means chairman, Representative Paul R.
Haley of Weymouth, counter that the Education Reform Act was
intended to elevate every school district to a ``foundation level''
of funding. That has been accomplished, they say, and $70 million
of the Senate's proposal should be diverted instead to
early-childhood education.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are another stumbling block. Finneran and the House have
approved a tax-rate reduction to 5.75 percent from 5.95 percent. No
such cut passed the Senate. Both chambers voted against an
incremental phase-out of the capital-gains tax, but approved
differing forms of tax relief for low- and moderate-income groups.
</P>
<P>
   On the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Finneran is
holding firm to his position that now is the time to change the
MBTA's financing. Under the House's ``forward-funding'' plan, the
current 18-month gap between MBTA expenses and payment would be
abolished, $325 million in short-term debt would be paid off over
20 years, and a revenue stream of one-fifth of the sales tax would
be dedicated to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the negotiations said Senate leaders believe
the plan is too expensive. But Haley counters that annual debt
payments would decrease and that the agency's funding sources would
be shared more equitably by the communities that actually use the
MBTA.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran and Birmingham also differ on pharmacy coverage for
elders. Montigny has told the Senate president he is committed to
doubling the current $750-a-year pharmacy benefit and raising
income-eligibility levels. The plan would double the program's cost
to $60 million. An additional $40 million would be used from the
tobacco settlement for higher-income elders hit with catastrophic
drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The House would expand pharmacy benefits to $1,000 from $750 per
year, but would not commit new state funds. Haley also has branded
as irresponsible the budget's use of tobacco settlement money,
which may not arrive in fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If the state is to avoid emergency funding for October, the
impasse will have to be broken by next week. Five days are then
allowed to print the budget, followed by 10 days for Governor Paul
Cellucci to review the document and submit vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Once movement occurs on the big issues, the rest of the budget
will fall into place, Montigny and Haley have said. In the
meantime, the balcony sessions are expected to continue. And lip
readers will be in greater demand.

DOCTORS RAISE CONCERNS OVER SOCCER HEADING

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one of the sport's most arresting sights: A soccer player
lunges under a streaking ball and blasts it with her head into the
opponent's net.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a practice attracting growing concern, especially
for younger players, with recent studies suggesting that the
repeated blows to the head can cause impairment in some mental
functions, such as concentration, memory, and verbal ability.
</P>
<P>
   However, as hundreds of thousands of children take the field for
a new season in America's fastest-growing team sport, especially
after the US women's World Cup title, the level of risk involved
has yet to be resolved to anyone's satisfaction. There's even less
agreement on what, if anything, schools, parents and coaches should
do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cause for concern to those of us who are involved with
kids' sports safety,'' said Dr. Lyle Micheli, a sports medicine
specialist at Children's Hospital in Boston who has published
research on soccer injuries and has reviewed the scanty literature
to date. ``But the youth soccer organizations in the United States
are rather defensive about the whole subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Micheli said during the making of a video for the US Soccer
Federation he was asked to delete a section that raised the
possible link between the maneuver, called heading, and brain
damage.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some coaches and administrators in youth soccer
downplay the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that heading the ball would cause head
injuries,'' said Ed Englander, a longtime coach and board member of
Newton (Mass.) Girls Soccer who has three daughters, all soccer
players. ``My 22-year-old daughter is in medical school and is an
accomplished musician, so if heading the ball caused any problems
it would be a surprise to me,'' he said, adding that he's heard
little if any concern from other parents.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same Boston suburb, an official of Newton Youth
Soccer says the organization takes the matter seriously. ``There's
obvious concern,'' said Gary Buchman, a vice president. ``And we
advocate that children under 11 should not be heading the ball. We
talk to coaches about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Journal of the American Medical Association is
scheduled to publish new findings on the issue, but they probably
won't settle the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent study on the heading question was presented last
month at a meeting of the American Psychological Association. In
that report, neuropsychologist David Abwender of the State
University of New York at Brockport and Danielle Symons, a doctoral
student at the University of Florida, tested the mental performance
of 26 college soccer players and six current or former soccer
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer players did significantly less well on five of 11
tests than did a group of swimmers used for comparison, said
Abwender and Symons, contending that their study reinforces
previous findings about the long-term effects of soccer headers.
</P>
<P>
   Some other studies, however, have not found such a link.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Kibler, an orthopedic surgeon in Lexington, Ky.,
said he and other physicians are preparing a position statement on
header safety for the US Soccer Federation. He said past studies
showing brain damage risk directly from heading have been flawed
due to their limitations. But the issue, he said, has ``some
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me the most is that we don't know how the force
was applied'' to the players' heads, Kibler said. ``How fast was
the ball going?'' Old leather balls, if saturated with moisture,
would be much heavier missiles than today's synthetic-covered
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents also worry about coeducational play, in which boys'
more powerful kicks could put girls at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Boyd of Bethesda, Md., said that last April a ball
hurtling off the foot of a boy struck his 12-year-old daughter,
Hollis, in the side of the head. She did not lose consciousness,
but later that day she could not read or write. Brain scans
detected no brain injury, and after 6 1/2 weeks she recovered.
Still, ``we have lingering concerns about long-term damage,'' said
Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, soccer has a low injury rate compared to other contact
sports, such as football. Among younger players, 85 percent of
injuries are minor and mainly affect feet and legs. Older players
suffer more serious injuries. Some studies have found that
soccer-playing girls are injured about twice as often as boys.
According to National Collegiate Athletic Association data, both
female and male soccer players have less than a 1 in 1,000 chance
of suffering a concussion during a game or practice.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, about 6 million children under the age of 12
play on some sort of soccer team annually.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer controversy comes at a time of growing concern about
head injuries in sports and how coaches and trainers handle them _
in many cases, sending players with concussions back into the game
too soon, say injury specialists.
</P>
<P>
   A concussion is the temporary confusion or loss of consciousness
that can follow a head injury, as a result of the jelly-like brain
being slammed against the inner skull. Heading the ball in soccer
doesn't usually cause a concussion: Collisions between players or a
kick to the head may do so, however.
</P>
<P>
   The studies on heading have been criticized for failing to
separate the effects of heading alone from more serious concussive
injuries the players may have suffered in collisions.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, however, almost half the young soccer players
complained of concussion-like symptoms _ ringing ears, nausea, or
double vision _ after heading the ball. An orthopedic surgeon, Dr.
David Janda, led the study for the Ann Arbor Institute for
Preventive Sports Medicine in which 57 children aged 11 to 14 were
followed for three years with neurological testing.
</P>
<P>
   By the second year, the researchers saw a statistical link
between the number of headers a player made and lower scores on
verbal tests. In light of this suggestive data, Janda, whose two
daughters play soccer, recommended that children use helmets and
lighter soccer balls while learning heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't abolish heading. But if you can make a ball that is
as light as a beach ball for practice drills, when the coach
bounces the ball off a head 10 times it won't have such an
impact,'' Janda said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hunt, director of the Warriors Soccer Club in Stoughton
and coach of under-11 boys, believes some of the damage may come
from players hitting the ball with the top of their head, and not
with the forehead, the strongest part of the skull. Children may
complain of headaches if they hit a ball with the top of their
heads, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   When they first learn to play soccer many girls close their eyes
so they can't see where they head the ball, said Warriors under-13
girl's coach Mario Cardoso. ``They hit the ball wrong, get hurt and
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because a ball hits the forehead doesn't mean it won't
affect the rest of the head, said Lyn Turkstra, a head injury
researcher at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
Turkstra said whether repetitive non-concussive heading is harmful
in the long term is still inconclusive. ``But we can't just relax.
We certainly don't have enough data that says it is or isn't
benign,'' Turkstra said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Friedman of Stoughton, Mass. recalls that when her
children were younger, the coaches didn't even talk to the boys
about hitting the ball with the head. Her daughter, Bari Seronick,
13, and her son David, 9, play for the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the difference is whether you are 8, 9 or
10. Your brain is still in there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauren Richman of Newton said from her experience, the
coaches do encourage heading at a young age. Although her husband,
Joel Trachtman, is concerned about the reports, Richman said, ``I'm
always so proud of Hannah when she hits a header.'' She says she
wonders whether occasional heading would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reports make her anxious, Debby Stein-Sharpe said
she will not tell her children not to do headers. Her oldest son,
Nate, 11, plays for the Canton (Mass.) Green Machine, and hopes to
play collegiate or professional soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty good at headers. But I hate to see him do it. I
cringe,'' Stein-Sharpe said. ``If they outlawed headers, I truly
would welcome that. But until then, I can't ask him to forgo
them.'' Nate Sharpe said once every two weeks or so he and his
teammates practice heading the ball past the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Micheli says that until further studies clarify the risks,
``there should be a yellow warning light signal going out.''
</P>
<P>
   His current recommendation is that heading not be taught until
age 12, when the young players' coordination and neck strength
makes it possible for them to learn the skill properly. ``I think
I'm becoming more cautious about this,'' he said. Noting that
coaches will say they haven't seen players injured while heading,
Micheli said, ``The coach isn't going to see it'' because the
damage is subtle, ``but I'm concerned about what the kids' IQ is
going to be 20 years from now.''

FEEDS OF DARING BY A CHAMPION EATER

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Hungry? How about a plump, juicy, three-pound
hamburger awash in cheese and garnished with five pounds of
toppling French fries.
</P>
<P>
   You're not that hungry? Well, Shaun Reilly is.
</P>
<P>
   At Eagle's Deli the platter is called the Reilly Burger, named
after the man, the legend, the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   About once a month, Reilly goes into Eagle's Deli and eats,
plenty. What began as a friendly competition with his cronies has
become local lore. In fact, eight pictures of Reilly's prodigious
eating accomplishments adorn the walls of the Cleveland Circle
deli. Reilly is the local guru of gluttony, holding the record for
the most food eaten there in one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally I thought it was pretty cool to have my pictures on
the wall,'' said Reilly. But the burgers got bigger, and the hunger
for more fame grew with them. ``I thought, `Wow, if I do it,
they'll name a hamburger after me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And so they did. What makes his feats intriguing is that Reilly
looks more like an everyman than a power fork lifter. Reilly, 21,
from Dracut, is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds. He's a
senior at Boston University, majoring in chemistry and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of eating, I've never met his equal,'' said Andrew
Lemoff, who has repeatedly watched Reilly in action. ``He's the
only guy I've ever met who can spend $18 at Burger King to feed
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At this deli near Boston College, Reilly racks up a victory for
Boston University. ``Not even the BC football players will try to
eat'' the Reilly burger, said Mark Seland, the deli manager, who
added, ``Reilly has a following here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably feed a small village with this meal,'' said
Lemoff.
</P>
<P>
   To be more specific, the Reilly burger is six eight-ounce
hamburger patties, each with two slices of American cheese. One
pathetic bun tries to enclose all the beef. A separate tray of
fries flanks the 9-inch tall burger. To wash it all down, Reilly
drinks three 32-ounce orange sodas. He has calculated that his meal
has at least 20,000 calories, almost 10 times a normal daily
intake.
</P>
<P>
   Such mass consumption cannot be undertaken impetuously. Reilly
has techniques to get the food down. He says he stretches his
stomach by eating a lot the day before the big chow-down, and eats
little the day of the feat.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent sitting with a reporter in tow, Reilly took almost
two hours to knock back the namesake burger platter. He started
with the fries. Later, he strategically unfolded the burger and ate
the two halves like open-faced sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   When he started to get full and lost gusto, the going toughened.
``My jaw is starting to get tired,'' he said. But Reilly wasn't
done. He bounced back and forth between the fries and the burger,
paying equal attention to each. When he finished the burger, the
few remaining fries seemed like a whole plate, he said. Soon, they
too were downed.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has been a big eater since his childhood. He recalls
going to Thanksgiving dinner at an aunt's house, who made sure to
cook another big turkey to supplement the 20-pounder she already
had. In his freshman year of high school, Reilly says he ate seven
large cheese pizzas in a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   At Eagle's Deli, burgers aren't his only target. He's eaten
eight chicken breasts, each with cheese and a slice of bacon, with
a couple of pounds of fries on the side _ for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in some ways, Reilly is a picky eater. He avoids
tomatoes, onions, and lettuce on his burgers, and he ignores the
pickles on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it must be said that eating this much food is not a great
idea. ``It's terrible for the digestive system,'' said Julie Seed,
nutritionist at the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at Tufts Medical
Center. ``To make room for the food, there's all kinds of
stretching . . . It's very unhealthy.'' Even Reilly said, ``I do
understand that eating a three-pound hamburger is not good for my
waistline.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as the Metallica song ``Sad but True'' played from the
speakers overhead, he popped the last French fry into his mouth.

WHAT A STATE THESE STATES ARE IN! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One problem with the Internet is that an author's name is often
dropped from an item that is widely circulated in cyberspace. For
instance, despite an exhaustive investigation (20 minutes at the
library), we don't know who concocted some funny state mottoes that
have been making the e-mail rounds. However, humor writer Dave
Barry is our prime suspect. Here are a few of the less-offensive
mottoes:
</P>
<P>
   --Arizona: ``But It's A Dry Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   --Florida: ``Ask Us About Our Grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   --Idaho: ``More Than Just Potatoes. . . . Well OK, We're Not,
but the Potatoes Sure Are Real Good.''
</P>
<P>
   --Indiana: ``Two Billion Years, Tidal-Wave Free.''
</P>
<P>
   --Kansas: ``First Of The Rectangle States.''
</P>
<P>
   --Massachusetts: ``Our Taxes Are Lower Than Sweden's (for Most
Tax Brackets).''
</P>
<P>
   --New Mexico: ``Lizards Make Excellent Pets.''
</P>
<P>
   --Rhode Island: ``We're Not Really An Island.''
</P>
<P>
   --Vermont: ``Yep.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Let's continue with stately questions. Which is the
most frequent final letter of a state's name? And which letter
comes in second? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: A lighthouse in the waters off Burlington, Vt., is known
as the Phoney Baloney Lighthouse because it is unauthorized and
unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``Trips start when the last familiar face recedes from
view, and end the instant one reappears'' _ author Lance Free. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: You're a man on the road who's about to shave and
have just discovered you didn't pack your shaving cream. No time to
get another can? Slap some shampoo on your face: The key
ingredients are the same as in shaving cream. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Zion, Ill., it is illegal to give lighted
cigars to dogs, cats, or other pets. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Good idea: Many Walt Disney World employees (or, in Disneyspeak,
``cast members'') and Disney Cruise Line members now wear badges
that list, in addition to their names, their home cities, states,
or countries. That often leads to conversations with visitors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Net travelers: The National Travel Survey reports that 6.7 million
American adults used the Internet or an on-line service to book
travel reservations in 1998, up from 5.4 million in 1997. &QL; 
 &QL; 
That's a lotta people: India's population has broken through the 1
billion barrier. That means it has four times as many people than
the United States in a land that is only 40 percent as big. The
only other country to top 1 billion is China, with 1.27 billion
people. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Twenty-one states end in ``a.'' Coming in second
is the letter ``s,'' appearing at the end of Arkansas, Illinois,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Texas, and, if you use the official name,
State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. We thank Warren
Himmelberger of Littleton, Mass.

<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ With the husband off in Argentina on a trip with
The Boys, I figured it was time for a Girl trip. And, since I'm a
spa afficionado but don't like to go alone, I called my sister in
Indiana to see if she'd like to meet me for a whirlwind three days
of healthy California living.
</P>
<P>
   To explain how unusual this suggestion must have sounded to my
sister, I must present a little of her background. She is my elder
sister, wife of a Lutheran minister in a town with more churches
than filling stations, and mother of five. Not only has she never
been to a spa, but she has only heard vague, disturbing things
about what they do in those self-indulgent and possibly decadent
places.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, her first questions: ``Is it true that the women walk
around nude all the time? Will we have to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   I assured her that the only time I was nude together with other
women was when we all sunbathed at a Florida spa, surrounded by
four high walls and listening gleefully to the male spagoers
shouting and yelling as they played their daily nude water
volleyball game in their own private pool many walls away.
</P>
<P>
   Her next question: ``Will they weigh us?''
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, for background: Sally has, over her 30
years of marriage _ how shall I put it _ made thousands of heavy
Midwestern stick-to-the-bones casseroles for thousands of church
suppers, and consumed a bit of those dishes herself. Given her
other duties as a mother and pastor's wife to a congregation of
4,000 members, she has sometimes neglected to get to the gym, the
tennis court, the treadmill, and the Nautilus. She is, shall we
say, aerobically challenged.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I didn't think they would have to weigh her, but I
didn't tell her that they would probably take her coffee away, and
to my sister, this could cause mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But we hadn't seen each other in a long time, and she was game,
and her kids threatened that if she didn't take me up on my offer,
one of them would go in her place. So she made the elaborate
arrangements that a pastor's wife must make to leave town in the
middle of the week. First, she had to trade the Bible study she was
supposed to lead with another woman. ``I was supposed to start
Exodus Monday, but I got the research person for Exodus to change
with me for Genesis, and she'll do Exodus, and I'll do Genesis
later,'' she said. Fair enough. Then, she had to cancel out of a
luncheon for 33 women on Tuesday, for which she was supposed to
make the hot casserole. ``I'll take cheese curls and pickles over
to the house of the woman giving the lunch and tell her to just
make cold sandwiches this time,'' she said, with devil-may-care
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all was that she had to skip choir practice, and when
she told the choir members where she was going, they all laughed.
``No one in Fort Wayne,'' she explained, ``does spas.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, though, and we met at the airport in California and
drove together to the tiny, artsy town of Ojai located over a
35-mile stretch of brown mountains from Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The Oaks at Ojai, we discovered, was the perfect spa for a
novice such as my sister. It is small and compact, re-created from
a funky old hotel in the center of town. We were not, thankfully,
greeted with a battery of scales and measurements and
official-looking athletes in neon Spandex showing off their lean
muscle mass. We were greeted with a basket of grapes that made us
realize why the fruit in our Eastern grocery stores that we call
grapes has nothing to do with California grapes. With these sweet
morsels, who needs candy?
</P>
<P>
   Everything but the swimming pool is snuggled compactly into the
ground floor of the hotel, including a huge exercise room with a
window overlooking the Topa Topa mountains, a whirlpool, a room of
weight machines, a dining room, a meeting room, and a front lobby
with a working fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   The spa is owned and run by Don and Sheila Cluff, who also own a
newer small spa in Palm Springs. Sheila Cluff, a vivacious little
dynamo, is the heart and spirit of the spa. She was a professional
figure skater with the late Sonja Henie while still a teenager, and
now, somewhere in her 60s, she looks like Henie did then, with the
same fit body she had when she skated. In her morning pep talk, she
tells guests that she weighed 95 pounds as a skater, but when she
started college ``I was depressed and I blew up to a massive 130
pounds!'' As she worked herself back to fighting weight, for her,
she picked up health tips and a philosophy that is inspiring to
those guests who need it. ``Make it an 80-20 proposition,'' she
says of the good and bad habits of eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out for a big dinner, go ahead and have a cocktail,
but remember that that's your 20 percent bad food. I love
cheesecake, and when I eat a piece of it, I want it to be the best,
but I don't eat it every day,'' she tells people. ``My cheesecake
is part of the bad 20 percent of that day's diet.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the spa offered Sally was a cup of
coffee. While some spas are adamant about eliminating caffeine from
the diet, this one, luckily, was not so rigid.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in late evening, just in time for the relaxing and
restful yoga class that prepares one for sleep. After a long drive,
it was heaven. And easy.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of early morning walks are scheduled daily, and we
signed up for our respective hikes: Mine was a 7 a.m. ``brisk''
3-mile walk with Sheila Cluff leading and a promise of ``great
aerobic benefits.'' Sally's was the 7:30 a.m. ``leisurely 1
1/2-mile stroll through downtown Ojai,'' so that she could check
out the residential rose gardens and look into the shop windows and
galleries to see what she could buy to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff keeps up a very brisk pace, just fast enough that you can
still talk while you walk, and she talks a blue streak but is so
entertaining that you forget when listening that you're walking for
a purpose. During our three miles we heard about the Cluff family
of four children and two grandchildren, the years on the pro
skating circuit and later as a skating Radio City Rockette, and the
frenetic pace of owning and running two spas, traveling back and
forth each week to both, in addition to attending fitness symposia,
lecturing all over the country, and taking a version of her spa on
a variety of Caribbean, Central American, and European cruises each
year.
</P>
<P>
   On her walk, Sally found out that the beautiful mission tower in
the center of Ojai is now the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff teaches some of the classes; we took a most beneficial
stretch class from her, having missed by two minutes the power yoga
class taught by one of those tyrannical yogi dictators who refuses
to let latecomers in one minute after she has begun her session.
Perhaps it was better for Sally's sake. I didn't like the thought
of her getting twisted up in all the hanging ropes that the power
yoga class was rumored to use anyway. We took a low-back
conditioning class which, my sister said, helped her problem in
that area. We also found some fun fitness toys at these classes
that we've not seen in the East yet, namely the gigantic Flexaball,
around which you can strength-train your abdomen, rear end, and
thighs, if you can keep your balance on it, and the colorful rubber
snakes used in the pool for aquatoning. Sally had a little trouble
staying on top of hers, claiming that her body fat made her bounce
to the top of the water before she could do the requisite
movements. She enjoyed herself nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   No one demanded that we attend every class, so we eschewed the
more vigorous advanced step classes. In a similarly laissez-faire
attitude, guests at this spa, unlike at some of the tonier and
pricier spas, were dressed haphazardly in whatever sweats they wore
at home. They also came in all sizes and ages, and Sally was
thrilled to see that plenty of the guests were not only older, but
bigger, and flabbier, than she.
</P>
<P>
   On our final morning, with all the easy hikes she could have
chosen, my newly toned sister picked the 6-mile, 6 a.m. hike
straight up into the mountains overlooking this fertile valley, and
so I, with some trepidation, joined her. The only difference I
noticed between her and Sheila Cluff by this time was that Sally
took her camera along, to stop and shoot the sights. Cluff went on
at a brisker pace, but when I finally suggested turning back toward
the spa and breakfast, it was my spa-seasoned, newly invigorated
sister who balked. ``But we haven't gotten to the top of the
mountain yet!'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   Then I remembered that she, for all her lack of visits to the
gym, is a born walker, once skied better and faster than I, and
still, out of boredom, runs over to her daughter's house to paint
and paper the walls between choir practice and Bible study. Her
stamina, I found, is intact.

ALL ABOARD FOR A GRAND RAILWAY ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE GRAND CANYON RAILWAY IN NORTHERN ARIZONA _ I have
seen the future, and it is nearly a century old.
</P>
<P>
   Perched in an observation car while watching the juniper trees
slip past, our three-person family is riding the rails 65 miles
northward from the city of Williams to the Grand Canyon. This is
the way most folks reached the canyon during the first quarter of
the 20th century, but it's also an experience that was slowly
killed off by the automobile following World War II. Now it's back
and thriving, to the point that it will likely attract about
175,000 camera-pointing passengers like us this year.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's only about 3 percent of the people who annually visit
Grand Canyon National Park. But faced with roads and parking areas
that are often choked, The National Park Service beginning in 2002
plans to require canyon day-trippers to leave their cars outside
the front gates and board a light-rail system. That means
alternative forms of transportation to the park _ including the
Grand Canyon Railway _ will likely flourish. Ironically, the very
car that killed off the train is helping to resurrect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask me how long it takes the train to reach
the bottom of the canyon,'' announces Chris Davis, one of the two
passenger-service attendants in our car. ``I tell them, `About 30
seconds from the time it jumps the track.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a joke, see? We're traveling only as far as the South Rim.
Still, this isn't an inexpensive journey. The 630 people on the
12-car train this morning have paid anywhere from $24.95 to $119.95
per ticket round-trip, depending on their age and which of five
classes of travel they've chosen. What's more, the scenery we're
looking at is less than dramatic. It begins with the Ponderosa pine
of the Kaibab National Forest and ends with the gentle curves of
Coconino Canyon, but the flat miles of rangeland in between are
heavy on grass and sagebrush. The only view we'll get of the Grand
Canyon before we reach the rim will last 10, maybe 15, seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell customer service,'' our engineer, Sam Lanter,
explained to us in Williams just before he climbed into the cab of
Engine Number 4960, a steam-powered locomotive that was built in
1923 but has been restored at a cost of $1.5 million. Indeed, the
GCR attracts riders by creating a theme-park atmosphere that
includes a hotel, restaurant, museum, two gift shops, a pre-trip
Wild West show, and musicians who stroll the aisles of the train.
There are more than two dozen crew and cast members traveling with
us today, all of whom can't seem to smile enough. The 50-year-old
Lanter is wearing an Oshkosh engineer's cap, the kind you see on
kids.
</P>
<P>
   The three of us have chosen to travel northward in the
comfortable and carpeted DeLuxe Observation Class of the
45-year-old Coconino Car. That means we paid top dollar to share
the best view with 17 other passengers, one of whom has had
balloons attached to the back of his seat by the crew because he's
celebrating his 78th birthday. Our 12-year-old son, Ethan,
occasionally takes a break from reading P. G. Wodehouse long enough
to scan the landscape as we roll along at our top speed of 40 miles
per hour. ``No elk yet,'' he murmurs as we pass dirt roads,
gurgling creeks, empty corrals, cattle tanks, former station sites,
small arroyos, and giant ant hills.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I read the up-down-up history of Grand Canyon
railroading: how trains began hauling passengers from Williams to
the canyon in 1901 at $3.95 per head, how only three passengers
were carried on what appeared to be the final run to the canyon in
1968, and how the GCR was born in 1989 after owners Max and Thelma
Biegert acquired much of it when the fellow who was trying to
restart the enterprise defaulted on a loan they'd made to him.
</P>
<P>
   But enough reading. I decide to walk the train, from the plush
Victorian chairs of the 24-seat Parlor Car (complete with
complimentary continental breakfast) to the five coaches that each
seat 80 people in rows of four (complete with complimentary
Coca-Cola). We're a mixed band of travelers, from kids scooting
along the aisles to senior citizens warily eyeing the kids scooting
along the aisles. But we're also a heavily over-40 crowd. The GCR
reports that only a little over one-third of its passengers travel
with children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people are reliving their past,'' conductor Ken
Stephenson tells me. ``And they like the idea of a train ride, of
going slowly and socializing.'' There have been birthday parties,
marriage proposals, and, according to Stephenson, two deaths from
heart attacks aboard the train.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is an uneventful trip on a gorgeous summer day.
When we arrive at the log-and-wood-frame Grand Canyon Depot, built
in 1909-10, a five-man band toots its welcome as we mosey off the
train. More than 90 percent of the folks who take the CGR begin
their return trip to Williams 3 1/2 hours after arriving here, so
most of the other passengers make their way onto buses for a
narrated tour. Not us. Ethan, my wife, Margery, and I are spending
the night in a hotel room here on the South Rim, which is a short
walk from the depot.
</P>
<P>
   We'll take a bus tour, yes. But we'll also hike five miles along
the rim and have a leisurely and excellent dinner in the dining
room of El Tovar, the undisputed queen of the six-lodge fleet here.
We'll watch the sun set and rise over the canyon, visit two small
exhibitions on canyon history, and spend the rest of our time
simply staring at a sight that is arguably unmatched anywhere on
earth. And how good is the weather? We can see the buildings atop
the North Rim, 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But when the whistle blows the next afternoon, we're ready to
board the Club Car for the return trip to Williams and its rebuilt
91-year-old station. The Club Car is a livelier place than the
Coconino Car _ it features a mahogany bar, after all _ but it lacks
the view. That means more time for talk. We're setting next to Jeff
Garrett of Berkeley, Calif., an Amtrak engineer who's riding with
his two teenage sons and their friend. When Kevin Johns, one of the
singers aboard the train, makes an appearance, Garrett requests
both ``Casey Jones'' and ``The Wreck of Old 97.'' Johns doesn't
miss a beat or word.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett is impressed by the GCR. ``A lot of people are fed up
with their cars,'' he says as we roll southward. ``I know I am. I
just didn't want to deal with my car at the canyon. If I could park
it and take public transportation, great. Plus,'' he adds, grinning
broadly, ``I love trains.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bar, a wiry fellow in exaggerated western garb is holding
court. He answers only to the name of Barge, and is the
``marshall'' aboard the train (a former electrician, actually).
When I ask him if he's expecting trouble this afternoon, he replies
that the Cataract Creek Gang is in the neighborhood and might try
to hold up the train _ say, at 4:55 p.m. And lo, at that exact
moment two masked men on horseback appear beside the track and
bring the train to a halt. Ambling through our car, they announce
that drinks are on the house. Barge is in hot pursuit. By the time
we reach Williams, of course, the good guy and the bad guys are
arm-in-arm at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   For Wiliams, a weary hamlet of 2,500 souls that once made much
of its living off long-gone Route 66 and is now bypassed by
Interstate 40, the CGR is a necessity of life. The city brightens a
little bit every time the railroad's empire grows: the 89-room
hotel that opened last year (and will more than double in size in
2000), the 300-seat restaurant that began operations this year, and
the 100-space RV park that will open next year. Meanwhile, a $15
million Arizona State Railroad Museum is being planned for the
city.
</P>
<P>
   In June of this year, the GCR carried 20,000 passengers during
its best month ever. In August, Amtrak began servicing Williams,
bringing with it a new source of passengers for canyon trips. And
Max Biegert, the onetime crop duster who inadvertently ended up
with a railroad when a loan when bad, recently fired up a new
airline, Phoenix-based FarWest, to fetch riders to his train via
package deals.
</P>
<P>
   When he first acquired the railroad, Biegert wasn't sure what to
do with it. ``But I hired some ex-Disney folks to look at it,'' he
recalls. ``They told me, `There's only one Grand Canyon. And
there's only one railroad that's ever gonna run to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the future here looks about 100 years old.

PATIENT ACCESS RAISES ETHICAL DEBATE ABOUT CLINICAL TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH YANG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Countless numbers of terminally ill patients in
the United States wage life-and-death battles to gain access to
experimental drugs available largely to people in clinical trials.
Whether they can _ or should _ get special access to these drugs is
a subject of huge debate.
</P>
<P>
   One such patient is Larry Williamson, 52, who was diagnosed in
July with kidney cancer, which had spread to other parts of his
body and was growing rapidly. A tumor undetected in tests two
months earlier was the size of a tennis ball. His doctor said he
had anywhere from two to eight months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson has pinned his hopes on anti-VEGF, an experimental
drug that has not been approved for market by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, if there's any chance that something might save my
life, how will I feel if I'm facing death and I haven't tried to
get it,'' said Williamson, who lives in San Francisco. ``I just
want to know I exhausted all the possibilities for extending my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson had tried chemotherapy. It hadn't worked; it rarely
does for renal cell carcinoma. A newer treatment, interleukin-2,
failed as well. It does so in four out of five kidney cancer
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA makes room for such last-resort cases under ``expanded
access'' programs, allowing seriously ill and dying patients with
no real alternative the chance to take a drug before it is approved
by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs were broadened in the 1980s in response to demands
from AIDS activists for greater and faster access to new
medications. Since then, tens of thousands of patients have
received access to drugs treating such illnesses as heart disease,
AIDS and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   According to some specialists, expanded access programs have
become more popular in recent years as more patients use the
Internet to find out about new drugs under development.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, it is the manufacturer _ which absorbs the
cost of supplying the treatment before market approval _ that must
weigh the burden of providing expanded access against the
desperation of patients clinging to a last chance at life.
</P>
<P>
   In Williamson's case, Genentech in South San Francisco has
denied him expanded access to anti-VEGF, an angiogenesis inhibitor
that might hinder the growth of cancer tumors by starving their
blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sue Hellman, the chief medical officer and senior vice
president of Genentech, said the company only produces enough of
the drug for the patients in the clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for anti-VEGF. Because it is a
monoclonal antibody, a protein that must be produced by living
cells, it is extremely difficult _ and expensive _ to manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Only if enough evidence of safety and possible effectiveness
emerges at the end of phase 2 trials would the company consider
setting up an expanded access program, Hellman said. Supplying the
drug outside controlled trials without evidence that it might help
the patient would be premature, she argued, as well as
``potentially foolish'' and ``costly for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that if Genentech provided a drug to a single
patient, company policy states that a program must be set in place
to provide the drug to multiple patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Jaffe, senior vice president of drug development at
Gilead Sciences in Foster City, added that it's rarely only one
person who wants the drug. ``We get these calls every day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead has 9,000 patients enrolled in an expanded access program
for adefovir dipivoxil, an anti-HIV drug that is on an accelerated
approval process at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe said he gets about 20 requests per week for adefovir
dipivoxil, which is also going through phase 3 clinical trials for
the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, the demand outpaces the company's
ability to meet it. ``Where do you draw the line?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also worry that providing drugs outside the
carefully controlled clinical studies risks clouding up the
investigation, and might ultimately slow approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do compassionate-use studies, they're still studies,''
said Dr. Larry Hirsch, a spokesman for Merck Research Laboratories
in New Jersey. ``We're still responsible for communicating any
experience with the drug to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Months earlier, Williamson was denied entrance into a controlled
clinical trial for anti-VEGF because investigators were concerned
his liver was not functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   Trial researchers have since reconsidered, but Williamson argues
that he is now in such an advanced stage of the disease that he
cannot bear the trip to Bethesda, Md., where the studies are being
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we administer anything to a patient, and if anything
untoward happens, we're left trying to determine what was the cause
and effect,'' Hirsch said. ``We consume time and resources trying
to understand those incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expanded access programs mix politics and public relations, said
Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition in
Washington, D.C. Visco advised Genentech when the company was
developing its expanded access program for Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any biotech company puts an expanded access
program into place without pressure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jaffe said well-organized expanded access trials can do more
than polish a company's relations with the public. ``You're
learning more about a drug in as near a market setting as
possible,'' he said. ``It's like a big field test.''
</P>
<P>
   In a financial sense, Jaffe added, the programs also help
develop a group of patients who might continue using the drug after
it is marketed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Klein, the HIV/AIDS program coordinator at the FDA's
Office of Special Health Issues in Maryland, said his biggest
concern about expanded access is that people go into experimental
trials with unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often assume if something is coming down the pipe, it's
better,'' he said. ``But it's still research, and that means it has
a lot of risks.''
</P>
<P>
   These patients, said Klein, are often left ``grasping pieces of
wood from a sinking ship. But we have to put the wood there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Williamson, he understands the drug might do little or
nothing to stop his kidney cancer from advancing. But he said that
companies holding so much potential influence over a person's life
should still be bound by a moral imperative, when asked, to help
those with no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is going to make millions of dollars selling a
product to the public,'' he said, ``shouldn't they be at least
slightly beholden to that public, before (the drug) is approved by
the FDA and while they have to pay for the drug?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of my situation is that this anti-VEGF, I probably
won't get it,'' he said. ``And even if I did get it, it probably
wouldn't save my life. The most I could hope for is a stabilization
of my disease.''

FANS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BARRY WHITE _ AFTER 30 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry White didn't invent love. He simply perfected it in song.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, there's The Voice, bottomless and rumbling
like something Cecil B. DeMille would have created for the Burning
Bush. It's an aphrodisiac swaddled in a jet-black, river-deep basso
profundo that settles into your bones and caresses you somewhere
down below. Just say his name _ go on, say it _ and you want to
coax your voice down a few octaves, to take it where it was never
meant to go, into the loverman lair of the man they call the
Maestro of Love.
</P>
<P>
   Barry White makes love songs _ steamy, sweaty songs that also
exude tenderness and romance. He's been singing love songs _
classics like ``Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe,'' ``You're The
First, The Last, My Everything,'' and ``Never, Never Gonna Give Ya
Up'' _ since Nixon was president, and bellbottoms were in style the
first time around.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 30 years in a industry that chews up and spits out
its artists faster than you can say the Spin Doctors, White has
perservered by sticking to what he does best _ crafting lushly
produced songs, honey-thick with bass and passion. As evidenced by
his 1994 album ``The Icon is Love,'' which sold 3 million copies,
good love songs never go out of style. At 54, when many of his
1970s contemporaries are VH1's ``Where Are They Now?'' subjects,
White is garnering some of the best reviews of his career with a
sultry new CD, ``Staying Power,'' as he begins a concert tour with
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire Friday in a sold-out show at Boston's
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   As he sings on the CD's opening lines, ``I'm not going nowhere.
I'm staying, baby, I'm staying. You know why _ I've got staying
power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No artist can tell you when they first start how long they're
gonna last,'' said White in an telephone interview from Los
Angeles. ``That's a secret. You have to find that out by living, by
doing what you're doing, by being committed to your work, and being
consistent in your work. That's the only way you find out. So I'm
very grateful that after all these years, they've still got room
for Barry White.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD, White's first in five years, includes duets with Chaka
Khan, Lisa Stansfield (who covered White's ``Never, Never Gonna
Give Ya Up'' a few years back), and Gerald Albright. Sean ``Puffy''
Combs remixed White's slow-funk version of Sly Stone's ``Thank You
(Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).''
</P>
<P>
   If not for the fact that he's never really gone away, it could
be said White is smack-dab in the midst of a career revival.
Recently, he's lent his voice to the reading of Top Ten lists on
``The Late Show with David Letterman,'' and, even more bizarre, to
a stuffed bunny encouraging ``love your salad'' in a Good Seasons
salad dressing commercial. His autobiography, ``Love Unlimited,''
is due in stores next month. And last season, he performed on
``Ally McBeal,'' as the rhythmically challenged cast performed a
line dance. His music, a favorite of John ``The Biscuit'' Cage,
played by Peter MacNicol, has long been used to season the
program's sexual politics and romantic jousting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been playing my music, and they called to say they
wanted me to come do an episode of the show,'' White said. ``I
obliged them, did an episode, and really made some good friends
over there. The people are very respectful and professional, just
all-around good people.'' (After this interview, White returned to
the ``McBeal'' set to tape another episode for the upcoming
season.)
</P>
<P>
   Through the show, White is enjoying a host of new fans, many of
whom are too young to remember his original hits. But while some of
the fans are new, White insisted his approach to music has remained
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still make music the way I've always made it,'' he said.
``When it's time to do an album, I go deep inside, and I try to
pull out the very best in myself _ lyrics, melodies, rhythms,
counter melodies _ whatever it is. It's no different on this album
than any other album. I use the same philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   And the philosophy he preaches hails the joys of love and
romance. With a voice that fashions every murmured babybabybaby
into a undying declaration of love, he's been making the ladies
gooey long before Ginuwine or K-Ci &AMP; JoJo were even a twitch in
their mamas' tummies. In his songs, White is the old-fashioned wine
and candlelight kind of lover _ this is, after all, a man who
composed a four-minute disco symphony with his own 40-piece Love
Unlimited Orchestra and called it ``Love's Theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, singers like White owned the airwaves and charts. Love
seemed to ooze from every record groove. The Stylistics exclaimed
``You Are Everything,'' Al Green cooed ``Let's Stay Together,'' and
Marvin Gaye just plain testified with, ``Let's Get It On.'' R&AMP;B and
soul music were the soundtrack of love, moon-spoon-June sentiments
wrapped in silk sheets and rose petals, with the lights turned
down. It was what you popped into the 8-track or on the turntable
when the mood had to be right. And if you couldn't find passion
with White's ``It's Ecstacy When You Lay Down Next to Me or ``Oh
What A Night for Dancing,'' then it just wasn't meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Today, what passes for R&AMP;B is just so much booty-slappin' ill na
na nonsense, where sex pretends to be love, and women have been
reduced to semen receptacles. The ``old concept of love and being
respectful has changed, and keeps changing,'' White lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that the young people today don't know how to, or don't
try to write love songs like they used to. People talk about Barry
White singing love songs, but everybody used to sing love songs,''
he said. ``Now it seems the only way to get a good love song today
is if somebody takes a sample from somebody else's love song.''
</P>
<P>
   And even when they aren't sampling him, White's influence is
apparent in such current artists as Maxwell and D'Angelo, who, like
White, concentrate on the many moods of love.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there were other subjects White could have devoted
his music to. He could written gangsta-trippin' tales about the
hard, foolish ways that claimed his brother's life in 1983. Born in
Texas, White was raised in south-central Los Angeles where he got
involved in enough gang mess to land him in jail for six months in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   But those experiences which, White said, turned his life around,
won't be found in his music. Despite the occasional ``message''
song, such as 1983's prescient ``Change,'' and ``Sometimes'' on the
current CD, White sticks to love songs _ appropriate enough, since
few voices are as libido-inducing as his. Besides, he said, ``Love
is a subject the whole world understands, and I knew that long
before I started making music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a better subject in the world to talk about,'' he
said with a smoky chuckle. ``Everybody's still doing it, baby, and
it hasn't gone out of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, neither has the Maestro.

BOTTLING `BARRACUDA' TAKES HER WATER SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Posing for a newspaper photographer at
the water bottling plant she oversees, Robin Prever experiments
with crossing her arms and legs just so, to exude confidence. She
stretches her arms out wide along a row of blue bottles and smiles,
her face turned upward, eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Saratoga Beverage Group understands image
and marketing. When you're selling water in a bottle for as much as
$1.85, marketing is critical. The hyperactive chief executive in
her late 30s has taken a company that was nearly dead in 1992 and
turned it into a profitable and growing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary, in retrospect,'' she says of her decision
to take control of the company in her early 30s, with no experience
running a business. ``At the time, I always had a certain amount of
confidence. I would figure a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen De Crescente Sr., one of the group of investors who
bought Saratoga Beverage with Prever seven years ago, says it
didn't take him long to realize the petite woman had the tenacity
Saratoga needed to make it a viable brand again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her a barracuda,'' says De Crescente, who is also
chairman of De Crescente Distributing Co. of Mechanicville.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll trade blows with ya,'' De Crescente says. ``She's a
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Prever says she is so competitive by nature that she has a
difficult time relaxing. She remembers a time someone suggested she
not take golf so seriously. Her response: ``I'm not here to relax
and enjoy it. I'm here to conquer this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Conquering the game of business, she says, has been easier for
her. She's had marketing instinct since she was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   As a 7-year-old on Long Island, she biked to the local grocery
store, bought candy and resold it at a profit to the neighborhood
children, aware they were a captive market _ most had no bikes.
Later, she decided she would have an easier time selling bracelets
she made from free telephone wires if she gave half the money to
charity. She sold the bracelets for $1, pocketing 50 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, she saw her opportunity to get into the world
of finance not long after graduating from law school in 1985. She
met storied money manager Mario Gabelli at a party, and he hired
her to handle public relations at his Rye, N.Y., company.
</P>
<P>
   Prever realized on her first day that the action _ and the money
_ at Gabelli Asset Management Co. was not in PR. Her second day,
she told Gabelli she was moving herself into portfolio management.
</P>
<P>
   She did well there, she says, sharing in the prosperity that
characterized Wall Street in the late 1980s. In 1992, Anthony
Malatino, her boyfriend and a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter in Albany, persuaded her to take some of the money
she'd made and join a group of investors to buy Saratoga Beverage,
after Evian Waters of France had idled the water-bottling
operation.
</P>
<P>
   It was never her intent to run the business. But a year later,
it was her idea to jump-start the company by raising capital
through an initial public offering of stock. Looking for an
underwriter for the offering, she went to a friend at Merrill
Lynch, who laughed because the company was too small and at the
time unprofitable. Unfazed, she moved on to D.H. Blair &AMP;
Associates, which was then underwriting IPOs for smaller companies.
She couldn't sell an underwriter there on the concept either _
until she agreed to run the operation.
</P>
<P>
   So she gave up Wall Street _ and the hefty commissions and
perks.
</P>
<P>
   Prever's new job provided a culture shock. Instead of meeting
clients for lunch at the Waldorf Astoria, as Saratoga Beverage's
new chief executive she was entering the hotel's rear entrance to
talk to the purchasing manager. Instead of walking into
well-appointed offices, she found herself in the front end of a
bottling plant, at a wood-veneer desk, in hearing range of the
perpetual kerplunk-chink of bottles moving down conveyor belts.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she boasts about her frugal ways, pointing out the
carpet remnants that change with each floor of the company's
offices. But she still looks like she could be transplanted to
tonier digs in her Ann Taylor suit, with her Yorkshire terrier,
Pebbles, always by her side.
</P>
<P>
   Always willing to trust her instincts, Prever leapt into product
development soon after taking over the company's reins. Pre-Prever,
the company had produced only carbonated water. But Prever hated
bubbles. So noncarbonated drinks with Saratoga labels hit store
shelves for the first time in over a century.
</P>
<P>
   De Crescente remembers thinking she was crazy. Plain old water,
even from springs as famous as Saratoga's, was not a big seller
then, he said. He ended up being wrong about that, and later about
the success of the company's sweet, clear fruit drinks called
Splash. He's since stopped doubting her.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lately, she's taken the offensive. Six months ago the company
purchased the Fresh Juice Co. for $19 million. The company plans to
introduce fresh-squeezed juice in a bottle and new iced-tea and
lemonade drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive might steer clear of the latter category,
after the flop Saratoga Beverage had with iced-tea and lemonade
drinks called Toga.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers and business leaders in upstate New York
speculate Prever's management team has been able to put fizz back
in Saratoga Beverage because the little guys have focus the big
guys lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really needed somebody like Robin and crew to say this is
our baby and this is going to be our main line, and really attack
the market with it,'' said Joseph Dalton, president of the Saratoga
County Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Prever hasn't licked every battle, though. She hasn't won over
Wall Street. The company's stock price has hovered between $2 and
$3 a share for months. At the company's annual meeting earlier this
month, Prever told shareholders that Saratoga Beverage needs to
work harder to sell its name _ not just to consumers, but
investors, too.
</P>
<P>
   And she hasn't found time for much of a personal life. Prever
concedes to having given up a family life in the pursuit of work.
Malatino, now at a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter office in Saratoga
Springs, remains a part of her life. After 10 years of dating, a
wedding may at last be in order, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whatever the sacrifices, Prever is not one to regret. She
ignores friends who tell her the dumbest thing she did was leave
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I wanted to build something,'' she says,
``leave a mark.''

THE ERASER'S EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- W. Somerset Maugham, once the world's best-selling
English-language author, would have hated it.
</P>
<P>
   His correspondence. On display. In Boston. It was wrong on all
counts. Or so he would have said.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his long life, Maugham urged his friends to destroy his
letters, and he and his secretary spent long evenings burning
anything that might help a biographer.
</P>
<P>
   And as for Boston? Maugham didn't care for the place. He once
told a friend that proper Bostonians looked upon on authors who
hadn't taken the precaution of dying 100 years ago as guilty of bad
taste.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, thousands of people have visited Boston University's
unheralded exhibit of Maugham-orabilia. Which is one reason a
Maugham fan can't help thinking that Howard Gotlieb, director of
BU's Special Collections, has done both the author and literature a
favor.
</P>
<P>
   A walk through the exhibit, with its letters of praise and
admiration from such luminaries as Winston Churchill, E.M. Forster
and Henry Miller, reminds you of the heights Maugham once commanded
in the literary world.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Although his work is still popular enough in England
to sell at airport bookstalls, in this country Maugham has suffered
a long fall from favor since his death in 1965 at 91. ``He is not
talked about the way Henry James is or the way Conrad is,'' says
Ted Morgan, whose 1980 biography was the first to give a full look
at the complicated, curmudgeonly author. ``I think he went on
writing too long, and the later stuff is not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Gotlieb looked for experts to speak at the opening
of the Maugham exhibition, he searched in vain for an academic who
had made Maugham his specialty. ``It was as if I was searching for
a ghost from the past,'' he says. In death as in life, Maugham has
largely been ignored by the academy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame, for if Maugham's later work may have tarnished
his reputation, it's also true that part of what makes him
remarkable as a writer is his sheer longevity. He published his
first book in 1897, his last in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   As Morgan points out in his book, Maugham's early literary
contemporaries were James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, and Theodore
Dreiser. When he finally laid down his pen, J.D. Salinger had
already quit writing, and John Updike was making his name. With
letters from figures as distant as Hardy and as recent as Tennessee
Williams, the papers Gotlieb bought at auction reflect that amazing
span.
</P>
<P>
   And if some of his later fiction is undeniably hackneyed, the
best of his work is just as clearly first rate.
</P>
<P>
   One of Maugham's books _ ``Of Human Bondage'' (1915), a
Proustian tale of love turned to obsession and misery _ qualifies
as a classic. Two others, ``The Moon and Sixpence'' (1919) and
``Cakes and Ale'' (1930), are witty, compelling romans a clef
(about Paul Gauguin and Thomas Hardy) mocking the way the world
makes saints of the sinners who are often its best artists. ``The
Razor's Edge'' (1944), which sold more than 500,000 copies in a
single month, anticipated widespread interest in Eastern philosophy
and mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   If Maugham managed to stay contemporary through more than half a
century of writing, his sensibility still makes him fascinating
more than three decades after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Victorian novelists, he wasn't interested in didactic
moral tales designed to improve the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike reform-minded writers such as John Galsworthy or George
Bernard Shaw, he wasn't interested in societal critiques aimed at
improving the lot of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   He was, as he said again and again, simply a storyteller. The
``greatest living short-story writer'' England's New Statesman
declared in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Maugham, a homosexual, feared his sexual orientation made him
frivolous and superficial. In retrospect, one can argue its real
contribution was to lend his work the very features that help keep
it fresh. Unhappily married for a period, Maugham had a grim and
ungilded view of matrimony, and it's that stark outlook that
informs his best stories.
</P>
<P>
   His homosexuality also made him somewhat uncomfortable in
England. ``I have never felt entirely myself till I had put at
least the Channel between my native country and me,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly did, traveling on long sojourns to remote corners
of the British Empire. The short stories he crafted from raw
material collected on his travels are riveting: tales of love and
lust and hypocrisy, of cowardice and betrayal, adultery, murder,
and parricide.
</P>
<P>
   Often denounced as a cynic by critics put off at the
dispassionate, even amused, way in which he presented human foible
and failing, Maugham pled not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have done is bring into prominence certain traits that
many writers shut their eyes to,'' he wrote in ``The Summing Up,''
his 1938 retrospective. In the current era, that criticism seems
hopelessly dated, while the unvarnished candor for which Maugham
was often criticized keeps his stories as current as the flaws that
lurk in the hearts of men.
</P>
<P>
   But that's hardly the only reason he's a treat to read.
</P>
<P>
   In an age that often takes more interest in the literary
personality than in literature itself, Maugham is a catty delight.
The rapier of sarcasm was more effective than the bludgeon of
invective, he was fond of saying, and he employed the former weapon
so skillfully that no less nimble a tongue than Winston Churchill
struck a pact with his favorite novelist: He would promise to make
no sport of Maugham if the author would extend him the same
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, felt the cut of the blade. Although he
professed not to be, Maugham was terribly envious of the critical
recognition awarded writers like Henry James, James Joyce, and D.H.
Lawrence, men deemed artists while critics too often relegated him
to the ranks of literary tradesman.
</P>
<P>
   When, ``In Cakes and Ale,'' Maugham created octogenarian
novelist Edward Driffield, about whom he wrote, ``If . . .
longevity is genius, few in our time have enjoyed it in a more
conspicuous degree than Edward Driffield,'' critics accused him of
trampling on Thomas Hardy's grave and denounced as a ``literary
ghoul.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Maugham saved his worst for James, whom he
considered pretentious and ridiculous. In ``Some Novelists I Have
Known,'' he wrote: ``Henry James's fictions are like the cobwebs
which a spider may spin in the attic of some old house, intricate,
delicate and even beautiful, but which at any moment the
housemaid's broom with brutal common sense may sweep away.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, literature's housemaid has taken Maugham's own novels
and stories and stacked them in a dark cellar. Still, if the
critics tended to deride Maugham, and they did, and if the literary
world has tended to forget him, and it has, walking the Boston
University exhibit, one is struck by the writers who counted
Maugham an important influence.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried Sasson wrote to declare himself delighted by Maugham's
``astringency and clear-cut writing.''
</P>
<P>
   V.S. Pritchett penned a note in praise of Maugham's short
stories, saying he had tried to follow that model in his own, only
to be left ``in impotent admiration'' of Maugham's mastery.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scrawled a long letter enthusing over ``The Razor's
Edge,'' adding: ``Before I had written a line, I had read `Of Human
Bondage.' It was one of the books that formed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan reports that when his biography of Maugham came out, both
V.S. Naipaul and Paul Theroux, now locked in a literary feud worthy
of Maugham, told him they had learned from Maugham the need to
travel the world in search of their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   John le Carre also belongs on the list. More than three decades
before le Carre, Maugham, too, had been a spy, in World War I, an
experience he fictionalized in his Ashenden stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``John le Carre . . . said Ashenden was a major influence in his
works,'' recalls Morgan. ``It was the first sort of modern
espionage story where the spy is a more complicated figure, not
always heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kingsley Amis wrote to thank Maugham for all he had taught
him about narrative technique. ``You are one of the very few
authors I admired when I was in my teens and still admire _ even
more _ today,'' he said in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Amis was onto something there. And yet, despite that eminent
re-readability, these days Maugham is rarely read at all.
</P>
<P>
   The author himself expected no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no illusions about my literary position,'' he wrote
late in life. ``There are but two important critics in my own
country who have troubled to take me seriously and when clever
young men write essays they never think of considering me. I do not
resent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha! His bitterness and resentment bleed through that denial and
a dozen others. Writing ostensibly of Maupassant, he seemed to
plead his own case. ``An author,'' he said, ``has a right to be
judged by his best works.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Maugham's bad has overshadowed his good, nudging almost
his entire oeuvre into obscurity. Yet his best books certainly
deserve better. As do many of his short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings one back to Maugham's correspondence on display at
BU. Protest as Maugham would have, would an author who owned his
era only to fall into ill-deserved eclipse really hate it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it for one minute,'' declares Gotlieb.
``Authors want the cloak of immortality. . . . They adore the idea
that some graduate student will write a doctoral thesis on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you pierce the cloak of camouflage the author left behind,
it's hard not to think Gotlieb is right: If Maugham could see the
thousands who have wandered through the exhibit to look at his
manuscripts and letters and books and honors, he'd likely be
beaming. Even in Boston.

 UNDATED: ... I can.''

<P>
   Still, your average majorleaguer, let alone your average
Hollywood star, would be hard pressed to meet the demands Costner
did during the film shoot at Yankee Stadium last fall. ``Probably
the fastest I threw was 87, 88 miles an hour,'' he says. ``I didn't
throw 87 to the hitters, though. I threw about 81 because I was
afraid to let it go. I only threw in the high 80s when I was
warming up. But when the batter stood in there, they were in a
minor league system, and I could have hit them just as easily as
not, so yes, I did cut back a little.'' Major league pitchers, few
of whom exceed Costner's dances with the radar gun, throw every
fourth or fifth day. Costner threw almost every day. Needless to
say, his arm felt as if it was going to fall off by the end, he
adds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A shorter take &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about this or that detail in the film, and Costner
relishes the discussion. Certainly there were many discussions
during the shoot. However, director Sam Raimi has said they were
not about ego, but about motivations and details and how best to
make a given scene or moment work. Length wasn't the bone of
contention it has been in some Costner films. ``This is a
two-hour-and-15-minute movie,'' Costner says, ``and I haven't yet
made a movie that some people didn't want to get to the plot of
quicker. But I also haven't read a book in my life that I loved
that it didn't take until page 60 or 100 to really get into, and if
you lose those first 60 pages, then the part that spiked for you
doesn't spike for you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be stunned at how people can weigh into a movie and want
to put their fingerprints on it. It's like someone coming into your
house and saying they want to rearrange the furniture. You might be
more receptive if they were invested as much as you, if they said
they would rearrange your furniture and then be willing to live
there for a year. You keep hearing about the opening weekend _ `The
weekend did this,' or `The weekend did that.' But if a movie is
really good, then it doesn't matter about the opening weekend
because 20 years from now it will still be good and will have
resonance for people. I think the calling card of a great movie is
that when you watch it again you see things you didn't see before.
Opening weekend is a false god!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``For Love of the Game,'' the most dramatic moment isn't a
big strikeout. It comes when the pitcher played by Costner hits a
trough, is pitching on fumes, and goes 3-and-0 on a batter in the
eighth. The question isn't whether he can do something resoundingly
heroic, but whether he can just get the next pitch over the plate
with something on it. ``I mean, percentages are for people who talk
about stuff they don't understand,'' Costner adds. ``Anybody can
get to the Hall of Fame pitching at 100 percent. Anybody. It's the
guys who learn how to pitch when they're at 50 percent who go to
the Hall of Fame. When their fastball's gone and their curve's
turned (bad) _ those are the guys that go. Because very rarely do
we get to operate at 100 percent. You have family, you have medical
problems, you have financial problems, you have personal problems,
and you still have to go to work. And you maintain a level of
professionalism and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Resonance, anyone? One piercing moment in the new movie has
nothing to do with baseball. It unfolds almost wordlessly in the
middle of the night, in a kitchen, between the aging pitcher and
the young daughter (played by Jena Malone) of the woman he loves.
``There is trouble,'' as Costner describes it, ``because the kid
and her ask him a lot of stuff and he's a loner and has lived so
long by himself. That eventually gets put alongside the bread and
the milk in that scene. I used to find my dad doing that, sitting
in the kitchen, when I was little, in the middle of the night. I
realize now that he was probably 32 or 33 and that he must have
been worried about things, worried about money for us and he wanted
to give us everything, you know. And I'm sure somebody was
bothering him, like a boss. My dad worked for the Edison power
company. He was never a political guy. He was always a straight
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my dad used to just get away from the noise. And I
think that to have a girl who just sits next to him and doesn't say
anything _ that's how relationships form. My daughter, Annie, wrote
this beautiful poem. There were some things in it about fishing,
and she said, `I came out early to see my dad fishing' _ I am going
to get this all wrong _ but the gist of it was, `I got up early and
realized that he was already fishing because to him it was
important, and I went down and sat next to him and eventually got
up and left him, and I realized that he didn't leave me because he
didn't want to be with me, but because fishing was a solitary
thing.' And she said that, and it pierced my heart, and I thought
to myself, `I will never not sit next to her.' You know what I
mean? That kind of made it into my movie.''

   NEW RELEASES: ``Dracula'' _ The 1931 Bela Lugosi classic is
reissued with a soundtrack written by Philip Glass and performed by
the Kronos Quartet. It's effective, but so was the use of
Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake'' in director Tod Browning's original
release. Dwight Frye is terrific as Renfield, and the tape is only
$15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' _ Director Garry Marshall was terrific with
comedy when he oversaw the TV series ``The Odd Couple'' and was a
producer of ``Happy Days.'' He even gave a fine acting performance
as the casino operator in Albert Brooks's ``Lost in America.'' But
his feature-film work, including this lame romantic comedy, has
been dreadful. Obvious. Dull. Insipid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' _ Filmmaker Jim Moll follows a handful of
Holocaust survivors back to the death camps. The result is dramatic
_ without being sentimental _ and powerfully understated. It was
produced in association with the Shoah Foundation.

   DVD UPDATE: Get ``Analyze This'' on DVD. The outtakes are worth

commentary audio track features director Harold Ramis's
observations about working with actors whose styles are so

PUT GOAL OF HOUSE AHEAD OF STOCK OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I have the opportunity to start buying stock
in his company at a 15 percent discount from market price. He can
purchase an amount representing 10 percent of his annual salary, or
$5,000. The only stipulation is that he must hold on to it for at
least four months. It is a growing company, and the stock has been
increasing in price over the past year that he has been with it,
but I am not sure if we should take advantage of the offer or not,
given our goal of buying a house. We are saving $1,300 a month
toward the down payment in a money market account that earns 5
percent. We currently have about $17,000 saved, or 6 percent of the
anticipated cost of the house. For retirement we fully fund Roth
IRAs for both of us and both contribute 10 percent of our salaries
to 401(k) plans. We would like to be in a house by this time next
year. What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; K.P., Maynard
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I'd do just what you are doing and let the company
stock offer, however attractive it may seem, wait until you have
achieved your primary goal of buying the house. The value of shares
in small and growing companies can be very volatile, and most would
probably be very susceptible to any substantial downturn in the
stock markets, sometimes regardless of the performance of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still tempted to go for the stock offer, approach it
as you would approach any investment. That is to say, ask a lot of
tough questions, and don't let that fat 15 percent discount hold
too much sway.
</P>
<P>
   Is the company profitable, and are its prospects of continued
and growing profits strong? Does it have unique market niche that
is secure, or is it facing substantial competition? Is it in a
business in which a competitor could suddenly come up with an
improved product that blows your husband's company out of the
water? What is the price-to-earnings ratio relative to other
companies in the same industry? Do you have absolute faith in your
company's top management?
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions to ask that might make the idea of
gambling on the stock offer more attractive. Your husband is, of
course, an insider, so he is likely to know whether the company has
strong product or service offerings in the pipeline _ products or
services he feels are strong enough to cause a significant spike in
the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you believe the prospects are strong enough so that
you're willing to take the gamble _ and don't fool yourself that
investing in a small company for a four-to-12-month profit isn't
gambling _ I would limit the contribution to less than the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   If you maintained your current savings schedule, you would have
accumulated $33,890 toward the mortgage down payment over a year's
time. If you cut contributions to $1,000 a month, you would have
$30,126 in the money market account, and you would have invested
$3,600 in stock that might or might not be worth more than you paid
for the shares.
</P>
<P>
   You might look at it this way: If you're attracted to the offer,
you could consider buying the stock as a gamble that, at the very
worst, could delay your home purchase. If you think the upside
potential outweighs that downside, by all means go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But to answer your direct question _ what would you do? _ unless
I had some powerful inside information on the potential value of
this stock, I'd stick with the saving schedule you have established
and save the option of buying the stock until a time when you can
view the purchases as long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   I should also note here that although the term ``inside
information'' has all kinds of negative associations lately, in
your situation, thinking hard about your husband's company is not
only wise, but entirely legal.

! ``Chill Factor'' Notable only for Cuba Gooding Jr.'s worst choice
of a role yet. He plays a stereotype driving a stolen ice-cream
truck that will keep a canister of toxic chemicals cool while Skeet
Ulrich's watered-down James Dean loner chills his way through the
dumb chase stuff. (R) 
 
!! ``Floating'' Concord, Mass. native William Roth brings rich
atmosphere and a waste-free narrative style to the bittersweet
story of a teenager's summer of awakening, and Norman Reedus plays
the townie teen with natural grace. But some of the supporting
characters are cartoonish, and one edges into old-fashioned
tortured-homosexual stereotype. (Unrated) (Matthew Gilbert) 
 
! ``Outside Providence'' The Farrelly brothers (``There's Something
About Mary'') collaborate with Michael Corrente (``Federal Hill,''
``American Buffalo'') on a coming-of-age story that, while
familiar, steers clear of cliche. There's no ``American Pie''
glorying in dumbness here, just a tender, gritty honesty. Shawn
Hatosy brings unforced conviction to the role of a blue-collar
Rhode Island kid packed off to boarding school by his dad, played
with terrific control by Alec Baldwin. (R)

 UNDATED: ... far too great.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only network that has been mindful of balancing youth with
age, if not of balancing pablum with quality, is, of course, CBS.
This season CBS has roles for veterans Betty White and Dixie Carter
in a dud of a sitcom called ``Ladies Man''; for Tyne Daly as a
retired judge whose daughter, Amy Brenneman, is a practicing judge
in a ``Providence'' knockoff called ``Judging Amy''; and for
Kathleen Quinlan in a bland legal drama called ``Family Law.'' Then
again, CBS also serves up one of the fall's most egregiously ageist
shows, the supernatural ``Now &AMP; Again.'' By the end of the pilot,
the brain of middle-aged shlep John Goodman winds up in the buff
young body of Eric Close, and the series becomes another
hunk-in-a-funk drama. Goodman, it turns out, is just a guest star. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox effect &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new titles are from the do-it-again school of TV
programming, as the networks, like sequel-crazed movie studios, try
to duplicate proven successes. It's not just ``Angel'' and ``Time
of Your Life'' or the three other spinoffs: Fox's ``Ally,'' a
half-hour of outtakes from ``Ally McBeal''; NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit,'' which will deal with more heinous crimes
than ``Law &AMP; Order''; and UPN's already-premiered ``The Parkers,''
with characters from ``Moesha.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks are busy going back to familiar wells for more
product from backstage creative players like Kevin Williamson. With
two of TV's strongest series _ ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal''
_ under his belt, David E. Kelley is giving ABC yet another
probable hit this fall, called ``Snoops.'' About a PI firm that
uses high-tech spying gadgetry illegally, the dramedy exploits the
hot-button issue of privacy in America. In typical Kelley fashion,
it also exploits the tension between its female leads, the
street-smart Gina Gershon and the by-the-book Paula Marshall.
``Snoops'' has a winning, almost ``Avengers''-like whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Happy with Steven Levitan's successful ``Just Shoot Me,'' NBC
has hit up the producer for another sitcom and scheduled it in the
golden slot after ``Frasier'' on Thursday nights. But, based on the
pilot, Levitan's ``Stark Raving Mad'' looks like a loser, despite
funny neurotic antics from Neil Patrick Harris as an editor saddled
with a prankish horror writer. Smitten with ``ER,'' and forgiving
of last year's ``Trinity,'' NBC is also trying out another hour
from series creator John Wells, called ``Third Watch.'' About
late-shift paramedics, firefighters, and cops, it's faster-paced,
younger, and ultimately less involving than ``ER.'' The busy pilot
depends on too much ambulance-side dating chatter, not to mention
vomiting in the name of ``gritty realism.'' NBC also has great
expectations of Aaron Sorkin, creator of ABC's acclaimed ``Sports
Night.'' With the White House dramedy ``The West Wing,'' Sorkin
delivers yet another set of high-strung characters in a charged
office setting. Martin Sheen is the president, and Rob Lowe is his
George Stephanopoulos-like adviser. Expect snappy dialogue, dashing
camerawork, and, alas, painfully earnest moral moments.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for a new paranoia-themed hit, Fox is featuring a murky
sci-fi drama called ``Harsh Realm'' from ``X-Files'' creator Chris
Carter. Targeted to computer-game players, and potentially
monotonous, ``Harsh Realm'' traps a hunky war hero inside a video
game, where he must destroy a power-hungry player named Santiago.
Think ``Heart of Darkness'' meets ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the best do-it-again move may have been
by ABC, which looked to former hotshots Edward Zwick and Marshall
Herskovitz, the men behind ``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called
Life,'' for an hour of guaranteed quality. This time out, the pair
came up with the stylish character drama ``Once and Again,'' an
honest look at the hard-to-manage affair between divorced father
Bill Campbell and separated mother Sela Ward, as well as its impact
on their kids. It looks like a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom roster is particularly grim this fall, with a group
of comedies as dull as their titles. ``Oh Grow Up'' (two guys, a
gay, and a bachelor pad) and ``Then Came You'' (he's 22, she's 33,
age jokes ensue) are on ABC; ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' (a Norm and
Drew wannabe) is on NBC; and ``Work With Me'' (the couple that
works together doesn't work) and ``Love and Money'' (super in a
superduper apartment building) are on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The only original half-hour comedy is ``Action,'' a Fox show
that's already been rocked by controversy for its explicit
language, most of which is bleeped out, and for its sexual content,
which includes a Hollywood honcho with an exceedingly large penis.
First created for HBO, the sitcom stars Jay Mohr from ``Jerry
Maguire'' as a slimeball movie producer who sharks his way through
the studio waters with the help of hooker Illeana Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Wired with the spirit of Robert Altman's ``The Player,''
``Action'' is without doubt the most cynical new show on TV. And
guess what: It's made for adults.

SHORT LONG ON RISK AS TV TALK SHOW HOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The challenge of hosting a TV talk show might freeze the marrow
of your average performer, but Martin Short can truthfully say that
it's child's play to him.
</P>
<P>
   You see, when other kids in his Hamilton, Ontario, neighborhood
were slapping hockey pucks around, Short was up in his family's
attic, hosting an imaginary talk/variety program that he dubbed,
presciently enough, ``The Martin Short Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I alternated every other week with Andy Williams, which
allowed me to continue my film career,'' Short deadpanned. ``I
would interview Eldridge Cleaver, and then someone would call
`Dinner!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Short's fantasy gets real starting at 10 a.m. Sept. 13 as he
launches a daily, one-hour talk show called, what else, ``The
Martin Short Show.'' He is wading into treacherous waters: If Short
doubts that, he need only ask Howie Mandel, whose own syndicated
talker was swiftly canceled, or Roseanne, whose
forgotten-but-not-gone ratings disaster has been relegated to a
post-midnight slot in Boston to make room for Short.
</P>
<P>
   But Short seems to see only blue skies ahead, perhaps
justifiably, since he has proven his ability to charm many a
talk-show audience over the years. ``One of the reasons I'm not
daunted _ and I could be wrong, God knows I've been wrong before _
is the simple fact that when I would go out and promote a movie,
the reaction of the audience has been very warm, very receptive,''
said Short.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been met with stone silence in the last 18 years, I
wouldn't in any way be proceeding with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that Short's prospects seem relatively bright is
that he has vastly more performing range than most of the one-trick
ponies who try their hand as talk-show hosts, so he can add some
new ingredients to the overly familiar celebrity chitchat formula.
There's a chance his many-sided personality could light a fire
under the dullest guest, and indeed Short says he wants to see
``how loose and seat-of-the-pants you can be'' within a talk-show
format.
</P>
<P>
   Short has a rare gift for character sketches (as his stints on
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``SCTV'' attest), and he is clearly
nostalgic for the variety-show format. So his new show will make
plenty of room for parodies and taped comedy segments, featuring
himself and a troupe of young performers, along with musical spoofs
that will showcase Short's song-and-dance talents.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical
for his appearance on Broadway in ``Little Me,'' Short, 48,
determined that he wanted to return to television, which he calls
``the most immediate, the most forgiving _ my favorite medium.'' He
was looking for ``a home to do what I do,'' but he'd done a sitcom,
he'd done sketch comedy _ how about a talk show?
</P>
<P>
   Short acknowledged in some Hollywood eyes, ``celebrity talk
wasn't the coolest thing to be doing.'' But the allure of the
untried thing proved strong for a performer who says of himself:
``Nothing is as intriguing to me as something I haven't attempted
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really dabbled in a lot of forms of show business; this
is one I haven't,'' Short said. (A talk show) allows me to do a
wide variety of different things as well as be in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   With a lot of movies (``Innerspace,'' ``Father of the Bride,''
``The Three Amigos'') and television shows on his resume, Short
also has enough clout to book a few A-list guests who don't usually
traverse the daytime talk-show circuit. For instance, old pal Billy
Crystal agreed to appear on the premiere, Steve Martin is slated
the next day and Tom Hanks will be a guest later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Short makes clear he recoils at the thought of personally
ringing up his cronies and pressuring them to do guest stints.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money is worth that call,'' he said emphatically. ``I have
some old show-business friendships, but me phoning up and saying
`Hey, Nick Nolte, it's me, Marty! Are you busy on Friday the 13th?'
And he says `Sure,' but that is not what he says when he hangs up
the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Short's new program carries the same title as his short-lived
1994 sitcom for NBC. He said he envisioned that show as a series of
comedy sketches, but the network insisted on a traditional sitcom
storyline. ``Clearly, NBC wanted `Home Improvement,' '' he said.
``We reached a civil-war point.'' (He noted, however, that the
lowest-rated ``Martin Short Show'' still notched a 19 audience
share, which would be a solid hit in the current, cable-fragmented
TV universe).
</P>
<P>
   As a young TV viewer, Short admired the styles of Jack Paar and
Johnny Carson, but unlike them and most other talk-show hosts,
Short does not plan to sit at a desk while he interviews
celebrities. He also will eschew question cards, hoping for the
smooth-flowing give-and-take he likes best when he is a guest on
other talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   While some stations, such as WCVB-TV, Channel 5 in Boston, are
giving Short a morning slot, others in the country plan to air it
as a late-night or early-evening show. Short says he's not worried
about tailoring the show will play in different time periods.

   ``I don't really endlessly worry about the outcome of
anything,'' he said. ``If you worry too much about the outcome, you
probably get frozen, and start trying to please everyone, and
people can smell that.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude extends to his debut. From his longtime perch on
the guest couch, Short has learned that progress can be gradual in
the talk-show game, so he's not adopting any do-or-die attitude
about his first show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I know so far,'' he said. ``There's no way I will
be as loose and as good (today) as I will be six months from now.
Nor was Johnny, nor was Conan, nor was Dave, nor was anybody who
ever existed.''

PBS ROLLS OUT ITS NEW SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pope, the apocalypse, the mysteries of the microbial world,
the search for extraterrestrial life: Yep, it's another season of
big themes on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The occasional Yanni special notwithstanding, the Public
Broadcasting Service appears to be largely resisting the temptation
to dumb down. No bellowing pro wrestlers or shrieking game-show
contestants here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what quickens the pulse of PBS programmers _ and, they
hope, their viewers _ are high-minded explorations of history,
religion, urban life, women's emancipation, class, race, politics,
cinema, and space.
</P>
<P>
   PBS could use a little luster on the fall schedule, because off
the air it's been a bad year. Numerous public-television stations
became embroiled in an embarrassing contretemps involving the
swapping of membership lists with political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for PBS, Ken Burns _ who recently alleviated his own
funding worries by reaching a long-term deal with corporate sponsor
General Motors _ is back on the schedule this fall.
</P>
<P>
   With the glorious ``Baseball'' and ``The Civil War,'' the New
Hampshire-based filmmaker has established himself as one of the
finest documentarians of our time. This season, Burns turns his
attention to the struggle for women's suffrage (a subject notably
shortchanged by ABC when it covered the past 100 years in ``The
Century''). Burns's ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony'' examines the
struggles faced by two early champions of women's rights, who
forged an unstoppable alliance. It clocks in at a brisk (for Burns)
four hours and is scheduled for Nov. 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who crave a typically sprawling Burns epic will find it
supplied this fall by Ric Burns, Ken's brother. His 12-hour ``New
York: A Documentary Film'' will range across the history of New
York from its origins as a Dutch trading post in 1624 to its status
today as the de facto capital of the world. Co-produced by Channel
2 as part of ``The American Experience'' series, ``New York'' will
air Nov. 14-18.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, ``Frontline'' will try to get a handle on the
extraordinary, complicated figure of Pope John Paul II, who
reenergized the Catholic Church and helped smash communism (and has
proven no friend of capitalism, either). ``John Paul II: The
Millennial Pope'' is scheduled to run 2 1/2 hours. Not likely to be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The team that produced the superb ``From Jesus to Christ: The
First Christians'' for ``Frontline'' is back with ``Apocalypse!''
(The un-PBS-like exclamation point is jarring, but at least they
didn't call it ``Old Testament Smackdown!'') The program, slated
for Nov. 22, examines the shifting interpretations of the idea of
apocalypse over the past 2,500 years.
</P>
<P>
   Writer, scholar, and now travel guide Henry Louis Gates Jr. of
Harvard will take viewers on a journey through modern Africa that
pauses in ancient towns and palaces for glimpses at the past. The
six-hour ``Wonders of the African World with Henry Louis Gates
Jr.'' will air Oct. 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteenth-century England is the setting, and four high-born
sisters who lived ``long and turbulent lives'' are the subjects, of
``Aristocrats,'' a three-part ``Mobil Masterpiece Theatre''
miniseries airing Oct. 10, 17, and 24. Speaking of turbulence:
``Hitchcock, Selznick and the End of Hollywood'' (Nov. 1) will
focus on the stormy relationship between genius filmmaker Alfred
Hitchcock and genius mogul David O. Selznick.
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 12 through 16, American Playhouse raises the curtain
on ``An American Love Story,'' a documentary about a black man and
a white woman whose 30-year relationship has defied racial
prejudice and social conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, ``Greater Boston'' host Emily Rooney and a panel of
pundits will explore the future of journalism in ``Brave News
World: A Greater Boston Forum,'' on Oct. 1. ``Greater Boston Arts''
returns for a new season on Oct. 6. ``Basic Black'' kicks off a new
season on Nov. 4, featuring an interview with Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, the ``Nova'' team tries to get to the bottom of an
ill-fated 1924 attempt to scale the world's tallest mountain with
``Everest: The Mystery of Mallory and Irvine.'' Then, on Nov. 9,
``Nova'' goes back to World War II for ``Decoding Nazi Secrets''
(Nov. 9), a chronicle of the way Allied mathematicians and chess
champions helped win the war by cracking a crucial German code
machine.
</P>
<P>
   PBS is billing ``Intimate Strangers: Unseen Life on Earth'' as
the first series ``ever to focus exclusively on the microbial
world.'' On Nov. 9, 16, 23, and 30, the program will examine the
way DNA links all life, the riddles posed by infectious disease,
and whether microbial life can help fix environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   If the microscopic view begins to pall, there's always the view
through a telescope. ``Life Beyond Earth,'' a two-hour special
about mankind's search for life on other planets, is hosted and
written by Timothy Ferris, author of ``Coming of Age in the Milky
Way.'' It's scheduled for Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Rigg celebrates her 10th anniversary as the host of
``Mystery!'', which kicks off Sept. 30 with ``Second Sight,'' a
thriller about a hard-boiled detective diagnosed with an eye
disorder that steadily robs him of his vision, with attendant job
complications.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, PBS is introducing a new animated program for
preschoolers called ``Dragon Tales.'' Produced by Children's
Television Workshop, it follows the adventures of two youngsters
who enlist some friendly dragons to help them cope with the
challenges they face.

BAPTISTS ASK MEMBERS TO PRAY FOR CONVERSION OF JEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Southern Baptists have produced a ``Jewish
prayer guide'' urging members to pray for the conversion of Jews to
Christianity during the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana and Yom
Kippur beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish leaders called the action arrogant and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptists have a right to believe what they believe,'' said
Mark Briskman, Southwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith. ``But we find this offensive. It shows an
element of arrogance because they are specifically targeting Jews
during this holy season.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer effort was announced in a news release by the
Southern Baptist International Mission Board in Richmond, Va. The
board has published a similar guide on praying for Muslims during
Ramadan; guides are planned focusing on Hindus and Buddhists, the
announcement states.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Rosh Hashana, when observant Jews around the world begin 10
days of seeking God, Southern Baptists will be praying they find
his Son,'' the release begins. The 10 days are called ``Days of
Awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist prayer strategy will begin at sundown Friday, the
beginning of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and will continue
through Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist ``Days of Awe'' prayer guide explains the way Jews
celebrate High Holy Days, gives sketches of Jewish people in
different parts of the world and offers suggestions on how to pray
for Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   The guide urges Baptists ``to pray for Jewish individuals you
know by name'' throughout the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Jewish people attempt to purge themselves of spiritually
crippling attitudes, pray that they will find the spiritual
wholeness available through the Messiah, (Jesus)'' the guide
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray for a realization among the Jewish people that their sins
can be transferred through belief to the One (meaning Jesus) sent
to bear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists anticipated criticism of their prayer effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Jewish leaders reject such efforts as being wrongheaded,
arrogant or even contributing to the spiritual and cultural
equivalent of the Holocaust,'' Don Kammerdiener, executive vice
president of the International Mission Board, said in a statement.
``But the Bible is clear regarding the necessity of sharing the
Gospel with Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Sprinkle, director of the International Mission Board's
prayer strategy office, added, ``Because God loves the Jews as His
chosen people, Christians ought to mirror that love at the very
time Jews worldwide are seeking God.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sibley of Dallas, who was named coordinator of the Baptist
North American Mission Board's mission efforts among Jews in 1996,
said last week that the prayers are an attempt to show love for the
Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to be offensive or provocative,'' Sibley said.
``It is simply a matter of exercising our freedom of religion and
convictions. I wouldn't mind if the Jewish community prayed for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rabbi Ralph Mecklenburger, leader of Congregation Beth-El, a
Reform synagogue in Fort Worth, said he does not see the prayer
effort as so benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come to my holiest day of the year and suggest God
is not listening, I think that is offensive and very
un-Christian,'' Mecklenburger said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Albert Zeilocovich, leader of Congregation Ahavath Sholom,
a Conservative congregation in Fort Worth, said Baptists have a
right to pray for Jews to accept Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do what they want in their churches,'' he said. ``But
if they try to contact somebody who is Jewish and try to take him
away from his faith, that is not respecting his belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Briskman said he understands and appreciates that many devout
evangelicals believe that it is their religious duty to share their
belief in Christ with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when they target Jews as we begin our 10 most serious
religious holidays, I think that is the height of arrogance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time Briskman has been asked to comment
about a controversy involving Southern Baptists and Jews. In 1980,
the Rev. Bailey Smith, then president of the Southern Baptist
Convention, announced that ``God does not hear the prayer of a
Jew'' during a speech in Dallas before religious conservatives who
included presidential candidate Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   After an uproar, Smith apologized and led efforts to improve
Baptist-Jewish relations, including accepting Briskman's invitation
to join a Seder with Briskman's family.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's comments came early in the conservatives' drive for
control of the Southern Baptist Convention. In the years since,
conservatives have consolidated power, taking over all convention
offices and seminaries. Baptists who are more moderate formed the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and slowly distanced themselves from
the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among recent conservative actions that moderates oppose are
boycotts of the Walt Disney Co. and the addition of a line to the
basic statement of faith requiring wives to submit to their
husbands. Another point of contention arose in 1996 when the
conservatives first targeted Jews for conversion and mapped out a
strategy to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Mecklenburger said he knows many Southern Baptists who opposed
the 1996 resolution and would also oppose scheduling the prayer
effort during the most important religious holidays of the Jewish
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many Southern Baptist friends and we have a mutual
respect for one another's beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Dilday of Southlake northeast of Fort Worth, president
of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, which is led by
moderate Baptists, said he strongly favors sharing the Christian
faith with all. But he disagrees with the Baptist prayer effort
during the Jewish High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think picking on the special days of the Jewish people to do
this is an intrusion,'' he said. ``We need to share our faith in a
Christlike way. This could drive people away from Jesus rather than
draw people to Him.''

REMEMBERING THE PILOTS OF THE VIETNAM WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ This is the pitch: a war movie starring
10 real-life Harrison Fords, one as intense as ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' only true.
</P>
<P>
   Freida Lee Mock and Terry Sanders actually use those lines to
describe their latest project, ``Return With Honor.'' But the
Academy Award winners do it with small, knowing smiles. After all,
as documentary filmmakers they have learned that a catchy blurb can
put even the most reticent people in movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they're not stretching the truth all that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor,'' about American pilots shot down over
North Vietnam, is 102 minutes of harrowing heroism and undeniable
endurance. Grainy, archival footage from Hanoi recalls men who were
gaunt and grimacing, beaten and sometimes broken. Sketches they
made hint at their torture. Mostly, though, the prisoners of war
appear as themselves today, physically whole again, still
psychologically strong, heartwrenching, of course, but also
unexpectedly humorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you, hey, there's more to this story than these guys
getting shot down and getting the crap beat out of them,'' said Ed
Mechenbier, who was a 24-year-old Air Force lieutenant when he was
shot down on June 14, 1967, the start of an ordeal that lasted, as
he put it, 2,093 days, or five years and eight months. ``It was a
chance to tell it the way we wanted to tell it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this film's not about those of us who were lucky enough to
return with honor,'' added Mechenbier, now an executive with a San
Diego technology firm. ``It's really a tribute to the fellas who
didn't come home at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the movie ``Return With Honor,'' which opens at the Museum
of Fine Arts Wednesday at 8 p.m., and the expression the title is
taken from are layered with meaning for the Vietnam War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the chaos of the camps, there was an unspoken order.
POWS struggled not to give up information, even when they were
suspended by their arms and their shoulders dislocated. They nursed
each other through. No matter how desperate, no matter what the
North Vietnamese offered, they were not to leave out of turn _
first the worst wounded, then the longest held. To this day, as the
film makes clear, the POWS who stayed do not speak to those who
accepted an offer to go home early while their fellow prisoners of
war were kept behind.
</P>
<P>
   The others keep in close touch, with reunions and emails, and an
understanding of each other's experiences that transcends words.
Paul Galanti, a former Navy pilot who was a POW for 6 1/2 years and
now maintains the group's Web site, said he would lend any one of
them money and never think to ask for it back.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary ends with Galanti's philosophy -- ``There's no
such thing as a bad day when there's a doorknob on the inside of
the door'' -- but in between it hardly glosses over the agony that
made that sort of simple optimism possible.
</P>
<P>
   With chilling friendliness over tea and cookies, Galanti
recalled, their captors informed one POW that his wife had left
him. Another learned of his divorce on the plane home. They were
kept up to date on the antiwar movement in the States, and marched
through the streets of Vietnam. Then there were the ropes. One
wrong move and, as former Navy Lt. John (Mike) McGrath puts it in
the movie, ``You'd choke yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point where you'd throw your own child in the fire
to get out of those ropes,'' said Galanti, who spent 10 months in
and out of the hospital after his release, was an executive in the
medical field, and is now starting a computer company. ``The first
time, my hands were turning black and it really hurt and I said,
``OK, I'll tell you.' So they untied me and it hurt worse when the
blood rushed back to my fingers and they put me right back in the
ropes. I had to answer before they'd take them off again. I don't
remember what I told them, my mind was so screwed up. I later
learned to tell them big lies and not get to the point where I was
irrational. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out I wasn't as tough as I thought I was,'' he
added, ``but that in a lot of ways I was tougher than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay sane and mentally strong, the POWS learned to
communicate from cell to cell by tapping out a code that was passed
from man to man. Mechenbier gave wine-tasting classes, pouring
imaginary glasses for the other men. They walked miles, back and
forth across their rooms, pretending they were outdoors. They
shared everything they brought with them, which was what they had
in their heads, and tried not to lose their senses of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Later Mechenbier even wrote a manuscript called ``Ho Ho Ho Chi
Minh,'' a lighter look at the camps. For instance, he said, the
POWS explained to their captors that fighter pilots greeted each
other with their middle fingers raised in respect. Years later,
when antiwar protesters came to Vietnam, the guards saluted them as
they had been taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the POWs we interviewed are professional POW
survivors,'' said Sanders. ``Many are asked to speak on Veterans
Day, but these are fighter pilots and they're always thinking ahead
of the crash. They're not guys who spend all their time looking
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mock, ``We met them as very whole human beings. It was a
psychological question: How do you deal with what happened? Can you
get past it?''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter-century after the last prisoners were
released from Vietnam, Mock and Sanders attempt to answer those
questions. The idea for the project, in fact, came from three
Vietnam veterans who approached the pair after seeing their
documentary, ``Maya Lin: A Strong, Clear Vision,'' about the
architect who designed the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. That
documentary won them an Oscar. ``Return with Honor'' opened in June
in selected cities to strong reviews in New York and Los Angeles.
The fighter pilots themselves gave it two standing ovations at
their 25th reunion a year ago in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   What Mock and Sanders, who work out of a Santa Monica bungalow,
said they found were men who were anything but sterotypically
military. Not everyone agreed with everything the US government
did, then or in later conflicts, including the most recent one in
the Balkans. Rather than damaged warriors, they discovered unsung
heroes -- men whose stories so moved actor Tom Hanks after he saw
it on video that he lent his name as ``presenter,'' although he
does not appear anywhere in the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its most basic, this is a story about people surviving,
about how you resist becoming a collaborator with the enemy,'' Mock
said. ``But these are also men who believed in their country, who
believed in their leaders, who signed up and have stuck to it. In
this day and age, there is interest in those attitudes.''

COSTNER'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could say that Kevin Costner is stepping up to the plate
again with ``For Love of the Game,'' except that this time he's
occupying the pitcher's mound. After reinvigorating the baseball
movie genre with ``Bull Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams,'' he's
returning to on-screen hardball as an aging Detroit Tigers ace
working on a perfect game against the Yankees, punctuated by
flashbacks from a less perfect personal life. In a timeout from his
participation in the ancillary festivities attached to July's
All-Star Game at Fenway Park, Costner previewed a rough cut of his
new film, due to open Sept. 17. He also delivered a couple of
surprise pitches in an interview on the eve of the game.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he says, withdrawing to a quiet room in a
downtown hotel suite where friends, associates, and his 15-year-old
daughter, Annie, come and go: ``I don't think you can make a sports
movie about sports. I think it always has to be about people. What
you need to do is honor the athleticism it requires to make such a
movie, because even nonathletes can tell what an unathletic
movement looks like. But there was no feeling on my part that now
was the time to make another baseball movie. These three movies are
like my three children. They're all my children, but they're wildly
different and they each can stand on their own. `Field of Dreams'
was a mystical mood piece. `Bull Durham' is about this minor
leaguer, with all the glory and hilarity and sensibility of that,
and ultimately it's about a man and a woman who were made for each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Chapell, the pitcher at the end of his career in `For
Love of the Game,' is the greyhound in the group, this person on
his way to the Hall of Fame. He's almost a kind of throwback. And
as the game proceeds he's examining his life.'' (Much of what he
examines in flashback is his prickly but loving on-off relationship
with a Manhattan-based magazine writer and single mom played by
Kelly Preston.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the script, what I wanted to do was make it
tougher, make him more blemished, because I think it's easy to make
him a golden boy. I think you like him better when he's fierce, at
least I do. It's more interesting to me that a guy can be like that
and then be weak at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game,'' with its view of American male
solitariness crafted into the inning-by-inning drama, is more than
just your usual baseball movie, in other words, and more than just
your usual boy-girl story. ``I would have had reservations about
making another movie with a baseball background if I were trying to
plan a career,'' Costner adds. ``But I'm not. When I read something
I like, I have a no-looking-back attitude, a real killer instinct
about here's what I want to do. I still haven't done a movie for a
paycheck. Professionally, nothing has changed. Hopefully, I'm
trying to do it better. I still approach it in an enthusiastic
way.'' That kind of enthusiasm extended, during Costner's Boston
stay, to doing some Kennedy-related homework for his upcoming film
set during the Cuban missile crisis, ``Thirteen Days.''
</P>
<P>
   What about personally? ``Personally, my thinking has had to
alter itself because I'm living a more independent life,'' Costner
says, referring to the six years since his divorce. As to ``how my
personal life has changed over the last few years, I don't really
have that wrapped up in the way that I have some of the other
questions I feel I can handle.'' Suffice it to say that Costner's
character in the movie is not portrayed as a paragon, and that he
brings some of his off-the-field troubles on himself _ just as
Costner in his own life has, as he always acknowledges. Although
he's loose and relaxed in the middle of a busy day, he says, ``I
mean, I'm a single man. I don't want to talk about this anymore. I
just have to go forward in my life without fear. Not without the
knowledge that something was going to be written, but without the
fear of it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that makes Costner a throwback to such Hollywood
archetypes as, say, Gary Cooper is the fact that for better or
worse, he's unapologetically his own man. If he weren't, he'd have
folded his tent and walked away from ``Dances With Wolves,'' which
almost everyone told him would end in disaster, and never would
have undertaken such ambitious films as ``Waterworld'' and ``Wyatt
Earp.'' He's inner-directed, stubborn, but loyal to old friends and
associates and especially to family. He has cast not only his own
children in films, but his father as well. And there's more of him
than is immediately apparent in ``For Love of the Game,'' beyond
his genuine involvement with baseball as a game to which he came
late, but plays remarkably well, especially for a 44-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play college baseball at his alma mater, Cal
State-Fullerton, but since has become involved with the nationally
ranked team, accompanying it to tournaments and even playing
shortstop this year in a spring-training exhibition game against
the Anaheim Angels. Cal State-Fullerton lost, 2-1, when Costner
lost a pop fly. He made no other errors, handling hot grounders,
and pitching to two batters in the eighth inning. He struck out a
minor leaguer, then got Angels manager Terry Collins on a grounder
to end the inning. Costner says he fell in love with Fenway when he
visited it for ``Field of Dreams.'' It and another old inner-city
park, Chicago's Wrigley Field, are his favorites, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did OK in the All-Star sideshow, sending a few balls to the
warning track. For Costner, a lifelong fan of baseball no less than
a lifelong fan of movies, the highlight of the All-Star weekend was
being in the presence of Ted Williams. ``I don't know what it is,''
he says. ``It's almost like voodoo to talk about it. But everybody
recognizes it when it happens. When you see him, there's immediate
nobility in him, and nobody has to put a sign behind it. You just
recognize it. We don't fool ourselves. We're never going to be like
these ballplayers. We really don't kid ourselves. We were never
them. I just try to get as much of it to come out right as I can.''

A GESTURE LIFE 
By Chang-rae Lee. Riverhead. 356 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No other position on the playing field of literature has quite
the perplexing allure as that of the unreliable narrator. We don't
trust the voice but are captivated by its deceits, whether
self-deluded or intentionally mendacious. Observing the imagined
world through this skewed (even pathological) perspective, we begin
to envision something wider _ the way things ought to be, or could
have been, or indeed were. Thus are we granted the bracing task of
playing gumshoe and Diogenes both: In wrestling with the
half-truths and garbled recollections of the narrator in charge, we
have to use our own creative skills to flush out the real story.
</P>
<P>
   Modern fiction's most famous literary liar is the valor-ridden
madman of Ford Madox Ford's ``The Good Soldier,'' though certainly
Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, arriving a half-century later,
alerts us pretty quickly that he's up to equal mischief. More
recently, Kazuo Ishiguro achieved a different sort of pathos with
the muted tragedy of the butler in ``The Remains of the Day'': Only
after being swayed by the delicate control of the narrator's story
do we begin to glimpse his frailties. So it is with Chang-rae Lee's
beautifully realized second novel, which delivers the poignant
complexities of an elderly Japanese-American man with an exquisite
sense of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   If Lee's first novel, ``Native Speaker,'' possessed a similarly
taut restraint, he has imagined a story both deeper and sadder in
``A Gesture Life.'' Franklin Hata _ known as good Doc Hata to his
neighbors in the comfortable suburb of Bedley Run, N.Y. _ is a man
for whom propriety is everything. Duty is larger than love, or
certainly more tangible, in Hata's world; and honor, or the face of
it, will always outlive passion. Like Ishiguro's butler, he's an
existential yes-man, someone who steps quietly in the margins of
his own life. This circumspect stance has caused as much harm as
good, of course, however unintended: In trying never to leave a
mess or raise a fuss, Hata has come across as cold and unyielding _
posted eternally in some other country _ to those who need him
most.
</P>
<P>
   What gave Hata this curse of elusiveness is the story of ``A
Gesture Life,'' which opens in the present in Bedley Run and
returns intermittently to Hata's service as a medic in the Japanese
Army during the Second World War. Having recently sold the
surgical-supply store he ran for three decades, Hata is facing the
expanding time of retirement by swimming endless laps in his pool
and pestering the store's new owners. Reluctantly, he begins to
face the ghosts and consequences of a deliberately peripheral life:
memories of the good-hearted Mary Burns, a woman, now dead, whom he
chose not to marry, and of his adopted Korean daughter, Sunny, who
hasn't spoken to him in years. While Doc Hata has been a beacon of
good citizenship to the residents of Bedley Run, taking care always
to take care, he has hardly fared so well in his own matters of the
heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   We learn these things piecemeal, first by Hata's tentative
explanations, then by other people's reactions to him. If the new
owner of Sunny Medical Supply resents him for their business
dealings, is it that the man blames Hata for the store's recent
failures, or for something worse? Did Sunny leave because she was a
wild, ungrateful adolescent, or did Hata's exasperating coolness
dismantle the very bond he was trying to sustain? Layers of secrecy
accrue even as others unfold in ``A Gesture Life,'' for Hata has
spent much of the last 50 years trying to shoehorn certain
realities into an acceptable narrative _ his version of the stories
we all tell ourselves in order to make bearable the things we can't
control.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in some cases, to make sense of a senseless world. The
extent to which Hata's present is defined by his past reveals
itself slowly but continually through his formal, nuanced rendering
of his story _ his rationalizations, modest confidences, impeccable
explanations. All the acts that have made up Hata's life in Bedley
Run have been agonizingly correct, and yet the emotional silence
that accompanies them is more frightening than any howl in the
night. Remembering Mary Burns, he notes with surprise her curious
quality of being emotionally linked to other people _ adding,
politely, that ``there is nothing inherently wrong with this.
Indeed, there was a time that I held my own associations quite
close to who I was, in the years leading up to and during the
Pacific war, when in the course of events one naturally accepted
the wartime culture of shared sacrifice and military codes of
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   This chilling non sequitur _ from bonds of affection to wartime
conduct, with barely a comma in between _ suggests the mystery at
the center of Hata's story, or why he has chosen a circumscribed
life over a full-blooded one. The narrative's eventual return to
those war years _ to Hata's posting in Burma, to the Korean comfort
women he was assigned to attend, to ``the black fires of the past''
_ is both riveting and horrifying; in masterful understatement, Lee
has managed to capture an abyss of human experience with laconic
dignity. The war narrative makes up nearly half of ``A Gesture
Life,'' but any more detail here would diminish its effect. (For
the same reason, I'd advise readers to avoid reading the jacket
copy.) It was there that Hata came face to face with what he might
call the blight of destiny: his over-reliance, according to a cruel
commanding officer, ``upon generous fate and gesture.'' Then as
now, Hata realized the cost of that gesture life, where paralysis
looked like nobility and where love, in the face of evil, had no
chance at all.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his story, Lee opts for a mirroring effect
between past and present that seems unnecessary as well as
heavy-handed, particularly in a work of such delicacy. But
otherwise ``A Gesture Life'' is a hugely affecting novel, both for
what it delivers and for what it evokes, which is a kind of carpe
diem cry against the sorrows of an empty landscape. Immersed in his
routine of insularities, Hata ruminates on another man swimming
away from his life in John Cheever's ``The Swimmer,'' one of the
all-time great allegories of alienation and flight. But unlike the
endless strokes of Cheever's swimmer, Hata's journey has more to do
with history than with myth. His story belongs instead to the realm
of tragic compromise _ that of a man trying to live a
paint-by-numbers life by staying, no matter what, just inside the
lines.

THE LONG FIRM 
By Jake Arnott 
Soho Press, 345 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a nasty piece of work that Harry Starks is.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he's a lot of other things, too. He's charming, loyal to his
friends, loves spoiling his mum. He likes a well-cut suit, does a
dead-on Ethel Merman imitation, and gets teary listening to his
recordings of Winston Churchill's wartime speeches. But you don't
get the moniker ``Mad Harry'' by being a choirboy _ not that anyone
would call him that to his face, especially if he wanted to keep
his own face intact.
</P>
<P>
   As Jake Arnott's strikingly original debut ``The Long Firm''
begins, Harry, with perfect Merman intonation, is singing ``There's
No Business Like Show Business.'' He's also twirling a menacing
white-hot poker in his hand, which he hopes will convince an
unfortunate young man tied to a chair to reveal the information
Harry seeks. The captive, we soon learn, is Terry, the first of
five narrators recalling the life and times of Harry Starks in this
hypnotically entertaining story of crime, crooks, and assorted
crazies in 1960s London.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``The Long Firm'' so satisfying is Arnott's ease in
seasoning his fiction with real-life events and people, especially
the Krays. Reggie and Ronnie Kray, twin brothers, thrilled and
terrified London in the 1960s as the city's most notorious
gangsters. In the book, they are Harry's rivals, though Harry
shares Ronnie's taste for handsome young men. (``I'm homosexual but
I'm not gay,'' Harry asserts.) When a criminologist asks Harry for
his thoughts on Gay Liberation, he says, ``Well, someone once
called Ronnie Kray a fat poof. Ronnie took the top of his head off
with a Luger. That's my sort of Gay Liberation. Though, to be
honest, I think it was the fat part what got to him. Ron's, well,
touchy about his weight.''
</P>
<P>
   While he ruminates on the Krays, Harry is unveiled through the
eyes of a handful of people sucked into his orbit. Terry _ the one
tied to the chair _ meets Harry in a gay bar, and soon quits his
job to become Harry's kept boy. Of course, Terry knows what Harry
does for a living, and that his money isn't earned solely from his
nightclub, the Stardust. But Terry likes the finely tailored
clothes Harry buys him, and is seduced by his benefactor's
dangerous allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an attractiveness that went with the fierceness. He
drew people close to him. He had a sort of threatening charisma
that made you want to be close to him, an aura that you could feel
safe within. A bit like those fish that swim right up close to the
shark, you felt protected being in his slipstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry soon learns that swimming with sharks can be a lethal
pursuit, as does Teddy Thursby, a corrupt aristocrat in the House
of Commons whom Harry plies with beautiful young men. Thursby may
be a fictional character, but the next narrator is not. Arnott
fearlessly imagines the last days of Jack ``The Hat'' McVitie, a
mob henchman who works for Harry and does the occasional job for
the Krays. Writing in Jack's voice, Arnott reveals a man losing
control, whose open contempt and defiance of the Krays would
eventually lead to his bloody demise.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the book is violent _ a young man is hacked up and stuffed
in suitcases, and faces explode in a hail of bullets _ but the
bloodletting never feels gratuitous: It's truthful to the era and
characters. Besides, Arnott doesn't need to rely on cheap shock
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   A brazenly confident writer, Arnott perfectly nails 1960s
England in all its contradictions. You can practically hear Judy
Garland singing an encore of ``Over the Rainbow'' at the London
Palladium, and smell the gunpowder from Ronnie Kray's pistol after
he capped George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub.
</P>
<P>
   In this swaggering story, England (with apologies to Roger
Miller) does more than swing like a pendulum do. The Beatles are
fab, the Stones are gear, and Carnaby Street is the brightest star
in the fashion universe. But on the other side, the city's seedy
underbelly, there are the rentboys, the hookers, and the men
dressed in their Savile Row best who kill with precious little
provocation. The glamorous rub shoulders with goodfellas and goons
in a sort of warped mutual-admiration society. There are cops whose
vow to protect and serve can be bought and sold, and politicians
who use their powers for their own illicit gains.
</P>
<P>
   And at the center of it all is Mad Harry, a West End gangland
boss and nightclub owner with a taste for Tin Pan Alley tunes,
Bertrand Russell books, and myriad innovative means for breaking
those who cross him.

WOODS COACHES YOUNG PRODIGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jim Payton could barely sleep the night before,
could barely keep his heart in his chest on the ride over to
Harding Park's golf course Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking: I'm going to get a lesson from Tiger Woods, I
can't believe it,'' said Payton, who at 16 is rarely a victim of
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Tiger came up to him on the driving range,
Payton's confidence had made a huge comeback. ``I can beat you,
Tiger,'' he told the superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had a comeback of his own. ``I don't think so,'' he
corrected the cheeky teen-ager, in just the right tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That `I don't think so,''' Payton said later, ``was pretty
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods held one of his junior golf clinics in San Francisco on
Labor Day. Accompanying him were his sense of humor, his
entrepreneurial father, Earl, and the touch of a true teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about them,'' he told Jamila Ward, a 16-year-old
Oakland girl overwhelmed by a phalanx of cameras recording her
every stroke. ``Just listen to the sound of my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tiger arrived at her tee, Ward was overwhelmed by all of
the attention from the media. She couldn't concentrate. Her drives
barely left the ground. Then Woods showed up, and immediately she
began hitting balls in long, graceful arcs. He had either put her
at ease or driven her adrenaline to performance-enhancing highs.
</P>
<P>
   Ward would hit a ball, and Tiger would gently push another one
in front of her. When she dug up too much dirt, he tapped her club
clean with his own. Dressed like an elegant squire in gray wool
pants, a black sweater and black golf shoes designed like
wing-tips, Woods was utterly at the service of these youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced balls for them, shook all of their hands, tapped a
couple on the posterior with his club as friendly encouragement,
put Payton in his place and doled out flattery where appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, I don't hit it that far,'' he joked when Howard Oliver,
a broad-chested San Jose State freshman from Oakland, belted one
down the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jamila Ward, Oliver had been hitting stray balls until
Tiger came by to watch him. Then the shaking stopped, and the
drives started soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been nervous on those early shots? ``That,'' he said,
``and my hands were cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinic took place on the gray side of San Francisco. So
while most Americans spent their holiday under the sun, throwing
back drinks and grilling burgers, the world's most famous golfer
labored in a chill.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth and final clinic of the year for the Tiger
Woods Foundation. They started three years ago, shortly after he
left Stanford University to turn professional.
</P>
<P>
   This clinic was crisply organized by a bunch of efficient
volunteers. (Why couldn't these people have been at the Atlanta
Olympics?) Only one thing threw them off schedule: Tiger spent too
much time with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these events are bogus affairs. The star puts in a
short appearance, then bows out and lets his minions do the real
work. But Tiger spoke to a large group of novices at the beginning
of the day, then spent more than 1 1/2 hours checking the swings of
about a dozen top junior players.
</P>
<P>
   The players had been selected for the clinic by their local golf
organizations, and they were evaluated again by an executive for
the Tiger Woods Foundation. The organizers want to be sure they
find the juniors who can benefit the most from Tiger's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the young students come from ethnic groups
historically excluded from golf, children very much like Woods.
</P>
<P>
   When he first became a professional, and just as quickly became
a phenomenon, everyone promised that he would broaden the appeal of
golf, reaching out to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   For Jim Payton, that's exactly what happened two Aprils ago,
when he watched Woods win the Masters in a record 18-under par.
</P>
<P>
   He was a tennis player at the time, but the morning after he
went to the driving range. Ever since, he has been saving space in
his closet for a green jacket like the one Woods won at Augusta,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Tiger and said, `OK, I'll break that record,
20-under,''' said Payton, whose golf association flew him in from
Las Vegas for the day. In just two years he has become a star,
shooting as low as 61 at a public course in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   When the clinic ended, Brandi Chastain, the star of the Women's
World Cup final, stopped by to say hello to her fellow Nike
endorser.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger chatted for a few minutes, but he still had a packed
itinerary in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation awarded two plaques to community leaders Alma
Jackson and Gaylon Logan, who gave two of his nonprofit group's
T-shirts to Tiger and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pay you $10 million to wear them,'' Logan said,
bringing a huge grin to the face of Woods, the 23-year-old
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Earl Woods unveiled plans for a new PGA event,
organized by the Woods Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Held over New Year's weekend, it will feature the top 10 golfers
in the world, plus two players to be named. They will compete for a
top prize of $1 million. In the middle of the 72 holes, on New
Year's Eve, the tournament will break for a pro-am, which the Woods
family hopes will include Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As Earl Woods made the announcement, Tiger teased him for
confusing the dates. ``He's getting old,'' the son said into a
microphone, earning a bemused stare from dad. Later, Tiger gave his
father's shoulders a quick rub. He still had a celebrity auction
and a driving exhibition on his schedule. A 23-year-old franchise's
work is never done.

Wednesday, Sept. 8:
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The weekly wine column: All over the
world, but especially in Italy, winemakers are reaching back to
ancient grapes, in some cases varieties that had all but
disappeared. From the banks of the Rhine to the tip of the Italian
boot, from Southern France to the distant vineyards of Chile,
winemakers are rediscovering their heritage, and in doing so are
adding color and excitement to the world of wine. By Frank J.
Prial.

</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY-RESTAURANTS (New York) _ I used to eat at home on
Sundays. But the need to dine out constantly has disrupted my
pattern _ and opened my eyes. I now routinely eat out on Sundays,
and a creeping suspicion is growing into something like a firm
conviction: for diners, Sunday is not a good bet. At restaurant
after restaurant, I have detected a slackening off, a lack of
luster, a sag and a droop on Sundays. A critic's notebook by
William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   OCTOPUS (Undated) _ Raw octopus resting on ice at the seafood
store is definitely the ugliest thing in the vicinity, a floppy,
gray, suction-cupped monster that seems to have been born with a
natural defense aimed directly at the home cook. ``I am,'' it
growls, ``too hideous to eat.'' And yet, once the octopus is
cooked, it is beautiful _ tender and mild, with just a touch of
pleasant resistance, like lobster. Lately, as its qualities are
increasingly appreciated, it has assumed a starring role at many
restaurants in unexpected dishes. By Mark Bittman.

   ETROG (Undated) _ Observant Jews who follow the biblical
commandment of reciting a prayer over ``the fruit of goodly trees''
for Succoth, the harvest celebration, sometimes use a magnifying
glass to choose the finest etrog. This thick-skinned citrus fruit,
which looks like a large lemon and tastes like an especially bitter
one, is thought by some to have been the true forbidden fruit in
the Garden of Eden. By Joan Nathan.

   EDUCATION _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday uses his

   OLYMPIC-BUSES _ WASHINGTON _ When Atlanta Olympic organizer
Billy Payne first outlined the bid committee's excesses for
Congress, he conceded, among other things, that it ``facilitated''
the donation of a used bus to Lima, Peru. The gift went over so
well that on the eve of the vote in Tokyo on Sept. 18, 1990, a far
more generous offer to Peru's IOC member was planned. How would he
like 50 buses for his hometown? That offer was not mentioned in the
Atlanta team's original June 1 report to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee, which is looking into the Olympic bid process. But it is
documented in the materials that fill three dozen boxes being pored
over by federal investigators. They discovered more unreported
expensive gifts and favors for IOC members and their families.

   BAPTISTS _ TAMPA, Fla. _ They've come to meet, mingle, and elect

in the indictments shots taken at two other students. A bookbag and

   BUSH-HISPANICVOTE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Fresh from his success among
Texas Hispanic voters in the past fall's re-election bid, Gov.
George W. Bush has taken his Spanish-laced stump speeches to the
national stage, and the Republican Party sees him as a bona fide
crossover hit. In his bid for the presidency, Bush is energetically
courting the nation's fastest-growing voting group. And he's
creating great expectations in key states such as California, where
local GOP officers consider Bush a potential savior as they try to
patch up relations with Hispanics after former Gov. Pete Wilson's
anti-immigrant crusades. The courtship hasn't been completely
smooth. Bush has been criticized by some Hispanic groups for
skipping their national meetings, and he disappointed some Texas
border leaders who felt he didn't support their agenda during this
year's legislative session. 40. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman)

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Given the enormous money advantage of the

from their beach vacations and the candidates, like dying leaves,
begin their autumn descent upon New Hampshire, politics is taking a
different direction. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

OFFICIALS LOSE TRUST OVER WACO SIEGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New revelations about the 1993 Branch Davidian siege in Waco
have inevitably raised the question: Whom can you trust?
</P>
<P>
   The choice isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there are the conspiracy theorists, who see
shadowy black helicopters and Delta Force hit squads doing
Washington's dirty work. On the other are government officials, who
seem to have worked overtime withholding the truth or downright
lying.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that official Washington has lost credibility
over recent admissions about the fiery end of the Waco standoff and
that the fringe patriot movement has gotten a boost, said Mark
Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which
tracks extremist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Faith in government was already at a low ebb, Potok said. Last
week's disclosure, after years of denials, that the FBI used
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters to help end the 51-day standoff can
only further discredit Washington, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze that destroyed the Branch Davidian buildings April 19,
1993, ended a siege that began Feb. 28 when agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raided the compound of cult leader
David Koresh to search for illegal weapons. The bodies of Koresh
and about 80 followers, including 20 children, were found in the
remains of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey, conducted jointly by Democratic and Republican
pollsters, found that 76 percent of Americans distrusted the
government. By comparison, 61 percent expressed such distrust after
the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The new revelations about Waco ``have provided more fuel to the
anti-government movement than anything we've seen in a while,''
Potok said by telephone from Montgomery, Ala. ``I think this is a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, there is an exultant air on such anti-government
Web sites as FreeRepublic.com, where participants have long posted
their suspicions about the official version of the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they've been vindicated, big time,'' said Connie
Hair, a spokeswoman for the site, which has seen daily ``hits''
jump from 70,000 to 100,000 since the latest revelations about the
Branch Davidian siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great, big, I-told-you-so,'' Randy Trochmann, 31,
co-founder of the Militia of Montana, said of the movement's
reaction to the revelations. ``Obviously, we've been saying this
for how many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Potok, who said he believes that the disclosures ``have a
potential to draw a number of mainstream Americans into the
anti-government movements,'' Trochmann said he wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Montana militia leader said he is certain that the Waco
stories ``will make more of the mainstream look at whatever the
government says with a skeptical eye. Obviously, the trust is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Saxe, a political science professor at the University of
Texas at Arlington, said the importance of trust in a democracy
cannot be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government is predicated to a tremendous extent
on trust,'' Saxe said. ``And it needs to be strong for America to
hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations, though damaging to the government, ``show
our system still works,'' he said. ``And even those
conspiratorialists will see that, eventually, the information will
come out, whether it's from the media or former government
officials finally raising their hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy,'' said Chip Berlet, who heads
Political Research Associates, a Massachusetts-based organization
that researches extremist movements. ``What it's done is legitimize
conspiracy theories that people had put at arm's length.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he said, ``The patriot movement is saying, `The
government lied about this, so everything we claim is true,
including that the government intentionally set out to murder those
children at Waco.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berlet said he perceived a weakening in the patriot and militia
movements after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, carried out by men
who reportedly were motivated by the Waco tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people stepped back from the most virulent of conspiracy
theories after Oklahoma City, saying, `You can take this too far,'
'' Berlet said. ``Now, they're saying, `Heck, we weren't taking it
far enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Often lost in the current spate of disclosures is lack of proof
that the FBI started the deadly blaze, Berlet and Potok said. Even
the retired FBI agent who confirmed the use of pyrotechnic military
tear gas, said it was fired at a bunker about 40 yards from the
compound several hours before the fire started.
</P>
<P>
   The agency might have hurt itself by releasing only dry
transcripts of conversations picked up by tiny microphones
implanted in milk cartons, not the actual tapes of Davidians
discussing setting fires inside the compound, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   Berlet said he found it ironic that the extreme right seems to
be getting all the payoff from the new disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a Harvard Law School professor, a self-described
liberal, was the only member of the Justice Department's Waco
investigation to openly criticize the federal agencies involved.
The professor, Alan A. Stone, urged a continued inquiry. He found
no intentional misconduct but determined that the tragedy could
have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a reward, I have been taken up by right-wing fanatics,
pilloried by the liberal Democrats to whose campaigns I contribute,
and assured by knowledgeable colleagues that my services will never
again be needed in Washington,'' Stone later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Political fringe expert Mark Pitcavage questioned how much the
extremists will gain from the latest revelations about Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their Internet chat rooms, which get limited
exposure, ``they don't have many ways to influence the general
public,'' said Pitcavage, the Ohio-based research director of the
State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training Program.
</P>
<P>
   But the disclosures have revived a key issue for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been six years, and much of the initial emotion of Waco
had faded,'' Pitcavage said. ``But now, with these revelations, it
has made Waco again a rallying cry.''

<HEADLINE>
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES PLAY IT SAFE ON ABORTION POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON -- Here's an example of ``moderation'' on abortion
in George W. Bush's Texas, signed into law by the governor just
this year:
</P>
<P>
   A teenager becomes pregnant and has what lawyers call a
justifiable fear of abuse if she goes to her parents. So she goes
to her grandparents, and they take her to a state where abortions
services are confidential. The grandparents have now committed a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of reasoned substantive, discussion of
abortion in the nascent campaign for the Republican presidential
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes is on the trail, explaining his conversion as an
anti-government crusader into a down-the-line advocate of
government regulation of pregnancy. Up pops a right-to-lifer in his
small audience, armed with the latest facts circulating in circles
where conversions are suspect. Why is it then, he asks, that the
foundation set up by your business has given contributions to
Planned Parenthood?
</P>
<P>
   Forbes gets that look on his face that indicates he's only
answered this question a hundred times before. The foundation is
like the business, he says; it's controlled by his family, and he
has siblings with whom he doesn't always agree on funding issues,
including this one.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes clearly considers his answer responsive and dispositive.
But the right-to-lifer just as clearly is worried about trusting a
presidential candidate with independent-minded siblings.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's John McCain, who as far as I can tell is the
only person in the race who has shown any evidence of thought on
the issue. For two weeks, the Arizona senator and career-long
opponent of abortion has been taking modest guff from the
true-believers for suggesting care in advocating the junking of the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said in an interview, as have Bush and Elizabeth Dole,
that ``repeal'' is politically impossible for the foreseeable
future. But McCain also said repeal might be a bad idea if it leads
to state laws outlawing abortion that would drive it back to the
dangerous underground of pre-1973.
</P>
<P>
   When the guff came from the antiabortion orthodoxy that retains
its vice-grip on his party, McCain pulled back at once. Now, in
addition to affirming his 17-year record in Congress of voting
pro-life, his sole signal of ``moderation'' is (like Bush and Dole)
a refusal to commit to an antiabortion running mate or to ask
Supreme Court possibilities how they would rule on Roe.
</P>
<P>
   But when I asked him in Los Angeles recently what he thought
could happen during an eight-year presidency, McCain didn't speak
of ``repeal'' or of legislative fights. Instead, he spoke of a
possibly changed climate in the country, especially if prosperity
and economic security continued to spread. Even after getting
burned some, McCain's first political instinct was to think of
influencing the people who don't agree with him, as opposed to
preening for those that do. They call that governance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, McCain likes to say when campaigning
that given his broad views on constitutional questions and on the
Supreme Court, that he can't imagine picking a potential justice
who shares those views. And that tends to undercut McCain's
concerns about the prochoice majority in the country, because with
the prospective retirement of three justices in the near future
(two of them pro-Roe), a constitutional right to abortion services
based on a constitutional right to privacy could easily be toast
during a McCain presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different with George Bush. The justice he has picked
out of the crowd to call his model is Antonin Scalia, the most
relentlessly prolife of the current nine. Among the true believers
on the right, Bush's antichoice views and his detailed, anti-choice
record are regularly vouched for by the likes of Jerry Falwell,
Ralph Reed, and other leaders. The occasional barbs from
competitors like Forbes, Gary Bauer, and Pat Buchanan are
demonstrably inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   And more than Roe is involved. Since Ronald Reagan's election in
1980, there has been a steady chipping away at the right to choose,
especially for poor and young women and teenagers. There is not one
of these onerous, often mean-spirited policies _ from banning
public funds for the poor to regulating doctor-patient
conversations, to mandated waiting period and exposure to
government-written propaganda _ that Bush or all the other
candidates haven't supported.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan-Bush era was a time of gag rules, bans on
disease-fighting research using fetal tissue and a Supreme Court
that just 10 years ago was on a clear path to junking Roe. But for
Bill Clinton's election, it probably would have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all those stakes will return. The fact is that all abortion
views in the Republican contest must be written on litmus paper,
and all the candidates know they must pass. They already have.

HOW THE RICH GOT RICHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ What follows is for the benefit of the
economically smug, the financially complacent, the politically
myopic:
</P>
<P>
   --Since 1977, the average household income for the least
well-off fifth of the American public _ after taxes and inflation _
has gone down, by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Over the same neatly bipartisan period _ Carter and Clinton,
Reagan and Bush Pere _ the average household income for the middle
fifth of the populace _ after taxes and inflation _ has risen all
of 8 percent, or a whopping 0.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   --Also since '77 the average household income for the best-off 1
percent has more than doubled, up by 115 percent.What goes for
income, moreover, goes nearly double for wealth.
</P>
<P>
   --As of 1995, the last year for which full Federal Reserve
numbers are available, the top 20 percent of households, while
receiving more than half the after-tax income, were holding 84
percent of the wealth _ meaning stock portfolios, home equity and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   --The bottom 80 percent owned 16 percent of the wealth. That was
less than half the wealth owned by the wealthiest 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The 1-percenters, while getting 13 percent of all the
household income, were holding a share three times as large in
assets. And all these numbers on the concentration of wealth showed
a larger set of disparities than at any time since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers, and tons more, were disgorged over the weekend by
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the economic analysis
shop for progressives, but an odd bird famous for using
conservative data that shreds conservative myths. The household
income numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office, and are
the most broadly defined around for both the rich and poor; the
wealth stuff is from a study compiled from raw material at the
Fed's surveys of consumer finance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the center's famously understating head, Bob
Greenstein, there are at least three analytical conclusions to be
drawn just five months before the economic expansion of the 1990s
becomes the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth ever:
</P>
<P>
   --The growth, to put it extremely mildly, has been very uneven.
</P>
<P>
   --The gaps between rich and poor, between middle-class and rich,
are as wide as they have ever been in our statistically recorded
history.
</P>
<P>
   --Tax cuts benefiting the already well-off along with wage
erosion hurting those who already struggle have been at the
causative center of the trends.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein's co-author for the center's study, Isaac Shapiro,
makes an additional point of importance. The CBOs conservative (as
usual) projections for this year strongly suggest that the
continuing expansion and the tax cuts in the 1997 budget agreement
will act to widen the income and wealth disparities.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were much sharper during the fiscally insane '80s.
But the data shows that the positive changes in the '90s (tax
increases on the very wealthy, a huge expansion in the earned
income tax credit for the working poor, a higher minimum wage after
1996, and the tax credit for families with children) did not stop
the trend. On taxes alone, the study shows that for the top 1
percent of households, the average tax cut received since '77 was
worth $40,000-plus. That is nine grand above the entire, after-tax
income for the average household in the middle-fifth of the
spectrum today.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, in other words, the widened income disparity is
such that the best-off 1 percent will have as much after-tax income
as the bottom 38 percent combined; that 2.7 million people will
have the same combined income as 100 million people. The mere rise
in income at the top will exceed the total income of the bottom 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond taxes and the explosion in asset values, Greenstein also
points at two developments that have clearly hurt the poor
considerably: the erosion in pay from downsizing, job-exporting,
and a largely stagnant minimum wage; and the plunge in the value of
welfare assistance in the late '70s and early '80s because of high
inflation and the cruel nonresponses from the states.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statistics also have obvious political and policy
implications. The most obvious:
</P>
<P>
   --There is no justification left, none, for even a dollar more
of rich-tilted, across-the-board income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   --To would-be Reform Party convert Pat Buchanan: Your famous
brigades need more than pitchforks and protectionism. They need
more income, starting with a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   --To Bill Bradley and especially Al Gore, to celebrate the
economy is to celebrate numbers more than reality. The reality is
that most households have to struggle simply to get by. What has
happened in the '90s is in many respects a miracle, but it is also
just a start.
</P>
<P>
   --To Bradley and especially Gore, to focus too much on policy
topics like health insurance availability and poverty among
children is to take a commendable detour, but still a detour. The
bigger issue is economic security for working families. Big
thinking is what's called for.

STUDENT WITH PERFECT SAT SCORE GETS BOOST FROM LATIN, PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ For Martina Hurwitz, who scored a
perfect 1600 on her SATs (800 each in math and verbal), preparing
for the exam was like a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have some real fun,'' Dan Hurwitz, a mathematics
professor at Skidmore College, said of how he helped his daughter
study for the SATs when she was a Saratoga Springs High School
student.
</P>
<P>
   Martina would review math problems with her father and she'd
pick apart the nuances in written passages of the verbal exam with
her mother, Regina Hartmann-Hurwitz, who is an adjunct professor of
linguistics at Skidmore.
</P>
<P>
   One thing she didn't do, Martina Hurwitz said, was take one of
those high-priced preparation courses. Instead, she purchased a
work book of old exams. That way, Hurwitz said, she was able to
focus on the knowledge and reasoning skills needed for the exam,
rather than test-taking strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and it helped that Hurwitz now a freshman at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studied Latin, which
facilitated quick answers to the vocabulary questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are aiming for the SATs, Latin is a tremendous help,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most students won't come close to a perfect score, but for a
growing number nationally, the SAT, a standardized exam used to
help choose college applicants, is a teen-age rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they graduated from high school in June, some 1.2
million students took the exam. The makeup of exam takers is
growing increasingly diverse. Along with that, ethnic and gender
gaps remain, according to the College Board, which administers the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average verbal score for males was 509 compared
to 502 for women, with average math scores at 531 for males
compared to 495 for women.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the average score was 505 verbal and 511 math _ up just
a bit from last year's average of 504 verbal and 502 math.
</P>
<P>
   And while the latest crop of SAT-takers comes from homes where
the parents are better educated than ever, the scores remain
significantly lower than those of earlier generations. Average math
scores are six points below those of 1969, with verbal scores 35
points lower _ even after the entire scoring scale was
``re-centered,'' or curved to accommodate a lower achievement level
in the early 1990s.

ROSH HASHANAH AND GOD'S SUFFERING

   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It's Rosh Hashanah again. The Jewish New Year arrives on Friday
night and Jews will mark the calendar year 5760 since creation.
 &HT;    Many Jewish families will meet at prayer services and ask God
for a blessed year. At least one meal will include the customary
apple dipped in honey, symbolizing the hope for a sweet year.
 &HT;    With the holiday spirit comes some serious thinking. Why is
there so much suffering? We continue to be puzzled and shocked with
the needless shootings and killings at schools and workplaces.
Innocent children and adults are being hurt by madmen. We think,
whatever happened to God?
 &HT;    True, there are acts of God like fires and earthquakes for which
there is no understanding, but it's man's contribution to suffering
that troubles me.
 &HT;    For answers, I look at traditional Jewish writings. In the
Talmud (Megillah 29a) there is a statement: ``Wherever the Jews
were exiled, God, Divine Presence, accompanied them. When they will
return to the Holy Land, God will return with them.''
 &HT;    This means that God is with His people. Whatever happens to His
people affects God.
 &HT;    It would be correct to state that if people suffer, then God,
the Divine Presence, suffers.
 &HT;    Now the question should not be why do we suffer, but why should
God have to suffer? We experience bad things and God suffers with
us. Why?
 &HT;    In God's master plan for humankind there are provisions made for
accountability. God creates the world, then man is placed in it and
given the freedom of choice to enhance or destroy it. Think for a
moment, of the three basic things we need for existence -- water,
air and bread. Of the three, two are free and bread is an
inexpensive foods that is readily available.
 &HT;    How has humankind done with the two free gifts? Not so well. We
have poisoned the air and polluted the water. Thank God that bread
is still available.
 &HT;    Instead of taking advantage of the pure water and clean air, we
have been steadily destroying those vital gifts. How God must
suffer seeing the abuse.
 &HT;    On Rosh Hashanah, God created man. Our ancestor Adam accepted
the responsibilities of caretaker of the Earth for God. We, his
children, are responsible to care for this Earth, and each other,
in accordance with the Noachide Laws.
 &HT;    A story is told of an ancient house of prayer in Europe that
possessed an eerie sound. When entering the prayer room, you would
hear a continuous sobbing. The closer one would walk to the ark,
the stronger the sobbing was heard.
 &HT;    The old caretaker (shamus) would tell of a story he had heard
from the older shamus relating to the phenomenon dating back
hundreds of years:
 &HT;    There lived a saintly man, a tzadik, who prayed and fasted all
his life. The saint was as close to an angel as possible. One night
while in deep prayer, he heard God's voice calling to him. ``My
son, tell me what you need and I will grant it.''
 &HT;    The saintly man thought and thought. ``I have clothing to wear,
my health is good and I have a place to pray. I don't need money.
Nothing, dear God,'' the saintly man answered.
 &HT;    There was a silence and then a loud sob. Thundering and
lightning was heard outside. God's voice boomed out. ``Why did you
think of yourself, you should have thought of me. How I suffer for
My people, for mankind, and justice for the poor and needy. Why did
you not think of my suffering? Why did you not ask that my
suffering cease?''
 &HT;    The saintly man realized his sin and was too troubled to speak.
From that day on he grew weaker and weaker. On his deathbed he told
his most trusted students his tragic story. From that day on, when
entering the prayer room you could hear the sobbing, as if the
prayer room was crying about God's suffering and the lost
opportunity.
 &HT;    So, this New Year by all means enjoy yourself and family, dip
some apple in honey, pray for a good year and most of all pray for
an end of suffering: your suffering, my suffering and, most of all,
God's suffering.

TELEPHONES BECOME A TOOL FOR THIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Thank you for your recent purchase with Adult
Fantasies Online ToyStore. Your credit card transaction (for
$249.98) has been approved,'' said the mysterious electronic mail
message, versions of which went to more than 85,000 Americans over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The message, sent randomly to people who had never placed
orders, urged customers with questions to call a number in the 767
area code.
</P>
<P>
   But when recipients called to protest erroneous charges, the
number connected them to a sex hot line in Dominica, in the West
Indies, and automatically added a whopping toll charge to their
phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The scam, halted by the Federal Trade Commission in May, was
just one in an epidemic of telephone fraud that consumer watchdogs
say is bilking Americans out of millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some con artists have found the telephone billing and
collection system to be a fertile area to defraud consumers,'' the
Federal Trade Commission said in a report released this summer.
``Taking advantage of changes in the telecommunications industry
that began 15 years ago with the breakup of AT&AMP;T, these stealth
`operators' are arranging to put charges on a consumer's phone bill
for services that were never ordered, authorized, received or
used.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the problem is a side-effect of two
telecommunications trends of the '90s: deregulation of the
telephone industry and proliferation of companies that sell
information over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The new market has essentially turned your phone bill into a
credit card account that can be used by thousands of companies to
bill for services such as pay-per-view movies and monthly club
membership fees, sometimes when you didn't order them.
</P>
<P>
   This has opened the door to abuses so high-tech and so subtle
that many victims may not realize they're being ripped off at all.
Unscrupulous companies have left urgent messages on answering
machines telling people to call a number in the 809 area code to
get news of a sick relative or to stop cancellation of their credit
card account. The calls are routed to the Dominican Republic,
callers are kept on hold, and charges of up to $25 per minute are
billed to their phone accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of them charging huge amounts,'' said Linda Woods,
consumer affairs manager for the California Public Utilities
Commission. ``They can charge you whatever toll they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies run scams to bill unsuspecting customers for
calls to 800 or 888 phone numbers that would usually be toll free.
One California man returned a page from an 888 area code number,
was put on hold for four minutes and then got a $45 dollar charge
tagged onto his phone bill, according to the National Consumer
League, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Scam artists can do this by tricking callers into pressing 1 to
authorize the billing or essentially transferring consumer calls to
pay-per-call numbers without permission, according to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   One notorious example of creative phone billing was a modem
hijacking scheme broken up by the FTC in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC's charges, Internet users who logged on to
World Wide Web sites with names like www.sexygirls.com and
www.erotic2000.com were urged to download a free computer program
that would give them access to nude pictures. Once the consumers
downloaded the program, however, it took over their computers,
disconnected from their Internet service and silently dialed a
phone number in the former Soviet Republic of Moldova. It then left
their phones connected to the international toll number until they
turned their computers off, sometimes causing them to run up
$2-a-minute charges for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances, people were billed hundreds or thousands of
dollars,'' said Eileen Harrington of the FTC. ``They had no idea
they were connected to an international phone line.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed charges against the principals of two New York
companies allegedly responsible for the scam. A settlement included
agreement that 38,000 customers be reimbursed for $2.7 million in
unauthorized long-distance charges.

   Sometimes, a good dish is really just a lucky accident. I
stumbled on the idea for my Hudson Valley succotash several summers
ago, while I was working on a cookbook. My co-author, Molly Finn,
and I had bought bags and bags of fresh vegetables at the farmers'
market and were developing recipes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, we were surrounded. There were bowls full
of roasted corn and dappled cranberry beans, which we had cooked
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of perfectly ripe tomatoes. And as usual when recipes
are being developed, there was also plenty of leftover chopped
onion _ in this case, sweet red onions and scallions.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all these ingredients, I immediately thought
about making a succotash. But I was tired after cooking all day,
and our families were hungry. They were so hungry, in fact, that
they descended on the bowls of vegetables and started nibbling.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Molly and I gave up on the idea of cooking
anything else, and we all began to fill our plates. What had been
just a table full of individual vegetables was turning into a
communal feast _ an instant, self-serve succotash.
</P>
<P>
   We each scooped up exactly the combination of ingredients we
wanted. Since the late-summer vegetables were so intensely flavored
that they really didn't need any fancy dressing or preparation. It
was perfect as it was.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this succotash starts out like every other, with a
base of beans and corn, cooked separately and simply with water,
salt and butter. But everything else is left raw; the onions and
scallions contribute a sweet crunch, and as for the tomatoes, well,
in September, it seems like a crime to do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that summer, I've served this succotash when I could
get good, seasonal vegetables and felt like taking a day off.
There's hardly any cooking involved, and even that can be done
several hours ahead. Otherwise, the vegetables are left alone. And
so is the cook.
</P>
<P>
   HUDSON VALLEY SUCCOTASH
</P>
<P>

STEAMING FILL FILLETS BY THE CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have forgotten how delicious a great fillet of fish can
be, try this: Steam it, with nothing on it. Drizzle it with olive
oil and lemon juice. Sprinkle it with coarse salt. Eat.
</P>
<P>
   The number of ingredients and the technique may be minimal, but
the challenge is not. The fish has to be pristine, the timing
precise and the olive oil flavorful. Good salt helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   But there really is no better or easier preparation. This
technique works beautifully not only with cod but with red snapper,
grouper, striped bass, sea bass, halibut and even mackerel.
Steaming is such a fast technique that thin fillets inevitably
overcook and fall apart. So flounder is out, as are small fillets
from most fish. The best thickness for steaming is about an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Few fillets are of uniform thickness, though. For example, cod
fillets have a very thick end and a very thin end. So just fold the
thin end over onto itself to approximate the density of the thick
end.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an Asian bamboo steamer, you may have to
jury-rig a steamer. I use a large, oval casserole with a rack that
fits inside that was actually designed for roasting meat. But since
the rack sits only about a quarter of an inch above the bottom, I
elevate it above the water by resting it on a couple of glass
ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is timing. Check the fish often _ taking care not
to scald yourself when removing the steamer's lid _ and take it out
the instant a thin-bladed knife meets no resistance when poking the
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLEST STEAMED FISH
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds cod or other fillet, in two pieces, or 1 large halibut
steak
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { lemon
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put at least 1 inch of water in the bottom of a steamer,
cover and bring to a boil. Lay the fish on the steamer's rack,
making sure the rack is elevated above the water, and cover again.
Steam 4 to 8 minutes, or until the fish is done. (A good-size
halibut steak may take 10 or even 12 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove the fish to a warm platter and drizzle with olive oil
and lemon juice. Cut into serving portions, sprinkle with coarse
salt and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    Botanical garden's new children's attraction a joyous
exploration
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 9.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The arbored bridge is more than just a link to the
Atlanta Botanical Garden's latest attraction. The granite span
joins two worlds that have grown increasingly apart _ those of
children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   It not only connects with its new children's garden, which opens
next week, but also a techno-crazed generation of kids with a
waning appreciation of nature.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-acre Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Children's Garden is
chock full of exhibits aimed at teaching kids how plants contribute
to their sense of wellness _ a balance of body, mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful. It's so interactive,'' said Mary Swinn,
touring the site with daughters Emily, 3, and Rachel, 1, during a
preview last month. ``I think there's a big demand for this kind of
activity, and the kids seem to be really enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   The brightly colored sculptures, giant treehouse and bullfrog
pond are sure bets for luring kids into the garden. But once there,
the ``wellness'' theme may be tough lesson to comprehend. To help
them understand, the garden is designed around the idea of how
plants contribute to our abilities to ``live, laugh and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the botanical garden's gates, visitors will cross
the Flower Bridge and be greeted by the Green Man, a stylized
sculpture of the legendary mythological father of nature. To the
right is the new Trustees Court, another aspect of the garden's
ongoing five-year expansion. To the left, a giant Sunflower
Fountain beckons kids to the children's garden, a $3 million
project developed in partnership with Children's Healthcare,
formerly known as Egleston Scottish Rite Children's Health Care
System.
</P>
<P>
   The garden, designed for preschoolers through fifth-graders,
features a dozen interactive exhibits. Some concepts are obvious;
others call for a little head scratching. Not to worry: Signs
explain the ideas, and docents will be on hand to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, wear your swimsuits if you want to be showered by the cool
octopus-like Sunflower Fountain. Or you can bypass it and head for
the first stop, the Caterpillar Maze _ a ``laugh'' exhibit.
``Plants really lift our spirits, and especially the ones that
attract butterflies,'' said Cindy Reittinger, the botanical
garden's education director.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the gaping mouth of a red caterpillar, visitors travel
through its body en route to understanding how it forms a chrysalis
and finally, a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Next, to show how plants provide the air needed for breathing,
there's the Air Factory, a plant into which kids can go. After
watering the roots with an old hand pump, they follow the stream
into the stem and flower head, where speakers planted inside the
leaves emit sounds of inhaling; pinwheels housed in the flowers
exhale, illustrating how plants give off oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Learning is as much fun as laughing and living at this garden.
Beatrix Potter's ``Tale of Peter Rabbit'' proves an ideal backdrop
for illustrating what plants can teach. ``The story takes place in
a garden, many generations know it, and it's a tale kids love,''
Reittinger said. There's a hollow tree trunk, where children can
huddle inside, and Mr. MacGregor's garden, where they can learn
about vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite exhibit of children who previewed the garden was the
Dinosaur Garden, illustrating how long plants have been around.
``We talked to a paleontologist to find out which dinosaurs lived
in Georgia, and found there were three,'' Reittinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes a gingko tree, a large tree fossil from a
West Virginia coal mine and a bed where kids can dig for five
conveniently buried fossils. ``Look! I found another one,''
3-year-old Jones Maynard exclaimed while checking out the garden.
</P>
<P>
   A Creek Indian house, made of Georgia red clay and river cane,
exemplifies how Native Americans used plants, while a garden called
Grandma's Roots features plants that have been passed down through
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Passing through the door to Grandma's house, visitors enter a
contemporary exhibit of Every Day Plants, which shows their many
uses, often taken for granted. Dresser drawers spill with clothes
made of cotton, and fabricated sheep, which produce wool, graze on
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals is unstructured play outdoors, not indoors in
front of the TV or computer,'' Reittinger said. ``Before children
can begin to care about the environment, they have to experience
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden provides that in its Bee Hive Meadow, where thousands
of live bees fly in and out while foraging among for food; the
Soggy Bog, where children are shown how conservation efforts have
rescued endangered plant species; and the Bullfrog Pond and
waterfall, ideal for doing pond studies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Woodland, er, Treehouse, built on stilts to
avoid harming two 130-year-old trees, dubbed Grandfather and
Grandmother Oak. ``There was a lot of discussion about this exhibit
because we didn't want to damage their roots, so we built the
treehouse to the side,'' Reittinger said. ``We use the trees to
talk about what Atlanta was like before the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of talking, there will be plenty of that on
Saturday mornings at a new amphitheater, where parents and children
can take advantage of a new round of educational programs offered
Sept. 25 through Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing, whether it's at home or in a public garden,''
Reittinger said, ``is for parents and children to discover nature
together.''

 &HT;    Take the plunge, and water lily puts on a show
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 9.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all my gardening life, I had been content without
waterlilies. Even after I began ponding in the mid-1990s, I
eschewed the lilies. Instead, I put various water plants in the
pond over the years, growing one after another, including
horsetail, cattail, hyacinth, canna, arrowhead, rush, papyrus _
even the eager little duckweed. But no waterlilies.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I admired them greatly, often joining other visitors to
marvel at the Atlanta Botanical Garden's incredible Victoria lily,
whose pads grow to the size of royal umbrellas. So large they
invite you to walk on them, sit on them and float lazily across the
pond.
</P>
<P>
   Too, many gardener friends grew lilies, including John and
Charlotte Taylor of Rockport, Mass., who photographed theirs _
pinkish blooms floating atop dark water _ and gave Lyn two framed
pictures 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As evocative as those photographs always have been, as much as I
loved looking at waterlilies here and there, still I did not go
rushing to buy them. It wasn't time. Recently, the time came.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening is funny that way: You enjoy a plant for years, but
not enough to want to grow it. Then, one day, you just have to have
it for your own. That has happened to me time after time. With
plants ranging from abelia to asparagus fern. Once I start, I don't
want to stop. So it is with the waterlily.
</P>
<P>
   In all these cases, there is a common thread that reels me in:
the cumulative weight of having seen and loved these plants in
other gardens for so many years; sooner or later, a good plant is
going to get you. But, also, there must be some ``trigger'' that
sets me off, sending me from contented admirer to aspiring grower.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger this summer doubtless was the dry and fiery weather
that made water plants more and more attractive _ a cool
counterpoint to the heat's unrelenting drumbeat. By July, when so
much of my garden was flaming out, I had to have more water plants,
even if they provided only the illusion of relief.
</P>
<P>
   So I bought a dwarf reed and put it into a brass container,
perching the ensemble atop a grouping of stones. That was OK, but
not cool enough.
</P>
<P>
   Of course: a waterlily. There's something about a waterlily that
kicks the garden's temperature down a notch. The foliage certainly
helps. The notched leaves floating on water transport you to a cool
glade where chilly-skinned frogs hop from pad to pool _ and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   My first waterlily is a dwarf. In my postage-stamp-size garden,
only a dwarf would do. It came in a plastic pot of primeval muck. I
put the whole thing into a brass container and placed it in the
wide-open sun on the back porch, where it would get at least seven
hours of light daily. And I waited.
</P>
<P>
   As the temperatures soared, the little lily struggled mightily
to adapt to its new home in a container _ at 14 inches deep, a bit
shallower than its old one at the nursery. After a week or so, its
several buds did burst into flower, yellow with orange stamens.
Surrounded by egg-sized leaves, mottled brown and green, the
blooms, about the size of half-dollars, floated on the surface of
the water (indicating it is hardy; tropical blossoms typically
stand above the water line).
</P>
<P>
   After that initial show, the lily went into decline _ and no
wonder, given the shallow container that was a virtual cooking pot
(never mind that a foot of water was supposed to suffice).
</P>
<P>
   Trying to bring the plant back, I put it in a deeper (24-inch)
container, amputated most of its leaves and fed it a tablespoon of
blood meal. By last week, many new leaves had appeared _ followed
by a single, exceptional bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Like the others before it, this long-stemmed blossom began
rising from beneath the water's surface around noon, a tight bud
that soon started unfurling its pointed petals and by midafternoon
was fully flowered. After a few hours the lily reversed the
process, closing its petals and sinking below the water surface _
to become a bud again. This delicate performance would be repeated
for several days before the bloom would die, to be replaced by
others _ many others, I hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Such a show. More precious for its transience.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the little lily with its lone blossom is like a
bonsai, representing a larger scene in nature. I looked at the
blossom, a colorful exclamation point for the mottled leaves, and
saw a huge pond with frogs resting on pads big and strong enough
for me to walk on.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, somewhere, I may have that big pond with the big, regal
Victoria foliage and flowers. For now, I must have a few more
dwarfs. The little pond needs one; the goldfish would enjoy it. And
I just thought of an unused container that'll work real fine for a
lily on the side porch. Soon.

OFFICIALS LOSE TRUST OVER WACO SIEGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: CORRECTS characterization of Web site in 9th graf,
``anti-administration'' sted ``anti-government'') (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New revelations about the 1993 Branch Davidian siege in Waco
have inevitably raised the question: Whom can you trust?
</P>
<P>
   The choice isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there are the conspiracy theorists, who see
shadowy black helicopters and Delta Force hit squads doing
Washington's dirty work. On the other are government officials, who
seem to have worked overtime withholding the truth or downright
lying.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that official Washington has lost credibility
over recent admissions about the fiery end of the Waco standoff and
that the fringe patriot movement has gotten a boost, said Mark
Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which
tracks extremist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Faith in government was already at a low ebb, Potok said. Last
week's disclosure, after years of denials, that the FBI used
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters to help end the 51-day standoff can
only further discredit Washington, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze that destroyed the Branch Davidian buildings April 19,
1993, ended a siege that began Feb. 28 when agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raided the compound of cult leader
David Koresh to search for illegal weapons. The bodies of Koresh
and about 80 followers, including 20 children, were found in the
remains of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey, conducted jointly by Democratic and Republican
pollsters, found that 76 percent of Americans distrusted the
government. By comparison, 61 percent expressed such distrust after
the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The new revelations about Waco ``have provided more fuel to the
anti-government movement than anything we've seen in a while,''
Potok said by telephone from Montgomery, Ala. ``I think this is a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, there is an exultant air on such
anti-administration Web sites as FreeRepublic.com, where
participants have long posted their suspicions about the official
version of the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they've been vindicated, big time,'' said Connie
Hair, a spokeswoman for the site, which has seen daily ``hits''
jump from 70,000 to 100,000 since the latest revelations about the
Branch Davidian siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great, big, I-told-you-so,'' Randy Trochmann, 31,
co-founder of the Militia of Montana, said of the movement's
reaction to the revelations. ``Obviously, we've been saying this
for how many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Potok, who said he believes that the disclosures ``have a
potential to draw a number of mainstream Americans into the
anti-government movements,'' Trochmann said he wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Montana militia leader said he is certain that the Waco
stories ``will make more of the mainstream look at whatever the
government says with a skeptical eye. Obviously, the trust is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Saxe, a political science professor at the University of
Texas at Arlington, said the importance of trust in a democracy
cannot be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government is predicated to a tremendous extent
on trust,'' Saxe said. ``And it needs to be strong for America to
hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations, though damaging to the government, ``show
our system still works,'' he said. ``And even those
conspiratorialists will see that, eventually, the information will
come out, whether it's from the media or former government
officials finally raising their hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy,'' said Chip Berlet, who heads
Political Research Associates, a Massachusetts-based organization
that researches extremist movements. ``What it's done is legitimize
conspiracy theories that people had put at arm's length.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he said, ``The patriot movement is saying, `The
government lied about this, so everything we claim is true,
including that the government intentionally set out to murder those
children at Waco.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berlet said he perceived a weakening in the patriot and militia
movements after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, carried out by men
who reportedly were motivated by the Waco tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people stepped back from the most virulent of conspiracy
theories after Oklahoma City, saying, `You can take this too far,'
'' Berlet said. ``Now, they're saying, `Heck, we weren't taking it
far enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Often lost in the current spate of disclosures is lack of proof
that the FBI started the deadly blaze, Berlet and Potok said. Even
the retired FBI agent who confirmed the use of pyrotechnic military
tear gas, said it was fired at a bunker about 40 yards from the
compound several hours before the fire started.
</P>
<P>
   The agency might have hurt itself by releasing only dry
transcripts of conversations picked up by tiny microphones
implanted in milk cartons, not the actual tapes of Davidians
discussing setting fires inside the compound, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   Berlet said he found it ironic that the extreme right seems to
be getting all the payoff from the new disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a Harvard Law School professor, a self-described
liberal, was the only member of the Justice Department's Waco
investigation to openly criticize the federal agencies involved.
The professor, Alan A. Stone, urged a continued inquiry. He found
no intentional misconduct but determined that the tragedy could

   ``As a reward, I have been taken up by right-wing fanatics,
pilloried by the liberal Democrats to whose campaigns I contribute,
and assured by knowledgeable colleagues that my services will never
again be needed in Washington,'' Stone later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Political fringe expert Mark Pitcavage questioned how much the
extremists will gain from the latest revelations about Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their Internet chat rooms, which get limited
exposure, ``they don't have many ways to influence the general
public,'' said Pitcavage, the Ohio-based research director of the
State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training Program.
</P>
<P>
   But the disclosures have revived a key issue for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been six years, and much of the initial emotion of Waco
had faded,'' Pitcavage said. ``But now, with these revelations, it
has made Waco again a rallying cry.''

A WINE WORTH TAKING A CHANCE ON

   Calamin Cuvee Speciale 1995, Vaud, Switzerland. About $24.
</P>
<P>
   Should you lay out the price of a decent bottle of Champagne for
a virtually unknown white wine from Switzerland? This is one time
when plunging into the unknown will pay off. Calamin is from the
Domaine Louis Bovard, which has been in the wine business along the
terraced shores of Lake Geneva for 16 generations. The principal
grape in most Bovard wines, including Calamin, is chasselas, long a
favorite among Swiss vintners. This is an aromatic wine in the
style of viognier. It will go with rich dishes, but I'd recommend
getting to know it first as an aperitif. The winery says Calamin
can age for 10 to 15 years. Undoubtedly it will. But why wait?

GENES ARE CHANGED, BUT NOT THE LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)  (jt) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a field of genetically altered corn at the University of
Maine was destroyed by protesters in mid-August, it was a rare hint
that uneasiness over bioengineering in agriculture is growing among
Americans. Such actions have become common overseas, with
experimental fields burned in England, and the European Union and
Japan decreeing that genetically engineered food be labeled. But
Americans have so far been slow to anger.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that most of them don't have a clue that many
foods are already being made with genetically engineered
ingredients: no labeling is required in this country, nor is
government approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the September issue of Consumer Reports includes a
surprising shopping list of products tested by Consumers Union that
were found to contain genetically engineered soy, corn or other
ingredients. Among them were three powdered baby formulas _ Enfamil
Prosobee soy formula, Similac Isomil soy formula and Nestle
Carnation Alsoy _ as well as several soy burgers, including Boca
Burger, Chef Max's Favorite, Morningstar Farms Better 'n Burgers
and Green Giant Harvest Burgers. Ovaltine Malt powdered beverage
mix, Bac-Os Bacon Flavor bits, Bravos Tortilla Chips Nacho Nacho,
Old El Paso 12 taco shells and Jiffy Corn muffin mix also tested
positive for genetically altered ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union said it tested breakfast cereals and cooking
oils too, but that the results were inconclusive. It also reported
that 60 percent of all hard-cheese products are made with a biotech
version of rennet, the enzyme from calves' stomachs. And it
analyzed McDonald's McVeggie Burgers, sold in some of the chain's
New York City restaurants, which also tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union said it chose to test foods that were likely to
include genetically altered ingredients; the testing analyzed the
DNA makeup of those foods.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves the splicing of plant or animal
genes into the DNA of other species, either to improve crop yields
or to ward off insects or disease. Corn, potatoes, squash, papayas,
soybeans and canola are among the bioengineered crops already on
the market. All a company has to do to grow bioengineered products
is certify to the Agriculture Department that it will take safety
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Because so few safety studies have been done, there is no
evidence that genetically engineered food now on the market is
unsafe to eat. But some scientists and consumer advocates worry
about the potential for unknown allergens, an increase in natural
toxic substances, a decrease in nutritional value and especially
environmental damage. In addition, some religious groups are
concerned about the possibility that genes from foods they are
forbidden to eat will be put into other foods, like shellfish genes
into a tomato. The environmental concern has led to protests like
the one in Maine, in which a group calling itself Seeds of
Resistance claimed responsibility for cutting down 1,000 stalks of
genetically engineered corn in an experimental field hear Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   But the big issue, as Consumer Reports emphasized, is whether
consumers should be informed when bioengineered ingredients are
used, so they can decide whether to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the International Food Information Council
found that 71 percent of consumers in this country rated themselves
as poorly informed about food biotechnology. (Only 2 to 3 percent
thought soybeans are genetically engineered, for instance.) But
when they do know, they often act. After bovine growth hormone was
approved in 1993 to increase milk production, sales of organic milk
skyrocketed, and last year they doubled. That still represents only
0.3 percent of the $75 billion dairy market, but analysts say the
figure could reach 2 percent by 2005. Between 10 and 30 percent of
the nation's dairy cows have been injected with the gene-altered
hormone rBGH.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about genetically modified corn were raised last spring
when it was reported that pollen from the new crop killed monarch
butterfly larvae in a laboratory experiment. Entomologists at Iowa
State University are following up on the experiment in the field.
Consumer Reports said that John Obrycki, one of the entomologists,
reported that mortality data indicated that there is indeed a
threat to the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Since the European Union has refused to accept some genetically
modified American crops, farmers have begun to pay attention to the
issue, too. A judge in Brazil has also banned the sale there of
Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybean seeds, which are resistant to the
company's Roundup herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   Today, genetically engineered crops cover one-fourth of the
cropland in the United States, representing 35 percent of all corn,
almost 55 percent of all soybeans and nearly half of all cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports, which has a circulation of 4.5 million,
offered recommendations for dealing with the issue of genetically
altered foods, like requiring a federal review of the safety of
such foods for humans before they are put on the market.
</P>
<P>
   These were some other recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _That safety reviews be required before farmers are allowed to
plant bioengineered species, in an effort to prevent insects from
developing resistance to pesticides, the creation of superweeds and
harm to beneficial insects.
</P>
<P>
   _That a single national standard be established certifying that
``organic'' food meets certain standards, and that genetically
engineered food not be considered organic. No federal standard
exists now.
</P>
<P>
   _That the food industry be made liable for economic or
biological damage resulting from genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   _That genetically engineered foods, both domestic and imported,
be labeled. As the magazine put it, ``Consumers have a fundamental
right to know what they eat.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Time magazine poll published last January, 81 percent of
the respondents said genetically engineered food should be labeled.
In fact, labeling can work more than one way: some dairies and tofu
makers have found that they can increase sales by noting on labels
that their products are free of genetically engineered ingredients.

SOYBEANS: BET YOU CAN'T EAT JUST ONE

 (ATTN: N.Y., Minn.)   (Editors: recipes at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chinese call them mao dou, or hairy beans. The Japanese call
them edamame, or branch beans. Neither name, however, expresses
even faintly the fondness those cultures have for the soybean. Like
the peanut in America, the soybean is a humble home-grown legume
that everyone eats _ often as a snack _ and most adore.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans are earning increasing fondness in this country, too.
Enter any Japanese restaurant in Manhattan _ especially now, at the
height of the season _ and you are sure to spot a bowl of them,
piled high and disappearing quickly. Served in the pod, they are
eaten by scraping the oval beans out of the salty, fuzzy pod with
your teeth. They're so tasty they're addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Trader Joe's, a national grocery chain, began carrying frozen
soybeans 10 months ago. Sales now rival those of frozen corn and
broccoli. Sales at Sunrich Inc. in Hope, Minn., the largest
producer of organic and genetically unmodified green vegetable
soybeans in the country, have risen 25 percent in each of the last
two years. ``We sell out as much as we can grow,'' said Allan
Routh, the president of Sunrich, which sells soybeans mostly to
large food manufacturers, health food stores and Asian markets.
Recently, the company has begun distributing the beans, grown
mainly in Iowa and Minnesota, to mainstream grocery chains.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, pigs were the beneficiaries of most soybeans
cultivated in the United States. Other soy products, like tofu and
soy milk, had for years been treated as esoteric health foods. Now
that soy is being heralded for healthfulness, that perception is
reversing. Soybeans are remarkable: they are 36 percent protein,
high in vitamin C and abundant in the plant-derived hormones called
phytoestrogens.
</P>
<P>
   Health, however, is not the sole driving force behind the new
interest in soybeans that are sold whole, which are a different
variety from those used to make tofu and are unlike the ones grown
for animal feed. Next to a bag of chips, soybeans in the pod happen
to be the world's easiest hors d'oeuvre. Simply buy a bag of the
frozen beans (or sweet beans, as they are sometimes labeled), boil
them for a few minutes, drain, cool and pile them into a bowl. This
is how they are prepared in Japan, where they are served in
practically every bar.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, edamame appears on the menus of most Japanese
restaurants, usually among the appetizers. It also shows up on
Korean and Chinese menus, as well as on ones that are not Asian. At
Avenue, soybeans are mixed with cucumber, lemongrass, red onions
and vinaigrette and served with fried oysters. They are paired with
roasted suckling pig, corn and summer savory at Maison. At Gourmet
Garage, they are mixed into a salad with shrimp, rosemary, olive
oil and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, soybeans are sold in markets on the branch with their
roots still attached _ thus the name branch bean. ``You need
gardening gloves to pull the beans off,'' said Elizabeth Andoh, the
founder of a Taste of Culture, a culinary arts and cultural program
in Tokyo. ``They're really prickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A copper brown fuzz clings to the outside of soybean pods and
must be removed before eating. To get it off, Ms. Andoh said,
Japanese cooks put the beans in a suribachi, a ceramic mortar with
a grooved interior. Then they sprinkle on coarse salt and rub the
beans against the mortar so that the fuzz sticks in the grooves,
leaving just the bright-green pods. With this technique, there is
no need to salt the water when boiling them.
</P>
<P>
   All this work may be considered a necessity in Japan, but in
America, it's tough to sell. Julie and Davie C.Y. Yen, owners of
the Hydro Garden Farm in Yaphank, N.Y., found that they had to
remove the fuzz and even boil the beans to sell them at their stand
at the Greenmarket in Manhattan's Union Square. ``People didn't
want to do the work,'' Ms. Yen said. Still, their sales have grown
about 30 percent annually in the three years they have been selling
them.
</P>
<P>
   The beans are also sold fresh around Chinatown and at specialty
Asian markets like Yaohan Plaza in Edgewater, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find fresh, you can always find frozen, in or out
of the pod, which are lightly blanched and need less cooking. Most
are imported from China or Taiwan. Markets like Eli's Manhattan and
Fairway also now carry cooked edamame in the pod in the sushi
aisles. But fresh soybeans in season are sweeter and cleaner
tasting and have more snap when you bite into them. Frozen ones
lack the sweetness and have a starchier, almost glutinous texture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wangsheng Li, an owner of the Evergreen Shanghai Restaurants in
Manhattan's midtown and Chinatown, refuses to serve the frozen
variety, so soybeans are on the menu for just a few months a year.
Freezing them, he said, ``ruins the texture.'' He is fussy perhaps,
but he grew up in Shanghai, where the beans were treated like a
summer vegetable _ something eaten almost every day in season
because they were not available the rest of the year. They were
eaten plain or boiled in water, sometimes with rice wine lees or
anise.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford brought soybeans to the United States from Asia in
the 1940s, said Carol Miles, a vegetable researcher at the
Washington State University Cooperative Extension. He was the first
to push their production, offering them to his employees as food
supplements after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As in Asia, soybeans are a warm-weather plant, with harvests
stretching from July through October. They grow on a low leafy
plant like green beans and are picked fairly young, before the
beans get too plump and starchy.
</P>
<P>
   Some growers, Ms. Miles said, have been picking field soybeans
grown for animal feed while they are young and selling them as
edamame. But there is a difference: vegetable soybeans _ those
grown to be eaten as a vegetable _ have a much fatter bean and a
brighter pod, and taste better.
</P>
<P>
   For all their inroads into American restaurants, fresh soybeans
are most traditional in Asian cooking. At Evergreen, they are
stir-fried with paper-thin strips of soybean sheet and pickled
Chinese cabbage. At Menchanko-tei, a Japanese restaurant in
midtown, whole beans are mixed with bay scallops, shrimp and
scallions, dipped in tempura batter and fried in lacy fritters.
</P>
<P>
   In Japanese restaurants, though, soybeans are still mostly
served plain. And cold. Eating them cold from the pod has been
traditional since the 17th century in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mame gohan, the Japanese version of rice and beans, is at least
that old. The beans are simmered in dashi seasoned with mirin and
light soy sauce, and then the same cooking liquid is used for the
rice. Before serving, the beans and rice are folded together, with
a light dusting of salt and black sesame seeds.
</P>
<P>
   For a first taste, though, none of these dishes will do. Boil
water. Wedge open a beer. And eat soybeans the easiest way, as a
snack, slipping them from their shells with your teeth, bean by
salty bean.

THE DAY THE RESTAURANTS REST: ON SUNDAY, EATING OUT GOES SOFT
FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I used to eat at home on Sundays. But the need to
dine out constantly has disrupted my pattern _ and opened my eyes.
I now routinely eat out on both weekend nights, and a creeping
suspicion is growing into something like a firm conviction: for
diners, Sunday is not a good bet.
</P>
<P>
   At restaurant after restaurant, I have detected a slackening
off, a lack of luster, a sag and a droop on Sundays. The same dish
that sparkled on a Wednesday just sat there on Sunday, dull and
lifeless. The snap, crackle and pop that I admired in the service
on Saturday night became a listless shuffling on Sunday. Only the
bill remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   I first noticed this phenomenon at The Red Cat in Chelsea, a
restaurant that thrilled me on a couple of weeknight visits,
especially with a highly original sweet pea and risotto cake fitted
out with plump oysters. On an ill-fated Sunday, I took a party of
four there and coerced my fellow diners into ordering my favorite
dish. We all took a bite. Everyone looked at me quizzically. There
was nothing wrong with the thing, but it was no big deal, either.
It just reposed on the plate meekly. The rest of the meal went the
same way. No one could figure out what I was so excited about,
until chance brought two of my diners to the restaurant on a
weeknight. We had a really good meal, they reported.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Square Cafe, I sensed the same falloff. Not a
precipitous plunge, but a slight relaxation, a perceptible dulling
of the restaurant's reflexes. My lemon-pepper duck with
peach-cherry chutney and glazed carrots, for example, seemed wan,
and just a little tough and dry. Union Square Cafe? Et tu, Brute?
</P>
<P>
   What explains the malaise? I've been turning the question over
and over and have come up with a few explanations _ some
philosophical and speculative, some common-sensical and rooted in
hard economics. To start with the hard facts, many chefs take
Sunday off. On the seventh day, they rest, and in many cases, so
does the food. An eagle eye and deft hand is no longer enforcing
the letter of the law, so the food that comes out of the kitchen,
although executed well enough, slides just a notch.
</P>
<P>
   The food itself is different, too. It's older. Restaurants
cannot browse the daily market on Sunday for the freshest greens.
Fish suppliers do not deliver. The oyster with a sparkle in its eye
on Saturday can look a little blurry on Sunday. Sushi loses some of
its sheen. It's like eating food in soft focus. The flavors lose
clarity and definition. The vibrancy of the weeknight meal doesn't
vibrate quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with the service. A Sunday lassitude seems to
spread throughout the staff. The curious psychological power of
Sunday, which drains energy from everyone except televangelists,
may be the culprit here. There may be a dollars-and-cents
explanation as well. At most restaurants, Sunday is not a prime
night for tips, and therefore the best, most-seasoned waiters will
choose it as a day off, leaving the restaurant with
second-stringers. And the first-stringers who do work on Sunday can
be forgiven for experiencing a Sunday letdown after the tumult and
excitement of a busy Manhattan Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant-going in New York is theater, and there's no question
that Friday and Saturday nights generate an excitement unmatched
during the week. Restaurants stay open late. The mood is upbeat.
Waiters and waitresses give it their all, into the wee hours. And
then the unlucky ones have to turn around and do it over again on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   They play to a tougher crowd. The Sunday night diner is not the
same as the Saturday night diner. Sundays are made for the
returning weekenders who are too tired to fix a meal at home, for
the pleasure seekers who want to squeeze the very last drops out of
their days off, and for the thousands of New Yorkers who look deep
into their refrigerators, then look deep into their souls and
decide that that they'd rather eat out.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a fun group. Some of them look like they're eating
their last meal. And servers, like stand-up comics or actors, feed
off audience energy. It's a lot easier to deliver a top-drawer
performance for dating couples out for a splurge, a giddy gang
looking forward to a late-night party or out-of-towners with stars
in their eyes. Sunday diners are subdued, already feeling the
shadow of the workweek. Mirth and hilarity _ and the big tips that
go with them _ belong to the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Summer does not help. Oysters are out of season. Chefs take
actual vacations. The heat adds another humid layer to the torpor,
and the very notion of Monday seems not just cruel but perverse.
Sunday dining takes a beating.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, restaurants get around the Sunday problem by closing
down for the night. Most of them stay closed Monday, too, just to
be sure. Some New York restaurants have followed suit, but most
need the cash flow. Like taxis, they keep the engine running seven
days. And the unwary diner can get taken for a ride. &QL;

preparations of mussels is at Plouf, a charming downtown

balancing the dish with apple and celery and smoothed with creme

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; POTPOURRI &LR;  _ About 10 years ago, wine lovers began
to grumble about Chardonnay dominating the white wine field to the
exclusion of nearly every other varietal. ``That other white wine''
(i.e., Sauvignon Blanc) was just beginning to gather a following,
but it needed a push.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the SOBs, a group of winemakers and winery owners
anxious to see Sauvignon Blanc get more respect and attention with
the aim of convincing wine drinkers that Sauvignon Blanc can match
Chardonnay and Johannisberg Riesling as one of the truly noble
white grape varieties.

 Kitchen Appliances Allow Us to Have a Career and
Home-Cooked  Dinners, Too

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR;

 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  At the danger of being summarily dismissed from
from the fraternal order of foodies, I have to make a confession: I
love my kitchen gadgets.
<P>
   And we are not talking about the reputable chef's knife (though
I couldn't cook without it), nor the unlined copper bowl (which
 &LR; does &LR;  give egg whites that billowy extra volume).
</P>
<P>
   We are talking of the untouchables: the food processor, the
blender, the microwave oven and _ shudder _ the bread machine.
Admittedly, none of them are life-or-death necessities, but they
can make existence on a hectic schedule easier, and if you use good
kitchen sense and discretion, they can make it possible to produce
a home-cooked meal when you might otherwise resort to take-out.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recipes using some appliances that are meant to
save time _ in preparation and in clean-up.

10-MINUTE BORSCHT
</P>
<P>
   Any leftover borscht is excellent served cold the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   1 red beet (5-6 ounces), peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1/4 head cabbage (about 8 ounces), rinsed
</P>
<P>
   3 cups beef broth
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sour cream or plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely chopped fennel leaves or chives (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Shred the onion in a food processor fitted with the shredding
disk. Don't clean the bowl and blade until all vegetables have been
processed. Transfer the onion to a large micro-safe bowl; toss with
the oil. Cover loosely and microwave at medium-high for 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Shred the beet in the processor. Add to the onion and microwave
at medium-high for 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cabbage into chunks and shred in the processor. Add to
the onion/beet, along with the broth. Microwave, loosely covered,
on high for 3 minutes. Test the soup _ the vegetables should be
cooked through but not mushy. If needed, microwave up to 2 minutes
longer in 30-second increments. Taste for salt. Amount needed
depends on saltiness of the broth. Stir in the vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle into bowls and top each with a dollop of sour cream or
yogurt. If you wish, garnish with coarsely chopped fresh fennel
fronds or chives.

POACHED SALMON WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE FOR 2
</P>
<P>
   If you are cooking for more than two, increase the amounts
accordingly and increase the cooking time _ about half again as
much time for four, almost double for six.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Fish
</P>
<P>
   1 large salmon fillet, 14 to 16 ounces
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons vodka (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
</P>
<P>
   The Sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon butter, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cold water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Yolk from 1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the salmon skin-side down in a heat-proof pie plate or
other shallow micro-safe dish, tucking the thin part of the fillet
under to make an even thickness. Drizzle with lemon juice, maple
syrup and the optional vodka. Sprinkle with dill. Let marinate at
room temperature while you prepare the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The sauce:  &LR; Place 3 tablespoons cut-up butter in a 2-cup
heat-proof measuring cup or other suitable container. Microwave on
medium-high for 45 seconds, until barely melted. Stir with a fork
until all the butter is liquid. Stir in the water and lemon juice.
Add the egg yolk and beat to blend. Microwave at medium (half
power) for 12 seconds, stir with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat these 2 steps 3 or 4 times, until the sauce thickens.
Remove from the oven and immediately stir in the remaining teaspoon
of cold butter.
</P>
<P>
   Taste for salt and add additional lemon juice, if desired. Place
in a bowl filled with hot tap water and cover loosely to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Place the plate with the fish in the microwave; microwave at
medium-high for 2 minutes. Check for doneness by cutting a slit in
the center of the fillet. Cooking time will vary depending on your
oven and the thickness and temperature of the fish. In most
instances, the fish will need another 30 seconds to 11/2 minutes at
medium-high.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the oven as soon as the center is no longer raw.
Cover loosely and let rest a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Portion the fish onto serving plates and spoon the sauce over.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Poultry Lunch Meat Isn't Same Old Bologna  &HT;       
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Last week we brought you the disappointing results
of the Taster's Choice for bologna made from pork, beef or a
combination of meats. This week's panel tasted three bolognas made
with turkey and one made with chicken.
<P>
   The poultry bolognas were lower in fat than most of the meat
bolognas, giving them a slightly more attractive health profile.
Overall, the panel liked these better than the meat versions, but
they still found most to be just as slimy and overly salty.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on the poultry bologna varied more than the meat
bolognas. Poultry bologna ranged from $1.59 for an 8-ounce package
to $3.49 for a 12-ounce package.
</P>
<P>
   The panel agreed on one favorite and gave it a decent rating.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was  &UR; Zacky Farms Chicken Bologna &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.49
at Andronico's). Four panelists liked the texture, which they
described as meaty and with ``good chew.'' But one panelist thought
the texture was grainy. Three panelists liked the spicy, peppery
taste; one of them described it as almost sausagelike. Two
panelists did not like the dark color. Two would buy it; three
might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Butterball Turkey Bologna &LR;  (12 ounces,
$3.49 at Safeway), which also happens to be fat free. Two panelists
liked the slight smokey quality, but all commented it had a strange
sweet flavor. Two also thought it was too salty. Three panelists
described the texture as plastic, rubbery and elastic. One would
buy it, one might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Zacky Farms Turkey Bologna  &LR; (16 ounces, $2.49 at Andronico's)
came in third, but scored significantly lower than its chicken
counterpart. All of the panelists were put off by a pronounced
grainy, gritty texture, and most thought it was too salty. One
might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Louis Rich Turkey Bologna  &LR; (8 ounces, $1.59 at Safeway) came in
fourth. All the panelists disliked the texture, which they
described as plasticlike and ``like Silly Putty,'' and two also
pointed out a lack of flavor. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Roland
Passot chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are

<P>
   Finding a perfect etrog is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Observant Jews who follow the biblical commandment of reciting a
prayer over ``the fruit of goodly trees'' for Succoth, the harvest
celebration, sometimes use a magnifying glass to choose the finest
one. This thick-skinned citrus fruit, which looks like a large
lemon and tastes like an especially bitter one, is thought by some
to have been the true forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jewish law, if the skin of the etrog (pronounced
EH-trog) is covered with scars, or has peeled, split or been
perforated, the fruit cannot be used. An etrog considered fit for
Succoth must come from a tree that has not been grafted; in Israel,
where most of these fruits are grown, they are supposed to be left
on the tree every seventh year, following a biblical commandment.
</P>
<P>
   Grown in small numbers specifically for Succoth, etrogs are
harvested by hand and are in demand only in the weeks before the
holiday, which this year begins Sept. 24. Good ones are sold in
stores that sell religious items and can cost from $25 to several
hundred dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   At the Esrog Warehouse in Queens, N.Y., thousands of etrogs
(also called esrog or citron) will be distributed in the region in
the next week or so. Most of the 200,000 that are exported to the
United States come from Israel, with about 10,000 from Italy and
Morocco, said Yaakov Charlap, the warehouse owner.
</P>
<P>
   The Succoth blessing is said with the etrog held in the left
hand and a date palm branch, entwined with myrtle and a willow
branch, in the right. The four items are sold as a set, and Jewish
tradition holds that incredible spiritual blessings flow upon a
person who prays over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the etrog is both fragrant and edible, it symbolizes
Jews who are learned in Torah and who do good deeds,'' said Rabbi
Jerome Davidson of Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The etrog is thought to have originated in northern India or
Afghanistan, and in ancient times it was also prized for its
medicinal value; it was thought to enhance potency in men.
According to one folk belief, a woman who bites into an etrog will
become pregnant within a year.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part throughout history, etrogs have only been
candied or dried for their fragrance. Now there is a movement in
California, Florida, Arizona and Texas to grow them for food as
well as for Succoth. The etrog does not make things easy for
would-be farmers: trees do not bear fruit for four to seven years,
and the fruit has relatively little pulp for its five-inch size.
</P>
<P>
   Among these hopeful growers is Dr. David Wiseman of Dallas.
Wiseman, 39, a medical research scientist, became curious about the
etrog after a Succoth class with his rabbi. ``After we said the
traditional prayer over the etrog, I started wondering what it
tasted like,'' Wiseman said. So he cut it open and found it
``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   He planted a few seeds in pots and put them in his garage. When
they started to sprout months later, he moved them to a sunny place
in his house. By the next summer they had become such admired
plants that he asked his fellow congregants to give him their
etrogs after the holiday was over. From six etrogs he planted 300
seeds in pots in his backyard and has since learned how to make a
vodka-based schnapps, candied citron and marmalade from the pulp.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman has created Zaide Reuben's Esrog Farm (972-931-5596), a
company that sells etrogs from Israel, his seedlings, an etrog
booklet and T-shirts through his Web site:
members.aol.com/zrsesrog.
</P>
<P>
   But he faces a challenge. That's how it is when you seek
perfection.

about 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place fruit in food processor, and pulse 3 or 4 times.
Transfer to saucepan. Add 1 cup of sugar for every cup of fruit.
Heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Simmer for 30
minutes uncovered, stirring frequently, until marmalade thickens.
Pour into jars, cover and refrigerate.

 LEARNING TO COOK: When Life Gets Corny, Make Soup  &HT;       
 By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  One of the most common weaknesses we home cooks
have is buying too much produce at the farmers' market, then having
to figure out how to use the excess. Buying too much summer fruit
is easier to cope with than having an overabundance of vegetables.
<P>
   I simply cook excess fruit with sugar, ladle it into jars and
keep it in the refrigerator. This is simple to do and is easy to
serve in a number of different ways: spoon it on toast, over ice
cream, or in a small dish topped with a little cream.
</P>
<P>
   Being creative with vegetables is a little trickier. However,
I've solved the problem of what to do with too many ears of corn,
both raw and cooked. Corn Soup.
</P>
<P>
   This soup is nice served with rye crackers and a sharp cheese.
Or, try serving it with a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich for a
light summer meal. If you are new at home cooking, this
three-ingredient recipe is hard to flub.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Marion Cunningham, Bay Area cooking teacher, is the author of
``Learning to Cook,'' ``Cooking With Children,'' ``The Fannie

</P>

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; 3 INGREDIENT CORN SOUP
</P>
<P>
   This easy summer soup can be either creamy or crunchy, depending
on whether you puree it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 cups corn kernels (about 9 ears of fresh corn)
</P>
<P>
   41/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cutting the kernels off the cob:  &LR; Pull the outer leaves and
silky threads off each ear of corn.
</P>
<P>
   Put a large piece of waxed paper on cutting board.
</P>
<P>
   Hold each ear of corn, large end upright, on the cutting board
and, using a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob from top to
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up the ends of the waxed paper and, using it as a sling,
transfer the corn to a heavy-bottomed saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the soup &LR; : Add 3 cups of milk and the salt to the
saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high and stir often until the
milk begins to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, so the
milk simmers, but does not boil. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring
every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the soup:  &LR; If you want a crunchy corn soup, just add
the remaining 11/2 cups milk, taste and add more salt if needed;
heat and serve.
</P>
<P>
   If you want creamy corn soup, pour the soup into a food
processor and process until the corn is pureed (the kernels will be
broken down into small bits, or blended completely into the milk,
depending on how powerful your processor is). Pour the soup back
into the saucepan and add the remaining 11/2 cups milk. Taste and
add more salt if needed; heat and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &LR; 3 INGREDIENT CORN SOUP
</P>
<P>
   This easy summer soup can be either creamy or crunchy, depending
on whether you puree it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 cups corn kernels (about 9 ears of fresh corn)
</P>
<P>
   41/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cutting the kernels off the cob:  &LR; Pull the outer leaves and
silky threads off each ear of corn.
</P>
<P>
   Put a large piece of waxed paper on cutting board.
</P>
<P>
   Hold each ear of corn, large end upright, on the cutting board
and, using a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob from top to
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up the ends of the waxed paper and, using it as a sling,
transfer the corn to a heavy-bottomed saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the soup &LR; : Add 3 cups of milk and the salt to the
saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high and stir often until the
milk begins to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, so the
milk simmers, but does not boil. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring
every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the soup:  &LR; If you want a crunchy corn soup, just add
the remaining 11/2 cups milk, taste and add more salt if needed;
heat and serve.
</P>
<P>
   If you want creamy corn soup, pour the soup into a food
processor and process until the corn is pureed (the kernels will be
broken down into small bits, or blended completely into the milk,
depending on how powerful your processor is). Pour the soup back
into the saucepan and add the remaining 11/2 cups milk. Taste and
add more salt if needed; heat and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 CHRON  
 COOK'S BOOKS: Make Way for Matzo Ball Gumbo  &HT;        By David A. Steinberg 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; One of the hottest catchphrases (some would say
cliches) in food circles these days is ``fusion cuisine'' ergo
German blutwurst served sushi-style. So I had an undeniable
prejudice toward ``Crossroads Cooking: The Meeting and Mating of
Ethnic Cuisines _ From Burma to Texas in 200 Recipes,'' by
Elizabeth Rozin.
<P>
   It's a forgivable preconception, given that the title seems to
support the idea that this is yet another cookbook to jump on the
fusion bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   The blurb on the inside of the book jacket, however, insists
that the concept of ``crossroads'' cooking is ``very different from
self-conscious `fusion' or a `melting pot' that blurs the identity
of its ingredients. . . . (It covers) the happenstance meeting and
mating of traditions, thereby creating cuisines both diverse and
distinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. Sounds like a distinction without a difference to me.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong _ I am not reticent about liberally borrowing
from a variety of cuisines to make a single dish. I do have a
problem with a cookbook trying to justify its existence by claiming
to be different, while marketing itself in the same niche that it
claims to reject. But that is in many ways beside the point with
this book.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are far from controversial, and, indeed, Rozin makes
the case that fusion cuisine is a natural process when cultures
collide at various junctures in the world. With an extensive
foreword and introductions to every chapter, she pushes this thesis
further.
</P>
<P>
   She leads the reader to believe this is practically an academic
treatise on the anthropological development of cuisines. Yet, she
doesn't offer a single scholarly reference. Instead, she makes
ad-hominim remarks and facile observations about the origins of
various cuisines and trends without supporting evidence. (Matzo
Ball Gumbo offers ``the vibrant spirit and flavor of the Louisiana
gumbo . . . refashioned within the guidelines of the biblical
dietary laws.'')
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook is more of a ``Whitman sampler'' of cultural
cuisines than anything else. Despite the haphazard premise, Rozin
offers some good recipes. The deviled crab casserole is elegant and
well worth the effort of dealing with shelling the fresh crab.
</P>
<P>
   Less appealing, though still quite good tasting as a ``feeding
the hoard'' dish, is the turkey tamale pie. More than one person
commented that this is an ideal recipe after the holidays when
you're trying to figure out how to use all the leftover turkey for
the fifth time in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning recipe, however, is the sweet-and-sour lamb satay
with coconut-peanut dipping sauce. This is an exceptionally
balanced recipe and a brilliant blending of flavors. If you or
someone in your house is a grill maven, this is a great recipe to
pull out when you are having people over for a backyard barbecue.
It can be used as either a tempting appetizer or the star
attraction as a main course.
</P>
<P>
   The book as a whole is well laid out, and the recipes are easy
to follow. But I suggest Rozin should have presented her book more
honestly. She adds nothing of substance to the fusion debate (if
you are even interested in such a thing) but rather seems eager to
ride its coattails. Sort of like having your blutwurst sushi and
eating, too.

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SWEET-AND-SOUR LAMB SATAY WITH COCONUT-PEANUT DIPPING SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Although pork is the favored meat of most Asians, lamb is a
delicious alternative for many of the Malaysian Muslims whose
religion forbids the meat of the pig. The sweet-and-sour marinade
works particularly well with the full flavor of lamb. The
coconut-peanut dipping sauce is but one variety of a host of
sweet-and-spicy satay sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean boneless lamb, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons regular soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon crushed hot pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons black soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely minced lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   If you are using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for an hour
or two before you need them.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the lamb with 2 tablespoons of the regular soy sauce, 1
tablespoon of the brown sugar, and the tamarind and garlic. Mix
well. Let stand, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a small, heavy saucepan and saute the shallots,
ginger and the pepper flakes over moderate heat, stirring, for a
few minutes, until the mixture becomes aromatic.
</P>
<P>
   Add the coconut milk, the remaining tablespoon of regular soy
sauce, the black soy sauce, lemon juice, lemongrass and the
remaining tablespoon of dark brown sugar. Mix well and bring to a
simmer. Simmer, stirring, for a few minutes. Add the peanut butter
and mix until the sauce is well blended and smooth. Remove from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Thread the marinated lamb onto skewers. Grill over hot charcoal,
turning once, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the satay with the coconut-peanut sauce for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Any leftover dipping sauce can be stored in a covered
jar in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks. Heat the sauce to a
simmer before serving again.

 CRUSH '99: Harvest Is Late, But Quality Looks Good  &HT;        By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  El Ni &LR; n &LR; o and La Ni &LR; n &LR; a have dealt the California
wine industry a double weather whammy this year, backing up the
annual harvest at least two to four weeks in some areas. Even so,
it's under way in some of the state's warmer grape-growing regions.
<P>
   In Lake County, Karen Magoon of Guenoc Winery reports that grape
picking has begun in the Guenoc Valley and that grape quality looks
very good. Harvest is also under way at the Kendall-Jackson
Lakeport Winery with the arrival of Chardonnay grapes from Contra
Costa County.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, the California Department of Food and
Agriculture estimated this year's wine grape production would be
2.9 million tons _ up 13 percent from 1998. The report concluded,
``Growers are expecting a good quality crop due to recent warm days
and cool nights.''

RECENT EVENTS PUT WACO RESIDENTS ON DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For more than six years, Brenda Carpenter has
lived with the stigma of being from a city people associate with
renegade cults; gruesome, fiery deaths; and overzealous law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people would just let it rest,'' said Carpenter, 43, a
pharmaceutical technician who lives in the Waco suburb of Elm Mott.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Waco residents like it or not, the events at Mount
Carmel in 1993 will not likely let them rest for some time. The
city is in the news again after the Federal Bureau of Investigation
recently disclosed after years of denials that it used pyrotechnic
tear-gas canisters to help end a standoff at the Branch Davidian
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith told federal
authorities to surrender to a federal clerk in Waco all evidence
related to the events at Mount Carmel or risk being held in
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   But these events are probably tame compared to the public frenzy
that could build in this city of 104,000 by the time the civil
trial being brought by relatives of dead Branch Davidians begins
Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in light of recent news stories, the number of visitors
to the compound jumped from about 30 to 40 cars on an average
weekend day to about 100 Sunday, said Amo Paul Bishop Roden, who
lives in a one-room, white-washed A-frame house at the entrance to
the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of days it's been absolutely wild,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Carpenter and others, the recent events bring back memories
of April 19, 1993, when fire consumed the compound, and the bodies
of David Koresh and about 80 followers were found in the complex's
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   While Carpenter was in a south Louisiana store buying a shirt
for her husband shortly after the fire, the proprietor overheard
that she was from Waco. He tried to give her the shirt to get her
out of the store quickly because he was so unnerved that she might
be a Branch Davidian, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter discussed such misperceptions while sitting in her car
at the entrance to Mount Carmel, the compound about 10 miles from
town where the Davidians died after a siege that began Feb. 28,
1993, when agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
attempted to search for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of saying that she wanted the public to forget about
the debacle at the compound while visiting it herself was not lost
on Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister wanted to see it,'' she said and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Many local residents have such stories.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Stovall, an M&AMP;M/Mars plant worker, said she dislikes
using her credit card with the Waco skyline when she's out of town
because it prompts too many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Melvya Collins, a retired school administrator, said she gets
similar treatment when people see Waco on her luggage tags. They
want to know if she knew any Davidians, if she's a Davidian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `I wasn't even there at the time. I was in
Pittsburgh, P-A,' '' she said. ``It's exasperating.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may provide fulfillment for some, Roden said.
</P>
<P>
   Roden was married to George Roden, who preceded Koresh as Branch
Davidian leader and who had feuded with Koresh. Now she serves as
part squatter, part welcoming committee for the slow trickle of
trucks, sport utility vehicles and rental cars that drive the rural
farm road for a glimpse at the infamous compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking, I think, for answers, or maybe just
looking,'' Roden said. ``Some want to pay their respects,
especially for the children. People have lost a lot of faith in the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles follow the same black dirt driveway that the tanks
used to arrive at the front door of the main building in the
compound before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   There is little to see anymore. All that remains of a complex
that once included a two-story building with a four-story tower, a
gymnasium and several underground tunnels is a swimming pool of
rough concrete with some stagnant brown water in it. On the edge of
the pool, under the label ``History's Most Photographed Massacre,''
someone has painted directions pointing to where cameras from the
FBI and news media were located.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of grasshoppers jump waist high every time a visitor
takes a step, and almost everyone makes a comment about the
biblical plagues.
</P>
<P>
   Two burned-out buses are on either side of the area where the
buildings were, and one of Koresh's old motorcycles sits across the
street. The only other vertical features are typed signs covered in
glass and 80 crape myrtles. The signs, showing where the gym, the
front door, the dining room and other compound features were once
located, are apparently new, maybe driven into the ground as
recently as Sunday, Roden speculated. One refers to the upcoming
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The crape myrtles _ with not a single bloom _ stand above
granite gravestones for each of the Branch Davidians, including 20
children, found dead after the fire. Only Koresh's was set in
concrete, presumably to prevent theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take long to see everything,'' said Larry Barton,
50, of Grapevine, Texas, surveying the remains.
</P>
<P>
   For the three-day Labor Day weekend, Barton decided to take in
the sights of Waco: the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum, the
Dr Pepper Museum and, of course, Mount Carmel. The city of Waco
tourist office even gave him a map to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Barton predicted that many millions of dollars will be wasted in
further investigations of the episode and that nothing will be
resolved. His views were similar to those of several who visited
the compound Sunday, that something terrible went wrong and that
the American people will never know the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the government covers up a lot of stuff, so we will
never know what the truth is,'' said Les Baldwin, 46, of Campbell,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Waco has become a symbol. And for all their
eye-rolling, even some Waco residents have to admit that the events
at Mount Carmel mean that the town's name has recognition not just
by millions of Americans but by many more around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Conley knows. The Waco truck driver visited the compound
Sunday for the 10th time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensational story,'' Conley said. ``Everybody
seems to know about it and about us.''

 CHRON   WINE POTPOURRI: SOBs Rally 'Round Sauvignon Blanc  
   
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  About 10 years ago, wine lovers began to grumble
about Chardonnay dominating the white wine field to the exclusion
of nearly every other varietal. ``That other white wine'' (i.e.,
Sauvignon Blanc) was just beginning to gather a following, but it
needed a push.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along came the SOBs, a group of winemakers and winery owners
anxious to see Sauvignon Blanc get more respect and attention. The
Society of Blancs' charter aimed to convince the wine trade and
wine-drinking public that Sauvignon Blanc can match Chardonnay and
Johannisberg Riesling as one of the truly noble white grape
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1990, I moderated a panel discussion by Sonoma County
winemakers, all SOB members, on ``Taming the Wild Sauvignon
Blanc.'' Wildness referred to the broad palate of aromas and
flavors that could be developed from Sauvignon Blanc, depending on
where the grapes were grown and how the wine was made.
</P>
<P>
   One attempt by the SOBs to get the word out was the Sauvignon
Blanc &AMP; Fume Blanc Flavor Spectrum. Designed like a fan, the graph
starts at the center with the three styles _ grassy, fruity and
spicy _ then fans out to show typical flavors. Grassy, for
instance, is categorized as fresh, garden herbal, floral or
flat-out grassy. The outer ring takes the flavor spectrum one step
further, with suggested flavors like mint, oregano, violet and
lemongrass. The Flavor Spectrum also lists conditions _ climate,
soils and winemaking, for example _ that influence the character of
the wine.
</P>
<P>
   However, nearly a decade after it was formed, the Society of
Blancs is on hiatus because of lack of interest on the part of the
winery members _ an odd move considering the California wine
industry still has not provided the public with a clear definition
of Sauvignon Blanc, and how, if at all, it differs from Fum &LR; e &LR; 
Blanc.

   Following the French models, a California wine labeled Sauvignon
Blanc should resemble a Bordeaux blanc, usually with a little oak
and some Semillon in the blend. A California Fum &LR; e &LR;  Blanc (a name
created by Robert Mondavi in the early 1970s from the Loire Pouilly
Blanc Fum &LR; e &LR; ) should be more like a Loire Pouilly Fum &LR; e &LR;  or
Sancerre. But the reality is that California Fum &LR; e &LR;  Blanc often is
barrel-fermented and oak-aged and may include Semillon, while some
Sauvignon Blancs never see oak.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all that the fact that many Sauvignons and Fum &LR; e &LR; s are
finished with perceptible sweetness, a characteristic that should
be alien to Sauvignon Blanc. With all this confusion, is it any
wonder that Sauvignon Blanc doesn't sell as well as Chardonnay?

   Q: Henry B. Meyer of San Francisco is the owner of the following
three old European wines and he wonders about their drinkability
and value. &QL; 
A: Zeller Schwarze Katz (Black Cat) is made from a number of
individual vineyards, around the town of Zell on the Mosel River.
It is a white wine made for early consumption, so it is unlikely
that the 1957 Schwarze Katz is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gilis 1933 St. Emilion Light Bordeaux is a mystery to me,
although at 66 years old, I would think that any ``light'' wine
must now be an undrinkable curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Caraco &AMP; Benitez Malaga Oro may be the keeper of the lot. Malaga
is a sweet dessert wine from the Costa del Sol region of Spain.
Some Malagas age well, but since there is no way of knowing the
true age of your wine, I'd pull the cork. If you decide to drink
the Malaga, I'd like to hear your impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: C. Earlenbaugh of Oakland inherited a bottle of Charles Krug
1972 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and is curious about its value
and if any restaurant has an interest in adding his Cabernet to its
wine list.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not knowing the history of the particular bottle, I can only
offer general advice. Vintage 1972 was not that good in the Napa
Valley for red wines, and most of the best wines were already
tiring by the early 1990s. Since any remaining '72s are not
generally on collector's lists, I suggest gathering together a few
friends to enjoy it.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Plouf Makes a Menu of the Bay Area's
Favorite  Seafood   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If I had to pick the No. 1 seafood dish in the Bay
Area, it would be mussels. It doesn't matter whether the cuisine is
Chinese, Thai, Italian or French, you'll find them on just about
every menu.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best and most unusual preparations is Scott Barton's
version with curry sauce served at Plouf, a charming downtown
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Several things set this recipe apart _ adding curry powder and
balancing it with apple and celery; smoothing the sauce with creme
fraiche (or cream) and coconut milk; and adding a splash of
Champagne vinegar infused with chiles for a hearty kick.
</P>
<P>
   This all adds up to a marvelous dish that's easy to prepare at
home _ especially if you think ahead to make the chile-infused
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Plouf, a French-inspired seafood restaurant, has a way with
mussels. No other restaurant in the Bay Area has a bigger selection
_ eight different preparations on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away on Belden Place _ a block-long alley in the
Financial District _ Plouf feels like a find. The fireplace in the
corner is great on cool evenings, and a wall of windows in front
can be thrown open in warm weather to bring the outside in. With
all the tables out front the area has become a popular after-work
hangout.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Plouf, 40 Belden Way (near Bush Street), San Francisco; (415) &LR; 
 &LR; 986-6491. Lunch weekdays; dinner Monday-Saturday. &LR;

SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; The sauce. &LR;  Creme fraiche, yogurt and coconut milk, paired
with a fiery chile vinegar and curry powder, work wonders on the
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; The apples. &LR;  Crisp Granny Smiths offer a clean textural and
flavor contrast to the other ingredients.

 `WELCOME BACK, MR. McDONALD': GIDDY FARCE POKES FUN AT JAPANESE(EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedy is certainly not the first thing that comes to mind when
we think of Japanese cinema. But a few more films like Koki
Mitani's hilarious screwball farce ``Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald''
could change all that.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is ostensibly a goofy comedy about a live radio drama
that goes haywire after the imperious diva playing the lead insists
on certain last-minute changes. Her demands set in motion a
desperate chain of events that transform a sudsy romantic drama set
in a Japanese fishing village into a ludicrous action-adventure
fantasy set in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald'' can be taken as pure, giddy fun
in a farcical tradition that has all but disappeared from American
movie comedy in the age of the salacious gross-out. But it can also
be taken as a good-natured invitation to Japanese culture to
lighten up. Its manic surface only partially conceals its satiric
barbs.
</P>
<P>
   As the broadcast skids out of control, the movie pokes gleeful
fun at the Japanese insistence on order and good manners at all
costs and on the rigidity of corporate politics and pecking orders.
Finally the movie ridicules Japan's envious fascination with the
gaudy detritus of American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this madness is Miyako Suzuki (Kyoka Suzuki), a
meek housewife whose radio play ``The Woman of Destiny'' is being
broadcast nationally after winning a bogus contest sponsored by the
station to provide cheap programming. (Her play was the only
entry.)
</P>
<P>
   After a rehearsal in which all goes smoothly, word comes down
that the lead actress, Nokko Senbon (Keiko Toda), who has
connections with the station's bigwigs, would like her character's
name changed from Ritsuko to Mary Jane and her nationality from
Japanese to American.
</P>
<P>
   After the nervous producer, Ushijima (Masahiko Nishimura),
reluctantly agrees, Nokko demands that Mary Jane be a high-powered
New York City trial lawyer. It isn't long before her competitive
male co-star begins making his own demands for script changes.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, wants an American name and occupation. Inspired by the
logo on a bag of takeout food, he chooses Donald McDonald and
insists his character be a pilot. For silly reasons too complicated
to go into, the setting is eventually moved to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything, the station's sound effects library is
locked, and no one can find the key. In desperation the producers
call on an elderly guard who used to improvise acoustic sound
effects on old-time radio to help them out. Some of the most
uproarious scenes show radio technicians desperately executing
ideas that use everything from a flushing toilet (for a dam
bursting) to a vacuum cleaner (a rocket launching).
</P>
<P>
   Once the show goes on the air, station breaks and commercials
are juggled while sound effects are readied and the script written.
Periodically the movie cuts away to show a Japanese trucker (Ken
Watanabe) who has tuned into the program on the road and becomes
mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all, who should show up in the studio but
Miyako's anxious husband (Yoshimasa Kondo), a car salesman who
assumes his wife's play is autobiographical and becomes extremely
agitated on discovering that it involves a romantic triangle.
</P>
<P>
   As Miyako, desperate to calm his fears, watches her tear-jerker
being re-made into an action-adventure yarn in which the hero is
lost in space, her ultimate concern is that the story have a happy
ending. When that ending doesn't seem forthcoming, she locks
herself in the studio in protest until a solution is devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald'' may be a one-joke movie, but the
inventive ways in which that joke is extended and embellished
insure there is never a stale moment. The fast-paced comic timing
and sharp ensemble performances that give even the minor characters
defined personalities make for a delirious comic portrait of human
vanity and ingenuity in the wonderful world of entertainment.
</P>

`LATER TODAY': SLICE OF `MARTHA,' DOLLOP OF `VIEW' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; see local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For weeks viewers have been bombarded with promos for
NBC's new morning show ``Later Today'' (at 9, right after
``Today''), which came with a tag line either brilliant in its
simplicity or boneheaded beyond belief: ``It's like `Today,' only
later.'' When the program had its premiere Tuesday, it turned out
that the line was simply fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The three hosts, Jodi Applegate (familiar as a regular ``Today''
sub), Florence Henderson (inescapably Mrs. Brady) and Asha Blake
(the unknown) began by chatting in a kitchen. From that moment on,
it was clear that this would be less a franchise of ``Today'' than
a cross between ``The View'' and ``Martha Stewart''; this is not a
program trolling for male viewers. And in its debut ``Later Today''
was smooth, unoriginal, unexciting.
</P>
<P>
   Naming Ms. Henderson as a host was the most attention-getting
move, but Ms. Applegate is the program's likely strength. She is
engaging, witty, at times irreverent, and resists the sycophantic
manner that turns so many daytime shows into sugar-coated donuts.
She handled its most ``Today''-like segment, introducing a news
report about scientific developments that allow parents to choose a
baby's sex, and interviewing experts on different sides of the
issue. She displayed a lighter side in a taped segment about the
Senior Olympics, tossing a javelin and competing in a long-jump
contest against a white-haired granny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't beaten by a great-grandmother, I was beaten by a
grandmother,'' she said. ``That's not so bad, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henderson's history with ``Today'' had been mentioned at
every opportunity leading up to the premiere, and again during the
opening chat. Briefly, 40 years ago, she was what was then called a
```Today' girl,'' and everyone has made progress since then. No one
has to call Katie Couric `` `Today' girl,'' and Ms. Henderson has
become a polished talk-show personality.
</P>
<P>
   She threatens to be altogether too perky, though. Rosie
O'Donnell, sometimes called the Queen of Nice but truly the Queen
of Plugs, dropped by to say a quick hello, bearing a Cuisinart
cappuccino maker. (Her motto seems to be: Never let an opportunity
to display a brand name go to waste.) After she dashed off to do
the season opener of her own show, Ms. Henderson gushed: ``She is
so neat. How many people would do that on their first day back?'' A
star stopping by to promote her own show? Who ever heard of such
generosity?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henderson also handled a cooking segment, though everyone's
attention was deflected from the ham-and-mushroom fettuccine by the
appearance of Ann Davis, Alice on ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blake (formerly a reporter for ABC and for the NBC-owned
station in Los Angeles) was saddled with a segment so vapid it made
fettuccine look like breaking news. She talked to an editor from In
Style magazine about Kevin Costner's bedroom furniture, with
near-facsimiles in the studio. The real Costner bed, the audience
learned, is one of a kind, carved from ebony. He was not there, but
there was a framed photo of him on the duplicate bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The View'' would have had him in person. Martha Stewart would
have demonstrated how she carved the bedposts out of trees she had
grown herself. ``Later Today'' needs a style of its own.

FREEZING AND DEFROSTING  
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON   By Lesli Neilson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Here are some helpful tips on freezing and defrosting products that
are conducive to freezing. &HT;    _Use airtight rigid containers, plastic freezer bags or freezer
wraps, such as heavy-duty foil or freezer paper to freeze foods.
Remember to ``burp'' all lids and tightly seal, removing all air
from bags.
 &HT;    _The colder the food is to start, the faster it will freeze and
the better it will maintain its original quality.
 &HT;    _Follow the ``first in, first out'' policy. Use a permanent
marker to write the date on the food when you freeze it. Place the
new food under food already in the freezer and use the older foods
first.
 &HT;      
 FREEZING PREPARED FOODS &HT;      
 Lasagna, casseroles, soups and stews can be easily frozen and
stored for several weeks to months in airtight containers. Remove
the food from the oven or stove and allow it to cool completely. &HT;     Casseroles:  If the food is in a casserole dish or if the
amount is small, allow it to cool at room temperature for 30 to 45
minutes before freezing. Otherwise, cool the food in the
refrigerator.
 &HT;     Soups and Stews:  Ideally, freeze soup bases (the soup before
the addition of all the liquid) rather than finished soups. Chill
the soup base or finished soup in small portions, in airtight
containers for up to six months.
 &HT;    _Finished cream soups, chowders or bisques cannot be frozen, but
the bases of these soups, before milk or cream is added, can be
frozen. Add milk or cream when reheating the soup. (Reheat gently
over low heat to avoid curdling.)
 &HT;    _Soups with a potato base often become grainy after defrosting.
For best results, make the soup base and add the potato puree when
reheating the soup.
 &HT;    _Soups with beans, such as pinto or navy, freeze well for three
to six months.
 &HT;    _For best results, freeze the meat and vegetables from stews
separately in airtight containers. Combine them when reheating,
adding liquid as needed.
 &HT;    _Cool soups and stews quickly by transferring them to tall-sided
containers and placing the containers into an ice bath in the sink.
 &HT;    _Once cooked foods are cool, transfer soups and stews to a rigid
airtight container and freeze; place plastic/ freezer wrap onto
casserole or lasagna, followed by heavy-duty foil. (This prevents
foil from sticking to food when it's defrosted.
 &HT;     Rice and Potatoes: 
 &HT;    _Leftover rice freezes well in an airtight container for up to
one year. Frozen rice may be reheated without defrosting.
 &HT;    _Baked potatoes freeze well. Once cool, wrap tightly in plastic
wrap and heavy-duty foil. Fried potatoes and potato gratins may be
frozen for up to three months.
 &HT;      
 DEFROSTING PREPARED FOODS &HT;      
 Allow one to three days to completely defrost frozen foods in the
refrigerator. &HT;    _To refresh defrosted prepared foods, add fresh herbs, grated
cheese or breadcrumbs to a dish before reheating it.
 &HT;      
 FREEZING UNPREPARED FOODS &HT;      
 Unprepared foods that may be frozen include: &HT;     Poultry:  Remove chicken from its market wrapping. Rinse the
bird and dry it well. Truss the chicken, if desired. Double-wrap
the bird with plastic wrap, then heavy-duty foil or freezer bag.
Freeze for three to six months.
 &HT;     Meat:  Remove meat from its market wrapping. Pat dry with a
paper towel. Wrap meat in airtight freezer wrap and/or freezer bags
in recipe-size portions to allow for even-freezing. Wrap each piece
individually to prevent pieces from sticking to one another.
 &HT;     Seafood:  Whole, cleaned and dressed fish may be frozen in a
freezer bag with enough water to completely surround the fish.
Carefully remove all the air from the bag, seal tightly and freeze.
Shellfish should be placed in an airtight freezer bag before
freezing.
 &HT;     Fruits and Vegetables:  Most fruit turns mushy in the freezer
except for blueberries, raspberries and cranberries, which freeze
well. Spread berries in one layer on a baking sheet and freeze for
15 to 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight freezer bag and return to
the freezer.
 &HT;    Vegetables should be perfectly ripe for optimum freezing. Blanch
vegetables prior to freezing to set their color and retain their
texture.
 &HT;    There are two methods for blanching vegetables:
 &HT;    _ Steam blanching:  Trim the vegetables, removing any excess
leaves or unwanted pieces. Use a bamboo steamer over a pot of
boiling water or a steaming basket and pot. Blanch vegetables and
plunge immediately into an ice bath. Once cool, remove vegetables
and spread onto paper towels to dry.
 &HT;    _ Water blanching:  Prepare the vegetables as described above.
Boil a gallon of unsalted water for every pound of vegetables.
Immerse the vegetables in the water using a mesh basket or
blanching basket. Plunge vegetables into an ice bath to cool.
Remove vegetables and spread onto paper towels to dry.
 &HT;    Portion the vegetables into airtight plastic freezer bags,
remove all air and freeze.
 &HT;     Dairy:  Semifirm to firm cheeses generally freeze well
(cheddar, Swiss, provolone, mozzarella, Parmesan). Cut the cheese
into small portions and wrap it very tightly before placing it in
the freezer.
 &HT;    _Unsalted butter may be frozen for nine to 12 months; margarine
for five months.
 &HT;    _Milk, cream and eggs do not freeze well.
 &HT;     Fresh herbs:  There is some debate as to whether herbs should
be blanched before freezing. If blanching, use hearty herbs that
are still on the stalk for best results.
 &HT;    Wash delicate herbs such as basil, dill, chives and tarragon.
Pat them dry on paper towels and freeze in small portions in
airtight freezer bags.
 &HT;    Frozen herbs will darken and become limp when thawed, so add
them directly to food you are cooking.
 &HT;      
 DEFROSTING UNPREPARED FOODS &HT;      
 Thaw all unprepared foods in the refrigerator. If necessary, run
frozen food under cold water or use a microwave oven. &HT;     Cold water:  Keep the frozen food wrapped and place it either
in the sink or in a deep container. Allow cold water to run over
the product until thawed. Defrosting time will vary.
 &HT;     Microwave oven:  Do not defrost any foil-wrapped food in the
microwave. For foods wrapped in plastic wrap, follow microwave
manufacturer's instructions for defrosting.
 &HT;      
  
 PANTRY ESSENTIALS  
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Every good cook has one or two pantry essentials _ those magic
items that can be used in a pinch to make a meal. Think canned
chicken stock, tuna or Italian white beans.
<P>
   The Chronicle Food staff asked Bay Area chefs and cookbook
authors to share what's most important in their larders. We also
opened the question to readers, who sent in an array of suggestions
_ some that echo the chefs' ideas and some the professionals hadn't
thought of.

 &UR; _Dried Asian glass noodles.  &LR; With just a quick dip in hot water,
the noodles can become the base for a hot or cold supper. Stir in a
little chicken stock, soy sauce, green onion and a handful of bok
choy or other stir-fried vegetables for a hot, quick meal. Or chill
them and toss with soy sauce and sesame oil, chopped vegetables and
slivered chicken to make a cold salad. &LR;  _ Kirk &LR;   &LR; Webber,
chef/owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _Miso. &LR;  In addition to making a quick soup, miso enlivens sauces
and adds flavor to meat, fish and vegetables. Coat fish with miso
and broil or grill, finishing with butter and lemon, breadcrumbs
and/or some fresh basil. Yellow miso is less yeasty than the red
variety, but both are handy to have on hand. &LR;  _ Alison Richman, &LR; 
 &LR; chef, XYZ, San Francisco. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _Eggs, canned Ortega green chiles, cheddar cheese, salsa and corn &LR; 
 &UR; tortillas. &LR;  South-of-the-border scrambled eggs, quesadillas or a
baked Mexican dish can be made with these five ingredients. Store
the tortillas in the freezer for added shelf life. Also, it's nice
to have frozen shrimp, a can of coconut milk and some curry paste
on hand for quick Southeast Asian dishes.  &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; Rosalie &LR;   &LR; Wright,
editor-in-chief, Sunset magazine, Menlo Park. &LR;

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _Frozen stuffed pasta and a jar of tomato sauce. &LR;  With a little
butter and garlic and a snip of fresh herbs, a package of
good-quality frozen ravioli can be the basis for a simple, elegant
supper. A jar of pasta sauce _ the plainer the better to allow for
a cook's imagination _ is another good topping for ravioli or dried
pasta.  &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; Dan Bowe, associate culinary &LR;   &LR; director, Center for

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _Hard-cooked eggs. &LR;  Cook about a half-dozen at a time and store in
the refrigerator. They make a quick, protein-rich snack. Spread
with a little mayonnaise, a grind of black pepper and a dash of
salt and they can  &LR; become part of a light meal. Also, they can be
sliced into a number of dishes. Other items include orzo, because
it cooks so quickly, and lentils. Cook lentils and top with good
salsa for a fast vegetarian meal. And always have ice cream on hand
for a quick dessert. &LR;  _ Marion Cunningham, &LR;   &LR; cookbook author and

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _Quinoa, sesame seeds, good quality canned tuna (preferably tuna &LR; 
 &UR; belly in olive oil) and nama shoyu &LR; . The quinoa cooks quickly and
sesame seeds, toasted with the quinoa before broth is added, lends
a nutty quality. Mix nama shoyu, considered the balsamic vinegar of
soy sauces, with water and put in a spray bottle to use sparingly
for flavor. For a vegan meal, spray the soy mixture over each layer
of sliced root vegetables set in a steamer.  &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; Mary Etta Moose,

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _Canned chili con carne and corn.  &LR; With a little creative
doctoring, a can of chili can become a centerpiece for a hearty
supper. Brown a pound or so of ground beef, drain it and add it to
the chili with a can of corn, a teaspoon of toasted, ground cumin
seeds, a tablespoon or more of good-quality ground chile and salt
and pepper. Simmer the mixture at least 10 minutes to blend the
flavors. Add up to a can of water if the chili seems too thick. _

FAST 5 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ORECCHIETTE PASTA WITH BROCCOLI
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds trimmed broccoli flowers
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 pound orecchiette pasta (see note)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil + olive oil to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Grated pecorino cheese or toasted pine nuts (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place a large stock pot of liberally salted water over high
heat. Make sure there is plenty of water, since the pasta and
broccoli will cook together.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the broccoli flowers into tiny florettes slightly larger
than the pasta, about 1-inch pieces. Put the garlic through a
garlic press.
</P>
<P>
   When the water boils, add the pasta and cook on high heat for 1
minute, stirring constantly to keep the pasta from sticking. Add
the broccoli and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and
continue cooking, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente and
the broccoli is very soft. Remove and reserve 1 cup of the cooking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the pasta and broccoli, shaking the colander vigorously to
release any trapped water.
</P>
<P>
   While the pasta is cooking, heat the 4 tablespoons olive oil
over medium-low heat in a large saute pan. Add the red pepper
flakes and the garlic, saute over low heat until the garlic just
begins to release its aroma, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from
the heat before the garlic begins to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pasta and broccoli to the stockpot. Add the
garlic-olive oil mixture and the reserved pasta water. Stir over
low heat for 1 minute to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the pasta with a drizzle of olive oil. Garnish with the
optional cheese or pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Orecchiette pasta, which literally means ``little ears''
because of its cupped shape, is becoming much more widely available
in grocery stores. Its chewy texture contrasts well with the
softness of the broccoli, and the cups pick up the sauce perfectly.
If you can't find orecchiette, substitute fusilli.

</P>
<P>
   1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion, sliced paper thin
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the vinegar, lemon juice, yogurt, cilantro, salt,
pepper and cayenne. Set aside at room temperature while you
construct the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off and discard the 2 inches of dark bitter green at the
leafy end of the romaine lettuce. Slice the remaining inner leaves
into 2-inch pieces. Discard the stem ends, and wash and pat dry the
leaves. Place them in a large bowl with the other salad
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the olive oil into the vinegar mixture and adjust the
seasoning, making sure you have a good balance of acidity and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the salad in the dressing and serve it with hearty Italian
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Smoked trout is available at Whole Foods, Real Food,

<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 ears fresh corn, husked
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   3 jumbo russet potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   6 slices bacon, cut in small dice (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, cut in small dice
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 canned chipotle chiles, removed from their sauce, seeded and
finely diced (about 2 teaspoons total) (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, seeded and cut into small dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Roast the corn either on a grill, in a heavy cast-iron pan over
low heat or directly over a gas burner, turning until all the
kernels take on a smoky hue. Cut the kernels from the cobs,
reserving 2 of the cobs.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the bell peppers on the grill or under the broiler,
turning as the skin blackens on each side. Place the roasted
peppers in a plastic bag; seal and allow them to steam while you
prepare the other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Cut 2 of the of the potatoes into small dice; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Quarter the remaining potato and cover it with water in a small
saucepan. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Mash this potato
coarsely with a fork and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Fry the optional bacon in a large heavy stock pot until almost
crunchy, about 5 minutes. Drain off most of the bacon grease. Melt
the butter in the pan, add the onion and saute until translucent, 7
to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and saute a few more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Deglaze the pan with the broth. Add the reserved corn cobs,
diced potatoes, mashed potato, chipotle peppers and tomatoes. Bring
to a boil, and season with salt and pepper. Reduce to a simmer and
cook until the potato pieces are cooked through, about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the soup is cooking, remove the loosened skin from the
peppers. Discard the seeds and membrane and cut the flesh into
small dice.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the cobs from the soup and add the corn kernels, roasted
red pepper and cream. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Adjust for seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with warm tortillas or cornbread and a green salad.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; You usually can find canned chipotle chiles in the
Hispanic food isle in supermarkets. Remove the peppers from their
sauce and slice them in half. Scrape off the seeds and mince into a
pulp. Any remaining peppers, when kept in sauce and tightly
wrapped, will keep well in the refrigerator for a few weeks.

 THE WORKING COOK: A new game plan for cooks who want fresh flavor 
 but don't have time to fuss.   Introduction 
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Surveys continue to show that the Bay Area palate
differs from other parts of the country. We drink fewer carbonated
sodas and eat fewer canned goods than anybody else in the country.
And we love wine, fresh salads, eggs, yogurt and bottled water.
 &HT;    We also dine out more than anybody else, and we don't mind
spending a little extra to get really good food. At home and in
restaurants, fresh is our mantra.
 &HT;    However, when it comes to time constraints, we're like everyone
else. It seems that all the recent inventions _ computers, cellular
phones and faxes that have become a part of our daily lives _ only
load more burdens onto our day. And let's not even talk about the
commute to and from the office.
 &HT;    So what's a food lover to do?
 &HT;    The Chronicle's Food staff has come up with a new game plan for
getting delicious meals on the table in a hurry. The result is The
Working Cook, which debuts today. This new weekly column by staff
writer Tara Duggan offers a three-prong approach to everyday
cooking. If you use all of Tara's suggestions, a family of four can
have meals on the table five nights a week.
 &HT;    The first recipe, called Now &AMP; Later, is designed to be cooked
on the weekend; this is a big recipe _ enough to serve 12. It can
function as dinner on the night it's prepared, with enough stored
in the freezer for two future meals.
 &HT;    The 30-Minute recipe is just that _ preparation of the recipe
takes a half-hour or less. Even at that speed, with Tara's creative
twists and turns it is often special enough for a dinner party.
 &HT;    The last recipe _ called Fast 5 _ is even quicker. It has just
five ingredients, not counting salt and pepper, and can be on the
table in 20 minutes or less.
 &HT;    In addition, today's Food Section is also packed with tips,
ideas and suggestions for preparing your kitchen and pantry to
battle the clock. Just because you don't have a lot of time to cook
doesn't mean you have to compromise your taste buds.

 THE WORKING COOK: Game Plan for Cooks in a Time Crunch 
 &HT;

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Whether you're the kind who orchestrates
complicated dinner parties every weekend or who barely cares to
cook, the daily grind of coming home from work and racing the clock
to prepare a quick homemade meal can be daunting.
<P>
   A fresh meal in 30 minutes? What about in 20? And without the
likes of Hamburger Helper?
</P>
<P>
   That's the purpose of this column. Utilizing a handful of fresh
ingredients and a few simple cooking techniques, it is possible to
prepare recipes that are not only fast but delicious.
</P>
<P>
   You can broil chicken breasts in seven minutes, pan-fry salmon
fillets in under five minutes, and stir-fry tofu or steam mussels
in under four. Add to these exciting ingredients like piquant
achiote paste or wheaty Israeli couscous, and suddenly you've got a
great ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   begin trim? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Each week this column will feature three recipes, each from a
different category _ Now &AMP; Later, 30-Minute and Fast 5.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow this column, you will have five easy meals every
week, inspired by a wide range of cuisines. And each column
provides a mix of meat, poultry, seafood and vegetarian options.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's Fast 5 recipe, Orecchiette Pasta with Broccoli,
the broccoli is cut up fine and cooked at the same as the pasta.
The broccoli becomes the main ingredient in the sauce when sauteed
with the three remaining ingredients _ olive oil, garlic and red
chile flakes. The pasta, named ``little ears'' because of its
cupped shape, adheres to the sauce perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe derives from Orecchiette con Cima di Rapa, a
specialty of Puglia, a region in Italy. The traditional version
features broccoli rabe (also called rapini), a bitter, delicately
flowered cousin of broccoli. Although broccoli rabe has a
wonderfully pungent bite, you can also use regular broccoli in this
southern Italian comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's 30-Minute recipe, canned chickpeas elevate smoked
trout salad to a satisfying main course. The smoky,
melt-in-your-mouth trout is offset by complex flavors and textures
_ briny olives, crisp romaine, sweet red onions, nutty chickpeas
and a citrusy cilantro dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Corn-Chipotle Chowder, the Now &AMP; Later recipe, also
makes a hearty one-course meal. Roasted bell peppers and a touch of
fiery chipotle chiles combine for an earthy backdrop to the sweet
corn. Served with warm tortillas and a fresh green salad, it will
remind you of summer when you defrost it and serve it in the autumn
weeks ahead.

`LOVE IN A DEAD LANGUAGE': LALITA, POST-MODERN OBJECT OF DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: India, Ill.) (Eds.: Publication notes appear at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Erudite murder mysteries used to be the province of Jorge Luis
Borges, who would invent some scholarly master of arcane lore and
entangle his fate with the study of obscure manuscripts,
palimpsests, secret codices, Cabalist mysteries, Sufi labyrinths
and other hidden meanings. Now along comes Lee Siegel, who mixes a
bit of Borges with some Nabokov and then adds an erotic gloss from
the Kama Sutra to write ``Love in a Dead Language,'' a witty,
bawdy, language-rich farce of academic life.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, who is a professor of Indian religions at the University
of Hawaii, is especially and purposefully Nabokovian in his choice
of a main theme. His story centers on an adulterous affair between
a professor of Indian studies named Leopold Roth and an initially
reluctant student of his, a beautiful American-born Indian woman
named, not Lolita but Lalita, Lalita Gupta.
</P>
<P>
   But from that beginning Siegel flies off on his inventive own.
His Prof. Roth, a married man haunted by the death of his only
daughter, is doing a new translation of the Kama Sutra, the famous
Indian manual of sexual knowledge, and his pursuit of Lalita is a
kind of realization in practice of Kama Sutrian erotic wisdom. But
we also know from the beginning of Siegel's book that shortly after
the affair, Roth is found dead in his office, having been struck in
the face, either accidentally or not, by his copy of the massive
Monier Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   After Roth's death, an Indian-Jewish graduate student of his
named Anang Saighal is assigned the task of editing the professor's
unfinished annotated translation of the Kama Sutra. The first thing
he discovers is that most of Roth's annotation consists of the
story of his sexual obsession with Lalita.
</P>
<P>
   Saighal himself is the narrator of Siegel's novel, and he turns
out to be a sardonic and scholarly figure, a man who is faithful to
his deceased mentor but has a mind of his own. So, speaking of
palimpsests, ``Love in a Dead Language'' is Saighal's story about
Roth's work and murder, which is written over Roth's illicit love
affair, which is itself inextricably blended with his erotic
attraction to India and the notion that all knowledge is a kind of
seduction, an erotic attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call this post-modern, this hall of fractured mirrors
that reflect Siegel's themes back on one another. Whether it is
post-modern or not, ``Love in a Dead Language'' is pulled off with
such unhinged elan by Siegel that it is also plain good fun, a
clever, literate satire in which almost everything is both
travestied and, strangely, loved by its author.
</P>
<P>
   There are farcical riffs on the mating habits of snails,
extracts from the brilliantly scurrilous confessions of a
19th-century member of the Bengal Lancers and portions of the
correspondence of Richard Burton, the storied English explorer who
first translated the Kama Sutra into English.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel concocts comedic articles on sexual harassment from the
student newspaper. He invents marvelously learned and poetic
disquisitions on Indian sexual lore. He even fabricates an index
and a six-page multilingual ``bibliography'' _ a list of books
supposedly used by Saighal in his work on Roth _ that so cunningly
apes a real academic bibliography that you have to study it for a
while to be sure it is a parody.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel brings along for the trip a bright collection of cleverly
wrought caricatures. These include a professor of Indian religions
at the University of Hawaii named Lee Siegel, an academic rival
heartily disliked by Roth. Siegel _ the author, not the character _
floats the whole contraption on a literary raft loaded with
wordplay and verbal pyrotechnics that often stay just on the
civilized side of excess.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an extract from what Roth (in his Kama Sutra commentary)
calls ``the raucous roar and grumbling anthem of Delhi'':
``Pandemonial moans and hapless laughter, scolding and beseeching,
hawking and hounding, and the hectic honking of horns, discordant
metallic clitter-clatter and terrible tintinnabulation The infernal
blast agitated the perfumes of the road (spice and sandal, gasoline
and feces, ganja and dust, garlands and tropical sickness).''
</P>
<P>
   Or here is a wry little commentary on Siegel's main theme: ``We
cannot comprehend the meaning (either the intent or significance)
of our word for love, that morphemic wafer on a quivering tongue,
that small, dark, vermicular, spermatic squiggle from the tip of a
pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's penchant for the ludicrous is so strong that the
underlying and actually more serious themes of ``Love in a Dead
Language'' are almost hidden by his scholarly games and verbal
tumescence. But within this ludic tale there lurks a tragedy of
love and loss that does not lose its tenderness even when embedded
in Siegel's perpetually farcical frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, the aging scholar, is a man whose thirsts simply cannot be
quenched. ``Sometimes I worry about you,'' his wife Sophia tells
him. ``You just seem to need so much.''
</P>
<P>
   His needs are embodied in his fascination with India, a
fascination that he admits ``has allowed me some success at
socially legitimating my essential deviance.'' His fascination with
India is in turn embodied in his infatuation with Lalita, even
though anybody except Roth can see that Lalita is just an ordinary
teen-age girl, bright, rebellious, mercurial and impressionable.
</P>
<P>
   Like another famous literary visitor to India, Mrs. Moore in ``A
Passage to India,'' Roth sees the smallness and the horror of it
all, including his own smallness and horror, but he also sees the
poetry of his obsession and of India: ``I want the silence within
the mausoleum to be perfect, a melodious silence that enchants the
heart, a celestial silence that drowns out all earthly rumblings, a
peaceful silence that is different than any other silence anywhere
in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's narrator Saighal attributes those words to Shah Jahan,
the builder of the Taj Mahal. That Siegel is able to bring them to
bear in ``Love in a Dead Language'' is a strong indication that
there is more to this raucous love story than mere satire.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A raw octopus resting on ice at the seafood store is
definitely the ugliest thing in the vicinity _ nothing like the
many-hued snappers or even the white, pristine cleaned squid. No,
this floppy, gray, suction-cupped monster seems to have been born
with a natural defense aimed directly at the home cook. It seems to
growl, ``I am too hideous to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, once the octopus is cooked, it is beautiful _ tender
and mild, with just a touch of pleasant resistance, like lobster.
Lately, as its qualities are increasingly appreciated, it has
assumed a starring role at many restaurants in unexpected dishes.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been a standard at sushi bars, of course, and
available at Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and even some Italian
restaurants for years, in salads or stews or with potatoes or
pasta. But now adventurous chefs are bringing their talents into
the arena, too, with dishes like octopus terrine, octopus confit,
octopus risotto and more. Then there's grilled octopus, which,
since it was first popularized at Periyali about 10 years ago, has
become ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us (at least, those of us who do not come from
culinary traditions familiar with octopus) may well think it's high
time we got adventurous, too, and started cooking octopus at home,
having some fun with it. And in fact, all of those restaurant
dishes can be readily accomplished by the home cook.
</P>
<P>
   The main stumbling block, hideous looks aside, is that octopus
has a reputation for being so tough that extraordinary measures
must be taken to tenderize it. There's no explaining why a Greek
cook may beat it against some rocks or, less primitively, against
the kitchen sink; a Spanish cook will dip it in boiling water three
times and then cook it in a copper pot (only copper will do); an
Italian might cook it with two corks, or a Japanese might rub it
all over with salt, or knead it with grated daikon, and then slice
the meat at different angles, with varying strokes.
</P>
<P>
   These methods may work _ and so does slow cooking in water.
Which is a lot less fussy.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few cases, quick cooking is the answer. Octopus is much
like squid: if you keep the cooking time minimal, less than five
minutes or so, you get a chewy, pleasant texture; this is a good
technique for octopus salad or sushi.
</P>
<P>
   For most preparations, though, long, slow cooking just to the
point of tenderness, before the flesh becomes too dry, is perfect.
You put the octopus in water to cover and simmer until it is
tender. This usually takes about an hour for an octopus of about 4
pounds, but may be considerably less for smaller specimens and
sometimes twice as long for larger, tougher ones. A potentially
exasperating characteristic is that even octopuses of the same
weight may require considerably different cooking times, depending
on how tender the specimen. But judging when it is done simply by
how tender it is is easy: when the thickest part of the octopus
(the skirt, where the head meets the legs) yields to the sharp
point of a small knife with little resistance, it is done. ``It's
like a potato,'' said Rick Moonen, the chef at Oceana in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   The instant the octopus hits the hot water, it appears to shrink
by about half. It continues to tighten and shrink as it cooks,
which is why you need to start with about 3 pounds of raw octopus
for four people. The simmering need not be in water. Alessandro
Giuntoli, the chef at Osteria del Circo, also in midtown, braises
the octopus in red wine and vegetables, giving it deep, rich flavor
and a dark purple color. Even more unusual is the preparation
suggested by Tadashi Ono, the chef of Sono, opening later this
month on East 57th Street. Ono simmers the octopus, but in olive
oil _ a kind of octopus confit.
</P>
<P>
   Once tenderized by simmering, the octopus can be served with
little further preparation. Ono serves his confit dressed with soy
and lime juice. It can be tossed in olive oil and lemon juice, with
or without other seafood and vegetables, to make a salad. It can be
incorporated into a risotto or pasta sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Or of course, it can be grilled briefly after the simmering,
making it both crisp and tender. This ultimately appealing
combination is easily achieved, as long as the fire is hot enough
to crisp the exterior before drying out the interior.
</P>
<P>
   If octopus comes freighted with unnecessary cooking concerns, it
is also surrounded by many other myths and misunderstandings that
may confuse or worry the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Octopus is an ancient denizen of the deep _ its ancestors lived
at least 200 million years ago _ and it has adapted well to warm
and temperate waters all over the world, feeding on crustaceans and
fellow mollusks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a common belief that the best octopus comes from
Portugal. But since water knows no political boundaries, it can
hardly be the whole truth. ``Whether Atlantic octopus is fished by
the Portuguese or anyone else, most of it comes from the waters off
the west coast of Africa,'' said Vincent Cutrone, who owns the
Octopus Garden, a fish store in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, that
specializes in cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish).
</P>
<P>
   But Mediterranean octopus is also commonly eaten, as is octopus
from Asia, especially the Philippines. (There is very little
domestic octopus in stores, probably because the domestic market is
so small; it's an incidental catch and probably thrown overboard as
often as not.)
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of cooking octopus from just about everywhere, I
detected little or no difference in quality. Almost all of this
octopus is cleaned and frozen before shipping, which is not the
disadvantage you might think. For one thing, octopus spoils
quickly, so it's difficult to maintain high quality during
shipping, especially since it's not expensive, about $3 or $4 a
pound, and therefore rarely shipped by air. More important is that
the quality of octopus, like that of squid, does not suffer
noticeably when it is frozen.
</P>
<P>
   In fact there may be benefits to freezing. ``There are times
that frozen octopus actually seems better than fresh,'' said
Ignacio Blanco, the owner of Meigas, a Spanish restaurant that is
to open this month on Hudson Street. ``It doesn't hurt the flavor
at all, and it becomes tender more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Size is another question. Tiny octopuses, less than 6 ounces,
may be difficult to find and tend to be expensive _ upward of $10 a
pound. They're great cooked for a couple of minutes and then served
with little more than olive oil, lemon and salt, but they are
really tidbits, mostly suitable for appetizers. The most common
octopuses we see are in the 2 to 4-pound range. Occasionally,
you'll see medium-size specimens, 12 to 16 ounces. These are useful
and convenient because one of them is a fine single serving.
</P>
<P>
   But size is less of an issue than it may seem. ``I like both big
and small,'' Moonen said. ``All that matters is that you don't
overcook them. Where it comes from, whether it's been frozen or
not, the size, the cooking method _ these are all pretty much
irrelevant as long as you cook it carefully.''

 NEW YORK: it carefully.''

<P>
   Finally, there is the issue of octopus skin, ugly when raw, but
a lovely gelatinous, almost fatty substance once cooked. Some cooks
and chefs rub the skin off. But to me, that's like serving osso
buco without the marrow _ there is a delicious, almost creamy
element missing.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that this gelatin is so powerful that cooked
octopus can be made into a terrine simply by weighting it, as
Blanco does in the variation on his recipe for octopus and
potatoes. But this gelatinous skin dries out and virtually
disappears during grilling and some other preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its other culinary attributes, the octopus is extremely
low in fat _ just one-fifth of a gram of nutritionally undesirable
saturated fat in a 3- to 4-ounce serving, compared to about a third
of a gram in chicken breast of the same size. Total fat is only 1
percent _ another attractive quality to weigh against that initial
hideous impression.

Sprinkle with pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add octopus, along with some pepper and a little more salt.
Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, and then add wine, bay leaf and
garlic. Cook until octopus is tender, for about 1 hour (check with
point of sharp knife). Remove octopus, and cut into bite-size
pieces. Return octopus to skillet, and turn heat to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, bring large pot of water to boil, and salt it.
Fifteen minutes before eating, begin cooking pasta. When it is
barely tender but not nearly tender enough to eat, drain it,
reserving about 1 cup cooking liquid. Add pasta to octopus mixture,
with half the reserved liquid. Cook until pasta is tender but not
mushy; add remaining liquid if needed to keep mixture from drying
out.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add remaining olive oil, along with butter, cherry tomatoes
and basil. Stir until butter melts, and then serve.

   1. Combine octopus, bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, 1 teaspoon
salt, garlic and 1 lemon, cut in half, in saucepan along with water
to cover. Turn heat to medium, cover, and bring to boil. Adjust
heat so that liquid simmers slowly, and cook until octopus is
tender, for 30 to 90 minutes, depending on whether you're using two
smaller octopuses or 1 larger one (check for doneness with point of
sharp knife). Drain, discarding everything but octopus. (You can
prepare this 24 hours in advance up to this point; cover, and
refrigerate octopus.) Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Start charcoal or wood fire, or preheat gas grill; fire
should be quite hot. Grill rack about 4 inches from heat source.
Cut octopus into large serving pieces, brush it with half the olive

`GET REAL': TV THAT SENDS UP TV 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ``Get Real'' makes two obvious assumptions about its viewers:
They have watched lots of television, and they're not afraid to use
their brains a little. If the second of these isn't overly
optimistic, ``Get Real'' could get established.
</P>
<P>
   This family series, which Fox is unveiling Wednesday night,
never stops reminding you that you're watching television, not
life, and that there's nothing real about ``Get Real.'' The
white-bread upper-middle-class family _ overworked and unusually
attractive Mom and Dad, three glib teen-agers and sage, recently
widowed Grandma _ comes right out of a mail-order Make Your Own
Prime-Time Series kit. So when the younger characters start sharing
their innermost thoughts with you, you're not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   But quite early in the game, the show throws you a curve. The
brilliant daughter, the oldest of the children, doesn't merely tell
you what she's thinking. She says, ``I know what you're thinking.''
You're thinking that this is another one of those shows ``where the
kids talk to the audience, like, um, `Dawson's Creek,''' which she
declares she would never watch. Why not? ``There is nothing more
obnoxious than self-aware teens who know more about life's
mysteries than their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, of course, is just what this show is lobbing you. Here
are the high school senior Meghan Green (Anne Hathaway) and her
younger brothers, Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen), the goofy
skateboarder who follows his hormones, and the sensitive Kenny
(Jesse Eisenberg), who's tortured by his. Their stressed-out
parents, Mitch (Jon Tenney) and Mary (Debrah Farentino), can't
figure out where their lives have gone, while Mary's mother,
Elizabeth (Christina Pickles), who does seem to understand where
her life has gone, looks on knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens may be suffering, but the show's creator, Clyde
Phillips, seems to be having a wonderful time. Phillips, who wrote
Wednesday night's pilot, also originated the long-running (but
ordinary) ``Suddenly Susan'' and the short-lived (but wonderfully
quirky) ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose.'' His ideas are sharp, but his
barbs, appropriately, are not lethal. His obvious affection for his
medium gives the show a knowing wink, rather than a frigid leer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the principals, the young actors, especially Eisenberg,
are quietly winning. The grown-ups succeed a little too well in
impersonating generic television characters.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is standard television fare, too: coming-of-age angst
with parental midlife crises for counterpoint. But the writing can
be surprisingly funny. When Kenny's best friend ends a pep talk
with ``Two words, amigo: Carpe diem,'' the confused Kenny asks,
``Fish of the day?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the humor, however, comes from sending up other
television shows, including ``My So-Called Life,'' ``E.R.,''
``Seventh Heaven'' and, by extension, every turgid family saga
since ``Mama.'' When Mitch and Mary pause in their bickering, she
says, ``If this were `Cheers,' we'd be having sex right now.'' And
when Kenny is flattened by a blow from the school bully, his friend
exclaims (what else?): ``Oh, my God! You killed Kenny!''
</P>
<P>
   You have to work a bit to keep up with all that Phillips is
dishing out. While every inch of the show tells you not to take
anything seriously, he is somehow asking you to share the
characters' emotions. And in spite of yourself, you agree.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to get a look at this show soon. Once word leaks
out that there are ideas in play here, who knows what could happen?
</P>

 &HT;    Report on Olympic bid left out some details _ like 50 buses
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Billy Payne first outlined the Atlanta Olympic
bid committee's excesses for Congress, he conceded, among other
things, that it ``facilitated'' the donation of a used MARTA bus to
Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
   It was a generous gift presented with much fanfare by Mayor
Maynard Jackson and gratefully acknowledged by International
Olympic Committee member Ivan Dibos, a Lima councilman who would be
voting in a few months for the host city of the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the gift went over so well that on the eve of the vote
in Tokyo on Sept. 18, 1990, a far more generous offer to Dibos was
planned. How would he like 50 buses for his hometown?
</P>
<P>
   That offer was not mentioned in the Atlanta team's original June
1 report to the U.S. House Commerce Committee, which is looking
into the Olympic bid process. But it is documented in the materials
that fill three dozen boxes being pored over by federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered more unreported expensive gifts and favors for
IOC members and their families. Some offers of college assistance,
jobs and excursions to the city _ with side visits to Disney World
and Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club _ were not cited in the
original report to Congress. Nor were some gifts of clothing,
jewelry and art objects.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Atlanta Olympic team's lawyers at King &AMP;
Spalding are immersed in the uncomfortable task of rewriting the
report, which they say will be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Echols, a spokesman for Olympic officials and their legal
team, said they would not comment on specifics until the updated
report is submitted. He described the initial report as ``our first
attempt at responding to the committee's concerns. And we did the
best job we could. Now, given more time for a complete review, we
believe that our supplemental report will do the job thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding allowed The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to
review 29 of the 36 boxes last week at its offices in Washington,
D.C. The material made it clear why congressional investigators had
many more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and his aides were meticulous record-keepers who discarded
little, if anything. The files contain thousands of letters, memos,
invoices and canceled checks. They trace a difficult-to-follow
trail of Payne's successful strategy that won the hearts and votes
of the 86 IOC members from around the world who had the singular
responsibility of anointing one lucky city in the quest for the
1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's plan included lavishing first-class travel and
entertainment and personal gifts on the delegates and their
families in an exuberant display of Southern hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials admitted in their initial report that 38 gifts
exceeded a $200 IOC limit. The presents ranged from a collection of
surgical instruments costing $318 for the member from Cameroon to
an $875 English bulldog for the member from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more, according to the new documents. A $265
camera was purchased for an Algerian, a $222 Chanel scarf for one
of the two wives of the Swaziland voter. Those gifts and others,
accumulated during shopping sprees in Atlanta by bid team hosts and
hostesses, were omitted from the original report.
</P>
<P>
   And when the bulldog, named ``Billy'' by the Cuban, died the
following spring, Payne offered a replacement. No document could be
found to indicate whether ``Billy II'' was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Documents show that the Atlanta group circumvented the $200
limit in many instances by taking wives to several mall stores and
buying them numerous gifts, each within the allowable range.
</P>
<P>
   No gift proposal approached the scale of the 50 MARTA buses
offered to Dibos, which was documented by three letters in the
boxes that outlined the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In one, from Dibos to then-MARTA general manager Ken Gregor and
dated Oct. 12, 1990, the Peruvian thanked Gregor for his ``kind
letter'' and expressed hope that ``the city of Lima still has the
chance to acquire the 50 buses available offered ...''
</P>
<P>
   Dibos sent Payne a letter three days later and included a copy
of his correspondence with Gregor. Dibos congratulated Payne for
winning the Olympic vote and said he is ``proud that our friendship
was a strong one no matter what the outcome in Tokyo had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, he told Payne he was ``accepting generous offer of 50
buses'' and added that ``your assistance in expediting same will be
greatly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   The files provided to the newspaper contained no confirmation of
the delivery of the buses, and MARTA records do not indicate that
such a transfer occurred. Gregor, reached while on vacation in
Hungary, said he did not recall the transaction. Interviewed on a
conference call with Horace Sibley, a bid team attorney, Gregor
said, ``Those letters do not ring any bells to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols acknowledged the offer of buses to Dibos but said he had
no record of their delivery. Echols said he believed the buses were
not a gift but offered for sale, although he did not know a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta Organizing Committee (the bid team) had no
involvement in setting the terms of this potential transaction,''
Echols said. ``We were merely a facilitator.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne, in a letter to then-Lima mayor Ricardo Belmont, dated
Sept. 25, 1990, thanked the mayor for his help and urged him to
``please check with Ivan (Dibos) regarding other bus information
that we delivered to him in Tokyo.'' Ironically, the documents
indicated that the offer of buses failed to reach Dibos before the
vote. Gregor's letter was either misdated or postdated Sept. 25 _
one week after the vote. Dibos did not receive the letter until he
returned to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The letter) has recently been sent to Lima together with
another group of letters not given to me by the (Tokyo) hotel at
such time,'' Dibos wrote to Gregor, apparently concerned that the
offer might no longer stand since the vote had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope the city of Lima still has the chance to acquire the
50 buses available offered and not getting to talk to Morris
Dillard (a MARTA official and later an Atlanta Olympic group
executive) in Tokyo for reasons above could have made you think
different,'' Dibos wrote. He went on to tell Gregor the city needed
5,000 buses, although he noted it was the ``responsibility of the
central government'' to acquire them.
</P>
<P>
   Dibos, an IOC member since 1982 who succeeded his father, denied
knowledge of the transaction when questioned by a
Journal-Constitution reporter last week even though his signature
appears on the correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a letter like that, someone has commited forgery
with my name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The records indicate the Atlanta bid team arrived in Tokyo laden
with expensive gifts, if not buses.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, 21 days before the ballotting, Ginger Watkins spent
$2,694 at Tiffany &AMP; Co., collecting 10 ``rope pins with 18 kt.
accents'' at $185 each, 10 oval compacts at $70 each, a ``frog on
lilly pad'' box for $150, and other baubles.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, Watkins bought a jewelry box for $616 and a travel
clock for $318. The total tab at Tiffany was $3,849. The next day,
she picked up $2,449 worth of six unique sculptures from the Frabel
Gallery in Buckhead. The six gifts, wrapped and presented the day
before the vote in Tokyo, included a $424 soccer sculpture given to
Maurice Herzog of France.
</P>
<P>
   A shopping trip to Neiman-Marcus yielded several pricy Steuben
crystal sculptures, including a $457 crystal skier presented two
days before the vote to Marc Hodler of Switzerland. Hodler is the
IOC member who blew the whistle on the Olympic bribery scandal last
winter, alleging that bid groups routinely offered bribes in
exchange for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-hour bounty appears to have been documented in the
original report. Many more gifts did not exceed the $200 limit and
therefore were not recorded. They included a $172 sports coat and
shirts produced by a South Korean haberdasher for Virgilio de Leon
from Panama. The gift suggestion originated in a memo Payne wrote
in August that listed a number of ideas for last-minute items for
IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   When the memo first emerged from Olympic files this spring,
Payne denied writing it, then insisted he never sent it or acted
upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, de Leon was not in Tokyo for the vote. But the
documents indicate Payne mailed the suit to him in Panama with a
letter that said, ``We would like to send to you that which we had
intended to give to you in Tokyo, custom-made clothing from our
mutual friend Johnny La in Seoul. We remain anxious to receive you
in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne and his team invited IOC members and their families to
Atlanta over and over again. A few never visited; others came
frequently. Agustin Arroyo traveled from Ecuador six times, always
with his wife. Four of the visits were before the vote, and two
were to help celebrate the victory. The Atlanta group's report to
Congress listed only three visits.
</P>
<P>
   A profile contained in his file in the Olympic records
characterized the Arroyos as ``delightful people who love to
travel, be entertained and are most entertaining themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arroyos were flown first-class, lodged at the Marriott
Marquis and feted in the city's finest restaurants or private homes
in Buckhead. The bid team chartered a luxury coach to take them and
others to a Georgia Tech-Georgia football game. They were given
tickets to the musical ``Cats'' at the Fox Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins noted in an August 1990 memo that the Arroyos never
``asked for anything while here. He paid for everything he
purchased.'' Except, apparently, a $474 ruby pin from Macy's bought
while the couple was in town earlier that month, according to the
initial report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But in another memo, Watkins noted that ``Agustin's grandson
wants to come to the Bolletierri Tennis Camp next summer. I found
out through his daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no indication that the youth received a
scholarship to the prestigious Florida tennis camp, the bidders _
at the request of IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga _ spent at least
$14,099 to train two teenagers from the Republic of Congo at the
camp, according to the original report.
</P>
<P>
   The bid team dangled tennis camp scholarships in front of other
IOC members, according to correspondence in the boxes, but there is
no indication of those being accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite previous denials by Payne, there is much evidence of
college assistance. Bid team officials offered their help in
admitting IOC members' relatives and securing scholarships, a
practice of 2002 Winter Games bidders in Salt Lake City that
launched the influence-peddling scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The documents did not indicate Atlanta officials paid for
scholarships, but they apparently used their connections at state
universities _ which benefited handsomely from hosting Olympics
events _ to bypass standard admissions procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Bid team member Bobby Rearden wrote in one memo that he offered
a University of Georgia tennis scholarship to the daughter of
Hungarian IOC member Pal Schmitt. The young woman wound up at a
California university.
</P>
<P>
   The son of IOC member Ram Ruhee was admitted to Georgia Tech
with the Atlanta committee's assistance. He stayed one semester
before returning home to Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   And the favors continued after Atlanta won the Games. The
stepson of Russian member Vitaly Smirnov enrolled at Tech to attend
an English program in 1991, and then, with the help of Watkins,
secured a work permit and a job with the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Payne faxed a letter to Smirnov in July 1991, saying, ``I am
delighted to inform you that our mutual friend reported to work
Wednesday morning and before he received a first pay check is
inquiring about an automobile and drivers license. What do you
think? Should I proceed to help him with this request?''
</P>

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; LAWMAKERS PREPARE FOR BUDGET BATTLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Jonathan Lipman &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   States News Service &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Sept. 7 -- As members of Congress streamed back into
the nation's capital Tuesday after a month-long holiday from the
inexorable math of the federal budget, supporters and critics of
the nation's space agency prepared to do battle over next year's
space programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to debate and vote on the VA-HUD
Appropriations bill on Wednesday. The bill sets the yearly funding
levels for independent federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs
office, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration - NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Because the NASA budget is part of this larger bill, its future
is inextricably linked to those other agencies. Under current House
rules and the 1997 budget resolution, the amount of money in each
appropriations bill cannot increase once it leaves the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it is unlikely that the NASA budget will get
increased in the House bill from its current proposal of $12.7
billion, a nearly $1 billion cut from this year's level and the
president's request for next year. The Senate has not written its
version of the bill yet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the national budget debate has fallen along clearly
partisan lines as the Republican Congress has pushed its tax cut
and spending priorities over President Clinton's proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the partisan lines on the NASA budget have blurred. Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D- N.Y., will introduce an amendment on the floor
to pull another $305 million from the space station budget to go
towards public housing, which he believes is ``severely
under-funded'' in the VA-HUD bill, spokesman Brett Heimov. said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler thinks that the ISS will not really be able to run any
scientific experiments that the Shuttle couldn't run in another
form for much less money, Heimov said. Nadler is a ``space buff''
who decided this based on ``his own personal research,'' Heimov
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes in NASA, he believes in technology development,''
Heimov said. ``He just feels the space station has gotten to the
point where it is not serving its purpose. It would be a waste of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Also crossing party lines is Rep. David Weldon, R-Fla., who in
July was one of the first to declare that he would fight the cuts.
Weldon's 15th district includes Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy
Space Center, the busiest spaceport in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there are changes to the NASA budget, he plans on
voting against the entire bill,'' said Weldon's legislative
director, Stuart Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Weldon is not sure whether he will offer an amendment
to the spending bill, but he plans to speak on the floor during the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon has already spoken to Florida Senators Bob Graham and
Connie Mack about NASA's chances once the Senate takes up the
VA-HUD bill in late September, Burns said. None of the three
Florida lawmakers will sit on the conference committee since none
is on an appropriations committee.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the pro-NASA forces will probably be Rep. Steny Hoyer,
D-Md. The 10- term congressman's fifth district includes NASA's
Goddard center, and Hoyer has always fought hard for the agency.
However, spokeswoman Debra DeShong said that while he will make a
public appeal and a speech on the floor asking for a restoration in
NASA funding, he will not offer an amendment that could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any money to do it with,'' DeShong said, referring
to the spending limits placed on the bill. Instead, Hoyer will make
``a number of comments'' on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His point will be that not only does NASA do research and make
technology breakthroughs in space science, but there are so many
practical things that NASA does that we never even realize,''
DeShong said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer is also working with a number of other Representatives in
Colorado, Texas and California, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The VA-HUD appropriations bill is scheduled for debate in the
House at the start of business tomorrow at 10 a.m. The Senate will
then draft its version of the bill later this month.

WINE TALK: A RENAISSANCE FOR ANCIENT GRAPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along the rugged hills of northern Italy, a grape called arneis
has grown for more than 500 years. These are the same hills that
produce great wines like Barolo and Barbaresco, wines that by the
middle of this century overshadowed the arneis grape and its wine
and nearly caused its extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Arneis, once a well-known white in the Piedmont region, had
declined so far that it was used mostly to lighten and soften
powerful reds like Barolo. At one point, it was planted among the
red wine vines only because it ripened early and drew bees away
from the more important grapes.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s only two producers were making arneis wine, Vietti
and Bruno Giacosa. But thanks mostly to their efforts, the world
began to appreciate this fresh, fruity wine, which the Italians
sometimes called Barolo bianco. It enjoyed explosive growth through
the 1980s and early 1990s and is now one of the country's most
respected white wines.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, but especially in Italy, winemakers are
reaching back to ancient grapes, in some cases varieties that had
all but disappeared. From the banks of the Rhine to the tip of the
Italian boot, from southern France to the distant vineyards of
Chile, winemakers are rediscovering their heritage, and in doing so
are adding color and excitement to the world of wine, counteracting
what they perceive as a steady drift toward conformity and a bland
homogenous style.
</P>
<P>
   Italy claims well over a thousand varieties of grapes, of which
some 400 are in regular use. Many of these trace their roots,
literally and figuratively, to ancient times. The greco vines,
which today produce Greco del Tufo, one of southern Italy's most
famous wines, obviously came from Greece. The precursors of
sangiovese, the principal grape of Chianti, appear to have been
cultivated in Tuscany by the Etruscans.
</P>
<P>
   At San Felice, a large wine estate and research center near
Siena in the Chianti region, some 300 long-forgotten grape
varieties, many of them ancestors of sangiovese, are being nurtured
in a special vineyard. At a seminar there a few years ago, I tasted
wines made from grapes with names like abrusco, colorino, aleante,
morellino and pugnitello, all of them related to sangiovese. One
day, some of them may stand on their own, like arneis; others may
be added to the Chianti blend to give it richness and new vigor.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, the resurgence of interest in these old varieties
is a reaction to the vogue for foreign grapes that had overwhelmed
Italy and particularly Tuscany during the last three decades.
Appalled by the poor quality of so much Chianti in the 1960s,
forward-looking winemakers turned to French varieties to heighten
the quality of their wines.
</P>
<P>
   At first, in wines like Antinori's Tignanello, cabernet
sauvignon was used to enhance sangiovese. Eventually, cabernet
became the dominant wine in these blends, and the so-called
Supertuscans were born.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay, too, took the spotlight away from many traditional
Italian white wines, while merlot, grown in Italy for years, was
recast as a noble French import.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many Tuscan winemakers are returning to native varieties.
They have learned that with proper care in the vineyards and the
cellars, widely planted traditional Italian grapes like sangiovese
can produce wines with all the richness and elegance of Bordeaux
wines. A good example of what can be done with traditional Tuscan
grapes is Badia a Coltibuono's San Gioveto, a rich, powerful wine
made from a sangiovese clone.
</P>
<P>
   Many other traditional varieties are becoming better-known as
the world turns to Italy as perhaps the last bastion of good,
reasonably priced wines.
</P>
<P>
   There is cannonau, for example, Sardinia's version of Spain's
garnacha; the nero d'Avola from Sicily, and the negroamaro, another
grape from Apulia, the heel of the Italian boot, whose history
stretches back to the Greeks and Phoenicians.
</P>
<P>
   Apulia, or Puglia, is also home to the primitivo, a relative, it
is thought, of California's zinfandel. Some wine historians believe
the primitivo came across the Adriatic from Croatia as early as the
15th century and may actually have originated elsewhere in the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Fiano, another old Italian variety, is thought by some experts
to be a descendant of the grapes that made Apianum, a wine popular
in ancient Rome. Mastroberardino, one of southern Italy's
best-known wine producers, makes fiano from grapes grown on
hazelnut plantations near Avellino. Falaghina, another ancient
variety, is the grape used to make a modern version of Falernum,
probably the best known of all the Roman wines.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, on the windswept coast of Galicia, the country's
westernmost province, grows albarino, a grape that seems to thrive
on poor weather. Yet, it makes one of the finest white wines of
Europe. Thirty years ago, it had all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Albarino has been grown in the Rias Baixas region of Galicia at
least since the 15th century. But enologists say it appears to be
of German origin. How did it get to the western tip of Spain in the
Middle Ages? It was most certainly carried by pilgrims coming to
the shrine of Santiago de Compostela.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 500 years, from the 11th century on, some 500,000
pilgrims crossed the Pyrenees each year to come to Compostela.
Benedictines and Cistercians from the great German and French
monasteries almost certainly brought vines with them, including the
ancestor of albarino.
</P>

   The wine's popularity declined over the years, until by 1986,
there were only five producers. Today there are more than 60.
Albarino is a full-bodied, fruity wine, resembling highly perfumed
viogniers from France. Albarino is a bit leaner and livelier _ a
perfect seafood wine.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The French, as might be expected, have been less enthusiastic
about resuscitating old varieties. In fact, they have spent the
last half century pulling out thousands of acres of indifferent
varieties like carignan and aramon in the Midi and replacing them
with cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and merlot. Which is not to say
they have ignored all their oldest grape types.
</P>
<P>
   Viognier, a white wine grape of the northern Rhone Valley, was
once used mostly to lighten up the powerful reds of the Cote Rotie.
A little was sold as Condrieu, the name of the town where it's
made, or as Chateau Grillet, a famous vineyard in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Today, viognier is a popular varietal wine produced in the
United States and Australia as well as France.
</P>
<P>
   Roussanne, another old vine of the Rhone Valley, had practically
disappeared in the 1950s, mostly because it is difficult to grow.
It produces a dry, elegant wine unlike most Rhone varieties, which
tend to the rustic and robust. Once used mostly for blending,
roussanne has staged a slow, steady comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Rolle was once found mostly in the vineyards around Nice, which
suggests an ancient Greek and Roman heritage. When the carignan and
aramon vines were pulled up in the Languedoc and Roussillon, rolle
was one of the grapes that replaced them. Today, this once
virtually obsolete variety can be found in most French
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Carmenere was once an important grape in Bordeaux, where it
found its way into some distinguished wines. The onset of
phylloxera and oidium, the twin vineyard plagues of the 19th
century, proved disastrous, as carmenere was particularly
susceptible. By the time the Bordeaux vineyards returned to health,
carmenere was gone and practically forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the 1970s. With the increased demand throughout
the world for fine wines, Chile began to expand its cabernet
sauvignon and merlot vineyards. French viticulturists and
winemakers, working for Europeans who had invested in Chilean
vineyards, discovered that much of what was thought to be merlot
was actually the long-forgotten carmenere, probably brought in by
early settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is also where Miguel Torres, a Spanish winemaker,
discovered an old carignan vineyard. His first wine from it, called
Cordillera, will be released later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Torres has returned to his vineyard roots with his
newest premium wine, Grans Muralles, a blend of garnacha, tinta,
monastrell, samso and garro, all traditional varieties in the
Penedes region, southwest of Barcelona. Grans Muralles is big,
complex wine, with layers of intriguing flavors. The 1996 vintage
is still developing; it chould age for 15 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, pessimists have been predicting the
inevitable development of bland universal wines: soft, oaky reds
and whites that will taste the same in Cape Town as in Calistoga.
It may happen. But so long as the the search for old varieties goes
on and the respect for authenticity and tradition in grape growing
and winemaking continue, it isn't going to happen for a long time. &QL;

`SAM AND COKIE' TO AIR EARLIER IN NEW YORK; BRYANT GUMBEL'S NEW
PARTNER

   A Wake-Up Call On Sundays
</P>
<P>
   There will be no sleepy, lazy Sundays for New York viewers
accustomed to the late morning start of ``This Week With Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   That 10:30 a.m. ritual, which has endured for nearly two
decades, comes to an end this weekend when ABC's second-place
Sunday morning program will be shown live in the New York area at 9
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The switch in time slots is a reflection of the changing habits
of viewers, who show a penchant for rising earlier, and the
increased competition among the Sunday morning programs like ``This
Week'' and NBC's top-ranked ``Meet the Press,'' which is broadcast
in New York at 10:30 a.m. but taped at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you a lot about life styles,'' said Ms. Roberts.
``We're finding it's just too late to have the show on at 10:30
a.m. on Sunday morning for most people. They're up. They're out. At
church or out with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is experimenting with the new time slot in New York, but it
hopes the early morning start will spread to other affiliates if it
is successful. It also may prevent the frantic morning scurrying of
some guests, who will no longer have time to make appearances on
different programs on the same Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably should have been done sooner rather than
later,'' said Dorrance Smith, the executive producer of the
program, who helped create ``This Week'' in 1981 and has watched
the competition multiply to include shows on Fox, CNN and MSNBC.
``It is a very crowded field competing for a very limited number of
guests. It's clear that the news viewer is not going to wait around
with all the other competition. The environment has changed, and
we're changing with the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel's New Partner
</P>
<P>
   CBS's summerlong search for a suitable morning show co-anchor
for Bryant Gumbel has ended with the selection of Jane Clayson, a
32-year-old Los Angeles correspondent for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The pick comes just in time for the scheduled November premiere
of CBS's revamped morning program, but the network is
diplomatically waiting to release the information, given the
expected surge of headlines about Viacom's announced purchase of
CBS for $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for the ``Early Show'' co-anchor was jokingly termed
Operation Glass Slipper at CBS, but the search unfolded more like a
vexing game of Clue. Ms. Clayson's name had surfaced earlier but
initially as a prospect for a news reader who could later be
promoted to co-anchor. Such a scenario presented contract problems
for Ms. Clayson at ABC, which apparently have now been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had planned to make its long-awaited announcement on Labor
Day, but it now appears that will come Wednesday. . That leaves CBS
just a few weeks to mount a recognition campaign for Ms. Clayson,
who has been an ABC correspondent since 1997. She graduated from
Brigham Young University in 1990 with a journalism degree and
worked for six years at a Salt Lake City station as a reporter and
anchor.

   WACO, Texas _ For more than six years, Brenda Carpenter has
lived with the stigma of being from a city people associate with
renegade cults; gruesome, fiery deaths; and overzealous law
enforcement. ``I wish people would just let it rest,'' said
Carpenter, 43, a pharmaceutical technician who lives in the Waco,
Texas, suburb of Elm Mott. Whether Waco residents like it or not,
the events at Mount Carmel in 1993 will not likely let them rest
for some time. The city is in the news again after the Federal
Bureau of Investigation recently disclosed after years of denials
that it used pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters to help end a standoff
at the Branch Davidian compound. By JENNIFER AUTREY. Story has

   COCODRIE, La. _ Fifteen miles out in the Gulf of Mexico, schools
of fish _ sheepshead, drum, even a few snapper _ make their homes
amid the massive steel legs of an offshore oil rig. From the deck
of the research vessel Pelican, the marine life appears abundant
and the water remarkably clear. Only a skyline of oil platforms off
the Louisiana coast mars the pristine seascape. But as scuba divers
plunge into the ocean and swim to the base of the hulking oil
platform, they disappear into a layer of murky water. Below the
turbid water, a sickly looking jellyfish is the only sign of life.
The divers have entered the Dead Zone, a swath of water nearly the
size of New Jersey, stretching from the Mississippi River delta to
the Texas-Louisiana border. Monitoring devices at the base of the
platform confirm what the researchers' eyes tell them _ there isn't
enough oxygen in the water at a depth of 65 feet for fish to
survive. By BILL HANNA. Story will move in ``a'' general news

DEMOCRATS UPBEAT ON EVE OF CONGRESSIONAL SESSION
</HEADLINE>
 By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans started their monthlong
summer recess determined to rally Americans behind their
legislative agenda, but the 106th Congress returns to work
Wednesday with Democrats convinced that they are in the driver's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue is tax cuts, health care or guns, Democrats
can point to polls indicating that voters are on their side. Their
brash confidence contrasts with the mood among Republicans and
their allies, who are bracing for a series of year-end legislative
brawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very difficult Congress,'' said Thomas
Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who fears that
Republican leaders will surrender to President Clinton. ``It's
going to get very hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans hold majorities in both the House and
Senate, their numerical advantage may be offset by splits within
the party and the power of Clinton's veto. With an eye toward next
year's elections, Clinton has signaled that he is eager to take on
Republican congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't consider himself a lame duck, that is clear,'' said
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas. ``They're just heading blindly down
the path and Clinton's going to hit them right between the eyes.
They're like the Missouri mule. You've got to keep hitting them on
the head with a hammer to get their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like gridlock as usual, but nearly every American
has a stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's far-reaching $792 billion package of tax cuts would
reduce taxes on stock profits and other capital gains, ease the
burden on married taxpayers and make it easier for self-employed
workers to get health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Democrats say the lost tax revenue would force
big cuts in federal spending on everything from national parks to
the Head Start preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute over tax cuts is just one item on the crowded
congressional agenda. Over the next several weeks, lawmakers expect
to deal with health care overhaul, campaign finance reform, gun
control and the federal aviation programs.
</P>
<P>
   They also face an Oct. 1 deadline to complete work on 11 of the
13 spending bills needed to keep the government operating in the
next fiscal year. Congressional leaders hope to adjourn for the
year Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, House Republicans fanned out during the
August recess with ambitious plans to turn public opinion their
way. The effort, which organizers call ``Takin' It To The
Streets,'' involved more the 600 town hall meetings and other
grassroots events.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical example, House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas
underscored his opposition to estate taxes by hosting a town hall
meeting that included a visit from the Grim Reaper. But even Armey
concedes that the public relations effort did not produce a
dramatic shift in voter attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently show that tax cuts take a back seat to Social
Security, health care and reducing the federal debt on the list of
voters' concerns. Only 7 percent of the respondents in a CBS poll
last month listed tax cuts as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect to reorder the priorities of the American
people,'' Armey said. ``They say people don't want tax reductions.
That's not exactly true. They don't want it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Republicans plan to send their tax bill to Clinton
for his certain veto soon after Congress reconvenes. The veto is
expected to lead to negotiations over a scaled-back tax cut that
could increase tensions between Republican hard-liners and
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, the Chamber of Commerce president, is urging House
leaders to delay the fight with Clinton for a year-end showdown.
The strategy is similar to the chain of events that led to the 1995
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the Congress is smart enough, in our opinion, to hold
onto this deal until the card game starts, I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also divided over how to deal with health care.
At least 20 Republicans have endorsed legislation by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., that would give
consumers and doctors more clout in disputes with insurance
companies and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the public supports our position on the patients' bill
of rights. I can't imagine the Republicans winning on this issue,''
Frost said. ``I can't believe that they haven't heard the exact
same thing in their districts, it is so uniform and so across the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan package includes provisions that would make it
easier for consumers to take their complaints to court.
Conservatives and business groups adamantly oppose the change, but
they acknowledge that political momentum is not on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough one,'' Armey said. ``Right now, there seems to
be a feeling that you can't pass anything that doesn't have some
form of litigation in it. I'm not happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Donohue, who contends that legislation tilted too far
toward Clinton's views would prompt some employers to drop existing
health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a very, very emotional and difficult time
on health care. If we don't get past the anecdotal emotions, then
we can really screw up the best health care system in the world,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for gun control is more complicated. Although polls
show that most Americans favor stricter gun control, neither party
is united on the issue. Conservative Democrats tend to side with
Republicans in opposing gun controls; moderate Republicans often
join Democrats in backing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   At times, even allies disagree on the details. Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, who generally opposes gun control, recently endorsed a
proposal to increase the minimum age for handgun purchases from 18
to 21 and to ban high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the presidential candidate's commentary on the
matter, but this is a legislative process,'' Armey said in voicing
his opposition.

   Q: Before World War II, Lucky Strike cigarettes came in a green
package, but they switched to white with the slogan ``Lucky Strike
green has gone to war.'' Did they ever bring back green?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.R.S., Westboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Green packages returned briefly for a 1986 event celebrating
70 years of production, according to the Antique Advertising
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The change to white packages was made in 1942 ``due to the
demand for green pigment for the war effort, and pressure from
consumers that disliked the green pack,'' according to a Lucky
Strike history published by the association.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucky Strike company was founded in 1871 by R.A. Patterson,
and the name refers to the gold rush. The American Tobacco Company,
which acquired Patterson's company in 1905, introduced Lucky Strike
cigarettes in 1917. They used the same green package until 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The association has a Web site is at www.antiqueadvertising.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the hype about having bottled water on hand for Y2K,
I'm worried about the expiration dates on gallon jugs. Does water
spoil?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.J., LaBelle, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: If stored properly, bottled water can be good indefinitely,
according to Bob Hirst, a director of the International Bottled
Water Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem drinking the water past the expiration
date,'' Hirst said. ``The date is not due to spoilage.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey law requires a two-year expiration date on bottled
water sold in that state. Though Hirst knows of no other state with
a similar requirement, the use of expiration dates has been adopted
nationally by some bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water should be stored at room temperature in a dry
environment away from chemicals such as solvents and household
cleaning products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I reach the company that produces Ivory soap
products? I can't find Ivory shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   _ C.B., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Ivory Shampoo and Conditioner, which was introduced by
Procter &AMP; Gamble in 1984, was discontinued in January, according to
a company representative.
</P>
<P>
   To contact the company, call (800) 253-2756 or write to 1 P&AMP;G
Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45202.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble also has an extensive Web site at www.pg.com.

DEMOCRATS UPBEAT ON EVE OF CONGRESSIONAL SESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans started their monthlong
summer recess determined to rally Americans behind their
legislative agenda, but the 106th Congress returns to work
Wednesday with Democrats convinced that they are in the driver's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue is tax cuts, health care or guns, Democrats
can point to polls indicating that voters are on their side. Their
brash confidence contrasts with the mood among Republicans and
their allies, who are bracing for a series of year-end legislative
brawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very difficult Congress,'' said Thomas
Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who fears that
Republican leaders will surrender to President Clinton. ``It's
going to get very hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans hold majorities in both the House and
Senate, their numerical advantage may be offset by splits within
the party and the power of Clinton's veto. With an eye toward next
year's elections, Clinton has signaled that he is eager to take on
Republican congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't consider himself a lame duck, that is clear,'' said
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas. ``They're just heading blindly down
the path and Clinton's going to hit them right between the eyes.
They're like the Missouri mule. You've got to keep hitting them on
the head with a hammer to get their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like gridlock as usual, but nearly every American
has a stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's far-reaching $792 billion package of tax cuts would
reduce taxes on stock profits and other capital gains, ease the
burden on married taxpayers and make it easier for self-employed
workers to get health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Democrats say the lost tax revenue would force
big cuts in federal spending on everything from national parks to
the Head Start preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute over tax cuts is just one item on the crowded
congressional agenda. Over the next several weeks, lawmakers expect
to deal with health care overhaul, campaign finance reform, gun
control and the federal aviation programs.
</P>
<P>
   They also face an Oct. 1 deadline to complete work on 11 of the
13 spending bills needed to keep the government operating in the
next fiscal year. Congressional leaders hope to adjourn for the
year Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, House Republicans fanned out during the
August recess with ambitious plans to turn public opinion their
way. The effort, which organizers call ``Takin' It To The
Streets,'' involved more the 600 town hall meetings and other
grassroots events.
</P>
<P>

   Unsettled weather will linger from the northern Appalachians to
the New England coast as low pressure drifts into southeastern
Canada. Mostly cloudy skies will cover the northern areas of New
York and New England where light showers and drizzle will persist,
especially over the higher terrain. Farther south, clouds will
yield to brighter skies, but scattered afternoon thunderstorms will
develop in the humid air.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin with patchy low clouds from the eastern Great
Lakes to the Middle Atlantic States, but partly sunny conditions
will develop as drier air arrives from the west. Plentiful sun will
cover the eastern Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of potent thunderstorms will erupt during the
midday and afternoon near a front in the central Great Lakes
States. Some of the storms will contain damaging winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, much cooler air will sweep from
central Canada into the northern parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley on gusty winds from the northwest. Clouds and a
few showers will dampen the eastern Dakotas and northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be very warm and humid. Most of the interior
will be dry, however, scattered afternoon thunderstorms will form
near the Gulf Coast. A cluster of locally heavy thundershowers will
erupt ahead of a cold front from northern Texas to the southern
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, high pressure will promote abundant sunshine.
Afternoon temperatures will be several degrees above the seasonal
average in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MOUNTAIN WARMTH
</P>
<P>
   So far September has been unusually warm atop New Hampshire's
Mt. Washington. Record temperatures have occurred on the mountain
from September 1 through 6, culminating in a 69 degree reading on
the 3rd, which is just 3 degrees shy of the highest temperature
ever recorded on the summit. Perched at an altitude of 6,262 feet,
Mt. Washington is the highest weather observatory east of the
Mississippi, and typically witnesses its first accumulating snow
during September. Cooler weather will return to the mountain later
this week, but snow is not expected.

NEW FIREARMS LAW PUTS CRIMINALS UNDER THE GUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A plus sign and equal sign is needed in third graph.) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ By the end of September, the warnings will
be up on billboards all over this Texas city: ``Gun Crime Means
Hard Time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, Va, the signs carry this message: ``An Illegal Gun
Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, N.Y., you might read a similar warning on the side
of a city bus: ``You (plus) illegal gun (equals) federal prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the tough messages is a new approach to curbing gun
violence that is being adopted by cities around the country, where
officials are eager to duplicate the apparent success of Richmond's
2-year-old ``Project Exile.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminals who ignore the advertised warnings and tote guns face
tough, specialized federal prosecution instead of getting lost in
the overwhelmed state courts.
</P>
<P>
   In each city, they're selling a promise that if you're caught
carrying a weapon in the commission of a crime, the local
authorities will turn you over to the feds, who will use existing
law to seek out the longest sentence applicable for your offense. A
convicted felon caught with a gun or anyone caught carrying a gun
while trafficking in drugs will usually draw at least five years in
a federal penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal system, repeat offenders get more time, federal
prisoners serve about 80 percent of their sentences and there is no
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a sea change in the criminal community,'' says
James B.Comey, criminal division chief in Richmond's U.S.
attorney's office. ``The bad guys say exactly the same thing: `Hey
man, nobody's carrying any more. That thing will get you five
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond had the second-highest murder rate in the country in
1997, the year they mounted Project Exile. They ended the year with
140 homicides, but by the end of 1998 that number had dropped to
94. The city has recorded only 47 homicides through the first eight
months of this year, as compared to 67 for the same time period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what it's done,'' Comey said. ``Richmond was a
demoralized city, not just in the folks who live here but in the
police department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exile gets more credit than it deserves some times, but it's
fired up the cops and fired up the citizens,'' Comey said. ``We are
doing something. We are becoming a zero-tolerance city for guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the program doesn't require new gun laws, and is not gun
control in the traditional sense, even the National Rifle
Association is supporting Project Exile. That makes it a rare
animal _ a gun program that President Clinton, Sarah Brady and the
NRA can agree on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish (the Clinton administration) backed this more than the
lip service they've given it,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers.
``Call it whatever you want, but whatever effort goes after armed
violent felons on the streets of American cities is something the
NRA backs heartily.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders are desperate to reduce gun violence in their
communities. Even though the murder rate has fallen dramatically in
most major cities in recent years, traveling to Richmond to study
Project Exile is becoming a civic leader's pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't any rocket science to doing a lot of gun
cases,'' says Comey. ``The genius to Exile is the advertising,
because what that has done is sell fear to the potential defendants
in ways we never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really almost creates a myth in Richmond,'' Comey said.
``The advertising people said, `Look, we manipulate culture.' They
said, `Give us a chance to sell fear.'''
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth has been important, too, Comey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bug Smith was a legendary shooter in Richmond. We popped him
with a single gun and he got 16 1/2 years in the fed. When the word
got out that Bug Smith got 16 1/2 years on a gun, the reaction was
just phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Comey quickly agrees there are other factors at play in Richmond
that may have affected the murder rate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Virginia abolished parole in 1994, which means the
first wave of criminals put away since then are probably not yet
back on the streets. And the drug trade in his city has shifted
away from crack cocaine to heroin, which produces less volatile
behavior, Comey said.
</P>
<P>
   But all the decreases in homicides in Richmond have been in the
category of murders by firearm. And there's been a nearly identical
drop in armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two clues tell me something has happened in the firearm
world of bad guys in Richmond,'' Comey said.
</P>
<P>
   But the approach has its critics.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. District judges have lambasted Project Exile for
crossing the line ``into a sovereign state's area of authority and
responsibility.'' Federal prosecution also costs considerably more
than state prosecution of similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   And in Richmond, criminal attorney David Baugh charges that
Project Exile violates the civil rights of Richmond's black
residents by sending them in front of federal juries drawn from a
larger, predominantly white pool. Federal officials point out,
however, that most Project Exile offenders will never see a jury,
opting to plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Amendment to the constitution was written to make sure
the federal government did not intrude upon those responsibilities
held by the states, Baugh said, ``And now we have every case, and
it's momma being handled by the feds. The federal courts are
overcrowded anyway _ judges who are supposed to be handling the
most delicate cases are now doing the equivalent of traffic
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's ``Operation Safe City'' will work much like
Richmond's program, as a cooperative approach among the local
police department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and
the U.S. attorney's office. On a recent afternoon, ATF agent Mike
Russell delivered his pitch for the program to more than 100 of
Fort Worth's Neighborhood Police Officers.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear that the gun cases will be prosecuted strictly
off the arrest reports filed by the local police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of this program is directly proportional to
getting these guys prosecuted in the federal system,'' Russell
said. ``It's a gimme, folks. The U.S. attorney doesn't want cases
where we have to come back and interview people. These cases will
be made strictly off the reports you file.''
</P>
<P>
   Their best chance for making a gun case stick is at the point of
executing the search warrant, he said, advising them to write down
as much detail as possible about where the gun was found and any
comments the suspect makes about the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not tell you about the dope,'' Russell said. But the
gun?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not the gun police, we are,'' Russell said. ``You talk
to them then and they'll probably tell you anything you want to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Fort Worth officers immediately began asking questions
about using the program to get people off the streets who are
problems in their neighborhoods. When Russell got back to his
office, he had a handful of telephone messages from officers who
had specific cases they wanted to pass on for federal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has been operating something of a one-man ``Safe City
U.S.A.'' program for the past 18 months, wading through Fort Worth
Police Department offense reports and pursuing those gun cases he
thought he could make stick.
</P>
<P>
   Russell picked up one gun case from an offense report on a man
arrested for multiple traffic warrants. A patrol officer spotted a
motorcycle parked between two houses in a residential neighborhood
late at night, and saw a shortened, pistol-grip shotgun strapped to
the bike. The officer ran the motorcycle's license tag number, and
discovered the outstanding traffic warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The officer arrested Nicholas Alexander Martin when he returned
to the bike a few minutes later, dressed in black, a bandolier of
shotgun shells strapped to his chest. He was also carrying a
flashlight, four feet of telephone cord, a four-inch lock-blade
knife and white surgical gloves. There was a ski mask in his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked up the (gun) case, and he turned out to be a
multiconvicted felon in possession of a firearm,'' Russell said.
Martin got 17 1/2 years in the federal penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   David Montague, a spokesman in the Tarrant County District
Attorney's office, said Martin probably would have been allowed to
plead guilty to 10 years or less had the case stayed in the state
system. And with good time and parole, he would serve even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that in the state courts, we have so many
murders, armed robberies, child abusers and sex offenders that it's
unlikely he would have the maximum,'' Montague said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Safe City program formally kicks off at the end of the
month, Russell will be aided by six other ATF agents in researching
gun cases for prosecution. ``When this thing gets rolling, we're
talking about volume,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volume has been a problem in Richmond, where federal prosecutors
saw their felony caseload jump from about 139 in 1996 to 404 in
1998 as a result of Project Exile. The Justice Department is
requesting an additional $5 million from Congress to fund about 45
to 50 prosecutors to help with the increased gun enforcement
through a variety of programs.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is lobbying Congress for $50 million to implement
Project Exile or something like it in every major city.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the public relations campaign designed to make
criminals leave their guns at home is being financed by local
businessmen Perry and Lee Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth is not reeling under its homicide rate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, considered the city's worst year for violent crime,
there were 195 homicides. But by 1998 there were only 64, and Fort
Worth's violent crime rate dropped more in the past two years than
Richmond's under Project Exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better time than when life is good?'' said Fort Worth
assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Moore. ``I came to the U.S.
attorney's office from the district attorney's office. I was the
gang queen. I didn't try anything but murders and capital murders.
It was all guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about bearing down on criminals with guns because
I don't want to go back to those days,'' Moore said. ``If I can
take a gun away from one criminal and one person doesn't get shot
or killed, man, I feel great! How do you measure that?''

INSURANCE COMPANY PAYS FOR AILING MAN'S STASH OF POT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When 71-year-old Robert DeArkland discovered he
had prostate cancer as well as sciatica and arthritis, he asked his
psychiatrist to recommend marijuana to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   But early one morning a few weeks after DeArkland bought 13
small marijuana plants from an Oakland medical marijuana club,
sheriff's deputies broke down the door of his home, handcuffed him,
seized the plants and charged him with cultivating pot for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento district attorney's office later dismissed the
charges against DeArkland and returned his growing equipment. The
authorities, however, had failed to water the baby pot plants,
which shriveled and died. So DeArkland, a feisty retiree, filed a
claim with his insurance company and was reimbursed $6,500 for the
marijuana under the part of his homeowner's policy that covers
``trees, shrubs and other plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year in Seattle, where marijuana is legal for
medical uses, State Farm Insurance paid $3,500 to a man who was
arrested after he reported that his marijuana was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The two experiences are apparently the only publicly known
instances of insurance coverage for losses of marijuana that is
used for medicinal uses.
</P>
<P>
   They underscore the unsettled nature of laws that legalize the
use of marijuana as a medicine, and how insurance companies,
traditionally among the most conservative of businesses, are
handling the unusual risks that cops and criminals pose to their
pot-puffing clients.
</P>
<P>
   The cases also suggest that adjusters will increasingly face the
dilemma of setting the value of their clients' marijuana stashes,
as they do with more mundane household items.
</P>
<P>
   At least three insurers _ Farmers, Boston-based CGU, and State
Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, with 67 million policy
holders _ will cover losses of medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it would be covered like any other loss of prescription
drug, as long as customers could show proof ... that they received
it under the care of a doctor. That's how we see it,'' said Diane
Tasaka, a spokeswoman for Farmers Insurance Group, based in Los
Angeles and the second-largest insurer of cars and homes in
California.
</P>
<P>
   At State Farm's headquarters in Bloomington, Ill., spokesman
Phil Supple said the company paid its Washington claimant for his
stolen pot in May, after seeing a letter from his doctor. The
company reimbursed him about $280 per ounce for his ``Grade AA''
marijuana and $200 per ounce for his ``Grade A'' marijuana, after
checking prices with the state's officially recognized supplier of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at the controversy of the drug as long as it's
been sanctioned medically and legally,'' Supple said. ``It's the
same as if it were insulin or an expensive antibiotic. It's all
brought up as personal property.''
</P>
<P>
   DeArkland's insurance claim appears to be the first paid in
California, where voters in 1996 approved Proposition 215, a ballot
initiative that legalizes the growth and consumption of marijuana
for medical use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge it's unprecedented,'' said Dale Gieringer,
coordinator for the California chapter of the National Organization
to Reform Marijuana Laws. ``It's just one more indication that
marijuana is being recognized as a legal substance in appropriate
uses.''
</P>
<P>
   More claims seem likely. Gieringer estimated there are 10,000
people in California who use marijuana for medical reasons and more
than a dozen marijuana ``clubs'' that supply them.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance representatives initially were surprised at
DeArkland's case, but said similar claims likewise might be covered
under standard policies.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor, a legislative analyst for the California Department
of Insurance, said that losses of legitimate marijuana might be
covered as personal property, or as trees and shrubs, as long as
the loss resulted from a ``named peril'' _ such as fire, vandalism
or theft. It was unclear, he said, whether police raids were a
named peril.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeArkland, a retired home inspector and construction worker who
lives north of Sacramento, began having serious health problems in
1987, when he had a heart attack. He later developed sciatica, a
painful nerve ailment in his lower back and legs, and arthritis in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in constant pain,'' DeArkland said. ``It's real severe. My
kneecaps get so sore I can't even touch them.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. His
urologist recommended surgery, but DeArkland opted for less
invasive alternative treatments, taking herbs and large doses of
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, he visited Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld, a Sausalito
psychiatrist who conducts court-appointed evaluations of criminal
defendants and once wrote a counterculture column under the byline
``Dr. Hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld evaluated DeArkland, and in August 1998, recommended
he use marijuana. In an interview, Schoenfeld said he approved the
drug to relieve DeArkland's pain and anxiety, after explaining
possible side effects such as drowsiness and lung damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the passage of Proposition 215, more and more people
have come to see me to make medical marijuana recommendations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, DeArkland bought a small amount of dried
marijuana and 13 plants at the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative,
after its operators verified Schoenfeld's letter.
</P>
<P>
   DeArkland put the plants in his barn. ``I wasn't trying to hide
them,'' he said. ``They were in the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   DeArkland said he smoked as much as three marijuana cigarettes a
day. ``It depends on the amount of pain. It depends on the weather.
It definitely kills the pain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after sunrise on Oct. 1, a team of sheriff's deputies
from Sacramento and Placer counties, clad in camouflage jumpsuits
and bearing a search warrant and machine guns, smashed through
DeArkland's door.
</P>
<P>
   The officers scattered his flock of geese, detained his two
teen-agers, who had been preparing for school, and handcuffed
DeArkland. He told them he had terminal prostate cancer, that the
marijuana was recommended by a doctor and that the plants were in
his barn.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies seized the 13 plants, all less than 2 feet tall,
lights used for growing them, fertilizer, $424 in cash, 1.5 grams
of dried pot and a letter from Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   During the raid, DeArkland had trouble breathing, and was taken
to a hospital where he was put under observation, released and went
home. He heard nothing more from the police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a doctor recommended that he have radiation therapy
for his prostate. DeArkland went to the Sacramento district
attorney's office to inquire about his case and was arrested for
what officials told him was an outstanding warrant stemming from
the raid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with cultivating marijuana and possession of
marijuana for sale, two felonies that could net sentences ranging
from 16 months to three years and 8 months in jail, and released on
$10,000 bail, said his Sacramento lawyer, Joseph Farina.
</P>
<P>
   But after court hearings, Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi
dismissed the charges for insufficient evidence. He declined to
discuss details of the case, but said he believed Proposition 215
has caused confusion among law-enforcement officials because it did
not specify the number of plants or illnesses that it covered.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the sheriff's deputies returned DeArkland's property
and plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dead. They were dried up. Hell, they don't water
anything,'' DeArkland said.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a $25 million claim against Placer County that contends
deputies wrongfully raided his home and arrested him. He filed a
similar $10 million claim against Sacramento County. Both were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   DeArkland also filed a claim with his insurance firm, CGU,
estimating that the plants were worth about $20,500.
</P>
<P>
   DeArkland said he based his estimate on police figures that each
mature plant would produce four ounces of dried marijuana worth
$400 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   At first the company was skeptical, writing him that his
insurance contract applied ``only if it is not obviously illegal,
immoral or against the public good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the Placer County Sheriff's Department used a valid
search warrant to confiscate the plants, which may not be the same
as stealing the plants,'' an adjustor wrote him.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurance company relented after DeArkland showed he had
medical approval and, by July, the only issue was the value of the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the value at maturity approximates $20,500,'' wrote
adjustor L. Bruce Bogart. ``However the plants were not at
maturity. Thus, we need to try to agree on a value. ...''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, the company sent DeArkland a check for $6,500, after
deciding to cover the plants under the shrubbery clause of his
policy.

`BATFACE' CUPHEA KEEPS ON FLOWERING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: On a recent trip my wife purchased an interesting plant. She
was told that it is called the ``bat-faced'' plant. It has been a
good conversation piece. Any help would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   A: `Batface' cuphea is a drought-tolerant, sun-loving plant with
tiny blooms that resemble a bat's face. The ``face'' is purple; the
``ears'' are red. It flowers continuously spring through frost.
This low-maintenance, tough little plant will freeze back but may
return from the roots, depending on the severity of the weather.
Mature height may be 12 to 18 inches. I pinch mine so it won't be
so leggy. `Batface' does reseed somewhat, too. Kids love this
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please tell me how to care for a pineapple plant. Can the
pineapple be eaten? When do I cut it off?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pineapple is a bromeliad, and these plants like air
movement. Grow yours on the patio or deck in bright light, if
possible, during warm months. Place indoors during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can eat the fruit. After a pineapple flowers, fruit
will form. You know it's ready to eat when you notice a pineapple
fragrance. The fruit will give a little when squeezed and will turn
golden.
</P>
<P>
   It may take three or four years, but you can grow a pineapple
from fruit purchased at the grocery store. Buy a pineapple that
still has its top. At home, remove the top from the fruit, strip
off the bottom leaves, leaving 2 1/2 to 3 inches of solid stem.
Allow the top to dry for about three days.
</P>
<P>
   When the top has dried, plant it in a container full of good
potting soil, pushing the cut end into the medium. Keep the soil
moist, and the top should put out a good root system.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a small pot, and repot as necessary. Eventually the
plant will flower, followed by the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is this plant that is taking over our flower beds? How
can I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The foliage you mailed in appears to be that of a dayflower.
There is a spreading dayflower and an erect dayflower. Both have
blue flowers, but the erect dayflower's bloom is about an inch wide
while that of the spreading type is about 3/8-inch. The erect
dayflower's bloom consists of two blue petals and one tiny whitish
one. The spreading dayflower has a single bloom emerging from the
boatlike spathe; the erect dayflower produces several buds in the
spathe. The foliage on the spreading dayflower may be up to 4
inches long, while that of the erect dayflower may reach 6 inches.
On both, the lancelike leaves sheath succulent stems.

   The spreading dayflower is an annual that creeps along, and the
stems root at the nodes. It reseeds, too. I pull it like crazy at
various times to keep it under control. In loose, organic soil, it
pulls up easily. Otherwise, I have to make sure I get all the
roots. You could spot-treat it with an herbicide, but since it is
growing among your flowers, this is risky.

SLOPPINESS MARS COMPELLING TALE OF SERIAL KILLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``Bad boy from Rosebud: The murderous life of Kenneth Allen
McDuff''; By Gary M. Lavergne; University of North Texas Press,
$29.95. 
 
By MIKE SNYDER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For his second book, Gary M. Lavergne chose a powerful subject
and plunged into his research, producing a wealth of facts,
anecdotes, observations and background. Then he sat down to
assemble this rich material into a book, and he made a hash of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Boy From Rosebud'' suffers from sloppy editing and a level
of writing that ranges from competent to amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   This is a shame, because the story of Kenneth Allen McDuff is
significant on a number of levels. A good book about his life and
death would be an important asset to the body of nonfiction crime
literature.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff was a serial killer who achieved such depths of cruelty
that even staunch death-penalty opponents couldn't muster the will
to protest his execution last November. His release on parole in
1989 and his subsequent killing spree were important factors in
Texas' unprecedented prison-construction program and parole
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, McDuff inhabited a subculture of drugs,
prostitution and violence that, like other foul regions of society,
carries great literary potential. McDuff himself was a fascinating
and repugnant person, a worthy subject for a study of the internal
and external forces that create evil.
</P>
<P>
   Lavergne's first book was an account of Charles Whitman's 1966
shooting rampage from the University of Texas Tower in Austin, a
tragedy that left 14 people dead and 31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Boy From Rosebud'' begins in promising fashion with a
serviceable description of Rosebud, the small Central Texas town
where McDuff grew up. Readers meet McDuff's family and learn about
his development as a childhood bully who, encouraged by a mother
who insisted he could do no wrong, consistently refused to take
responsibility for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative proceeds logically to a description of McDuff's
first killings _ the so-called ``Broomstick Murders'' of three high
school students near Fort Worth in 1966 _ and of McDuff's arrest,
conviction and death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was commuted to life in prison when the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that the death penalty was
unconstitutional, and in 1989 McDuff was released on parole _ one
of a flood of dangerous prisoners released in response to pressure
to ease crowding in state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, young women in Central Texas began disappearing.
Ultimately, McDuff would become a suspect in 15 murders.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes detailed, vivid descriptions of the two
slayings that led to capital-murder convictions and death sentences
for McDuff. The victims were Melissa Northrup, a 22-year-old
pregnant mother of two, whom McDuff abducted from a Waco
convenience store, and Colleen Reed, a 21-year-old accountant he
kidnapped from an Austin carwash.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes for a compelling story. But Lavergne's telling
of it is marred by errors that a reader might expect to find in a
galley proof but that are inexcusable in a finished book. In at
least two instances, the past tense of ``to lie'' is expressed as
``laid'' (someone ``laid down''). In another passage, a car's brake
lights become ``break lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasional howlers in Lavergne's prose do nothing to improve the
reading experience. In a description of a peripheral character, he
writes: ``Below the ribs, in all directions, exploded a massive
stomach, so large that its front came to an apex at the
bellybutton, leading him as a stern sic leads a ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavergne also lapses into preachiness and moralism that are
hardly necessary in an account of a man whose monstrous deeds speak
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He describes the natural beauty of Central Texas and the virtues
of most of its hard-working residents, then offers, in contrast, a
glimpse of lifestyles on the streets that McDuff prowled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who populate this subculture,'' Lavergne writes, ``live
in a world of their own _ largely unknown to the rest of Central
Texas. At first glance, the major difference between the two
cultures appears to be monetary; a closer look reveals more than
poverty. It reveals an absence of pride of any type and the lack of
social graces and any moral base upon which to gauge appropriate
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's qualifications for such a sociological analysis are
not apparent. &QL;

ADVOCATE PRESENTS STRATEGY FOR SELF-SUFFICIENT INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL
IN LATEST BOOK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time space buffs decry the absence of an articulate
visionary in their ranks, a guru with the infectious passion for
interstellar exploration often associated with the late rocketry
expert Werner von Braun and astronomer Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   Von Braun, principal architect of the Saturn V moon rocket, died
in 1977, and Sagan's death almost three years ago left a void of
leadership and influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact they are not here right now is greatly missed,''
laments Robert Zubrin, the feisty aerospace engineer known for the
bold $20-billion, 10-year strategy he outlined in his 1996 book
``The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We
Must.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But rather than say we hope we have another superhero emerge,
we should say it's up to each of us to take on the burden of
spreading the vision. Yes, I'm trying to do that, and I hope that
other people try. It's a job, not a franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anyone, Zubrin has the imagination, the drive and the
credentials to claim the role of unofficial advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Space advocates may judge Zubrin for themselves by reading his
new book, ``Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization''
(J.P. Tarcher/Putnam, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin advocates a change in U.S. space policy, which currently
restricts human activity to low Earth orbit _ the reach of the
space shuttle and the prospective seven-person domain of the
U.S.-led international space station.
</P>
<P>
   He urges federal expenditures for the exploration and settlement
of Mars and for a human presence that could exploit natural
resources in the distant reaches of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Political obstacles loom large for the 47-year-old Denver-area
engineer, as evidenced by unresolved efforts in the House of
Representatives to trim $1 billion from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration budget as part of a tax-cut measure.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Zubrin is willing to fertilize the grass roots.
Barely a year old, the Mars Society (www.marssociety.org) he
founded in Boulder, Colo., sports 80 chapters, 30 of them in
foreign countries. The organization's second annual gathering in
August drew 1,000 enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, the society expects to gin up its $1.2 million Mars
Arctic Research Station, a prototype of the habitation module
Zubrin describes in ``The Case for Mars.'' Placed in the chilly,
Martianlike terrain of Canada's Devon Island, the station is
designed to accommodate a half-dozen residents with solar-generated
electrical power, water-recycling equipment, a greenhouse and other
implements of life support.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin says his writings, demonstrations and organizing efforts
are part of a strategy to offer the next U.S. president an
opportunity to embrace ``the case for Mars.'' At the outset, this
strategy does not require the breakthroughs in rocketry needed by
NASA's Cold War-inspired Apollo program.
</P>
<P>
   Though precluded by policy from embarking on human missions to
the moon, let alone to the Red Planet, NASA has embraced a key
Zubrin tenet in its planning for Mars: Use resources on the alien
planet to cut costs and manage risks.
</P>
<P>
   His ``live off the land when possible'' approach means
dispatching surface habitats, nuclear-power generators and
Earth-return craft well ahead of explorers rather than combining
all these elements in one large, as yet nonexistent, rocket.
</P>
<P>
   It means developing technologies to extract carbon dioxide from
the thin Martian atmosphere and to combine it with hydrogen to
produce fuel, breathing oxygen and water, rather than toting these
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are moving ahead with our human space program at
much too slow a pace. There is some forward motion,'' Zubrin says,
referring to the space station. ``But I would hesitate to describe
the current human space program as representing anything in any way
as beyond or even as good as what we had going on circa 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are at a historic crossroads, Zubrin says, in a world
that has changed greatly since President John F. Kennedy initiated
the Apollo program as part of a Cold War effort to trump the Soviet
Union with U.S. technical prowess by landing a human on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   He outlines the choices he sees in ``Entering Space,'' borrowing
from Russian visionary Nikolai Kardashev.
</P>
<P>
   Our options in the new millennium, he says, are to remain a Type
I civilization achieving mastery over the resources of its planet
or to press ahead to become a Type II civilization, which masters
its solar system, and, eventually, a Type III civilization, which
achieves access to the entire galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Entering Space,'' Zubrin discusses technical hurdles to
creating propulsion systems for deep-space exploration, and the
potential rewards of overcoming them. He portrays a future in which
our engineers mine not only the moon but also the atmospheres of
Jupiter and Saturn for helium 3, a fuel for nuclear fusion that
could power rockets and serve as a source of electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin envisions populated outposts midway to Neptune with the
technologies to prevent rogue comets and asteroids from striking
Earth. He dreams of technical advances that would permit humans to
direct cometlike ice-teroids from the distant Kuiper Belt and Oort
Cloud into the Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Through terraforming, as the discipline is known, Mars would
gradually be converted to a warmer, wetter, more Earthlike realm.
</P>
<P>
   For those who call his vision unrealistic, Zubrin believes he
can argue its merits on terms that a prospective president could
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will inspire the country in a positive way. This is an
invitation to adventure for every kid in the country. It will
inspire millions of our youth to get scientific educations,''
Zubrin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a human-to-Mars program were to simply inspire 1 percent
more of them to get a scientific education, that means you get a
million additional engineers, inventors, doctors and research
biologists. They will create new industries, advance the human
condition. There is an enormous payoff economically.''

`LOW SEASON' ISN'T ALWAYS A BARGAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reader Steve Buck struck a familiar chord with a letter about
travel in ``low season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently returned from a wonderful vacation at the Acapulco
Princess,'' Buck began. ``It's one of our favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there was one major problem. When we arrived, we
found that the main building _ the Pyramid _ was closed for the
summer, as they are reconstructing. This is the area in which we
were looking forward to staying, as we had in the past. There is
just something special to us with that building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adjusted and had a wonderful time, as usual. (But) is this
typical that the information about this closure was kept from us?
My travel agent didn't know about the closure, and Continental
Vacations didn't know or didn't say anything to my agent. Most
important, there was nothing on the hotel Web site mentioning this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any obligation on the hotel's part to inform
potential guests of problems like this?''
</P>
<P>
   I had an immediate flashback. Five years ago, also during late
summer or early fall _ slow periods for tourism in most of Mexico
and the Caribbean _ I, too, stayed at the Acapulco Princess and
found it an ideal vacation retreat. I wouldn't hesitate to return.
</P>
<P>
   But during that visit, one of the two principal lodging towers
was closed for renovation. Some restaurants were shuttered, too,
resulting in crowded conditions in other dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   No one had uttered a word about these closures prior to my
arrival, either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My response to Buck's question: Yes, hotels _ and all other
elements of the travel industry _ should feel an obligation to
inform guests when even one of their regularly advertised services
or amenities will be unavailable, or when construction is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the information is seldom forthcoming. And the
expressed reasoning for such failure to disclose usually is a shrug
of the shoulders and the explanation: ``It's low season. That's why
you're paying a discounted rate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a factor to keep in mind as we make our vacation choices.
</P>
<P>
   During one summer many years ago, the co-pilot and I were
delighted to secure a minuscule rate at a well-regarded oceanfront
hotel on St. Martin, a Caribbean island. Our pleasure was enhanced
when, upon arrival, we were given upgraded accommodations, the
explanation being that the hotel was ``quite empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we inquired about dinner reservations. ``Our restaurants
are closed at the moment,'' the manager said. By ``the moment,'' he
meant the duration of our four-day stay. We soon learned that the
swimming pools also were closed (for maintenance, we were told).
The bars and gift shop, too. And although the beach was lovely, it
was shared _ no, overrun _ by guests at an adjacent nudist resort.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAVINGS EVAPORATE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's brochures had touted so many enticements that we
hadn't bothered to rent a car, figuring we'd just relax and take
all our meals on the property. We were miles from any restaurants _
at least restaurants whose diners wore clothes _ and as the week
progressed, hiring taxis to take us to lunch and dinner wiped out
any ``low season'' savings.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised to learn soon afterward that this particular
hotel had been razed.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers also write this time of year to inquire whether
bargain-basement cruise fares from late August through October _ as
low as $500 for a seven-day Caribbean sailing on some vessels _ are
``too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not much for name-calling, but let me mention four you won't
find advertised in brochures and Internet promotions: Bret. Cindy.
Dennis. Emily. This may be ``low season'' aboard ship, but it's
hurricane season in the ocean. Chances are your trip to the Bahamas
or St. Thomas will result in smooth sailing _ and, unlike at some
land resorts, you'll enjoy the same entertainment, food and pools
as during peak season _ but are you willing to take that risk? Many
potential passengers shy away; thus rates drop in an effort to lure
business.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand, I'm not discouraging travel at off-peak
times. On the contrary, those are my favorite vacation periods. Not
only are prices lower, but you'll also find less crowding, and
local residents tend to be friendlier when not inundated by
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   During many years as a baseball reporter for this newspaper, my
vacations always fell in midwinter. Many times I would arrive in
small European towns to find bus routes curtailed, shops closed,
restaurant menus scaled back and service limited. Once in early
November, it seemed that the entire populace of Zermatt,
Switzerland, had fled elsewhere just as I arrived.
</P>
<P>
   I kept returning. But I knew what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when there are surprises, staff attitude can make a
world of difference. When we arrived at a hotel in Lucerne,
Switzerland, and expressed dismay that the small but familiar room
we had reserved was being remodeled, management placed us in a
suite. That gesture earned our repeat business.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance and new construction are essential. And fewer guests
are inconvenienced during off-peak periods. Practicality can
dictate cutbacks in service when demand diminishes. And certainly
hurricanes are beyond the control of cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't excuse anyone from telling travelers up
front when ``low season'' has a deeper meaning than ``low prices.''
</P>
<P>
   I visited a local travel agent not long ago to inquire about an
Alaskan cruise this month. His first words were: ``It's the end of
the season, and there are value prices, but do you realize that
it's going to be cold there in September?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of honesty I appreciate.

 &HT;    CISNEROS PLEADS GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR, ENDING CONSPIRACY CASE
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former housing secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded
guilty Tuesday to a single misdemeanor charge, ending a four-year,
$9 million federal investigation into his extramarital life and
allegations that he lied to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, reporters and onlookers who had gathered in U.S.
District Court for the start of jury selection in Cisneros's
long-delayed trial instead saw Cisneros plead guilty and agree to
pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret my lack of candor and accept responsibility for my
conduct,'' Cisneros said in a prepared statement. ``I hope that all
who follow me in public service learn the lesson that truth and
candor are important in the process of selecting our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, a former San Antonio mayor, had faced a possible
90 years in prison on 18 felony counts stemming from an affair he
began in 1997 with fund-raiser Linda Medlar, who now uses her
maiden name, Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, he will get no prison time or probation and
could apply for a presidential pardon. A felony conviction could
have kept Cisneros from running for office again.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement also saves Cisneros from the public airing of
most of the contents of 26 recordings Jones secretly made of her
conversations with him.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros pleaded guilty to telling an FBI agent in 1993 that he
lied when he said he paid Jones about $2,500 a month over a
three-year period. He paid her considerably more, in excess of
$250,000, according to federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros lied during an FBI background check pending
confirmation of his appointment as secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. He stepped down from the post in
1996 and is now president and chief operating officer of Univision,
a Los Angeles-based Spanish-language television network.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who earlier pleaded guilty to similar charges stemming
from the case, is serving a 3-1/2 year federal prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin that he wasn't
sure how much he had been paying Jones because he never calculated
a total. He said his wife of 30 years, the former Mary Alice Perez,
didn't know how much he was paying his former mistress. Cisneros
said he lied to the FBI in ``the pressured and confused fog of the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough for Sporkin, who pressed Cisneros to
admit guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know ... you were, in effect, not being candid with the
FBI?'' Sporkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros responded: ``That's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the outcome, Sporkin said, is that ``we
cannot permit an individual to lie his way into high public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by independent counsel David M. Barrett, a Republican
activist and lobbyist, the federal government spent at least $9
million on the Cisneros investigation. The final cost won't be
known for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The probe was part of the closing chapter of the independent
counsel law, which expired June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the outcome was worth the time and money spent to
pursue Cisneros, Barrett said: ``Ask me in a week.'' He otherwise
declined to comment, as did Cisneros and all the lawyers involved
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Di Genova, a former federal prosecutor and independent
counsel, called the misdemeanor plea ``a win for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Sporkin decided to let the tapes in, Cisneros had his
back against the wall,'' Di Genova said. ``He had to make some very
important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he said Cisneros's lie to the FBI was ``a very serious
matter,'' Di Genova also criticized the independent counsel
statute, calling it a ``very bad law that created a lack of
confidence in federal white-collar law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Cisneros supporters were crowing over what they
considered a clear victory for the charismatic man who electrified
Democrats at their 1984 national convention and who was once talked
about as a possible first Hispanic president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, he's paid the equivalent of a white-collar parking
ticket,'' said Austin political consultant George Shipley. ``I
think it's clear the government could have ended this case years
ago, perhaps with an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisneros's reputation, although tarnished, is intact,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley is mentioned 33 times in tape-recorded conversations
between Jones and Cisneros. He wouldn't say if he tried to help
Jones in an effort to get her to leave Cisneros alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of Henry's friends were concerned about Linda, but she
refused all offers of help,'' he said.

   OLYMPIC-BUSES _ WASHINGTON _ When Atlanta Olympic organizer
Billy Payne first outlined the bid committee's excesses for
Congress, he conceded, among other things, that it ``facilitated''
the donation of a used bus to Lima, Peru. The gift went over so
well that on the eve of the vote in Tokyo on Sept. 18, 1990, a far
more generous offer to Peru's IOC member was planned. How would he
like 50 buses for his hometown? That offer was not mentioned in the
Atlanta team's original June 1 report to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee, which is looking into the Olympic bid process. But it is
documented in the materials that fill three dozen boxes being pored
over by federal investigators. They discovered more unreported
expensive gifts and favors for IOC members and their families.

   BUSH-HISPANICVOTE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Fresh from his success among
Texas Hispanic voters in the past fall's re-election bid, Gov.
George W. Bush has taken his Spanish-laced stump speeches to the
national stage, and the Republican Party sees him as a bona fide
crossover hit. In his bid for the presidency, Bush is energetically
courting the nation's fastest-growing voting group. And he's
creating great expectations in key states such as California, where
local GOP officers consider Bush a potential savior as they try to
patch up relations with Hispanics after former Gov. Pete Wilson's
anti-immigrant crusades. The courtship hasn't been completely
smooth. Bush has been criticized by some Hispanic groups for
skipping their national meetings, and he disappointed some Texas
border leaders who felt he didn't support their agenda during this
year's legislative session. 40. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman)

from their beach vacations and the candidates, like dying leaves,

different direction. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

such a war with lice plaguing her daughter, Chelsea, she videotaped
part of the battle two years ago. The start of the school year is
high season for head lice -a growing problem in U.S. schools,
according to the CDC. Schools are now struggling to control
epidemics of the bugs, which are becoming increasingly resistent to
chemical treatments. A look at the problem and how to fix it.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When producer Ralph Farquhar first pitched a half-hour comedy
featuring Kirk Franklin as a petty hoodlum turned church choir
director, the initial reaction from ABC was sheer giddiness. A
hip-hop/gospel music phenomenon with multimillion record sales,
videos airing on MTV and BET, and sold-out concerts, Franklin would
arrive on the prime-time television stage with a built-in following
of the young and hip.
</P>
<P>
   But as the first scripts took shape, Farquhar was constantly
queried by network representatives about the ``mainstream
possibilities'' of a series whose cast was overwhelmingly
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, where were the white people?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sitcom set in a black neighborhood church,'' recalled
Farquhar, a veteran writer/producer who created ``Moesha'' and the
new sitcom ``The Parkers,'' both on UPN. ``Based on that, I turned
the question around and asked: What white characters would that be?
I remember this queasy feeling that something was about to happen.
I just didn't know what or when.''
</P>
<P>
   Farquhar found out in May, when the newly announced fall
television schedules revealed a rather disturbing pattern: Of the
38 new live-action dramas and comedies spread across the four major
networks and three upstarts, only two featured minorities in lead
roles. Nearly every cast member from the remaining series was
white.
</P>
<P>
   As black and Hispanic groups threatened legal action and
boycotts, the finger-pointing began. But there are no obvious
villains.
</P>
<P>
   This year's lily-white TV season isn't about racism.
</P>
<P>
   It's about ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For the networks, diversity just doesn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers simply prefer to watch shows with characters who look
like them. And so the networks, under pressure to halt audience
erosion and dwindling profits, have become doggedly focused on the
generally more affluent white households that advertisers seek.
Networks are afraid of alienating whites, who, despite watching 40
percent less TV than African-Americans and 30 percent less than
Latinos, still make up 70 percent of potential viewers. And if that
audience is no longer tuning in to shows with minority leads,
there's little incentive for networks to risk the millions of
dollars it costs to produce and market them.
</P>
<P>
   This helps explain how so many new series set in urban high
schools and in such diverse cities as New York and Los Angeles
feature so few black, Hispanic and Asian characters, and why a
sitcom about the adventures of a rap group has only one
African-American in a cast of four regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When looking at issues of race and TV programming, and looking
at the color scheme of how programs are cast, issues of green have
always been more important than issues of white, black or brown,''
said John Rash, senior vice president and director of broadcast
negotiations at Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis marketing
communications agency that last year placed close to a half-billion
dollars in TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not necessarily that networks want only younger,
Caucasian viewers. We need to pay closer attention to why, for
instance, there's such a lack of a shared viewing experience
between the races right at a time when most of society is becoming
more diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Never has prime time been as segregated as it is today. If you
look at the most popular shows among blacks, Hispanics and Anglos,
you'd think you were looking at completely different TV schedules.
Only Monday Night Football is a Top 10 favorite among all three
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The gaps in viewing tastes are quite astonishing, particularly
when you examine TV's history. Only a generation ago, Hispanics
(with the exception of Desi Arnaz, who starred in CBS' ``I Love
Lucy'' during the '50s) and Asians were virtually absent from the
landscape. Black performers had it one step better _ they were on
TV but relegated to roles as domestics, second bananas or buffoons
on series like CBS' ``Amos n' Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1965, when the NBC adventure series ``I Spy''
debuted, that we saw the first dramatic series with a black star.
(How ironic that Bill Cosby remains one of the few bankable black
leads today.) Three years later, Diahann Carroll portrayed a nurse
in ``Julia,'' also on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But white audiences watched those shows, and throughout the '70s
and '80s, it was hardly an anomaly for largely black or multiracial
casts to attract mixed audiences. ``The Jeffersons,'' ``Chico and
the Man,'' ``Good Times'' and ``Sanford &AMP; Son'' couldn't have
survived without white fans. And white-oriented series like ``All
in the Family,'' ``Hunter'' and ``The Golden Girls'' had large
black and Hispanic followings.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' not only became the first and only
black-cast television program to reign at No. 1, but positioned
itself as the first truly water-cooler TV show, able to link blacks
and whites with themes of family, education and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has changed dramatically. Now, only sports and
children's programming can make claims of supplying racially mixed
audiences. And NBC, once the home of the groundbreaking ``I Spy''
and ``The Cosby Show,'' didn't even consider any pilots with
minority leads for the fall season.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, NBC's new entertainment head, Scott Sassa, an
Asian-American, promised TV critics a more ethnically diverse
network, even commissioning suddenly hot producer Yvette Lee Bowser
to do a comedy pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bowser already has a track record with NBC. The
network axed her multiracial sitcom ``For Your Love'' after one
season.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why TV viewers have become so divided along racial lines
is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   Some point to the so-called ghetto-ization of black programming
that began in the late 1980s, when the then-new Fox network
embraced black audiences while searching for a toehold. Sassy,
ethnically diverse programs like ``In Living Color'' and ``Martin''
attracted a large black and Hispanic viewer base, but many of the
shows were poorly written and relied heavily on black stereotypes
and caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'90s Fox, wanting to expand its base, began to focus
more on the same affluent and larger white audience that the major
networks courted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was writing for `South Central' when the mandate came down
from Fox that there would be fewer shows featuring black
characters,'' said Kathleen McGee, a staff writer for the Lifetime
drama ``Any Day Now.'' ``It was a conscious direction on their
part. They wanted to segue into a more mainstream palette of
programs. So I saw that happen then and imagined that would be the
trend sooner or later with the others. It was.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, CBS, ABC and NBC were abandoning minority programming;
the two newcomers, the WB and UPN, programmed minority series
almost exclusively. But as the two new networks got their footing,
they, too, abandoned the plan. (The WB now wants young white women;
UPN targets men). Last season, the WB dropped three black-cast
sitcoms, ``Sister, Sister,'' ``The Wayans Bros.'' and ``Smart
Guy,'' to make room for more dramas based on white characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened,'' said Robert Townsend, who starred in and was
an executive producer of the WB's ``The Parent'Hood,'' ``was that
white audiences hated a lot of those shows and simply stopped
watching them. Having them all lumped together made them all easier
to avoid. So the only people watching by then were black people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, said that when
he ran programming at the WB, black-cast shows fared poorly when
sprinkled throughout the schedule, in part because ``white viewers
simply skipped over them. Once they started turning away and not
coming back, we had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, all of the WB's black-oriented comedies are on
Fridays; UPN's air on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, executives at ABC, CBS and NBC are expressing
frustration over their inability to lure mixed audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted solution was a new style _ the black sitcom that
wasn't really black. The trend showed up a couple seasons ago with
shows like ``The Gregory Hines Show'' (black family with white
friends), ``Arsenio'' (black couple with white friends), ``Living
in Captivity'' (black family living in white suburb) and ``Getting
Personal'' (black professionals with white colleagues). But white
viewers still didn't show up, and the shows were quickly dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, apparently, the networks have entered Phase 2, a kind of
cinematic affirmative action: Put whites on existing black-cast
shows to lure white viewers and improve chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't gone over well, either. Black producers, writers and
actors say the additions mean a change in the show's social tone,
that they are being asked to ``de-culture'' their shows, as one
writer put it, in order to make white viewers more comfortable
watching them.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: the WB's ``The Steve Harvey Show,'' which last
season was the most-watched program among African-Americans but
ranked 127 with whites, according to a study by TN Media. Two key
white characters have been added in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the No. 1 ranked comedy among whites,
``Friends,'' ranked seventh overall with Hispanics and 88th in
black homes.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a network that rants and raves about the No. 1 ranking
my show has gotten over the years, but because they happen to be
numbers that feature mostly African-Americans, all of a sudden
those are not wanted numbers anymore,'' said Harvey, the show's
star and one of its executive producers. ``If any other show has
the No. 1 ranking in any other demographic, they're applauding. If
I'm `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and get all white teen-agers, I'm
applauded. If I'm `Friends' and get all white males from 18 to 34,
I'm applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us? We gotta go trolling for white folks. And I don't see any
of those white shows like `Friends' trying to `broaden' their
audience with black people. How many black people watch that show?
Two? Three?''
</P>
<P>
   Athough lauded for remaining with minority shows, UPN also moved
away from the all-minority comedy. The new ``Grown Ups,'' for
instance, actually has more white than black regular characters,
and ``The Parkers'' gave star Countess Vaughn a white girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a narrowcaster in this business and expect to
stay in this business,'' said Dean Valentine, president of UPN.
``We focused more on black programming early on because no one else
would. But you eventually must consider the economic realities of
that decision. You need a cross section of viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   And being labeled ``a black show'' is the kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to get whites to watch,'' said Arthur
Harris, a staff writer with UPN's ``Grown Ups.'' ``It's easier to
get blacks to watch white shows. As a writer, if the show you're on
isn't crossing over, you better keep your resume circulating. And I
guess that may have something to do with that whole advertising
monster, too.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't advertisers more interested in reaching minority
households? Possible reasons include their lesser buying power and
the fact that because blacks watch more TV than whites, advertisers
won't pay networks as much for an audience that's ``easier'' to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time an oversupply of a certain type of viewer exists,
yes, it will cost less to reach them,'' Rash said, referring to
black viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smikle of Target Market News, a Chicago research firm that
monitors the African-American consumer market, estimates the
economic clout of black America at more than $400 billion. Because
of a growing black middle class, its economic power is increasing
at a faster rate than that of white households.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from advertiser response to the new season, they
haven't noticed that. Contrary to their self-proclaimed death
notices, the networks are actually thriving. Estimated advertising
revenue for the year is expected to rise among the six networks
(excluding PAX TV) to $7.25 billion, up from $6.4 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money for an industry considered to be in an
irreversible decline. And perhaps it explains why the bad press
over the lack of minority-fronted shows won't be perceived as
hurting the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``White advertisers don't value the black consumer to the extent
that they value the white consumer,'' said Bob Johnson, founder and
CEO of Black Entertainment Television. ``This has plagued black
businesses ever since they first started. It goes back to when
blacks were considered one-eighth of a person. That same value
discount still exists.''
</P>
<P>
   TV executives, as well as media buyers like Rash, routinely deny
any economic tie between race and ad rates, even while admitting a
frustration with advertisers who do have a tier system of paying
premiums to reach certain groups. (Viewers over age 50 _ of any
race _ are considered the least desirable.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any network executive _ I know certainly we
don't _ sits there and says, `Gee, if we make this show all-white,
we're going to get more dollars from Madison Avenue,' '' said Les
Moonves, president and CEO of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anticipating, nor have we received any resistance
to the new (Steven) Bochco show `City of Angels,' which will be
three-quarters African-American cast. There has not been one iota
of hold-back from anybody on Madison Avenue because of the theme of
that show.''
</P>
<P>
   More-cynical observers will probably also note that ``City of
Angels'' comes from powerful producer Bochco. The midseason series,
set in a black and Hispanic neighborhood in Los Angeles and
starring Blair Underwood and Vivica A. Fox, is one of the few
projects that wasn't hurriedly pieced together in response to the
blanket criticism that surprised the networks at the TV critics'
tour in July.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   After the controversy hit, the WB, for instance, announced that
``For Your Love's'' Bowser would produce a pilot for a multiracial
family drama, a project the producer admitted had been sitting
around unwanted for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The WB is also developing the sitcom ``Loose Cannon'' with the
black stand-up comic Nick Cannon. NBC has turned to ``In Living
Color's'' Keenen Ivory Wayans for an interracial family sitcom
under the working title of ``Not the Bradys.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of those all-white new series set in diverse
environments, like ``Manchester Prep'' and ``Wasteland,'' dashed
out to find minority actors, if only to keep the critics off their
backs. Even existing series such as ``Suddenly Susan'' became so
aggressive in their hunt for minority characters that Robert
Townsend referred to it as ``a Kmart blue light special on black
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing all this from the comfy set of his new series is
Farquhar, who said he'll keep pitching multicultural series like
``The Parkers.'' All-black fare _ along the lines of the
dead-and-buried Kirk Franklin project _ are relics of the past, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll continue to support the NAACP's legal
actions, whatever they may be. But he has his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's something the courts can resolve,'' he
said. ``At the end of the day, which show you choose and for what
reason has nothing to do with anything that can be outlined by a
judge. Or he'd be a network executive, wouldn't he?''

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TV AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WON'T CHANGE SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time I sit down to watch a television program that
purports to be about African-Americans, I do so with anxiety,
fearing that the characters will be false and stereotypical,
distorted into caricatures that are ignorant and cruel.
</P>
<P>
   I assume that we all want our lives to be taken seriously and
represented fully _ portrayed with power and honesty, empathy and
sympathy, pain and happiness. I can't imagine someone asking that
their life be reduced to the cardboard dimensions that often typify
prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly that is what I find.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what I'll continue to find.
</P>
<P>
   As the new TV season approaches and the debate over on-camera
inclusion and race is revisited, networks are promising to do
better, to be better by making their casts reflect the world in
which we live. I'm not optimistic. The relationship between this
medium and people of color has always been awkward and tenuous at
best, hostile and resentful at worst, and I don't see that changing
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   That's because TV has never known what to do with minority
characters, much the way America hasn't quite figured out what to
do with the issue of race.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the media seemed to discover this problem just this
summer, after the new season was announced and revealed a serious
lack of minority characters, I have watched it grow and manifest
itself for years, like a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While riffling through old press kits the other day, I noticed a
photo of the original cast of ``Melrose Place,'' the one with
Vanessa Williams smiling sweetly from the left side. There wasn't a
more luckless character on ``Melrose'' than Williams, unless you
count Doug Savant's gay character, who at least stayed a few
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it was clear that both Williams and Savant were
getting short shrift when it came to relationships on the steamy
soap. I don't know what producers feared more: a gay romance or an
interracial one. (Giving her a black boyfriend would mean bringing
on another black character.) So Williams was relegated to saying
``whassup?'' at the beginning of the show and ``see ya'' at its
end. Halle Berry had the same problems on ``Living Dolls,'' the
short-lived series about models. And the role of black nonentity
continued last season in such shows as ``Cupid'' with Jeffrey Sams
and Tangi Miller on ``Felicity.'' Neither got much to do.
</P>
<P>
   And thus lies the problem of minorities in ``white'' dramas _
writers can't seem to figure out exactly where they fit. It's why a
host of dramas, such as ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' never introduced
a regular black character and why ``Dawson's Creek'' seems to have
dropped one without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   You have to deal with race.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we'd do well to keep in mind the deeper origins of
this problem, that the power base of network television _ those who
make the decisions about who goes in front of and behind the camera
_ are almost exclusively white, and usually male.
</P>
<P>
   How odd it was to attend the Summer Press Tour recently and
watch each network president speak glowingly about diversity
efforts. But looking at the racial makeup of the executive
decision-makers positioned to move up through their corporate
pipeline, there was little to indicate that anything will change
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's a certainty that the segregated nature of TV executives and
producers has a rather chilling effect on what is programmed and
who is hired in an industry that is so powerful and influential
that its portrayals of groups and coverage of issues often
overshadow reality.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the profile of television producers and writers,
studio and network executives, and others running the industry
remains as exclusively white as it is today, alternative visions
from other groups will have a difficult time getting on air.
</P>
<P>
   Divergent views of comedy and drama will continue to be
marginalized, and people of color will largely remain trapped in
white reflections of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the black producers I've talked with would argue for
censorship or boycotts. That would only close off opportunities,
they say. But what they crave is balance, a chance to do a black
``Party of Five'' or a black ``Felicity,'' in which the characters
are struggling with sibling problems and in-laws, love pains and
resentments, like white characters do.
</P>
<P>
   The breathless advance notices for CBS' midseason series ``City
of Angels'' _ a black ``ER,'' I suppose _ is merely a reminder of
how few dramas there are about the black experience. But ``City of
Angels'' producer Paris Barclay is well-aware of the uphill climb
facing this series that has little to do with its quality. ``We
have so few projects addressing African-Americans,'' he said,
``that the tendency is going to be to expect us to address
everything. We'll have to deal with race in a certain way or we
won't be, quote, authentic, unquote. That's too much pressure on
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, a studio executive said that the small number
of people of color working in TV is ``a shame of our industry,''
but in saying that, he did not mean that white Americans are
incapable of producing programs enjoyed by minorities, or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Both minorities and whites working in the industry have track
records that prove the opposite. ``The atmosphere has done nothing
to encourage whites to write for shows with black characters or
blacks to write for shows with white characters,'' said producer
Yvette Lee Bowser, whose WB sitcom ``For Your Love'' features two
black couples and one white couple navigating different stages of
romance. ``TV will remain segregated as long as we aren't able to
come together and do multicultural shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Correction: TV will remain segregated as long as the networks
continue to turn to the same producers for shows. It's clear that
the TV industry is seemingly unable or unwilling to recruit and
fully employ minority men and women, many of whom would bring to
the job sensibilities and experiences quite different from the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of diversity is more than an issue of workplace equity
and fairness. Because the television industry creates images that
influence society's consciousness, the creators of those images
hold enormous power. Right now, those creators represent only a
limited segment of society; so aren't the stories they tell limited
as well?
</P>
<P>
   Today, the portrayals of minorities, and whites, too, are
created almost solely by white producers and writers. In such a
scheme, all viewers lose. White viewers lose because they rarely
see their reflection from someone else's eyes. In addition, they
are absorbing images of others that lack dimension and
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian viewers suffer
because the complexity and reality of their lives are distorted
into something that is unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the creative community, which often feels
beaten down by the weight of inequity. ``Whites will always have a
greater ease in navigating throughout the television industry,''
said Kathleen McGee Anderson, a black writer who is currently on
staff of Lifetime's ``Any Day Now.'' ``It belongs to them. It
doesn't belong to us. We do what we can in it and get what we can
out of it. But I've never felt that the sky was the limit in this
business because I'm a black female.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, networks are scrambling to add minority
characters to new and returning series this fall. Black and
Hispanic groups are planning to boycott network TV this fall,
hoping to force the issue. A few black producers have gotten new
deals to develop pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But I still find it difficult to be optimistic. Band-Aids rarely
do much for gaping wounds.

A GENERATION OF FILMMAKERS STUCK AT `PROMISING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: For release Sunday, Sept. 12.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the year's most auspicious film season approaches, at least
this is certain: the approach of the century's end will not go
unexploited by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer promotional chutzpah, it may be hard to beat the
trailer for ``Lost Souls,'' which uses sci-fi ominousness to
heighten its pitch: ``They had their 2,000 years,'' one character
declares. ``Now it's our turn.'' That will be one extra reason to
brace oneself for the movie onslaught this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a matter in which the M word is worth mentioning:
who will be the auteurs worth watching into the next millennium?
With the last great surge of filmmaking talent arriving in the
1970s, we have been in limbo for a long while when it comes to
newcomers who are capable of sustaining careers that are long and
varied, yet who are defined by their fundamental consistency.
</P>
<P>
   For every post-'70s filmmaker who has been able to establish
himself on those terms, from Spike Lee to Atom Egoyan, there have
been dozens who leave no creative fingerprints and seem chiefly
concerned with the short haul.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, this season will test the mettle of some recently
established filmmakers who just may turn out to have serious
staying power. David O. Russell's two previous films were so
assured, so outrageous and so different from each other that they
add up to a hard act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has made ``Three Kings,'' which is set at the end of the
Gulf War and apparently adds a new political edge to his already
impressive range. If he can move successfully from incest
(``Spanking the Monkey'') to delirious deadpan humor (``Flirting
With Disaster'') to a film that takes a critical view of U.S.
foreign policy, his offbeat early triumphs will not be mistaken for
beginner's luck.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thomas Anderson, the director of ``Boogie Nights,'' is at a
similar crossroads. Despite the stilted quality to ``Hard Eight,''
his first feature, Anderson made such a strong impression with the
vibrant neo-``Nashville'' panorama of ``Boogie Nights'' that his
forthcoming ``Magnolia'' warrants great anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Reuniting some of the ``Boogie Nights'' cast (Julianne Moore,
William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman) in a film that also
features Tom Cruise, Anderson will have an opportunity to establish
which of those early films was more representative of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   With its terrific cast and mordant kamikaze humor, Danny Boyle's
``Trainspotting'' made a bracingly strong impression, even if the
subsequent ``A Life Less Ordinary'' (both of which featured Ewan
McGregor) was more mean-spirited than exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Beach,'' he will take on another dark novel (by Alex
Garland) and another of the world's most magnetic young actors
(Leonardo DiCaprio), inviting lightning to strike again. ``The
Beach'' is sure to attract attention on the strength of its
DiCaprio factor. Perhaps the filmmaker's impact will be even more
compelling than that.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Minghella's adaptation of ``The English Patient'' was so
inspired that it established his intuitive brilliance almost
overnight. But once again, the triumph so wholly eclipses his
earlier work that it will be fascinating to watch his next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Ripley'' is another literary adaptation, from an
insinuating noir thriller by Patricia Highsmith, and it has the
kind of cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon) liable to make a
director look golden. And on the evidence of Minghella's skill with
actors in ``The English Patient,'' vice versa too.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's work varies tremendously, but it never falls short
of the surprising; this year's ``In Dreams'' was too inventively
spooky to pass for ordinary horror.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jordan, whose specialty is the drastic change of pace, has
adapted ``The End of the Affair,'' Graham Greene's novel, into what
promises to be a torrid romantic drama starring Ralph Fiennes and
Julianne Moore. Jordan has already made his mark as a serious,
enduring talent.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker who will be most conspicuously following in his
own footsteps is Frank Darabont. With ``The Green Mile,'' another
Stephen King adaptation, in the works after he brought such
eloquence and dignity to ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' Darabont
could well emerge as the kind of quietly durable filmmaker whose
craftsmanship and moral urgency are his strongest virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Lasse Hallstrom, whose ``My Life as a Dog'' was such an
idiosyncratic gem, and who turned ``What's Eating Gilbert Grape?''
into another coming-of-age classic, will try with ``The Cider House
Rules'' to adapt John Irving's novel into a nontreacly movie; if
anyone is up to the task, he's the one.
</P>
<P>
   And James Mangold, whose sensitive ``Heavy'' and ambitious
``Copland'' put him on the map, has filmed ``Girl, Interrupted''
with a fine cast of actresses (Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave,
Whoopi Goldberg, Angelina Jolie).
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' is only the first feature by Spike
Jonze, but its premise alone (unhappy filing clerk enters
Malkovich's mind) promises novelty and then some.
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Robbins, the strong, single-minded director of ``Bob
Roberts'' and ``Dead Man Walking,'' this time works on a big canvas
with his bustling 1930s tableau, ``Cradle Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those directorial heavyweights who have achieved landmark
status, they, too, will be taking chances this fall. Martin
Scorsese, working again with a screenplay by Paul Schrader (``Taxi
Driver,'' ``Raging Bull''), has made ``Bringing Out the Dead'' in
the pressure-cooker world of a New York City paramedic, with
Nicolas Cage as the man on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   And Milos Forman, with ``Man on the Moon,'' will raise the
question of why the comic Andy Kaufman, played by Jim Carrey,
should be the focus of an ambitious biographical film. Before
Forman's last stunning film arrived, that's what we wondered about
Larry Flynt, too.

MARQUAND WROTE THE SAME (GOOD) BOOK MANY TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Something to Say'' is the title of one of James Thurber's more
beguiling short stories _ about one Eliot Vereker, who has never
written anything but has what most people in his circle believe is
a keen mind. They support him financially and indulge his whims
because, after all, he has ``something to say'' and may someday be
an important author.
</P>
<P>
   Many authors less fraudulent than Eliot Vereker are held in
esteem by the literati, because they not only have something to
say, but have said it in print. The more serious-minded the author,
the higher the esteem. Indeed, esteem so high that the sympathetic
reader often fails to recognize the same message as replayed again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   Today's subject is not Thurber or Vereker, but John P. Marquand,
who wrote the same book many times. That really isn't unusual. Many
authors devise multiple variations on the same themes, because the
somethings they have to say are rather limited. It's an almost
perfect equation, however, because most readers, whether they know
it or not, want to read the same story over and over. Consider the
durability of the pulp romance novel. One could compose a romance
novel on a computer and edit the pilot draft 100 times, producing
100 different novels with only the names and places changed.
Readers addicted to the genre wouldn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't about pulp romances. In his day, Marquand was
recognized as a high-minded ``litteratus'' whose novels inevitably
topped the bestseller chart. It was a long and distinguished
career, but I'm not acquainted with anyone who reads Marquand
nowadays. His novels in their matched bindings (parallel horizontal
stripes all the way down the spine) are plentiful in used
bookstores, along with other bygone Book-of-the-Month Club
selections, apparently because their owners decided they weren't
worthy of retention on the home shelves.
</P>
<P>
   John Phillips Marquand (1893-1960) was born in Delaware but grew
up in Newburyport, Mass., and continued to live there in his years
of fame. From the early 1920s to the mid-1930s he delivered several
apprentice novels in the conventional romantic and melodramatic
genres, and simultaneously appeared in the popular magazines with a
score of detective yarns featuring Mr. Moto, a Japanese sleuth in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Marquand at 44 found his literary destiny. ``The Late George
Apley'' focused on a conservative Boston Brahmin in conflict with
the changing mores of modern times. This novel, lighter in tone
than its successors from the same cookie cutter, was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize for 1937, and deservedly so, for it's altogether
charming. Then, in succession, came ``Wickford Point'' (1939),
``H.M. Pulham, Esq.'' (1941), ``So Little Time'' (1943), ``E.F.'s
Daughter'' (1946), ``Point of No Return'' (1949), ``Melville
Goodwin, U.S.A.'' (1951), ``Sincerely, Willis Wayde'' (1955) and
``Women and Thomas Harrow'' (1958). Almost without exception, these
novels sound the theme of conformity vs. personal desire. The focal
character usually is an anguished male, a New Englander entering or
in midlife. Nor is ``B.F.'s Daughter'' really an exception, because
the husband figure has the same weakness of will that characterizes
Marquand's male protagonists, and the strongest portrait is of the
father figure, B.F. himself. ``So Little Time'' seems an exception
for being largely set in Hollywood, but it restates the condition
of a man _ in this case a screenwriter _ who has sold himself out
against his creative impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Marquand, though, should have been grateful to Hollywood.
``Apley'' and ``Pulham'' made fine films, ``B.F.'s Daughter'' was
OK (she was portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck at her man-crushing
best), and although ``Goodwin'' flopped as ``Top Secret Affair,''
the author pocketed $300,000 for the rights. There was also a
well-made ``B'' series with Peter Lorre limning Mr. Moto.
</P>
<P>
   Marquand's fame crested with ``Point of No Return,'' which was
successfully dramatized by Paul Osborn, with Henry Fonda in one of
his returns to Broadway. It may even be the author's ``best''
novel, but its theme _ a banker as an involuntary slave to
materialism _ was old stuff then.
</P>
<P>
   Should you read anything by John P. Marquand? Yes, if you
haven't already. The style is polished, the structure and
development are sound, and he does get inside his characters. It
hardly matters which one you pick. Read one, you've read 'em all.

MET'S AMERICAN WING CELEBRATES 75TH ANNIVERSARY WITH A YEARLONG
EXHIBITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I.)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  (DW) 
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A pioneer at the outset and a trendsetter ever since,
the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art has advanced
the nation's passionate interest in American art throughout most of
this century. Now, on Nov. 10, it will mark to the day the 75th
anniversary of its opening with ``Celebrating the American Wing:
Notable Acquisitions 1980-1999,'' a yearlong exhibition of American
paintings, sculpture and furnishings of the late 17th century to
the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The way the show will focus on these recent additions to its
American art collection, one of the finest and most comprehensive
in existence, is so understated that it seems a bit off the wall.
Yet it may portend things to come elsewhere. Virtually all of the
2,000 objects have been on view for months or years, surrounded by
the 12,000 others in the collection. Everything will be shown in
its usual place in the wing's 25 period rooms, 31 galleries and the
Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art. The new wrinkle
will be that the objects acquired since 1980 will be flagged by
bright blue stickers the size of silver dollars, and their wall
labels will be more detailed than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibition should be viewed as a treasure hunt,'' said
Morrison H. Heckscher, the curator of American Decorative Arts, who
organized the show with H. Barbara Weinberg, the curator of
American Paintings and Sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this do-it-yourself review of the American Wing
mirrors what museums _ and people, too _ do in educating themselves
as they amass collections. A check of the dates on the wall labels
reveals that most masterpieces were acquired at the peak of their
popularity: Duncan Phyfe and the federal style in the 1920s and the
Esthetic and Arts and Crafts styles from 1980 on. The dates also
show that gaps in the collection were filled whenever the
appropriate pieces were found.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Heckscher said that until recently he was unable to
illustrate fully how the 18th-century furniture forms that were
developed in Boston _ high chests, kneehole desks, secretaries and
the dressing tables called lowboys _ related to those that were
later adapted and changed significantly in Newport, with carvings
of shells, leafy knees and claw feet added.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, he got lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple who collect American furniture _ Yvette and Thomas
Cole _ invited me to select any piece in their collection for the
museum,'' he said. ``I chose a splendid, rare example of the one
important early form of Newport furniture not in our collection _ a
small, elegant dressing table from the 1740s, with sharply edged
legs and pointed pad feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The lowboy was the key piece that enabled him to rearrange the
gallery so that the similarities and differences between the pieces
from the two cities would be obvious. The blue sticker on the
lowboy calls attention to such distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Other objects with stickers were considered status symbols in
their day: a throne-like Great Chair of the late 17th century, a
mirrored silver centerpiece presented in 1825 to Gov. De Witt
Clinton of New York at the opening of the Erie Canal and a
Lincolnesque bust from 1874 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, depicting
William M. Evarts, a U.S. senator. Later works include a ravishing
1892 portrait by John Singer Sargent of Mrs. Hugh Hammersley, a
London beauty, and a massive iron door produced in 1927 by Samuel
Yellin for J. Walter Thompson, the New York advertising agency. The
show's dazzler is an album quilt patterned with 360 images of
tumbling blocks, each bearing a signature written on white silk.
The quilt was made by Adeline Harris Sears of Rhode Island, whose
persistence and family connections netted her the autographs of
illustrious statesmen, industrialists, artists and writers, among
them Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Horace Greeley, Ralph Waldo
Emerson and Harriet Beecher Stowe.
</P>
<P>
   Blue stickers will be most visible in the gallery of
late-19th-century objects, the only space in the American Wing that
has been enlarged and refurbished (opening on Oct. 19). The gallery
will be a repository for glowing stained glass windows by Louis
Comfort Tiffany, along with several Arts and Crafts gems _ Frank
Lloyd Wright vases, a Gustav Stickley tall clock and a George Ohr
earthenware vase.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant surprise there will be a Christian Herter cabinet,
exhibited for the first time since it was found _ blackened and
unidentified _ at a Boston-area auction in 1996 by Margo Johnson, a
New York dealer. The original gold-flecked painted ivory finish was
restored to the way it looked in 1883 in the drawing room of Oliver
Ames, a Boston industrialist.
</P>
<P>
   Today's American Wing is nearly nine times larger than it was at
its opening in 1924 and so imposing that people forget how daring
it was on completion: the nation's first permanent exhibition space
in an art museum for Early American decorative art. When the Wing
was dramatically expanded in 1980 to include the glassed-in Charles
Englehard Court, the collection was enlarged, adding American
paintings and sculpture as well as decorative art and architecture
from 1820 to 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take a look at where we are and what we're doing
so that we could move ahead,'' Heckscher said. ``We're planning for
a lot of changes to better display our treasures.'' Stay tuned.

WHITE HOUSE REBUFFS HILLARY CLINTON'S CRITICISM ON CLEMENCY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories.)   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House spokesman on Tuesday defended
President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican members of
a terrorist group in the wake of First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's criticism of presidential leniency.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart declined to directly
address Mrs. Clinton's objections but said the offer of
presidential clemency announced on Aug. 11 ``remains open'' until
Friday at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was ``not trying to avoid commenting'' on Mrs.
Clinton's criticism but instead was focusing on ``what I'm supposed
to do here _ which is talk about what the president's doing (and)
why he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton urged her husband on Saturday to cancel his offer
of clemency after the offer was widely criticized by law
enforcement groups and advocates of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans alleged that the president's clemency offer was
designed to win support among Hispanic voters for Mrs. Clinton's
possible bid for the U.S. Senate seat in New York. Mrs. Clinton's
expected rival for the Senate seat, Republican New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has called the clemency offer ``a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the offer should be withdrawn because the
convicted terrorists refused to meet the president's conditions for
early release or modification of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 were members of the Puerto Rican nationalist group that
carried out at least 130 bombings of political and military targets
between 1974 and 1983, killing six people and wounding scores of
others. The organization is known as the FALN, based upon the
Spanish acronym for Armed Forces of National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 members of the pro-independence Puerto Rican
organization was convicted of crimes stemming from individual
attacks that killed or injured people, according to deputy White
House chief of staff Maria Echaveste.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists have served at least 14 years for crimes such
as possession of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation
of a stolen vehicle or seditious conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency would require the convicts not only
to accept traditional federal parole restrictions on travel but
also to sign a document pledging to renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Clinton's offer, 11 of the 16 Puerto Rican
nationalists could be released from custody immediately. Two others
would remain in prison with shorter sentences. Three others would
have fines waived.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied the president's offer of clemency was designed
to benefit Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign in New York,
where Hispanics account for an estimated 2.6 million of the state's
population of 18.2 million, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House discussions of possible clemency began
at least two years ago, long before Mrs. Clinton began exploring a
possible Senate campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a partisan maneuver,'' Lockhart said. ``There
have been many who have sought to inject politics, and many who
have thought to inject a motive here, and all I can say is that
they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House lawyers' discussions of the clemency
offer with lawyers for the Puerto Rican prisoners do not constitute
``negotiations.''

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's criticism of the clemency offer has irked Puerto
Rican political activists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., said in an interview with the New
York Times published on Monday that he was withdrawing his support
for Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign because of her
``intervention'' in the White House clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy,'' Serrano
said. ``This is an action that will make people go out and make
sure that she's not our next senator. Maybe it's time to go out and
find out who else is interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican voters, the largest bloc of Hispanic voters in New
York, are a powerful constituency in New York state politics.
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, entitled to vote in congressional
and presidential elections, if they are living in the mainland
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., ousted incumbent Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., in New York's 1998 Senate race with the help of
Hispanic voters, including Puerto Ricans. Schumer carried 82
percent of the Hispanic vote, which accounted for 6 percent of the
statewide vote in 1998, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, New York City's mayor, carried 43 percent of the
Hispanic vote in his 1997 re-election drive during a contest in
which Hispanic voters accounted for 20 percent of the city-wide
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency for Puerto Rican nationalists is not new.
</P>
<P>
   Then-President Jimmy Carter pardoned four Puerto Rican
nationalists who were serving long prison terms following
conviction for a 1954 attack on the U.S. House of Representatives
that wounded four members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also pardoned a Puerto Rican nationalist convicted in a
plot to assassinate President Harry S. Truman in 1950.

 &HT;    `Get real' serves up lots of familial angst
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Get Real?'' OK, let's.
</P>
<P>
   A teenage boy comes home with his face bashed up because he was
knocked unconscious by a school bully. Mom says: ``Is there any
subtext to this fight you want to tell me about?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dad has his business partner over to dinner, after the
partner's wife has thrown him out for having an affair with one of
the L.A. Lakers' cheerleaders. The whole family is gathered at the
table as the betrayed wife bursts in, exposes her breasts to
everyone and screams at her cheating husband: ``Take a look at
these! This is real life!''
</P>
<P>
   And the live-in grandma, who's the voice of sage wisdom,
compares her late husband to a ``stallion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like reality at your house, right? There's nothing wrong
with ridiculous TV, but ``Get Real'' keeps reminding us how really
really real it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first major new fall series to debut (not counting UPN,
the ``Clueless'' network), and as if someone planned it, it's like
a one-stop-shopping overview of the entire fall TV season; what you
see here, you're going to be seeing again. These trends include a
blending of drama and comedy, lots of good-looking teenagers
getting all moody, and characters talking directly to the camera,
explaining their every thought to us. And, of course, sex. ``Get
Real's'' first scene, before the opening credits, is mom having an
orgasm. Top that, ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Green family veers between semi-functional and barely
coping. Mom (Debrah Farentino) is a professional party planner,
overwhelmed by her three closely spaced teens and rightly concerned
about her marriage. Dad (Jon Tenney) is so caught up in his work
he's oblivious to the family. Oldest daughter Meghan (Anne
Hathaway) is a brainy beauty who's chafing at following her
parents' plans; son Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen) is a
self-absorbed 16-year-old who's a walking (but not always talking)
babe magnet; and 15-year-old Kenny (Jesse Eisenberg) is still
developing, if he can keep from getting beaten up too often.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, particularly the always-great Farentino (``EZ
Streets,'' ``Storm of the Century'') are better than the material,
which is too often too cute, particularly when the teens talk to us
through the camera. ``You want everything tied up in a bow? Go
watch `7th Heaven,''' says Meghan, and the show also references
``My So-Called Life,'' ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``South Park,'' Alicia
Silverstone and Fonzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more obnoxious than self-aware teens,''
Meghan says in another breaking-the-fourth-wall moment, and oh, is
she right.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, and fun, to pick on ``Get Real,'' because it can be
so annoying. But it can also be honest and grounded, with emotional
connections among the characters that hint at depth. Creator Clyde
Phillips (``Suddenly Susan'') has an ear for adolescent dialogue
when he isn't trying so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' may have a case of pilot-itis, of trying too hard
to be different. There's potential here for a decent show if
everyone can settle down, get less cute and more real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real''

STILL A FEW STATE EDUCATION PROBLEMS TO SOLVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans put a high priority on education.
</P>
<P>
   Education accounts for the largest expenditure from the state
budget, and its administration at the state level is governed by a
small army of elected and appointed officials, including one
governor, 181 legislators, one state education commissioner and a
15-member State Board of Education. And they don't include several
thousand other policy-makers serving on local school boards and in
superintendents' offices in Texas' 1,000-plus school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The educational bureaucracy is rather top-heavy, to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
   The elected governor and the elected state lawmakers, of course,
belong at the top of any public state policy. And numerous state
boards and commissioners, most of them appointed, assist in
carrying out thousands of laws passed by the Legislature and signed
by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In most of those cases, however, the boards are appointed by the
governor, the commissioners are hired by the boards and everyone,
at least theoretically, is singing from the same page.
</P>
<P>
   The educational leadership is a different sort of animal _ a
two-headed animal.
</P>
<P>
   The state education commissioner, appointed by the governor,
heads the 800-plus employees at the Texas Education Agency, which
is charged with the day-to-day administration of the state's
educational policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas also has a 15-member State Board of Education, which
is elected independently of the governor and whose members don't
always agree with the governor, the commissioner or each other over
educational priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Political bickering on the board prompted the Legislature in
1995 to strip the panel of many of its responsibilities, including
any input into the selection of the education commissioner. Mike
Moses, who recently stepped down to accept a job at Texas Tech
University, was the first commissioner solely appointed by the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the board retains authority over curriculum standards, has
limited input over textbook selection and approves or rejects
applications for charter schools. It also oversees the Permanent
School Fund, a major source of public education funding.
</P>
<P>
   And the panel is an occasional source of potshots at the
education commissioner, prompted either by envy of the
commissioner's higher-profile role or by philosophical or political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Neill, a Republican board member from Fort Worth,
recently took a parting shot at Moses on the former commissioner's
last day on the job. Neill criticized Moses for developing a new
state skills test without the board's knowledge or consent.
</P>
<P>
   Moses denied the allegations. But his successor, James E.
Nelson, can likely expect similar messages whenever a board member
takes issue with one of his actions or simply wants to make a
political statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, in recent years, has had trouble deciding what
to do with the board, which has only three staff members of its own
and has to rely on research and other work conducted by the
commissioner's staff.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, as a key part of House Bill 72 reforms, lawmakers
abolished a 27-member, elected board, which had come to be viewed
as an obstacle to needed educational improvements. Legislators
replaced it with a smaller board appointed by the governor,
believing the governor's appointees could be better trusted to
carry out the Legislature's orders.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 law stipulated that the appointed board would be only
temporary and would be replaced within a few years by another
elected panel. But legislative leaders liked the appointed board so
much that they proposed keeping the panel appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice in a referendum, however, Texas voters
overwhelmingly said they wanted to elect board members, even though
most people don't even bother to vote in elections for their local
school boards, which have more impact on their educational tax
dollars than the state board does.
</P>
<P>
   The result is one of the most awkwardly constructed boards in
state government. The 15 members are elected from districts that
are twice as big as congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which now has a 9-6 Republican majority, has some
qualified, well-intentioned members. But since few Texans know
anything about the panel, the size of the districts also makes it
relatively easy for well-organized, single-interest candidates to
be elected. Social conservatives have been particularly successful
in winning election to the board, which offers a ready forum for
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the commissioner could do the board's job, some lawmakers
have toyed with the idea of abolishing the panel. But they haven't,
perhaps partly out of fear that some board members would paint them
as undemocratic, which they surely would.

WHITE HOUSE REBUFFS HILLARY CLINTON'S CRITICISM ON CLEMENCY DEAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House spokesman on Tuesday defended
President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican members of
a terrorist group in the wake of First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's criticism of presidential leniency.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart declined to directly
address Mrs. Clinton's objections but said the offer of
presidential clemency announced on Aug. 11 ``remains open'' until
Friday at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was ``not trying to avoid commenting'' on Mrs.
Clinton's criticism but instead was focusing on ``what I'm supposed
to do here _ which is talk about what the president's doing (and)
why he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton urged her husband on Saturday to cancel his offer
of clemency after the offer was widely criticized by law
enforcement groups and advocates of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans alleged that the president's clemency offer was
designed to win support among Hispanic voters for Mrs. Clinton's
possible bid for the U.S. Senate seat in New York. Mrs. Clinton's
expected rival for the Senate seat, Republican New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has called the clemency offer ``a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the offer should be withdrawn because the
convicted terrorists refused to meet the president's conditions for
early release or modification of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 were members of the Puerto Rican nationalist group that
carried out at least 130 bombings of political and military targets
between 1974 and 1983, killing six people and wounding scores of
others. The organization is known as the FALN, based upon the
Spanish acronym for Armed Forces of National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 members of the pro-independence Puerto Rican
organization was convicted of crimes stemming from individual
attacks that killed or injured people, according to deputy White
House chief of staff Maria Echaveste.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists have served at least 14 years for crimes such
as possession of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation
of a stolen vehicle or seditious conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency would require the convicts not only
to accept traditional federal parole restrictions on travel but
also to sign a document pledging to renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Clinton's offer, 11 of the 16 Puerto Rican
nationalists could be released from custody immediately. Two others
would remain in prison with shorter sentences. Three others would
have fines waived.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied the president's offer of clemency was designed
to benefit Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign in New York,
where Hispanics account for an estimated 2.6 million of the state's
population of 18.2 million, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House discussions of possible clemency began
at least two years ago, long before Mrs. Clinton began exploring a
possible Senate campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a partisan maneuver,'' Lockhart said. ``There
have been many who have sought to inject politics, and many who
have thought to inject a motive here, and all I can say is that
they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House lawyers' discussions of the clemency
offer with lawyers for the Puerto Rican prisoners do not constitute
``negotiations.''

<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's criticism of the clemency offer has irked Puerto
Rican political activists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., said in an interview with the New
York Times published on Monday that he was withdrawing his support
for Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign because of her
``intervention'' in the White House clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy,'' Serrano
said. ``This is an action that will make people go out and make
sure that she's not our next senator. Maybe it's time to go out and
find out who else is interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican voters, the largest bloc of Hispanic voters in New
York, are a powerful constituency in New York state politics.
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, entitled to vote in congressional
and presidential elections, if they are living in the mainland
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., ousted incumbent Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., in New York's 1998 Senate race with the help of
Hispanic voters, including Puerto Ricans. Schumer carried 82
percent of the Hispanic vote, which accounted for 6 percent of the
statewide vote in 1998, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, New York City's mayor, carried 43 percent of the
Hispanic vote in his 1997 re-election drive during a contest in
which Hispanic voters accounted for 20 percent of the city-wide
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency for Puerto Rican nationalists is not new.
</P>
<P>
   Then-President Jimmy Carter pardoned four Puerto Rican
nationalists who were serving long prison terms following
conviction for a 1954 attack on the U.S. House of Representatives
that wounded four members of Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a conceptual director, Martha Clarke is a creative
body in motion. On a recent morning in her airy Greenwich Village
apartment (many years ago the home of Marcel Duchamp), she was
brimming with activity. She was in the middle of casting ``Hans
Christian Andersen,'' her deromanticized Broadway musical version
of the 1952 movie. The show is planned for this season, and she was
still looking for an actor for the now misanthropic title role
(played in the film by Danny Kaye). The Irish playwright and
novelist Sebastian Barry, who is writing the new book for the
musical, had just arrived in New York on one of his periodic visits
to work with Ms. Clarke, and he had narrowly missed running into
Christopher Hampton on the stairway. Hampton had been there to
confer with Ms. Clarke about their projected Broadway version of
``The Blue Angel,'' a play with music based on the Marlene Dietrich
movie and the original Heinrich Mann novel.
</P>
<P>
   First in line for Ms. Clarke was ``Vers la Flamme,'' her
adaptation of five Chekhov stories, scheduled to run Wednesday
through next Sunday at the New Victory Theater as part of Lincoln
Center's Great Performers series. She was facing her usual long day
of appointments and telephone conversations about her diverse
projects. Were Chekhov to call, he would wonder what she was doing
to his classic stories. Well, Anton, it's like this....
</P>
<P>
   ``Vers la Flamme'' is an impressionistic interpretation of the
stories. As in her other work, it is an experiment in movement,
imagery, atmosphere and sound. In the show, Chekhov is seen but not
heard. There is only one word of dialogue, ``Olga,'' spoken by a
husband in an empty room in the story ``Enemies'' after his wife
has left him. In the cast are some of Ms. Clarke's favorite
performers, including Paola Styron, Margie Gillis, Felix Blaska and
George de la Pena, all of whom have made their own ensemble
contribution to the piece. Sofi, one of the director's two
Pomeranian dogs, is making her acting debut in ``The Lady With the
Lapdog'' in the Chekhov evening, and the other Pomeranian is the
understudy.
</P>
<P>
   When the 70-minute show had its premiere in April at Dartmouth
College, it was filled with striking images: snow seen fleetingly
through a window; a Monet-esque seascape signifying Yalta; an actor
climbing a wall as if fleeing into the sky painted on the ceiling
of the Michael Yeargan set. Since Dartmouth, Ms. Clarke has been
polishing the piece, adding and subtracting moments and movements.
In July, it was performed again at Jacob's Pillow.
</P>
<P>
   In the background as a throbbing motif is music by Alexander
Scriabin, more than 30 piano pieces played by Christopher O'Riley,
who is on stage with the actors. The title ``Vers la Flamme''
(``Toward the Flame'') comes from one of the Scriabin pieces.
Explaining its relevance, Ms. Clarke said: ``The Chekhov characters
always seemed to be hovering near a flame. They singe their wings
but they don't get burnt.''
</P>
<P>
   Scriabin was Chekhov's contemporary and thematic opposite, the
composer's sensuousness and volatility in direct contrast to the
writer's plangency: Scriabin the mystic, Chekhov the social
realist. The two are, Ms. Clarke said, ``odd bedfellows.'' With the
addition of the innovative director, this becomes a curious menage
a trois. For her, such a surprising juxtaposition is nothing new,
whether she is working in dance, theater or opera. Hers is often a
theater of opposites. Reading or watching Chekhov, she finds ``an
emotional fragility that's almost palpable _ like a fragrance.''
For Ms. Clarke, Scriabin fills in ``the subtext of Chekhov.'' In
other words, she is suggesting that if Chekhov had broken loose, he
might have had the obsessiveness of Scriabin.
</P>
<P>
   In her previous work, she has explored art, literature, history
and mythology, often at the same time. Beginning as a dancer and
choreographer, she sidestepped into the role of conceptual
director. She started with Kafka, then shifted to Heironymus Bosch
with her fabulistic tapestry, ``The Garden of Earthly Delights.''
After that, she reimagined the elegance and decadence of Vienna at
the turn of the century in ``Vienna: Lusthaus.'' She widened her
vision to include animal behavior and ecology in ``Endangered
Species.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Endangered Species'' received harsh reviews in 1990 and
closed precipitously at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, she moved to
London and focused on opera (in recent seasons, she has directed
Tan Dun's ``Marco Polo'' and Gluck's ``Orfeo'' at the New York City
Opera). Along the way, she collaborated with Hampton on a
psychological tracking of ``Alice in Wonderland'' (at London's
Royal National Theater). While diversifying her range, she has
remained true to her core, approaching texts and subjects as raw
material for dramatic transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In part, her explorations have been geographic. Tracing the
origin of ``Vers la Flamme,'' she said that she wanted to do
something Russian: ``Russia was in my blood and I was very drawn to
the turn of the century. That's probably when I had another life.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, she immersed herself in research, reading about
Chekhov and the Russia of his period. At the same time she culled
the stories, choosing those with which she felt a close connection
and deciding which best suited her actors. Ms. Styron had a
particular affinity with ``The Lady With the Lapdog.'' The
director, Ms. Styron and de la Pena talked about that story, and
then, wearing makeshift costumes, the actors began improvising
movements, with Ms. Clarke leading them into new areas.
</P>
<P>
   She said about her method: ``There's a tension involved if
you're taking an emotion like fear or anger and translating it
physically. Where other people will start with a rhythm of
language, I'll start with a natural reflex, or the dancers will do
some kind of turn, and we'll build from that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The stories deal with love, passion and betrayal. The characters
are highly strung people confronting crises, sometimes within a
moral context. One reason Ms. Clarke likes the stories, she said,
is that ``they nearly all end in ambiguity.'' For those unfamiliar
with the texts, it may be difficult to follow the narrative.
Occasionally, the director has faced irate theatergoers saying she
should insist that people read the synopses in the program before
seeing the show.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Clarke, the show should be received as if it were a
movie or a piece of music: ``I always felt that Fellini in `8{'
liberated our need to visualize and understand story. It's a bit
like stream of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Clarke was asked the perennial what-is-it question
about her work, she said, ``I'm not sure what it is.'' Then she
explained: ``I use dancers as actors and I direct as though I'm
using text. However, there is no text. It's all done through
movement and gesture _ and the chamber music is a very big
component.'' After an interviewer suggested that the piece was
dangerously close to silent film, Ms. Clarke asked, ``What's so
dangerous about that?'' Of course a silent film has titles, while
Ms. Clarke's work leaves audiences entirely on their own, reacting
to the direct stimulus of the performance. Her hope is that
everyone, including critics, will leave expectations at the door
and meet the work on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   About the difference between dance and movement, she said:
``Conventionally, people think of dance as dance vocabulary, based
on either a modern dance or a ballet idiom. In each piece I do, the
physical vocabulary is created for that piece and generally doesn't
make it to the next one. Obviously I have a style and a look. I
tend to think of it as minimal, because I don't like fat and I
don't like frills. Occasionally I'll sacrifice an absolutely
beautiful movement because I don't think it's really true to the
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the conversation, however, she admitted that she
repeated motifs, which become her equivalent of a dance vocabulary:
images, for example, are often seen through windows or open doors,
as in her version of ``Alice in Wonderland'' as well as ``Vers la
Flamme.'' She said that in the new piece ``we use a way of turning
that I had started but hadn't developed in `Vienna: Lusthaus' _ a
skating turn.'' There are other moments that she characterized as
``definitely Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   With each piece, she finds herself on the firing line:
``Obviously, one would rather be loved than burned at the stake,
but the truth is that I enjoy the process so much more than I did
when I was younger.'' Theater, or at least her branch of theater,
``is not for sissies,'' she said. ``It's like people say about old
age, you have to be prepared for humiliation. It's amazing to be 55
and to think that I can still make people upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has had a few fallow periods in her career, her
``garden'' is now full, and she can move freely from one performing
art to another. ``Hans Christian Andersen,'' which would be her
first Broadway musical, is a particular challenge. Replacing the
book of the upbeat Hollywood movie, but keeping the Frank Loesser
score and adding other Loesser songs, she wants to uncover the
darker, more complex side of the Danish storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a solitary writer,'' she said, ``who despised critics,
wept easily and had unfulfilled yearnings for unattainable women''
_ and he had an ambiguous attitude toward children. ``Sebastian and
I are trying to weave his true biography with the stories that seem
to come out of his life. In some ways, Chekhov is preparing me for
Andersen.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year she is bringing back ``Vienna: Lusthaus'' for a
national tour, and she is already committed to a project in St.
Petersburg in 2003, a piece based on Gogol. Confronted with the
chance for a new theatrical adventure, she says: ``This is
impossible. I'll do it.''

 &HT;    HOPES FADING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM THIS YEAR
 &HT;    650&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN and BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's little chance Social Security will be
reformed this year, and no agreement is likely until after the
November 2000 elections, advocates said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's dead for this year,'' said Michael Tanner, who
heads the Social Security privatization project for the libertarian
Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Max Ritchman, vice president of the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said Congress's attention
for the next few weeks will be focused on passing appropriation
bills and a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they're out of here until next year,'' he said. Reform
advocates have repeatedly said they do not believe the program can
be dramatically changed in an election year such as 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bixby, policy director of the bipartisan Concord
Coalition, called failure to reform the program, expected to run
out of money by 2034, a squandered opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one moment in time. It will never come around again,''
he said. ``It's a sore subject for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, White House chief of staff John Podesta did not
include Social Security in a list of priority issues this fall, and
the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee expressed dismay
Tuesday at that omission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will reconsider your reluctance to saving Social
Security this year, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a letter to
Clinton. ``As president, you must choose between employing your
powerful position and leadership to achieve real progress for
America's next generation or squandering those considerable assets
on political victories in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   While not responding directly to Archer's letter, Clinton
repeatedly mentioned the need to save Social Security in a speech
Tuesday in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to, first of all, think about the long-term welfare
of the country: save Social Security and Medicare; get the country
out of debt; invest what we have to do in education and other
things; then give the rest in a tax cut,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming Social Security this year has long been a top
administration priority. In last year's State of the Union message,
Clinton set out a timetable for action. He urged spending that year
talking about the need for reform and the various options, then
convening a high-level summit of congressional leaders and the
administration early this year to adopt a plan with bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Last year was spent in discussions, and
congressional leaders met for two days in December to discuss the
need for reform with Clinton, but the summit meetings to draft a
plan never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, essentially, was Monica,'' Tanner said,
referring to the scandal involving Clinton and former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky which led to the president's impeachment and
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was real opportunity last year,'' Tanner said, noting
that Clinton had indicated a willingness to accept some version of
private investment accounts as part of a Social Security reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
   After impeachment, ``the president was forced to shore up his
left wing,'' which opposes privatization, Tanner said. And after
the Senate trial this spring, ``Republicans became unable to do
anything controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Bixby traced the collapse of momentum to this year's State of
the Union address, in which Clinton advocated using the projected
federal budget surplus to finance the system into the middle of the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was, we were going to prepare the nation for
these hard choices'' involved with reducing Social Security
benefits, Bixby said. ``But then, having done all that, comes the
State of the Union address this year and you'd think that the whole
hard choices never existed. We're going to use budget surpluses to
fix Social Security. ... It totally took the wind out of Social
Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the Ways and Means
subcommittee on Social Security, said he expects his panel to vote
later this month on a reform proposal he and Archer offered in May.
The plan would use the budget surplus as well as personal
investment accounts to improve Social Security's earnings and
extend its financial life without cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is still a little bit of momentum,'' Shaw said,
but ``it's not a tidal wave of momentum at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he believes the administration and congressional
Democrats are split over whether to push for Social Security reform
now or use its failure as a campaign weapon against the
Republican-led Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said both parties are more likely to benefit _ and the
country will be better off _ if Social Security is reformed now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a joining in by the president in order to
go ahead with reform,'' Shaw said, later adding: ``I hope this
letter will shake loose some help.''

 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As it prepares for the opening of its new season, the
Martha Graham Dance Company has made a series of decisive moves
that it hopes will nourish and protect its founder's artistic
legacy and insure its own survival as a dynamic institution.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Protas, who succeeded Graham as artistic director on her
death in 1991, will step aside next year to devote himself full
time to running the troupe's new licensing program as well as to
the preservation work as the chief of the Martha Graham Archives at
the Library of Congress. He will continue to work with the company
as its artistic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Protas will be succeeded by Janet Eilber, a former Graham
principal who will take over the directorship in July. And Charlene
Nederlander, the theater producer and arts patron, has agreed to
lead the Graham board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to get out,'' Protas said. ``Two contiguous needs
have overlapped: my desires to have time to work with the Library
of Congress and to license Martha's work around the world. I've
been torn. I believe the Martha Graham Company needs to become more
institutionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   With Todd Dellinger in place since 1997 as the company's
managing director and with the arrival of Ms. Eilber, Protas said:
``I felt I could make this gesture. The missing element now is a
stronger board to support the vision that Todd and I and Janet have
crafted. Todd and Janet need much more support from the board than
they are getting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Protas said new members had agreed to join the board, among them
Lloyd E. Rigler, an arts patron who is the president of the Lloyd
E. Rigler-Lawrence E. Deutsch Foundation in Burbank, Calif.; and
the actress Vanessa Redgrave, who has invited the Graham company to
perform in shows she has organized in Kosovo this weekend. The
troupe's first performance is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Graham company moved from its home of many years
on East 63rd Street in Manhattan to downtown studios opposite the
Public Theater, leased from Musical Theater Works, and offices a
few blocks away. School registration is up, Dellinger said, and
both the junior and senior Graham companies are rehearsing there
for national touring through April. In May they plan to move back
uptown to new quarters on the old site.
</P>
<P>
   Eager young staff members seem to be everywhere, and the sound
of classroom piano music filters through the temporary
headquarters. Things seem to be looking up for the company, which
has endured years of financial instability.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the company's uptown headquarters to the developer
Benedetto Caiola, who agreed to provide the company and school with
studio and office space in a new building on the site, meant that
the Graham troupe could pay off its mortgage of $1.5 million and an
operating deficit of $400,000. But now, Protas said, it needs to
raise money for its day-to-day expenses. That is why, he said,
``I've been bringing in new board members with clout.''
</P>
<P>
   The new licensing program is intended to bring in money,
although he says he sees the project chiefly as a way of making it
possible for many more audiences to see the work and for the
quality of the productions to be overseen and preserved. Protas,
who owns the dances, established the Martha Graham Trust last year
to market the works.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on the Balanchine Trust with the assistance of Barbara
Horgan, its director, the Graham Trust leases dances to companies
and schools throughout the world and, for $1 a year, to the Graham
company itself. Prices otherwise vary depending in part on the
individual dances and on the length of the leasing contract, which
usually runs from two to three years. Companies also rent costumes
and sets from the Graham troupe or build their own with the Graham
designs as their guide and arrange for the rights to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my death the dances will go to a Martha Graham Foundation
that we are in the process of forming, which will have the mandate
to protect her name and property and to continue to lease the
works,'' Protas said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, Protas has made a point of icensing the
dances to ballet troupes rather than modern dance companies. One of
the most prominent companies is American Ballet Theater, which is
featuring Graham's ``Diversion of Angels'' in its City Center
season next month.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of crossover dance, even the venerable Paris Opera
Ballet has been delving into the mysteries of ``Grahamienne''
dance, as some of the performers call it, and what makes a move or
a gesture ``vraiment Graham,'' in performances of ``Temptations of
the Moon'' and the stark signature solo piece, ``Lamentation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at the Paris Opera Ballet wanted to do `Lamentation,'''
Protas said. ``It's only three minutes long. But they fell in love
with it once they danced it. It caught them emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Het National Ballet of the Netherlands has ``Acts of
Light,'' ``Embattled Garden'' and ``Errand Into the Maze.'' The
Colorado Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet will dance ``Appalachian
Spring.'' Julio Bocca has acquired ``Acts of Light'' and
``Diversion of Angels'' for his Ballet Argentino. And the ballet
company of the Teatro Municipal of Rio de Janeiro will dance
``Maple Leaf Rag.'' Five additional ballet troupes are negotiating
licensing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Protas, who shaped the project with Jane Hermann, a former
ballet director and producer who is now a vice president and
director of dance at ICM, says that ballet dancers may be better
able to perform Graham's choreography than modern-dance companies
not rigorously trained in the Graham technique, in part because of
the structure and discipline of ballet.
</P>
<P>
   There are some works he said he would hesitate to lease, among
them the playful ``Acrobats of God'' and the dark ``Herodiade,''
which Protas describes as difficult. ``And `Clytemnestra' would be
a challenge, but I would love to see it done by a ballet company,''
he said. ``Ballet has the tradition of prima ballerina assoluta.
Martha made many `assoluta' or star roles for women. But modern
dance did not produce so many women stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha felt that `Herodiade' revealed too much of herself.
Without the right person, the dance would fall flat.''
</P>
<P>
   The pieces will be staged by former Graham dancers like Takako
Asakawa and Kenneth Topping, who are working with Ballet Theater.
Ms. Asakawa will decide with the new dancers whether crash courses
in the Graham technique will be necessary. Protas says that not
only technique is important. ``These are works of such depth and
passion that they become melodramatic if they are not coached
properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers of today have been so exposed to the Graham
technique that it will not be all that unusual. It doesn't mean
that they will perform the works exactly as I or Martha would wish.
But as I said to ABT, as long as the spirit or the gist is there
the rest will come. These are works of such depth and passion that
they become melodramatic if they are not coached properly,'' Protas
said.

</P>
<P>
   Protas' conversation is filled with speculation on how to make
Graham's work live in a new time without violating its quality and
principles. To this end Protas has been envisioning ``the
definitive DVD of Martha's work'' at the Library of Congress. ``The
library is raising $6 million to film Graham technique for
distribution around the world, with the ballets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has been working with Ms. Asakawa and two former Graham
dancers, Pearl Lang and Yuriko Kikuchi, on a multi-media project
for the simultaneous teaching of Graham's technique, its changes
over the years and Graham's inspirations for elements in the
technique. He has also had talks with Robert Wilson about
``contemporizing'' Graham's work. ``Not changing Martha,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The works will stay the same. It's like Shakespeare. I'm not
saying we should update `Clytemnestra' to the 1940s and bring in
the Gestapo. But there are many versions of `As You Like It.'''

MIDDLE-AGED WRITER FINDS FAME EXORCISING DEMONS VIA FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Miss.)   (bl)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BAY, Ala. _ The trailer where Melinda Haynes found her
muse lies at the bottom of this state in the pine savannas where
sunlight and shadow mingle into a cool shade of dark jade.
</P>
<P>
   The ``manufactured home'' _ a term that Ms. Haynes considers a
more dignified description _ is not as big as a wraparound porch.
But it is roomy enough for the imagination of Ms. Haynes, a Baptist
preacher's daughter who at age 44 has written a first novel,
``Mother of Pearl.'' Her tale of small-town drama in 1950s Petal,
Miss., has transformed the circumstances of her life from the
trials of the trailer to the comforts of Country Living.
</P>
<P>
   The television signal for Oprah Winfrey's popular book club
discussions is too faint to reach her living room in Grand Bay, a
sparsely populated coastal community where reading groups are about
as plentiful as the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. But still
Ms. Winfrey found Ms. Haynes and featured ``Mother of Pearl'' as
her summer book selection, turning a novel with a modest first
printing of 6,800 copies into a best seller with 750,000 in print.
</P>
<P>
   The literary rush came with instant prosperity that had eluded
Ms. Haynes, who says she knows what it is like to see the lights
flick off because of an unpaid bill or to lose a home to
foreclosure. Since her success she has been able to pay cash for a
freshwater-pearl necklace for a beloved middle-school teacher and
for a five-bedroom house with black shutters, 10-foot ceilings and
three porches that are bigger than the trailer she will be leaving
soon. But her tender new confidence did not come as easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the book was going to be well received regionally,
and I was hoping there would be some ground swell,'' said Ms.
Haynes, who is barely 5 feet tall with close-clipped graying hair
and eyes the color of coffee beans. ``I never expected to sell more
than 20,000 copies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wrote the initial manuscript in a six-month burst
in 1997 from a back room in the trailer, where she would gaze out
on the night sky and confront yellow flies in season. Others had
urged her to plumb her life with all its dramatic tensions, but she
favored fiction, spiced with many of her emotions and anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   At night, after finishing her day job as a production manager at
The Catholic Week newspaper in Mobile, Ms. Haynes said she
retreated to her computer, where characters emerged in 1950s Petal,
the setting for her own early childhood. ``Mother of Pearl''
explores the friendship of Even Grade, a 28-year-old black man who
did not know his family, and Valuable Korner, a 15-year-old white
girl born to the town harlot who is probably better off without
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Haynes spent most of her life in Mobile, she placed
her novel 85 miles west in the Mississippi towns of Petal and
Hattiesburg because, she said, ``it was the first place I began to
feel different.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as she writes about a palette of brown shades in the river
Leaf _ 10-minute tea, steeped-too-long tea, barely tea, wet bark,
sun-baked bark, old-as-sin bark _ Ms. Haynes said she grew up with
anxieties and panic attacks that came in exotic hues and varieties.
</P>
<P>
   There was her fear of the second coming of Christ, a vision that
she took to heart from her fundamentalist upbringing. And in later
years she added new layers: fear of public speaking, fear of
crowds, fear that her ``pyloric valve'' would burst. (This last
anxiety was based on conversations overheard as a child about her
grandfather's esophageal cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   The first panic attack came during a seventh-grade math class,
she said, describing an electrical sensation that started in the
back of her neck and spread, stealing her breath away. While her
counselor advised her parents not to overreact to subsequent
attacks, Ms. Haynes said, they continued and she grew to dislike
school so much that she would ride the bus there, then turn around
and walk home. By 11th grade she left high school and was tutored
for a year to earn a diploma. She said she never went to college
because she had another fear: she wouldn't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that all of her anxieties finally found a release in
her writing,'' said Ms. Haynes' mother, Patricia Braswell, a
schoolteacher who with her husband, Richard, split from the Baptist
church and helped form a charismatic church and religious academy
in Mobile. ``It's like her characters began to experience all the
things that she's experienced herself. I think this has been a
healing thing for her. She has always been sensitive. When she was
little, she didn't want us to leave her. She was afraid we would
lose her in the library.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 18, Ms. Haynes made a choice that started her slide
down from the middle class. She married a minister's son in a union
that she said grew out of another anxiety. She thought she was
pregnant, but she wasn't. The marriage collapsed after 19 years and
three children and financial burdens that led to bankruptcy and
what Ms. Haynes delicately describes as her ``crash'': a suicide
attempt through an overdose of antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Through those years she helped support her family by painting
portraits in oil and watercolors, but she put down the brush after
the suicide attempt. The vivid colors did not emerge again until
she took up writing in the mid-1990s after converting to
Catholicism and marrying a retired marine, Raymond Haynes, who
liked to say that she wrote like a tall woman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haynes, always a passionate reader of Southern writers like
Eudora Welty and William Faulkner, said her new husband set up a
computer for her and encouraged her to write and ultimately to
publish her first two short stories, which included a tale about an
elderly black woman, Joody Two Sun, who later took up residence in
her novel as a mysterious seer.
</P>
<P>
   With her characters, Ms. Haynes confronted her own fears. She is
afraid of bridges, so she placed one character in the middle of a
span between Hattiesburg and Petal. Later she traced his fictional
footsteps on the same bridge. ``They say you can only teach what
you need to learn,'' Ms. Haynes said about the writing that became
a journey of sorts. ``I wrote what I needed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband secretly sent her short stories to The Crescent
Review, a journal that he discovered by thumbing through copies of
Poets and Writers magazine for potential outlets for her work. The
journal prompted the couple to send early chapters of ``Mother of
Pearl,'' then called ``Even Grade,'' to a New York literary agent,
Wendy Weil, who was the subject of a profile that noted that she
read unsolicited manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often say this little prayer when a manuscript comes in
unannounced,'' Ms. Weil said. `` `Please stay good. Please stay
good.' And they don't always, but this one stayed good. She has
this wonderful ear for language and this big heart and sense of
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Hyperion bought the book for about a $100,000 advance
in April 1998, which gave Ms. Haynes enough of a cushion to quit
her day job to write full time. With the halo from Ms. Winfrey's
book club, Ms. Haynes' royalties could easily climb to more than
$1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden literary celebrity has brought her attention around
Mobile, where she has made bookstore appearances and lectured. For
these engagements she rehearsed at home with a small podium and
microphone that her husband built to ease her fears of public
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama her book has generated everything from unabashed
pride to mixed reviews. The Mobile Register featured Ms. Haynes in
two front-page stories, but its book review editor took the rare
step of publishing a negative and a positive review of ``Mother of
Pearl'' after the first reviewer panned the novel, complaining
among other things that it was long-winded and meandering with
slang and wording that often seemed inauthentic for the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mixed feelings about this book,'' said John Sledge,
the Register's book editor. ``There are people who think it's
problematic and difficult, but yet there are other people who are
moved by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Roy Hoffman, in The New York Times Book Review,
described Ms. Haynes' language as ``profuse and vigorous'' as the
kudzu vine, providing a portrait of a Southern town that ``still
has its edgy charm.'' He continued: ``Summer here may be
sweltering, but there's enough going on to keep the beauty parlor
abuzz. And Haynes will surely be one of the last authors of this
century to take us back to the small-town South of its middle
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Haynes' circle of family and friends, readers have come
away with varying interpretations, particularly because their
experiences and anecdotes sometimes seeped into the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Richard Braswell, marveled at the power of her
observations and poetic descriptions of a familiar river in
Mississippi but confessed some shock at her occasional use of
``vile language.'' Her parish priest, the Rev. Louis Russell Biven,
who inspired a character who is also a Catholic priest and named
Russ, found the book ``certainly insightful, careful and
precious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was bold, this little gal writing this book,'' he
continued. ``And that it would be published, and people would be
reading it, it absolutely amazed me. I always thought she was
bright and talented.'' But he added, ``I can't say I understood the
book entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haynes is working on a second book for Hyperion, tentatively
titled ``Chalktown.'' But for now she is devoting more time to
promoting ``Mother of Pearl.'' (Her second appearance on Ms.
Winfrey's show is scheduled for tomorrow.)
</P>
<P>
   With the windfall of publicity, Hyperion is sending Ms. Haynes
on a tour of bookstores from New York to San Francisco, a literary
ritual that forces her to conquer yet one more anxiety: fear of
flying.

BREAST IMPLANT CONTROVERSY FAR FROM OVER
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Sept. 14)  
(nk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman with new implants was raving over her new breasts like
others do over the perfect haircut and fitting into a smaller jeans
size. She doesn't want to hear that there could be trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She's a mature woman and this is something she chose after
nursing three children took a toll on her body image. It's her
body. Maybe she and her new breasts will live happily ever after.
But who knows. There are skeptics out there like former implant
wearer Jody Fischer who think they all eventually fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet she doesn't go to her grave with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest salvo in the breast implant debate sounded this
summer when a government-requested study concluded that silicone
implants don't make women seriously ill. Implants can rupture and
lead to infections or scarring, but they do not cause lupus,
arthritis and other systemic diseases, said a panel of 13
scientists for the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dow Corning _ which had to file for bankruptcy
because of the number of breast implant lawsuits against it _ has
agreed to pay $3.2 billion to 400,000 American women with silicone
implants. This should be the end of it, say some. Not for the women
who hurt, say others.
</P>
<P>
   Some women will go away with money in their pocket _ an amount
still to be determined by a judge _ but it may not be enough to
live on, says Fischer, 68, of Santa Rosa, who is ready ``to stir up
something.''
</P>
<P>
   She's part of the global suit against Dow and worries, ``We'll
get patted on the head, given a little and told to go away.'' She
thinks she'll have to keep pushing for fair and adequate
compensation and, just in case, she's kept the evidence. Parts of
the implant that her doctor fished out of her body are stored in
preservative in a container in her garage.
</P>
<P>
   Jody can't stand the idea that people think the implant
controversy is dead and that women should be ashamed for ever
making a stink. When she heard a late-night talk show host calling
women like herself fraudulent, she literally sprang from her bed
and began writing letters to the media, government officials and
every former implant wearer.
</P>
<P>
   Jody had her first silicone implant in 1978 after a mastectomy
for breast cancer. It never felt right. Four years later her doctor
replaced it with a second silicone implant. Ten years later the
tissue became inflamed and swollen and a hard casing formed around
the implant. Her doctor removed it and Jody said silicone was found
embedded in her right breast tissue and chest wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jody feels like a ``sick test animal,'' and says, ``I recovered
from breast cancer, but I can't recover from silicone.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the studies say _ and this last one is considered
pretty definitive by medical writers _ there are hundreds of
thousands of implanted women with matching symptoms, who have
lupus, arthritis, fatigue and memory problems. Jody has had bouts
with all of them, which forced her to quit the real estate job she
loved. ``I used to be very high energy and highly organized. For
women like me there is no controversy over implants.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others still see new breasts as what they need to turn their
lives around.
</P>
<P>
   A good economy is said to be good for the cosmetic surgery
business, and breast augmentation is still on a lot of wish lists.
It's the most common cosmetic surgery for women ages 19 to 34.
Teen-age girls request them for graduation presents. You can buy
them on the installment plan. And even though many now choose
saline implants, which are presumed to be safer than silicone, the
National Women's Health Network says there's no research on the
long-term safety and effects of saline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish women could learn to be satisfied with what we have,''
says Jody. The chances of which are probably even less than her
getting enough from Dow to stop writing letters.

FIRST RUSHES OF A HOLLYWOOD SLOW-DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  
(DW) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Someone contemplating the list of films for most
recent movie seasons might have been forgiven for wondering whether
Hollywood had a hole in the bottom of its ideas bucket. Strip away
the sequels, pare away the remakes, ignore the big-screen versions
of television chestnuts, discard the book adaptations and the
(increasingly rare) play adaptations and often there was not much
left.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the anxiety in Hollywood over recent waves of cost
cutting at the studios _ some making fewer movies, others sharing
the risk of big productions between a pair of studios or between a
studio and an independent production entity, much of the digital
filmmaking being done outside the Hollywood orbit in San Francisco
and elsewhere, shooting more and more films in Canada or New
Zealand or any place cheaper than Hollywood, asking whether that $3
million shot of a tanker ship exploding is really necessary to make
the audience happy _ and there is a very real sense of unease here.
People wonder whether Hollywood will still make offbeat and
sophisticated films, or even survive as anything more than a
financing source and distribution-and-marketing service for other
peoples' risky visions.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, bent and twisted by all of these financial,
technological and artistic pressures, is clearly in the process of
becoming something else, but becoming what? It's a guessing game.
But perhaps we are beginning to see, with this year's fall and
holiday lineup, just what kinds of movies Hollywood studios and the
major independents are going to be making in response to all of the
corporatizing and cost-cutting and hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   To this newcomer to Los Angeles _ and a newcomer to the task of
covering movies and the movie industry _ this sense of creative
unease and financial anxiety seems to seep into every conversation.
Yet more than 30 recent interviews with studio executives,
producers, writers, directors and, yes, bean counters reveals a
growing, if sometimes tentative, hope for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed remarked, sometimes with apparent
wonder, how good much of this year's fall and holiday lineup looks.
Of course, they're paid to say things like that, at least about
their own films, and there is always a certain amount of
breast-thumping about any approaching movie season, leading to
inevitable speculation about how such a period of cost-cutting
could have produced such a roster. When the bean counters come in
and the budgets go down, shouldn't the movies suffer?
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the films are still in the finishing stages,
others have begun to make the rounds either in final form, in rough
cuts or in small snippets screened for a select handful. ``This
fall looks much stronger to me than last fall,'' said Mark Gill,
president of the Los Angeles division of Miramax Films, whose
``Shakespeare in Love'' won the Best Picture Oscar last year.
``Just look at the range of films, how many more things there are
that appear to be genuine Oscar contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the season has its share of sequels (``Scream 3''),
remakes (``The House on Haunted Hill''), long-running series (``The
World Is Not Enough,'' the 19th and latest James Bond adventure)
and more than a dozen book adaptations, the evidence also shows
that despite fears that cost cutting would make studios timid and
shave the sharp edges from quirky films, the reality is oddly
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a surprisingly unpandering-to-the-mainstream
movie season coming up,'' is the way Amy Pascal, president of
Columbia Pictures, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Hollywood had just one film (``Jerry Maguire'')
among the five contenders for the Academy Award for best picture.
This year, that will not be the case, executives vow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are back,'' said Stacey Snider, co-chairman of
Universal Pictures. ``That's the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the beginning of almost every movie season _ especially
the fall and holiday season, when so many movies are pitched toward
older audiences and Oscar voters _ seems to promise more joy than
it eventually delivers. The financial anxiety at the studios may be
creating a bumper crop of wishful thinking. But even if half of
these films turn out to be turkeys, it will still be a formidable
roster.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to assess those films they have seen _ in either
finished form or rough cut or in sufficient clips for them to make
what they consider a sound judgment _ or those films about which
they have heard detailed descriptions in the etherlike buzz on
which Hollywood floats these days like a hydrofoil, those
interviewed came up among them with a list of more than a dozen
films that they believe will be fighting it out for the top Oscar
nominations early next year. (Note: when asked this question,
almost everyone of course mentioned either their own film or the
films from their studio; all such votes were discounted.)
</P>
<P>
   The films mentioned most frequently (that is, by more than 10 of
those interviewed) were ``The Green Mile,'' the director Frank
Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's Death Row tale starring Tom
Hanks; ``Three Kings''; David O. Russell's story of three GI's
searching for buried loot in the waning days of the Gulf War; ``The
Talented Ripley,'' Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Patricia
Highsmith's classic dark thriller; ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann's
retelling of the clash between a tobacco industry whistle-blower, a
``60 Minutes'' producer and the forces of big tobacco and big
media; ``The Hurricane,'' Norman Jewison's film starring Denzel
Washington, and ``American Beauty,'' the theater director Sam
Mendes' inaugural Hollywood effort, about the emotional damage
caused when a married man develops an infatuation with one of his
teen-age daughter's young friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad _ if it's true _ for an industry that sometimes sounds
like it's on life support.

HOLLYWOOD: life support.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of the movie business' financial woes, particularly in
the last several years as top star salaries rose above $20 million
and production and marketing costs also soared, is like an old,
favorite set of worry beads that Hollywood people like to finger in
the gathering gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town has become much more cost-conscious,'' said Robert G.
Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. ``We
have become aware over time that the economics of the movie
business are tougher and tougher, and the only way to make that
better is to make your movies cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can this possibly translate into better films?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it results in new voices and new ideas and new ways to
tell stories in a way that's actually really exciting,'' Ms. Snider
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that something happened over the last several
years; the cost of making a movie has skyrocketed, both because of
higher salaries for the top actors and directors and other ``above
the line'' talent and for the physical, ``below the line'' costs of
actually making the film. The old formulas (star-studded big-budget
explosion pictures, for instance, built on macho images and
paper-thin characterizations) don't work reliably enough to be
worth the money they cost, and even a summer as successful as the
one just passed, with more than a half-dozen movies surpassing $100
million at the box office, isn't enough for the studios to turn a
sufficient profit to satisfy their corporate bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is broken,'' said Bill Mechanic, chairman of 20th
Century Fox. ``The business fell apart when the budgets of pictures
went running sky high.'' The only answer, he and others said, is to
cut costs, so that's what the studios, to varying degrees, have
been trying to do. While a few stars will earn astronomical fees,
secondary stars are earning less (``the $10 million sidekick,'' is
how one insider put it), and the studios are always on the lookout
for cheaper, younger talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of a movie is too high to recoup its investment,''
Mechanic said. ``A film that used to be $15 million is now pushed
up to $50 million, but the return is the same as if you'd made it
for $15 million. It means you're only going to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some filmmakers and studio executives said they believed one
reason the coming season looked to be strong was that in order to
get top-name actors and directors to work for less than their
normal fees, producers were pushed toward the kind of projects that
such artists would find appealing rather than those projects that
the studios' marketing departments might find appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will attract people to do it for less
money is something that's more interesting in terms of material,''
said Mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that is driving the studios toward finding new
voices and richer films is the perception that the audience is
revolting against the familiar and the formulaic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something happening out there,'' Mechanic said.
``People have just rejected seeing the same thing time in and time
out. It's a rejection of the mainstream, in a way, of the same old
way of telling stories. I mean, they're booing trailers out there
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of having fewer films in the pipeline won't be
felt until around the middle of next year, executives say. Projects
that might have been made in the past will hit a brick wall, unless
their makers can come up with a way to do it cheaper. ``I think
we'll find that the holes in the sieve are getting smaller,'' said
Dick Cook, president of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group.
</P>
<P>
   All of the filmmakers interviewed said they had felt the
economic crunch at the studios in one fashion or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a film that's off the beaten path, there's an
enormous amount of pressure to make it for a price that makes sense
to the studio,'' said Sydney Pollack, whose romantic drama ``Random
Hearts'' opens next month with Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott
Thomas. ``It costs so much money to market a film today, the
advertising costs and the marketing costs are often times more than
the cost of the negative. That would have been heresy 20 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone, whose gritty football drama, ``Any Given Sunday,''
will open on Christmas Day, has noticed the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eternal battle that goes back to the beginning of the
movie business, but certainly it's getting tougher,'' Stone said.
``I liken our jobs, that of the film's director and its marketing
director, to co-directors these days. They both spend sometimes the
same amount of money. The marketing director has enormous power
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the directors, the change has been not so much in
the drive to save money as in the growing sense that a corporate
mind set is taking over the studios. All of the major Hollywood
studios are now owned by larger conglomerates, for which the movie
business is just one segment of a multi-faceted business empire,
and the recent appointment of several top executives who were seen
as more from the corporate side than the creative side has also
increased some filmmakers' wariness.
</P>
<P>
   Lasse Hallstrom, whose adaptation of John Irving's novel ``Cider
House Rules'' is due for release on Dec. 10, said he had given up
trying to understand. ``I am not as well educated as I ought to be
about all of the financial side of the movie business,'' he said.
``It's still a mystery to me, what happens behind those closed
doors. You're always trying to find someone who has the
responsibility to make a decision, but it is sometimes impossible.
All these mysterious reasons, and you never get to the truth of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been at it longest feel the corporate creep more
strongly. ``The big change for me as a filmmaker, making films
since 1961, is that I used to be able to get an answer on stories I
wanted to tell as a filmmaker very quickly,'' said Norman Jewison,
whose film about the incarceration and eventual exoneration of the
boxer Ruben Carter, ``The Hurricane,'' is set for an Oscar-aimed
limited release on Dec. 29. ``Over the last 10 years it's become
more and more of a corporate decision. You get the feeling that
some of these people think that they are making a product. Good
films have never been a product. They are individual statements of
their makers, pieces of a very, very fragile vision. I have never
felt there was any equation between money and art.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the studio executives just shrug off these kind of
complaints. ``Movies have always been a business,'' one said. ``We
have all decided to go into a very expensive art form; we didn't go
into finger-painting or poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle is this: There were fears that when studios responded
to this _ and to increased pressure from higher-ups in the
corporations that own all of the studios _ there would be a rush to
the mainstream, seasons of little more than sequels, formulaic
comedies, teen-age sex romps and remakes of every television show
ever made. How then to explain this coming season?
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like it's going to be a good final quarter,
maybe even a great one,'' said one producer and former studio boss.
``And it's coming on the heels of a very lucrative summer, when
there were successful movies all over the place, in almost every
genre. But people still feel uneasy because, no matter what they
tell you, they really don't know what's coming next.''

TELLING THE STORY OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  
(mk) 
 By CHARLES STRUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A word to the National Endowment for the Humanities,
corporate underwriters like Chase, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting and viewers like you: Ric Burns is running out of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining. It's just that as his production
company, Steeplechase Films, grows into a purveyor of ever-larger
documentary sagas _ from an hour to three hours to 10 hours and
more _ the need for Lebensraum increases. But public television
budgets and the Upper West Side of Manhattan being what they are,
Steeplechase now operates out of two small suites in two separate
buildings a block apart, off 72nd Street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said for this cordon sanitaire,''
Burns said, referring to the production team in one building, the
editing team in another and the artistic negotiations that can
create occasional friction. Especially now, in the frenzied final
weeks of assembling Burns' most ambitious solo work to date, ``New
York,'' an admiring portrait of the city from Henry Hudson's
arrival, in 1609, to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years in the making, ``New York'' is 12 hours in
six equal parts, or as Burns puts it, the story of Prometheus
retold from era to era. The first five parts will be broadcast in
November (Sunday through Thursday, Nov. 14-18, 9 p.m.). A sixth
episode, scheduled for the spring, will focus on the last 60 years
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   When Burns' co-writer, James Sanders, an architect and
historian, and his co-producer, Lisa Ades, sat down at the start of
the decade to map their plans, it quickly became clear that New
York was indeed Promethean. It had also proved to be a city
perpetually engaged in creative destruction _ the process of
tearing down the old and rebuilding, in many cases, bigger and
better.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate harbor, the ultimate trading post, the
ultimate real estate deal and, most important, a crucible of
democracy and capitalism like no other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the simple core of the story, stealing fire from the
Gods,'' Burns said. ``This city in the New World, from the very
beginning, felt that there was no enterprise too lofty, too
difficult for human beings not to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 19th century, in a particularly intense way,'' he said,
``the powers that were previously thought to be _ metaphorically
anyway _ divine came within the grasp of human beings, transforming
the physical, political, social and cultural shape of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like the kitchen sink approach, it is. It's also
the quintessential Burns approach. Why compose a short story when
you can film ``Middlemarch''?
</P>
<P>
   The son of an anthropologist, Burns, 44, is a polymath with a
narrative mission, at 24 frames per second. His conversation
bristles with literary references and allusions, as befits a former
doctoral student at Columbia University. In his dissertation, he
said, he intended to trace the nature of revolutionary ideas in the
19th century and, at the same time, ``bring all the qualities of
modern literature into focus _ Carlyle, Flaubert, Dickens, Rimbaud
_ in explaining the transformation of cultural, political and
social authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he fell in step with his older brother, Ken, and helped
to produce the 11-hour 1990 PBS series ``The Civil War.'' That was
the end of the dissertation, but the start of even more research
that led him to documentaries like ``Coney Island'' (the name
Steeplechase Films is derived from Coney's famous amusement park)
and ``The Donner Party.'' Even now, he has begun work on a
three-hour film about Eugene O'Neill, collaborating with O'Neill's
biographers Barbara Gelb and her husband, Arthur, a former managing
editor of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   On his decision to switch to film, Burns seems to harbor few
doubts: ``I could have spent 50 years as an academic writing four
books for an audience of 3,000 or a life spent telling stories for
a larger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping through the office's dormlike clutter, Ms. Ades, whose
next project is the history of the Miss America Pageant, remarked,
``We're all hunter-gatherers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiding out at the New-York Historical Society, Ms. Ades
(pronounced AD-us) pored over uncounted thousands of prints and
photographs. ``What keeps me awake at night is thinking that I
might have missed one.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans of Burns brothers documentaries, the format will be
familiar: passionately written but with low-key narration.
Interspersed with contemporary video of New York are close-ups and
pans of etchings, paintings and historical maps as well as early
photographic stills; original musical themes repeated in rhythms
and keys both joyful and mournful; and the voices of actors and
writers breathing life into the words of those who watched or
commented on history as it was being made.
</P>
<P>
   There are also ``witnesses,'' contemporary experts whose
comments amount to a Greek chorus on the theme. They include Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Martin Scorsese, Ada Louise
Huxtable, E.L. Doctorow and Fran Lebowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Stern compared the city to the greatest fireworks you ever
saw,'' Burns said, referring to the architect Robert A.M. Stern.
``Out of each cascade comes yet another, higher, higher and louder
still. Narratively, this aspect of the city's history is a gift. At
each stage along the way it seems to be saying, `You ain't seen
nothin' yet.' And you haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this bit of synthesis. ``When New York was founded at
the dawn of the modern age,'' says the narrator, David Ogden
Stiers, ``London and Paris were already 1,500 years old; Rome and
Beijing, 2000; Jerusalem, 4,000. And yet somehow, in the centuries
to come, the tiny colony on the edge of the world would rise to
become the greatest city on earth _ the undisputed cultural and
economic capital of the world _ and the supreme laboratory of
modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What follows is stunning, though not because New York turns out
to be unique in all the ways he and others say it is. It's that the
New York story, from raunchy Dutch trading post to luminous global
icon, seems to be all of a piece these last 350 years. The more it
changes _ and New York is forever changing _ the more it stays the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City was founded by the Dutch,'' says Brendan Gill,
the New Yorker writer and preservationist who died in December
1997. ``The Dutch didn't give a damn about anything except making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   New York _ crowded, dirty, noisy, disorganized and often violent
_ was home to more people of more different ethnic and religious
backgrounds than anywhere else. Yet its blend of frontier democracy
and greed acted as a growth hormone of frightening power. It still
does.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on Gill's terse observation, John Steele Gordon, a
historian who has written the ``Business in America'' column in
American Heritage magazine for the last 10 years, said: ``New York
was founded for no other reason than to make a buck. The Puritans
came to New England to worship God as they saw fit. The Catholics
came to Maryland, the Quakers to Pennsylvania. The Dutch came to
Manhattan to get beaver skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so devoted were they to making a profit,'' Gordon said,
``that they didn't get around to even building a church for 17
years. And ever since, you know, however big the city has gotten,
somewhere deep in its soul it is always New Amsterdam. Where modern
capitalism was invented.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything right down to the Manhattan street grid, adopted in
1811, seems in retrospect to have been designed uncannily to propel
the city into yet another era of growth, prosperity and power.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just 200 years after the city's founding, DeWitt
Clinton proposed what Stiers, the narrator, describes as a
``363-mile-long ditch that if completed would transform forever New
York's relation to the entire American continent'': the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
   When it was completed in 1825, ``it made New York the only
American city that connected Europe on one side with the heartland
of the continent on the other,'' Stern, the architect, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that has been New York's strength ever since,'' he
continued. ``It still is the major port of entry and transfer point
for people flying from Europe to the rest of the country. You see
New York, and then you see America.''
</P>
<P>
   What you really see, Burns said, is something he recalled from
Ezra Pound, writing about the city in 1913. He recited it from
memory:
</P>
<P>
   ``And is New York the most beautiful city in the world? It is
not far from it. No urban nights are like the nights there. I have
looked down across the city from high windows. It is then that the
great buildings lose reality and take on magical powers. ...
Squares and squares of flame set and cut into the ether. Here is
our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.''

military are carrying out a planned and organized campaign of
terror that involves widespread killings, arson and the forced
evacuation of tens of thousands from the remote territory of
800,000 people. What is not clear is what the campaign is meant to
achieve and what degree of control the government in Jakarta has
over the people who are carrying it out. By Seth Mydans.

 &HT;    Deal may have big impact on wireless networkingBy Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Wireless Networks has landed what could be a
breakthrough deal in which British Telecom next year will sell the
Norcross, Ga. company's systems for connecting devices in houses
and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from the deal, culminating a year-long joint development
effort, are expected to reap more than $50 million in the United
Kingdom, according to BT. There is no guarantee that those
projections will be met, but reaching them would dramatically
recast Home Wireless, far outstripping revenues thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is exceedingly important to Home Wireless
Networks,'' said John Taylor, co-founder, president and CEO. ``In
fact, in our market space, it is the biggest deal ever announced.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless makes systems that provide a wireless way for a
user to connect many of the gadgets in either a home or office _
linking phones, faxes, printers and computers. The systems permit
use of several phones or computers via the same outside line. They
let a user tie together computers on a network. And a user would
not need to rewire any machine that is moved.
</P>
<P>
   The company's small system, which can connect three outside
lines and eight ``devices,'' retails for less than $1,000. A system
that can handle five outside lines and 16 home devices costs about
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless has pegged its hopes to a growing demand for
wireless communications, as well as increasing popularity of
phones, computers and the Internet. Adding to the wave is the
growth of telecommuting and small businesses that want the same
technology options as large companies _ but can't afford the same
number of phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, BT expects more than 5 million consumers
to buy such systems in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless is unable to simply sell its current product line
through British Telecom, since the technology standards for
wireless transmission are different from that in United States.
Joint development produced a system for the British market.
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless now sells its systems in the United States through
four distributors, including Alltel and GT, as well as through the
Internet. Results so far are promising, but not spectacular, Taylor
said. ``It is doing okay, but nothing stellar _ nothing compared to
the BT deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The BT agreement gives the company, still privately traded, a
headstart on the eventual surge of wireless communications, Taylor
said. ``You basically have the world. There are not many start-ups
who can do this out of the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Wireless Networks was jump-started in 1996 with a large
investment from Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Company backers include Grotech Capital Group, Alliance
Technology Ventures and Klaus Krone of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The company has burgeoned from Taylor and two partners to about
130 employees.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I work for a large company in the customer
relations department, and I receive many complaints from angry
customers. Some of the callers become extremely irate and resort to
verbal abuse and profanity. Our company policy is to continue the
call even if it becomes a personal threat. Failure to adhere to
this policy can result in disciplinary action, including
termination. What do you suggest? N.N. &QL; 
A. This is a real double-edged corporate sword: your callers
threaten you, and if you are not willing to take it, your employer
threatens you with termination. What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Your employer appears to be actively unconcerned with protecting
the employees from intimidation, providing a safe and hospitable
work environment, and managing issues that generate excessive
stress for the employees. One step is to let your employer know
that this type of environment often leads to workers' compensation
claims at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important for your employer to understand the fact
that customer relations people need a broad range of
state-of-the-art training. This includes education in active
listening, trust-building, creative problem-solving, persuasive
communication, and much more. It is also helpful to have back-up
policies and procedures to deal with particularly difficult
situations.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the broader picture, there appears to be a need to
look at whatever may be going on in the company that is causing
customers to go ballistic. And, one very important way to make
productive changes in internal and external operations is for
management to listen to the people who are paid to listen, namely
the customer relations staff. &QL; 
Q. My manager told me that he was very disappointed in the way I
handled a particular assignment, and then he said that he would get
back to me with more details ``at a later date.'' That was two
weeks ago. Should I ask him for the details, or just let it go?
A.C. &QL; 
A. Perhaps your manager is also planning to pick up some management
skills ``at a later date.'' After all, even the greenest of
managers understand the need to provide employees with constructive
feedback as close to their performance as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although some time has passed, it is still important for you to
understand why he was so disappointed in the way you handled the
project. By approaching him and asking for such information, you
are not only demonstrating self-confidence, but also a desire to
learn, develop, and grow in the job. And, if you do not ask for
such feedback, you may be setting yourself up to run into the same
problem in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When you approach your manager, you should tell him that you are
interested in his thoughts about your performance on the given
project, and then set a specific date for the two of you to meet.
In such a meeting, be sure that you have all the facts regarding
your performance on the project in question. Since he is somewhat
shortchanged in terms of managerial skills, he may have
shortchanged you when assessing your performance. &QL; 
Q. I work in an office with approximately 80 employees. I enjoy
what I do and I am a hard worker. Another quality I have is minding
my own business, no gossiping, no chit-chatting, and no spreading
of rumors. I believe some employees perceive this as being stuck-up
or anti-social. Is it wrong to mind my own business, or should I be
more sociable and outgoing? Outside of the workplace, I am very
outgoing. K.G. &QL; 
A. Being friendly with your fellow employees does not mean that you
have to toss your work aside and jump aboard the gossip bandwagon.
You can work very diligently while maintaining friendly and cordial
relations with your fellow employees. The real question is what you
want in your job.
</P>
<P>
   If you are bothered by being viewed as stuck-up or anti-social,
then you can try to drop some of the barriers and open the lines of
communication with your co-workers. Since you describe yourself as
being ``very outgoing,'' you would probably be happier by doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, you can do this without having to abandon your work
ethic or personal values. The fact is that you can control the
amount of time that you spend socializing with others, and if you
do not like the way a conversation is going, you can excuse
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Another point to remember is that if your work calls for
teamwork, coordination or interaction with your associates, being
friendlier can actually help you get your job done. Through
increased interaction with others, you may find more personal
productivity, more job satisfaction, and more friends.

 &HT;    Outbreaks, possible resistant strains have public health
officials scratching their heads
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Decatur, Ga., mother Randy Foster had done all the
typical things to get rid of the head lice in her daughter's hair.
She bought the chemical cream rinses, vacuumed the carpets, bagged
the toys and picked out the eggs, known as nits, with a metal comb.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked. After more than six weeks of frustration,
Foster tried a decades-old treatment _ Vaseline, slathered on the
scalp _ to smother the lice. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody warned me about how hard it was going to be to get rid
of them,'' Foster said. ``No one told us how this was going to turn
our lives upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said she believes her daughter, Chelsea, may have been
infested with lice that had developed resistance to typical
chemical treatments _ a trend that may afflict scores of families
and schools, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are unable to say how widespread the problem
of ``super lice'' may be in the United States, other countries have
documented a rise in resistant lice. And researchers at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta acknowledge that they
are seeing significant anecdotal evidence of tougher bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of frustrated parents, lots of frustrated
physicians and lots of frustrated school nurses,'' said Sue
Partridge, spokeswoman for the CDC's Division of Parasitic
Diseases. Lice outbreaks _ whether due to ``super lice'' or just
widespread, inconsistent follow-up care _ are now ``a major concern
for school nurses,'' Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   With the first weeks of school behind them, teachers and public
health workers are bracing for a bumper crop of head lice this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always seen some cases,'' said Tammy Hamilton,
spokeswoman for the Cobb County Board of Health. ``But in the past
few years, we've noticed a dramatic increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Many metro Atlanta schools are trying to control the insects
with new no-nit policies, which require students to leave school
immediately if a nit, or lice egg, is found. And public health
workers are stepping up prevention efforts, urging parents to check
their children's scalps every Friday night and suggesting that some
schools bag hats or coats as students walk into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta public schools, Parent Teacher Association meetings
are planned to discuss strategies to eliminate lice, said Jayketa
Singleton, a health services clinical adviser to the district. In
Cobb County, the health department has a designated nurse who
travels the district to educate school nurses and parents about
lice.
</P>
<P>
   And at Westchester Elementary School in Decatur, Principal
Cheryl Kuebler lets parents borrow nit combs, including the
Robicomb, a electric tool that kills lice with a satisfying zap.
Kuebler, fondly known to faculty and students as the Lice Lady, is
more prepared than most. A few years ago, her school struggled with
a near epidemic of lice and took several approaches to end the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot, and I became very proactive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kuebler recommends such family activities like Friday night
lice checks, writes articles about lice for the school newsletter
and personally does class checks _ bringing youngsters to the
classroom windows and gingerly poking around their hair with a
pencil. ``I'm pretty good at finding the things at this point,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the school has not seen any more widespread
outbreaks _ ``knock on wood,'' she said. But many metro Atlanta
schools _ and parents _ will not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a public relations manager for the accounting firm KPMG,
never dreamed that an itty-bitty bug could be so persistent. Foster
doused Chelsea's hair in over-the-counter lice products. They
didn't work. She went through Chelsea's hair with a metal comb,
looking for nits, or lice eggs. When that didn't work, she picked
out nits strand-by-strand and cut them out.
</P>
<P>
   She cleaned the house, the toys, the clothes and the linens _
repeatedly. And after researching books and Web sites, she finally
slathered Chelsea's hair in Vaseline, videotaped the special moment
for posterity, and capped her hair overnight. That finally killed
the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really long and ugly and exhausting,'' said Foster, who
said she kept Chelsea, then 3 years old, still for the daily
inspections through stacks of videos and ``lots of bribes'' for six
weeks. ``I put my poor kid through hell. She was a real trooper.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said Foster's story is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   When talking to PTA groups last year about how to combat lice,
she said she heard parents repeatedly vent their frustration over
fighting lice.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone, regardless of economic status, can get lice. Even
Cleopatra owned a nit comb.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not children with dirty hair,'' Thompson said about
the cases she's seen. ``These are children well cared for, with
clean hair.''
</P>
<P>
   But girls tend to have higher numbers of lice and nits, because
they often have longer hair and they tend to do more head-to-head
activities that promote the spread of the insects, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And lice tend to attack whites, Asians and Hispanics more than
African-American boys and girls, experts say. The reason: The
texture of African-American hair makes it difficult for nits to
attach. And often, boys and girls have hair styles that are either
extremely short or tightly braided, both factors that discourage an
infestation.
</P>
<P>
   When a lice outbreak occurs, things often degenerate into a
blame game, which can complicate efforts to solve the problem.
Parents blame the schools for not being aggressive enough in
stopping infestations by keeping common areas of schools free of
lice and sending infested students home. Schools blame parents for
inconsistent follow-up treatment for lice. Public health workers
say once a child has lice, the parents must be diligent about
shampooing, nit-picking, cleaning and vacuuming their homes for at
least a month to make sure all bugs are dead.
</P>
<P>
   A second complication is that lice treatment can be expensive.
Americans spend about $100 million a year on cream rinses and
shampoos that contain delousing agents, according to the National
Pediculosis Association. And Nix, the No. 1 lice treatment, has
raked in more than $40 million each year since 1997, when annual
sales of the over-the-counter product doubled, according to its
distributer, Warner Lambert. A family can easily rack up a $60 to
$70 bill to treat a single lice infestation. Chemical cream rinses,
which need to be used twice within one week, cost between $10 and
$20 a pop per person. And fine-toothed nit combs cost between $10
and $15.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest hurdle to combating lice in the past decade has
been that more parents are finding that typical treatments _ such
as permethrin, the active ingredient in Nix _ don't seem to be
working anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken at the 1998 annual meeting of the National
Association of School Nurses found, for instance, that more than 80
percent of the respondents reported an increase in the failure of
chemical treatments to stop lice outbreaks in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent unpublished Harvard University study found more
than 200 lice, harvested from the heads of 57 children, survived in
petri dishes treated with permethrin. In contrast, the researchers
showed that 67 lice from children in the Philippines, who use
chemical treatments far less frequently, quickly died after
exposure to permethrin, except one, which apparently escaped. The
CDC has not seen definitive evidence of ``super lice'' in the
United States, although they have been identified in other nations.
But the experts acknowledge lice studies are rare, since the bugs
are neither glamorous nor dangerous and only live on humans, making
laboratory studies of lice virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and school nurses say they don't need scientists to
confirm what they see every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely seeing something new,'' said Thompson of
Fountain Elementary, who said about 20 percent of her student body
contracted lice last year. ``And it's causing real nightmares for
everyone involved.''

activities that promote the spread of the insects, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And lice tend to attack whites, Asians and Hispanics more than
African-American boys and girls, experts say. The reason: The
texture of African-American hair makes it difficult for nits to
attach. And often, boys and girls have hair styles that are either
extremely short or tightly braided, both factors that discourage an
infestation.
</P>
<P>
   When a lice outbreak occurs, things often degenerate into a
blame game, which can complicate efforts to solve the problem.
Parents blame the schools for not being aggressive enough in
stopping infestations by keeping common areas of schools free of
lice and sending infested students home. Schools blame parents for
inconsistent follow-up treatment for lice. Public health workers
say once a child has lice, the parents must be diligent about
shampooing, nit-picking, cleaning and vacuuming their homes for at
least a month to make sure all bugs are dead.
</P>
<P>
   A second complication is that lice treatment can be expensive.
Americans spend about $100 million a year on cream rinses and
shampoos that contain delousing agents, according to the National
Pediculosis Association. And Nix, the No. 1 lice treatment, has
raked in more than $40 million each year since 1997, when annual
sales of the over-the-counter product doubled, according to its
distributer, Warner Lambert. A family can easily rack up a $60 to
$70 bill to treat a single lice infestation. Chemical cream rinses,
which need to be used twice within one week, cost between $10 and
$20 a pop per person. And fine-toothed nit combs cost between $10
and $15.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest hurdle to combating lice in the past decade has
been that more parents are finding that typical treatments _ such
as permethrin, the active ingredient in Nix _ don't seem to be
working anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken at the 1998 annual meeting of the National
Association of School Nurses found, for instance, that more than 80
percent of the respondents reported an increase in the failure of
chemical treatments to stop lice outbreaks in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent unpublished Harvard University study found more
than 200 lice, harvested from the heads of 57 children, survived in
petri dishes treated with permethrin. In contrast, the researchers
showed that 67 lice from children in the Philippines, who use
chemical treatments far less frequently, quickly died after
exposure to permethrin, except one, which apparently escaped. The
CDC has not seen definitive evidence of ``super lice'' in the
United States, although they have been identified in other nations.
But the experts acknowledge lice studies are rare, since the bugs
are neither glamorous nor dangerous and only live on humans, making
laboratory studies of lice virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and school nurses say they don't need scientists to
confirm what they see every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely seeing something new,'' said Thompson of
Fountain Elementary, who said about 20 percent of her student body
contracted lice last year. ``And it's causing real nightmares for
everyone involved.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cinema history is punctuated by the work of visionary
mavericks who will go to any lengths to get their films made, and
who require their collaborators to share their obsessive dreams.
Erich von Stroheim, who subjected his crew to misery during the
filming of the climactic scenes of ``Greed'' (1924) in blistering
temperatures in Death Valley, boasted, ``I was going to
metamorphose the `movies' into an art _ a composite of all arts.
Fight for it! And die for it, if need be! Well, fight I did. And
die I almost did, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Stroheim was matched in brinkmanship by Werner Herzog, who not
only decided to make the documentary ``La Soufriere'' (1977) on the
Guadeloupe volcano after hearing it was about to erupt, but
allegedly made his star, Klaus Kinski, work at gunpoint during the
filming of ``Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' (1972) in the Peruvian
jungle. Returning to the Amazon for ``Fitzcarraldo'' (1982), Herzog
echoed the fanatical quest of the film's main character by hiring
hundreds of Indians to pull a steamship over a mountain. Several
were killed during production.
</P>
<P>
   The latest would-be member of this club is Harmony Korine, the
young, prodigiously talented writer of ``Kids'' (1995) and
writer-director of ``Gummo'' (1997) and ``Julien Donkey-Boy,''
which will be shown at the New York Film Festival before its Oct.
15 release. While Korine took his cameras into some squalid
situations _ most notably a cockroach-infested house _ during the
filming of ``Gummo,'' he has yet to lay his life on the line in the
same way his friend and mentor Herzog has done. Yet he aspires to _
or at least did so until a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time I was willing to die for film,'' he said
in an interview. ``When I make a film, it consumes me to such a
degree that it feels it's my only purpose for living. My
relationships are damaged, I don't know how to tie my shoes and I
can't make my bed. Or I can, but I don't think about these things,
and my life suffers because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Chloe Sevigny agreed: ``He's a miserable wreck when he's
not working.'' Ms. Sevigny, who is Korine's girlfriend and has
known him since both were 17, is a regular in his films.
``Harmony's always going to need other people around to look after
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Korine is no longer willing to kill himself for his
work is his experience making a film he has now abandoned. So
slight he looks about 18 despite the wispy beard sprouting from his
chin, Korine, who is 25, had himself videotaped fighting strangers
on the streets of Manhattan. ``I wanted to make a cross between a
Buster Keaton film and a snuff film,'' he said. ``My intention was
to fight every demographic, but I fought a bouncer who broke my
ankle and three ribs, and I got arrested three times. It was
starting to get painful, and then my mother found out and got
really worried. So I promised her I'd go see a shrink, which I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Korine acknowledged that he had been behaving
self-destructively. ``This was during a period when I was losing my
mind,'' he said. ``I'm now beginning to regain it a bit. It was
maybe a way of punishing myself for something. I am now trying to
find some kind of medium between making the movies I need to make
and surviving as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   During Korine's childhood, much of it spent in the Appalachians,
his father, Sol, was an itinerant documentary filmmaker whose
interests ranged from circus clowns to moonshiners. Korine
eventually went to live with his grandmother, Joyce Korine, in
Queens, New York City. (Her house is the setting for ``Julien
Donkey-Boy.'') Korine attended New York University as an English
major, quitting after one semester. A meeting with photographer
Larry Clark led to his writing, at the age of 18 and in three
weeks, the script for ``Kids,'' Clark's controversial 1995 film
about promiscuous teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   After another script he wrote for Clark was shelved, Korine
directed ``Gummo'' in the Tennessee environs of his youth. That
tale of two adolescent cat killers was not only a simultaneously
ugly and beautiful antidote to Hollywood narrative structures; it
was also Korine's first excursion into what he calls a new film
grammar, a kaleidoscopic mix of realistic and surrealistic scenes
not necessarily connected to one another. ``After 100 years, films
should be getting really complicated,'' he said. ``The novel has
been reborn about 400 times, but it's like cinema is stuck in the
birth canal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Julien Donkey-Boy,'' a more mature (if not less graphic) film
than ``Gummo,'' is the harrowing story of a paranoid schizophrenic
that was inspired by Korine's uncle, a long-term patient at the
Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens. Without so much as a story,
the movie simply follows Julien around: from the opening sequence,
in which he kills a little boy, through the time he spends in an
institute for the blind, to the streets, a skating rink, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Korine had wanted to make a film about his uncle for some time.
``Greta Garbo had a schizophrenic uncle named Cromwell,'' he
cryptically wrote in his 1998 novel, ``A Crackup at the Race
Riots,'' an abstruse collection of musings that painted an ironic
portrait of life at its most whimsically quotidian and spiritually
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Julien, the film's tormented protagonist, who reveals an
affectionate nature during his moments of lucidity, lives
dysfunctionally with his ranting father, his dreamy pregnant
sister, his brother, who fancies himself a wrestler, and his silent
grandmother. The father is played by Herzog, the sister by Ms.
Sevigny, the brother by the newcomer Evan Neumann and grandma by
Joyce Korine. Julien is played by Scottish actor Ewen Bremner, who
prepared for the role by visiting Korine's uncle in Creedmoor and
working in a hospital for six weeks. His portrayal of Julien was so
intense, said Ms. Sevigny, ``that I can no longer talk to Ewen as
Ewen.''
</P>
<P>
   Korine claims that had Bremner overidentified with his role and
lost his bearings, it would have been in a good cause. ``I knew the
film would be fake if, when I said `Cut,' Ewen had said, `Can I
have a cappuccino now?' If Ewen had lost his mind forever, I would
be sad, but at the same time it would have been worth it. I demand
everything from the people I make my films with. I demand their
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he made this troubling statement safe in the
knowledge that Bremner had survived with his faculties intact. And
he admitted that he had been relieved when the shoot was over. One
cannot help thinking, however, of the British prisoner of war,
played by Michael Bryant in the BBC drama series ``Colditz,'' who
persuaded his commanding officer to let him feign madness to secure
his release under international law. The soldier succeeded only too
well: he went insane in the attempt, leaving his officer full of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   Bremner got the role of Julien after Korine abandoned the idea
of casting his institutionalized uncle or another schizophrenic or
even himself. The actor was not scarred, he said, either by his
immersion in the character or by his director's compulsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Harmony's not by any stretch of the imagination an easygoing
guy or a perfect citizen,'' Bremner said, ``but one of the things I
respect about him is that he's fearless. He's not going to pull any
punches in the way he goes about making his films. He uses what
he's got _ his fear, his love and his pain _ but he never allows
any of that to get in the way. Nothing does, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from thinking Korine callous, Bremner has paid him tribute
by calling his newborn daughter Harmony. ``My partner chose the
name,'' Bremner said. ``I thought she was joking when she suggested
it. It's not to do with the film particularly, but simply because
Harmony  &UR; is &LR;  inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Korine's fervent approach to filmmaking was outlined in his
confession to the Dogma collective of Danish directors, including
Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, who in 1995 issued a
manifesto of rules to counter ``the film of illusion'' and
``personal taste.''
</P>
<P>
   In submitting ``Julien Donkey-Boy'' for the group's seal of
approval, Korine wrote: ``If I was ever to make a `western,' for
instance, and a horse died because I asked too much from the
stallion, I would not shed a tear simply because it died by my
command. I would weep only if the horse died off camera. Cinema
sustains life. It captures death in its progress. Thus the horse
dies for the world as did Christ himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dogma brethren must film with hand-held cameras on location
and eschew unnatural light, optical work, produced sound, music,
superficial action, props not found on the locations and the cult
of the director. Largely obedient to this creed, ``Julien
Donkey-Boy'' broke a few of the commandments: for example, Ms.
Sevigny was not truly pregnant (Korine confessed in his statement
that he had not had time to impregnate her before filming began).
</P>
<P>
   The fine distinctions between what does and does not make a
Dogma film may be forgotten in the dismay that Korine's film is
likely to engender. Like ``Gummo,'' which Janet Maslin reviled in
her New York Times review as ``the worst film of the year'' and
``an aimless vision of Midwestern teen-age anomie, complete with
drugs, garbage, dead cats and neat tricks like turning off Granny's
respirator,'' ``Julien Donkey-Boy'' is a pullulating collage of
images that many will find unpalatable: a Thalidomide-maimed man
playing the drums with drumsticks held between his toes; blind
people demonstrating that you really have to be able to see to go
bowling; Julien yowling in various states of degradation, and
scenes involving a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   To dismiss these images as grotesque or exploitative, though,
would be to misinterpret Korine's intentions. The characters have
been filmed neither patronizingly nor with voyeuristic relish, but
with tenderness and humor.
</P>
<P>
   There is the same overarching humanity in the film that Tod
Browning brought to his circus sideshow performers in ``Freaks''
(1932) or Herzog to the midget cast of ``Even Dwarfs Started
Small'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a worse kind of discrimination not to use
people because of the way they look or because of their handicap or
their strangeness,'' said Korine. ``You can show Tom Hanks
stuttering or Dustin Hoffman doing his `Rain Man' thing and they
win Oscars for playing cute, lovable mentally insane people. That
makes me angry, because as soon as you show someone screaming with
fear at the voices they hear in their heads, puking on themselves
or punching themselves in the face, it becomes `exploitation.' But
to me it becomes something meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Korine cites the films of Jean-Luc Godard, British director Alan
Clarke, who died in 1990, and Herzog among his influences. The
drive to make uncompromising movies at any cost is clearly part of
the affinity between him and Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harmony's original intention to play my son in his film was
metaphorical, of course,'' said Herzog. What does he think of
Korine's esthetic?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw a piece of fried bacon fixed to the bathroom wall
in `Gummo,' it knocked me off my chair. He's a very clear voice of
a generation of filmmakers that is taking a new position. It's not
going to dominate world cinema, but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Korine's self-dramatizing zeal for art over life borders more on
the naive than the unconscionable. Less messianic in person than
his take-no-prisoners stance would suggest, he is a gifted
filmmaker with a disturbing world view and infectious passion. In a
movie environment clogged with opportunists and journeymen, he is
much needed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Vinterberg best summed him up when he said: ``Harmony
has a haunting relationship to his filmmaking, which is creating
almost a mythology around his work. I believe it's a matter of life
or death for him. Everybody who's involved with a certain serious
level of emotional life on screen has that kind of experience, but
whereas others struggle to have a life next to their films, I think
Harmony gave in.''

 &HT;    GORE PROPOSES BROAD EXPANSION OF HEALTH COVERAGE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore vowed Tuesday to provide
health care coverage to about 11 million uninsured children by 2005
as a first step toward making affordable coverage available to all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be crystal clear on this point: if you elect me
president, I will ensure that by the year 2005, every single child
in our country has full access to fully affordable health care
coverage,'' he told a room of health care workers at Children's
Hospital, one of America's major pediatric centers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's promise seemed to be a response to weeks of criticism by
former Sen. Bill Bradley that the Clinton-Gore administration has
not done enough for children in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore's timing, on the eve of Bradley's official announcement
of his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination,
appeared to be a reaction to recent public opinion polls suggesting
that interest in Bradley's campaign is growing rather than fading.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore did not mention Bradley by name, the vice
president contrasted his health care proposal to the universal
coverage the former senator is expected to embrace in the coming
weeks. ``Some ... will tell you that the only acceptable answer is
a one-size-fits-all solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the kind of controversy that the ill-fated Clinton
health care reforms generated in 1994, Gore cautioned that he would
pursue a wide-ranging package of reforms ``carefully, realistically
and step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one
fell swoop,'' the vice president said. Still, he added, ``we cannot
rest until every single American has affordable health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step in that direction, he said, would involve the
expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program, enacted in
1997 to provide federal funds to the states to pay for health care
coverage to children in working families.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the CHIP program allows coverage of children in
families that earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
But under Gore's proposal, the eligibility cap would be raised to
250 percent, or about $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as California, already have raised the cap to
250 percent. Some states, such as Texas, have tried to lower the
cap below 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the CHIP program, the Children's Health Fund, an
advocacy group, estimates that some 11 million children still have
no health insurance. And Gore, promising to spur the states into
greater efforts, took a dig at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
current front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some states _ Texas springs to mind _ one quarter of all
children are still out in the cold,'' he said. ``That is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore would also allow families who currently do not qualify for
CHIP and do not have access to health coverage through their jobs
to buy into the program, so that their children can have access to
coverage regardless of their parents' income.
</P>
<P>
   Gore never addressed the issue of cost, other than to say that
any public expenses should be ``fiscally responsible.'' His
spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the cost would be addressed later
``in the context of a balanced budget'' and not in terms of a tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Although campaign officials had billed the speech as a major
policy address, many of the reforms cited by Gore on Tuesday had
already been proposed:
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``enforceable'' patients's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing people with disabilities to keep Medicare or Medicaid
when they returned to the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage small businesses to band together to negotiate rates
for their workers' coverage by providing a 25 percent tax credit to
the firms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improving privacy safeguards for patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage insurers to cover mental illness as they do other
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew the most applause when he criticized health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly not satisfied when life or death medical
decisions are made by HMO bureaucrats at the other end of a
telephone line,'' he said. ``They don't have a licence to practice
medicine, and they don't have a right to play God.''

 &HT;    FSU's Weinke leaves injury behind and faces season openerBy Tony
Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Ten months ago, Chris Weinke lay in a
hospital bed wondering if his football career might be over.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State quarterback ended up in that bed courtesy of a
jarring, blindside hit from Virginia's Patrick Kearney. As Weinke
fell to the ground, his head hit the leg of a Florida State
lineman, and he fractured a vertebra in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   If the break had occurred a few inches in another direction,
Weinke could have been paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Weinke had neck surgery to fuse two vertebrae
to provide stability. Afterward, a nurse talked to Betty Weinke, a
very anxious mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' the nurse said. ``Don't ever let your son play
football again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a mother, that was Betty's wish. But she knew better. Her son
had come too far to see his dreams end that way.
</P>
<P>
   So it's fair to say Betty Weinke will be the most nervous person
among the 80,000-plus who will pack Doak Campbell Stadium on
Saturday night when No. 1 Florida State plays No. 10 Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke has recovered from the November surgery, and on
July 26, doctors pronounced him fit to play. He has been tested in
a game, taking several good hits in Florida State's 41-7 win over
Louisiana Tech in its opener Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine,'' said Weinke, the 27-year-old junior who
returned to college football in 1997 after five years in
professional baseball. ``It was good to take a few shots just to
show people that I could survive it and play. I think I'm ready to
put this behind me and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving on hasn't been easy for Weinke, because of the
seriousness of the injury, sustained in Florida State's 10th game.
After the surgery, he was in the hospital bed for six weeks unable
to move. The 6-foot-5 Weinke had weighed 240 pounds, but he lost 30
pounds. He had to have follow-up surgery in January to repair a
spinal fluid leak near the point where the vertebrae were fused; a
titanium clamp is still there.
</P>
<P>
   By March, Weinke could throw without pain, but he saw limited
action in spring practice and had no contact. This summer, he
remained in Tallahassee and worked with the Seminoles' receivers.
Even though doctors gave the OK, Florida State coaches would not
let him get hit in preseason practice. As a result, Weinke was
nagged by one question: ``How are you going to act when you get hit
for the first time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it a million different ways, but it was always the
same thing,'' Weinke said. ``It was like nobody wondered if I could
really throw the ball or not. They just wondered if I could take a
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. Weinke completed 20 of 32 passes for 242
yards and two touchdowns against Louisiana Tech. Early in the
second quarter, he broke the ACC record held by Matt Blundin of
Virginia for consecutive attempts without an interception, 231.
Weinke extended the record to 237 before getting intercepted at the
end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous at first, but after that, I settled
down, and it felt pretty good,'' Weinke said.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as neck surgery was, it was not as bad as watching
Florida State lose the national championship game to Tennessee in
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This Seminoles team has all the weapons it needs to win a
national championship, as long as Weinke stays on the field. That's
why he worked so hard in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly the fastest and most talented team we've had
since I've been here,'' said Weinke, who threw for 2,487 yards and
19 touchdowns last season. ``I really wanted to be their
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be Saturday, in his biggest test since the injury. And
Betty Weinke will be there for every heart-pounding play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing her,'' Weinke said, ``she'll have her eyes closed the
entire game.'' CHRIS WEINKE BIO BOX
</P>
<P>
   Birthdate: July 31, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Class: Junior.
</P>
<P>
   Major: Sports management.
</P>
<P>
   His past: He signed with FSU from high school and spent four
days in August 1990 on the Florida State campus before signing a
professional baseball contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, who had
made him a second-round draft pick. He spent six years in the Blue
Jays organization before going to Florida State in the spring of
1997.

SARATOGA POSTS RECORD YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM WILKIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The starting gate slammed shut for the
season at Saratoga Race Course Monday afternoon, signifying the end
to another glorious summer.
</P>
<P>
   And what a summer it was.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive season, the New York Racing
Association had a record-setting six weeks with the thoroughbreds
at the ancient and tradition-laden Spa.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga exceeded 900,000 in on-track attendance for the first
time in the 131 years racing has been held here.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 920,218 fans poured into the Spa gates this year, an
average of 25,562 per day and a 3.7 percent increase from last
year. Also, on-track handle rose 5.4 percent, to $111,969,548.
Daily on-track handle surpassed $3 million, registering in at
$3,110,265.
</P>
<P>
   With incoming simulcasts, the daily average handle reached
$14,869,743, 17 percent more than the 1998 figure of $12,697,170.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Nader, director of broadcasting communications
and promotions for NYRA, there were 865 sites that carried the
Saratoga signal. He said there were 43 states that simulcast the
Spa races, and they also were available in Canada, Mexico and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nader said, there were 810 outlets that had Spa
races.
</P>
<P>
   On the track, Jerry Bailey established himself as the Spa jockey
of the '90s and Bill Mott did the same as the top trainer of the
decade. They won the titles of leading rider and leading trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Saratoga set records in total on-track attendance
(887,752) and one-day attendance (61,190). Both of those marks were
squashed. A crowd of 66,194 was announced on Aug. 15, the day the
track gave away Saratoga steins for a single admission.
</P>
<P>
   Another record that fell was the single-day attendance of a
non-giveaway day. That came on Travers Day, when 51,371 came to see
Lemon Drop Kid win the Midsummer Derby. That surpassed the old
record of 50,359, set on Travers Day in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy with what we did up here this year,'' said
Terry Meyocks, NYRA's president and chief operating officer. ```We
are ecstatic that we beat our numbers from last year, but now we
have to try and beat these numbers next year. We are pleased, there
is no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The dates for next year's Spa meet have already been announced.
It will remain at 36 days and start on July 26 and, again, end on
Labor Day (Sept. 4).
</P>
<P>
   Meyocks said he does not expect the meet to grow in duration
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to say never but we have always said, that
right now, everyone feels that 36 days is a perfect number. I think
it would be unfair to the people of Saratoga and our horsemen.
People up here (who rent their homes) are away for six weeks and
our horsemen are away from home that long. I think if you made the
meet longer, you would lose some of the mystique that is Saratoga.
If you go longer than that, you lose some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third season Saratoga Race Course had a 36-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey won his fifth riding title in the last six years. Mott
has won four training titles this decade and shared the trophy two
other times.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, 42, dominated the rest of the jockey colony right from
the start of the meet and ended with 47 winners in 169 starts.
Bailey had a chance to tie or pass his all-time record of 48
winners, set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, two of his mounts were scratched. He finished fourth
aboard 8-5 favorite My Jan in the first race and was second with
even-money choice Tree House in the second. He got his only winner
in the sixth race, when he guided 4-1 Amelia's Song to victory.
Ironically, that victory clinched the training title for Mott. He
and D. Wayne Lukas entered the final day tied with 14 winners. Mott
also trained the winner of the eighth race, Dream For A Moment, to
end the season with 16 winners.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas did not have any horses entered on Monday's card. He left
town Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good meet,'' Bailey said while sitting outside the
jockeys' room after the third race Monday afternoon. ``I was able
to stay in one piece, make a few dollars and come out of here with
a smile on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was never seriously threatened in this race. The
competition was for second place.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Prado, riding his first full Spa meet, had 36 winners, one
more than Jorge Chavez. Shane Sellers was fourth with 31 trips to
the winner's circle, and John Velazquez, last year's champion with
31 winners, had to settle for fifth place with 28 winners, the same
number Pat Day had.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey won the Whitney aboard Victory Gallop, took the Alabama
with Silverbulletday and the Go For Wand with Banshee Breeze.
Bailey took a back seat to no one on the grass, winning 18 of the
60 races that he was on the turf for an average of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good just to survive the meet,'' Bailey said. ``Right
now I am very tired, but it's a good kind of tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott was happy with his meet as well. He did not have any major
stakes wins _ his grass star Yagli was upset in the Sword Dancer _
but he was the most consistent trainer. He was second in the
Travers with Vision and Verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to win a meet like this,'' Mott said. ``In
this game, winning is the name of the game. When you prove you can
win, then you are going to get people that send you horses.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the refreshing summer pause behind us,
Congress and President Clinton are back on the job, still accusing
each other of lying shamelessly about practically everything and
arguing bitterly about tax cuts, spending priorities and other
tiresome issues.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven help us. It will be a long 14 months until voters can
register their impatience with this intractable mess in the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Unrealistic hopes of fresh cooperation to build a bipartisan
record of achievement promptly evaporated with the anger that
erupted again over what happened in 1993 during a 51-day standoff
between law enforcement officials and the Branch Davidians near
Waco, Texas. The siege ended with the burning of the cult compound
and the death of some 80 people trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   This recycled crisis has familiar earmarks. The FBI suddenly
discovered proof that it had done something bad that it had
consistently denied doing.
</P>
<P>
   During the Clinton era long-missing, politically charged
documents have had a weird way of turning up belatedly. Conspiracy
theories abound. And it all turns out to be much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Hillary Clinton's law firm billing records,
inexplicably found inside the White House two years after being
subpoenaed by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr? Despite a
congressional probe and Republican cries of obstruction of justice,
the mystery of their disappearance and recovery has never been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after much huffing and puffing, Starr didn't indict the
first lady for illegal shenanigans and is not expected to do so.
Former Sens. Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of
North Carolina, the most aggressive GOP pursuers of Whitewater
rumors, ridiculed Mrs. Clinton. Faircloth once joked sarcastically,
``The butler did it!'' Both were defeated for reelection last year.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we have a similar phenomenon with documents, this one
involving suspected hanky-panky by the FBI, supposedly condoned by
the Justice Department. What happened is that the FBI _ after six
years of denials _ finally produced two videotapes proving that its
agents had launched potentially flammable tear gas canisters at an
underground bunker 50 yards from the cult's wooden compound.
</P>
<P>
   This time there is no way to drag in Bill or Hillary Clinton. So
Attorney General Janet Reno gets the dubious honor of being the
designated fall guy. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin
Hatch of Utah, a Republican presidential candidate, and Texas GOP
Sen. Phil Gramm rushed to judgment last weekend, calling for Reno's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the FBI may have sent a memo about the canisters to
someone in the Justice Department, and if it hadn't reached Reno,
that would indicate the department was ``poorly run.'' Ergo, it was
her fault she hadn't caught on right away that the FBI was lying,
not the FBI's fault for lying in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm complained that Reno ``either lied or allowed herself to
be lied to'' about the incident. The FBI is accountable to the
Justice Department, but, encouraged by Congress, it has long
enjoyed a formidable reputation for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always the last person to know,'' Gramm scoffed,
forgetting that when President Ronald Reagan was the last to know
about an illegal war in Nicaragua run from the White House
basement, a similar information lapse was considered an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had sworn to Congress that no incendiary device had been
used. She says she relied on what the FBI told her.
</P>
<P>
   Neither senator called for the resignation of FBI Director Louis
Freeh, who is in direct charge of the lying agency but who has won
over the congressional GOP leadership by pandering to their efforts
to bring down the Clinton administration. Freeh was not FBI
director at the time of Waco. The job was then held by William
Sessions, father of Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. The congressman
has already won the 1999 grand prize for self-serving prejudice by
calling immediately for Reno's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, this is a typical partisan firestorm more
indicative of overheated politics than any potential expose of
dangerous wrong-doing. A Republican-controlled House probe several
years ago concluded that the Branch Davidians set the fire in a
final, convulsive act of mass suicide and murder. There is plenty
of evidence to support that finding.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, refusing
to advocate new House hearings, has suggested that an independent
commission look into the case again, which seems okay with
congressional Democrats. Fortunately, Hyde is displaying the common
sense for which he was noted before he was tarnished by the
feverish fanaticism that swept the House during Clinton's
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of another Clinton administration witch hunt, however,
is in the congressional air. Rep. Dan Burton, GOP chairman of a
House committee with oversight duties, has already issued subpoenas
preparatory to holding hearings. Burton is an embarrassment to his
party and his country, but he is free to rant and rave at will.
</P>
<P>
   He has called Clinton a ``scumbag'' and threatened to hold Reno
in contempt of Congress for failing to appoint an independent
counsel to look into alleged Democratic fund-raising abuses similar
to those of which he has been accused himself. When he released
transcripts of former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell's
prison conversations, Burton selectively edited out Hubbell remarks
suggesting that the first lady was innocent of the Whitewater
charges.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine civility returning to the partisan
legislative wars in a wacko Waco atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The president is winning the public relations war over the size
of any projected tax cut, but the Republicans who control Congress
show little sign of accepting that reality, let alone negotiating a
compromise. So stalemate it probably is. There are worse outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have always known they face two choices this fall.
Go for a record or go for the issues. A record of positive, joint
accomplishment would be good for the country. But issues that are
unresolved are good for candidates' campaigns next year.
</P>
<P>
   And campaigning comes before governing. Too bad, but that's the
order of things.

WHITE HOUSE REBUFFS HILLARY CLINTON'S CRITICISM ON CLEMENCY DEAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House spokesman on Tuesday defended
President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican members of
a terrorist group in the wake of First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's criticism of presidential leniency.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart declined to directly
address Mrs. Clinton's objections but said the offer of
presidential clemency announced on Aug. 11 ``remains open'' until
Friday at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was ``not trying to avoid commenting'' on Mrs.
Clinton's criticism but instead was focusing on ``what I'm supposed
to do here _ which is talk about what the president's doing (and)
why he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton urged her husband on Saturday to cancel his offer
of clemency after the offer was widely criticized by law
enforcement groups and advocates of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans alleged that the president's clemency offer was
designed to win support among Hispanic voters for Mrs. Clinton's
possible bid for the U.S. Senate seat in New York. Mrs. Clinton's
expected rival for the Senate seat, Republican New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has called the clemency offer ``a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the offer should be withdrawn because the
convicted terrorists refused to meet the president's conditions for
early release or modification of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments may have spurred action by the most of the 16
Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart announced later Tuesday that 12 of the jailed
nationalists have indicated they will accept the offer of clemency.
Two have rejected it and two others two others, who are not in jail
but whose fines would be reduced, have yet to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 were members of the Puerto Rican nationalist group that
carried out at least 130 bombings of political and military targets
between 1974 and 1983, killing six people and wounding scores of
others. The organization is known as the FALN, based upon the
Spanish acronym for Armed Forces of National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 members of the pro-independence Puerto Rican
organization was convicted of crimes stemming from individual
attacks that killed or injured people, according to deputy White
House chief of staff Maria Echaveste.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalists have served at least 14 years for crimes such
as possession of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation
of a stolen vehicle or seditious conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency would require the convicts not only
to accept traditional federal parole restrictions on travel but
also to sign a document pledging to renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Clinton's offer, 11 of the 16 Puerto Rican
nationalists could be released from custody immediately. Two others
would remain in prison with shorter sentences. Three others would
have fines waived.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied the president's offer of clemency was designed
to benefit Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign in New York,
where Hispanics account for an estimated 2.6 million of the state's
population of 18.2 million, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House discussions of possible clemency began
at least two years ago, long before Mrs. Clinton began exploring a
possible Senate campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a partisan maneuver,'' Lockhart said. ``There
have been many who have sought to inject politics, and many who
have thought to inject a motive here, and all I can say is that
they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House lawyers' discussions of the clemency
offer with lawyers for the Puerto Rican prisoners do not constitute
``negotiations.''

   Mrs. Clinton's criticism of the clemency offer has irked Puerto
Rican political activists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., said in an interview with the New
York Times published on Monday that he was withdrawing his support
for Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign because of her
``intervention'' in the White House clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy,'' Serrano
said. ``This is an action that will make people go out and make
sure that she's not our next senator. Maybe it's time to go out and
find out who else is interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican voters, the largest bloc of Hispanic voters in New
York, are a powerful constituency in New York state politics.
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, entitled to vote in congressional
and presidential elections, if they are living in the mainland
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., ousted incumbent Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., in New York's 1998 Senate race with the help of
Hispanic voters, including Puerto Ricans. Schumer carried 82
percent of the Hispanic vote, which accounted for 6 percent of the
statewide vote in 1998, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, New York City's mayor, carried 43 percent of the
Hispanic vote in his 1997 re-election drive during a contest in
which Hispanic voters accounted for 20 percent of the city-wide
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency for Puerto Rican nationalists is not new.
</P>
<P>
   Then-President Jimmy Carter pardoned four Puerto Rican
nationalists who were serving long prison terms following
conviction for a 1954 attack on the U.S. House of Representatives
that wounded four members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also pardoned a Puerto Rican nationalist convicted in a
plot to assassinate President Harry S. Truman in 1950.

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS TRY TO SHAKE FEAR THEY'D CUT EDUCATION AID
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress comes back to work _ and back to school _
Wednesday, with Republicans scrambling to convince the public that
they don't want tax cuts so much that they are willing to risk
cutting federal aid to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   GOP support for education is the theme of a two-day, five-state
tour by Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House Republican
Conference, which began early Tuesday in Cincinnati and will
conclude in Allentown, Pa., on Wednesday afternoon. At each stop,
local GOP members of Congress join Watts for an event at a local
school.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a former high school
teacher and coach, plans to do the same thing on Capitol Hill as he
leads a congressional delegation to a nearby public charter school
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert plans to publicize the tax bill's provisions for
tax-protected education savings accounts and to spotlight
``Straight A's'' legislation proposed by Sen. Paul Coverdell,
R-Ga., and Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa. The legislation would end the
system under which the federal government tells states how their
federal education aid must be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to emphasize that Straight A's does not
subtract from any of the currently federally funded education
programs,'' said a fact sheet distributed by Coverdell. ``It simply
allows them to be put into a 'flex-fund' to be used by each state
as each sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   When they left Washington in early August, the Republicans hoped
to stir up a public rebellion against Clinton's vow to kill their
$792 billion tax-cut bill when they send it to him later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But as they return, they are instead defending themselves
against Clinton's repeated charges that the tax cuts are so deep
that the federal government wouldn't have enough revenues left for
education and other popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest attack, delivered Tuesday at a school in
Washington's Maryland suburbs, the president said: ``If their
budget passes with the tax cut, it will require us to reduce our
investment in education, in Head Start, early reading and other
programs by about 50 percent over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year alone, the cuts could be nearly 20 percent, Clinton
said. Bruce Reed, director of Clinton's Domestic Policy Council,
suggested that Congress could avoid education cuts by reviving the
president's moribund proposal for an increase of 55 cents per pack
in the tobacco excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our budget we set it aside to offset federal health
costs,'' Reed said. ``But we'd like to see the Congress take a look
at this for any purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Myers, general counsel of the nonprofit Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, reacted favorably. ``Substantial prices
increases in tobacco products are the quickest way to reduce
tobacco use among children, therefore we would strongly support an
effort to significantly raise the excise tax on tobacco products,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans shuddered at the notion of raising any kind of
taxes. ``It sounds like the president is he president is reverting
back to the old tax-and-spend days of Jimmy Carter and George
McGovern,'' said Hastert's press secretary, John Feehery.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Republicans scoff at Clinton's charges. ``Saying
that government programs are threatened if we return a sliver of a
$3 trillion surplus to taxpayers is like saying that cooking is
threatened by Betty Crocker,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who
heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past month, those views have been drowned out by the
flood of attention to the views of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Watts wryly summed up the competition this way: ``The Democrats
have one master salesman with a megaphone. We have 222 vice
presidents for sales.''

TEXAS AGENCY RECEIVES EXTENSION TO COMPLY WITH SUBPOENA IN WACO
PROBE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Department of Public Safety has
received an informal extension until Friday to comply with a
congressional subpoena for records relating to the 1993 federal
agents' assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange said Texas Rangers sought an
extension to prepare a report and gather records pertaining to the
use of tear gas on the Branch Davidians prior to the April 19 fire
in which leader David Koresh and more than 80 followers died. The
fire ended a 51-day standoff with federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee subpoenaed the documents
following recent disclosures that FBI agents, contrary to what the
agency has been contending for the past six years, did indeed fire
pyrotechnic devices into the compound prior to the start of the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The use of pyrotechnic devices is a key factor in a pending
wrongful death lawsuit filed by survivors against the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have insisted that the military tear gas
lobbed at an underground bunker at the compound did not cause the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mange said the Rangers' report and tear gas records will be
forwarded to the House Committee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Washington, committee spokesman Mark Corallo said
the panel is not likely to release the DPS records or report until
after the committee has conducted public hearings into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Government Reform Committee has subpoenaed documents from
other agencies regarding their involvement in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   DPS also is awaiting instructions from a federal judge on where
to send the tons of evidence collected at the Davidians' former
home site.
</P>
<P>
   DPS has maintained physical custody of the evidence since 1993,
but the U.S. Justice Department has retained control of the
materials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith has ordered the evidence be
turned over to him. Mange said the judge has not decided though
whether the material should be held in Waco or in San Antonio,
where the chief clerk for the District Court is located.

TREASURY YIELDS RISE AS INVESTORS AWAIT INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury yields rose Tuesday as investors awaited an
inflation report scheduled for release on Friday and braced for
speeches by Federal Reserve officials.
</P>
<P>
   Government securities were also under pressure from coming
issues of corporate debt, which are expected to compete with
Treasuries for investors' cash.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 26/32, to 100
23/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the
price, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.01 percent on Friday. The
Treasury market was closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Light trading continued to plague the market throughout the day,
exaggerating shifts in buying. Analysts noted that the bond market
had shown a penchant for volatility lately with plenty of obstacles
to choke off a sustained rally, including a busy calendar of Fed
speeches and a steady stream of economic data.
</P>
<P>
   This week's appearances at the podium by the Fed chairman, Alan
Greenspan, and two Fed governors, Laurence Meyer and Roger
Ferguson, ``have the power to send the bond market scurrying for
cover,'' said Adam Blankman, Treasury market analyst for Standard &AMP;
Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices slumped Tuesday in what traders described as an
uneventful session. Blankman noted that supply was weighing on the
market, though estimates of the corporate debt this month are being
reduced from about $60 billion to the range of $30 billion to $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The firms managing corporate bond sales often hedge against
possible losses by selling government securities before the
corporate issues are sold, then buying back the Treasuries after
the corporate issues are in the hands of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants looking for signs of the Fed's position on
the economy and the direction of interest rates will be paying
particular attention to the Fed officials' remarks this week and to
a government report on producer prices, or inflation at the
manufacturing level, on Friday. Analysts expect the report to show
a rise of .3 of 1 percent in August after a gain of .2 of 1 percent
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Blankman said that Greenspan and the other Fed officials
speaking this week were helping to keep buyers sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception was the three-month bill, which was the
session's top performer. ``Thanks to the laws of supply and demand,
this is the only instrument on the yield curve that is above water
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury's bill auction was well received. The three-month
issue was awarded at 4.72 percent, a little better than expected.

CISNEROS PLEADS GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR COUNT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Housing secretary Henry Cisneros, whose
earlier political career was derailed by an extramarital affair,
pleaded guilty Tuesday to a single misdemeanor count of lying to
the FBI about the money he paid his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea agreement, Cisneros, who had faced 18 felony counts,
will pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in federal court, a somber Cisneros admitted that he
``knowingly and falsely'' told FBI agents that he gave his former
paramour, Linda Jones, only about $2,500 per month between 1990 and
1992. The agents were conducting a background check leading to his
Cabinet selection in President Clinton's first administration.
Federal prosecutors alleged, and Cisneros conceded, that the dollar
figure was much greater _ more than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement forestalled what could have been an
embarrassing monthlong trial on charges that Cisneros not only lied
to the FBI but obstructed justice and illegally conspired in an
effort to prevent his payments to Jones from becoming public. The
trial was to start Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel David Barrett and his team of prosecutors,
who have spent more than $10 million on their investigation, were
prepared to introduce at trial surreptitiously recorded audio tapes
of conversations between Cisneros and Jones that detailed their
financial arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' lawyers were prepared to paint Jones as an unreliable
witness who had doctored the tapes and then lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who faced up to 15 years in prison on the original
charges, admitted that he lied to FBI agents Jan. 7, 1993.
Cisneros, in entering his guilty plea, told U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin that he lied in an effort to protect Jones and his
wife, Mary Alice, from embarrassment and also because he was caught
up in ``the fog of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin, however, showed little sympathy for Cisneros'
explanation. ``You knew you were not being candid with the FBI,''
Sporkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' Cisneros responded.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who served as mayor of San Antonio from 1981 to 1989,
chose not to seek re-election after his then year-long affair with
Jones became public in 1988. The affair ended by early 1991, and he
has since reconciled with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who resigned from the Cabinet in 1996, told the judge
that the four-and-a-half years he was under investigation were ``a
difficult time for me and my family.'' He said the guilty plea
would ``let us proceed with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $10,000, Cisneros agreed to pay a $25 special
assessment to the court as required under federal law. In return,
the independent counsel agreed to drop all other charges against
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin, before accepting the guilty plea, expressed sympathy
that Cisneros' personal life had become public. Calling the
investigation ``a long and sometimes nasty saga in the life of
Henry Cisneros,'' Sporkin told the defendant that ``I believe you
deeply regret the pain you have caused your loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the judge said Barrett acted properly in pressing ahead
with the prosecution of Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that future public servants learn from your ordeal,''
Sporkin told Cisneros. ``We cannot let an individual lie his way
into public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, in a statement released after Sporkin accepted the
guilty plea, expressed remorse and presented himself as an example
of what government officials should not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret my lack of candor and accept responsibility for my
conduct,'' he said. ``I hope that all who follow me in public
service learn the lesson that truth and candor are important in the
process of selecting our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros also defended his work in the Clinton administration,
adding that his lies were limited to events in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to say that after four-and-a-half years of
investigation there has not been any allegation that my service at
HUD was affected in any way,'' he said. ``I ... hope that when the
final chapter is written on my service at HUD, the focus will not
be on what I said in an interview prior to nomination, but on what
I did to improve the lives of those who need help the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros has moved far from Washington, serving as president of
Univision Communications Inc., a Los Angeles-based Spanish-language
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, in a prepared statement, defended his investigation and
prosecution of Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (guilty-plea) disposition should in no way be viewed as
minimizing the serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros,'' Barrett
said. ``Deception by public officials and those seeking public
office erodes trust and must be addressed and sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, a just disposition of any prosecution must include an
evaluation of the defendant's overall conduct,'' he said. ``In this
case, the conduct, while egregious, was committed by a person whose
life has been otherwise dedicated to public service, and this fact
must season the final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, using Jones' secret tape recordings of Cisneros, was
prepared to argue at trial that Cisneros paid Jones more than
$250,00, including $73,000 after he became HUD secretary in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisneros' veteran defense attorneys were equally prepared to
challenge the validity of the tapes, arguing that Jones was not a
person who could be believed. Jones, through her own actions, had
put her own credibility in question, making the job easier for
Cisneros' lawyers, Barry Simon and Brendan Sullivan, who gained
fame 12 years ago with his vigorous defense of Oliver North during
the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is serving a three-and-a-half year prison sentence after
pleading guilty last year to fraud for initially misrepresenting as
originals the copies she made of her recorded conversations with
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who went by her married surnamed Medlar until her 1989
divorce, also accepted $15,000 from ``Inside Edition'' in return
for her 1994 appearance on the syndicated television show. That
appearance, during which portions of the tapes were aired, helped
convince Attorney General Janet Reno to ask a panel of three
federal judges to appoint an independent counsel to investigate
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   But Sporkin, accepting Cisneros' plea, said the widely
anticipated trial will not occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Sporkin said to Cisneros. ``Good luck.''

 &HT;    High school's Little Big Man on Campus
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLQUITT, Ga. _ Take a swipe at Don Calloway on the football
field, and you might end up with a face full of grass.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, he'll make you miss _ badly. Calloway, a
senior running back for Miller County, isn't big. He is listed at 5
feet 8, 175 pounds, but he actually is closer to 5 feet 6.
</P>
<P>
   But Calloway can fly. His 4.4 speed in the 40-yard dash doesn't
tell the whole story. His feet never stop, and they move with the
rhythm and grace of a tap dancer.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tackle what you can't grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' Miller County coach Ronnie McNease said.
``His entire career, he's made cuts, and I have no idea how he made
them. I won't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier County still doesn't. His line for just one half against
Lanier on Friday was remarkable by Sony PlayStation standards: 15
carries, 476 yards and eight touchdowns. It was 115 yards short of
his season's rushing total as a sophomore and half as many
touchdowns as last season, when he rushed for 2,077 yards in 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cat was rolling,'' his father, Arthur ``Pop'' Calloway,
said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   The record yards didn't startle Don much. He predicted it
earlier in the day. Calloway's older brother, Selma Calloway,
called around noon to ask Don what he expected to do later that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ought to get about 500 yards,'' Don said.
</P>
<P>
   Selma, who played at Georgia 1993-98, laughed and cautioned him,
``Hey, don't concern yourself with that. Just run as hard as you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon Don's ambition. He isn't the arrogant, flashy type. When
he scores, he usually just drops the ball and heads to the
sideline. But he just had a feeling that against Lanier County _ a
program in its second season of varsity football _ it might be his
only opportunity to bump brother Selma from the top of Miller
County's single-game rushing yards record, 413 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier County defenders spent most of the night flailing and
swinging at his shadow. To tackle him, which didn't happen much,
required at least three or four players. After one quarter, he had
201 yards and touchdown runs of 68, 25 and 75 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, the Miller County stat man told
McNease that Calloway was closing in on Cartersville tailback Keith
Henderson's 15-year-old single-game rushing record of 423 yards and
that he wasn't far from breaking the touchdown record of seven,
held by five others, including Selma.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates kept feeding him the ball, even sacrificing their
own stats. Midway through the second quarter last week, junior
quarterback Derrick Bush had a clear path for a 30-yard touchdown.
But halfway during his run, Bush turned and flipped it to Calloway,
who handled the rest. ``I knew he was going for a record,'' Bush
said. ``I said, `It ain't going to mean nothing to me.' I love
watching him run.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway broke both records on his final carry _ a 77-yard
scamper on which he was obviously winded but huffed and puffed his
way to the score. Then, he tossed the ball to the ground and
rested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired,'' Calloway said. ``But none of this would've been
possible without my hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's a member of Future Farmers of America and has won
a few awards for showing swine at livestock shows, Calloway was
referring to his Miller County offensive linemen. After the game,
Calloway hugged each one and thanked them.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he was in Athens, watching Georgia beat Utah State
and saw highly heralded freshman Charles Grant, whom he reluctantly
backed up for two seasons. In a limited role his freshman season,
Calloway had 100 carries for 1,224 yards. ``He had something in
him,'' McNease said. ``If Charles didn't play here, (Calloway)
would've been starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway thought he'd get more playing time as a sophomore, but
Grant had a monster 1997 season. Grant rushed for 2,530 yards and
tied Herschel Walker's single-season state record with 45
touchdowns. Calloway did make all-state that season _ at nose
guard.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant knows what Calloway does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Don, you can't teach what he does. He knows how to run
with the football,'' Grant said. ``I said, `You only had 16
touchdowns all last year, and you've got half that after one game?'
He ought to be able to break my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to doubt somebody who actually caught rabbits as a
kid?
</P>
<P>
   When Don went on hunting trips with his father, Pop Calloway
wouldn't let him hold a gun, so one day Don, then 12, came back
with a rabbit. Pop didn't believe he caught it, until Don returned
with two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was better with his feet than I was with a gun,'' Pop
Calloway, 60, said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Don Calloway laughs when the subject turns to his fleet feet.
``Yeah, one of the coaches always tells me, my feet move faster
than my brain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway carries an 84 average at Miller County, but doesn't
have the SAT score necessary to qualify. But that isn't what is
keeping recruiters from some major schools away.
</P>
<P>
   The knock on Calloway is that he is too short for Division I.
Calloway, who has a tattoo of a Bulldog on his left arm, is
considering Georgia, Auburn, North Carolina, N.C. State, Nebraska
and Clemson. Calloway said Auburn is the only one of the six that
hasn't made an issue of his height.
</P>
<P>
   He's heard it all his life. When he was little, Pop Calloway
told him, ``You ain't going to be tall, so you be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   And he listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the biggest heart I've ever seen,'' McNease said
about Calloway, who benches 435 pounds and squats 665. ``His height
is a liability, but he can play on any level he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to tell Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's saying to me, 'I'm too short, too short,' ''
Calloway said, rolling his eyes. ``Hey, we all buckle 'em up the
same. I'm going to prove to everyone around here that small people
can do big things.''

NEW U.S. CONSULATE OPENS IN SAIGON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ In the heart of the old Saigon, on
the site where the American ambassador fled in a helicopter from
his embassy roof 24 years ago, a new U.S. consulate was dedicated
Tuesday, a symbol of a new but unsure relationship of old enemies
trying to be friends.
</P>
<P>
   The new beige-and-green building is modest compared with the
multistoried concrete block that was a nerve center for the Vietnam
War. The old compound was demolished last year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dealing with body counts and B-52 bombing sorties,
the consulate is generally expected to grant 25,000 immigrant and
150,000 visitors' visas a year, making it one of the busiest posts
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, here for the formal
commissioning of the consulate, spoke of the changing dynamic
between the United States and Vietnam, still cocooned by an
orthodox Communist Party and struggling to emerge on the economic
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this place, surrounded by reminders of the past, our two
countries will be moving resolutely toward a better future,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the two sides may try to put the war behind them, the
dialogue and the optics of the past still reverberate. A former
deputy foreign minister of Vietnam, Le Mai, was fond of reminding
Americans that ``Vietnam is a country, not only a war.''
</P>
<P>
   The two top American diplomats in Vietnam fought here.
Ambassador Pete Peterson, a former Navy pilot, spent six and a half
years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, where the American Embassy is
now situated. The consul general here, Charles Ray, served two
tours as an Army officer in the war.
</P>
<P>
   They are both big boosters of Vietnam and contend that the
emotions of the war should be replaced by closer political and
economic ties. But a ceremony on the tarmac of Hanoi International
Airport on Tuesday morning was a reminder that the legacy of the
conflict is still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Albright witnessed Vietnamese officials' handing over to a
Pentagon group the remains of four bodies believed to be those of
American soldiers who died in combat in the 1960s and who have been
listed as missing in action. The remains were placed in aluminum
coffins draped with the American flag and put aboard a C-17 Air
Force plane for the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   The search for American soldiers missing in action has been
progressing since 1992, when the Vietnamese government gave the
Pentagon permission to work here. Albright stressed that access to
the Vietnamese countryside to find those still listed as missing in
action was the basis on which the two countries resumed diplomatic
relations five years ago and that it remained paramount to good
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, the remains of 529 members of the armed forces have
been identified and returned to their families, according to the
Pentagon. An additional 1,530 are yet to be found. About 200,000
Vietnamese soldiers who died have not been accounted for, according
to the government here.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in a reciprocal gesture, the Pentagon agreed to open
its archives to Vietnamese officials to examine records and maps to
assist them in their search for their missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Albright devoted much of her time in Hanoi to trying to persuade
the top communist officials that it is in their interest to
finalize a trade agreement with Washington. The proposed pact,
under discussion for four years, would open Vietnamese markets to
U.S. companies and would give Vietnam normal trading relations with
the United States. Vietnam remains one of a handful of countries
that has not been extended such status by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But since signing a preliminary agreement in July, the
Vietnamese have not completed the final accord, even with the
approach of an economic meeting of Asian nations in New Zealand
this weekend. Albright said after her talks in Hanoi she was
hopeful that the Vietnamese would resolve ``technical issues'' in
time to sign the final agreement in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Vietnamese nervousness about the trade accord
appears to rise from uncertainty in the government about whether
Communist Party control can be maintained with the intrusion of
Western investment and the ancillary trends that free trade would
bring, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi remains one of the few cities in Asia relatively untouched
by Western culture and consumption. McDonald's does not operate in
Vietnam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governing Communist Party elite, including Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai, were trained in the Soviet Union, and still,
diplomats said, hark to those days. Ho Chi Minh remains a revered
figure, and a visit to his tomb is a popular excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a trade agreement, which is intended to slice import
tariffs like the 200 percent duty on imported cars and force a new
openness in commercial transactions has severely hampered growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an initial buzz of interest by Western companies when
the United States and Vietnam opened diplomatic relations, foreign
investment has declined in the last several years, according to the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was buffeted by the Asian financial crisis, and the
state retains control of all important industries. The World Bank
recently reported plummeting export growth. About 250 American
companies are doing business in Vietnam. But many have reduced
their presence. Some have left, and not many are making money,

 &HT;    Companies to test 2000 readiness when 9/9/99 arrives
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Much of corporate Atlanta will conduct a drill of its
Y2K readiness this Thursday, courtesy of another potential
date-related glitch involving computers.
</P>
<P>
   The date is 9/9/99, and no, it's not the designation of some
devilish cult. It is a date that programmers for years used as the
expiration time for thousands of data archives. The fear is that,
once this date is reached on Thursday, these programs will shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   Many big companies have prepared for this problem as they
readied their systems for 2000. Few corporate information managers
expect any problems Thursday. Still, many of them see the day as a
good test of their preparedness for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of folks are resting their Y2K fixes on Thursday and it
is smart of them to do it,'' says Ted Fisher, a Y2K consultant who
is secretary to the Governor's Y2K Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   One of those using Thursday as a test of Y2K contingency plans
is BellSouth. The phone company's test is set to run Wednesday
through Saturday to coincide with Sept. 9
</P>
<P>
   ``Our network elements and computer systems are ready for the
9/9/99 date,'' said Rick Harder, the BellSouth vice president with
overall responsibilities for the corporation's Year 2000 program.
``We expect everything to work as normal, but this gives us a
perfect opportunity to drill our contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder said this week's drill would be the first ``live'' test
of BellSouth's Y2K plans.
</P>
<P>
   The company has set up a Corporate Information Center in Atlanta
to monitor how all of the company's units fare. Those units include
local telephone service, cellular service and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The units will report any problems to the center, which will
move quickly to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, BellSouth will share its results with other
telecommunications companies, which is an industry first.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sharing information with other telecommunications
companies, we will have the best brains in the business examining
any possible problems that may pop up,'' Harder said. ``In the
unlikely event a problem does occur, the industry will be able to
address and fix the problem quickly and consistently.''

 FIRST UNION CORP. ABUSES 401(k) PLAN, SAYS EMPLOYEES' SUIT  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal law requires that companies operate their retirement
plans solely to benefit their workers, but a lawsuit filed Tuesday
accuses First Union Corp., owner of the nation's sixth-largest
bank, of operating its 401(k) plan to earn ``monopolistic profits''
at the expense of its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that First Union, based in Charlotte, N.C.,
has charged higher fees to its workers than it has to those of
companies whose much smaller 401(k) plans it manages.
</P>
<P>
   First Union's 401(k) plan ``fees and expenses are routinely
hidden from participants, and in some cases, are affirmatively
misrepresented'' as being waived or discounted, according to the
lawsuit, filed by 18 former employees in U.S. District Court in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The suit quotes internal memorandums that it says indicate an
active campaign to hunt for ways to extract the maximum possible
fees from the First Union 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   And, the suit says, when First Union wanted to move into the
complicated business of keeping 401(k) records, it experimented
using its 401(k) plan and then charged these costs to its workers.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, vowing to defend itself vigorously, said employees
have ``a broad range of investment options which are prudently and
appropriately selected'' in a plan run for their benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, alleges that First
Union's 71,000 employees have suffered $100 million in damages. It
seeks triple that amount, however, contending that First Union has
operated as a racketeering enterprise and in violation of antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that First Union chief executive Edward
Crutchfield and president John Georgius knowingly allow and
encourage conduct that benefits First Union at the expense of its
workers and have made sure that no one will ``watchdog with
independence and knowledge'' the 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crutchfield and Georgius, the suit asserts, ``intentionally
failed to select'' executives competent to protect the interests of
401(k) plan participants.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that Benjamin Jolley, a First Union senior
vice president who is on the board of the 401(k) plan, is so
ill-informed about 401(k) issues that he testified recently in a
related case that he did not know the difference between the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the Fortune 500 ranking of
top companies and had no idea which was tracked by the stock index
fund offered by the First Union 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley had no comment, said First Union spokeswoman Donna Smart.
.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley testified in a lawsuit filed last May by nine former
employees of Signet Bank, which First Union acquired in 1997. That
suit contends that First Union moved its 401(k) savings from
investments that turned in strong performances into its
far-less-lucrative Evergreen funds.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed Tuesday goes much further, contending there are
not just poor investment options but a long-running plan to find
ways to load fees and expenses onto the 401(k) plan that has pushed
costs far above what can be bought in the market from 401(k)
vendors, including First Union.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff in the suit, Sue Franklin of Danville, Va.,
said that when First Union sold the bank branch where she works, it
kept her 401(k) plan and did so in a way that would force her to
cash out and pay taxes now if she wants her money back before she
turns 59 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Union is supposed to look after our money for our
benefit, but they certainly have abused their power,'' Mrs.
Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Gottesdiener of Sprenger &AMP; Lang in Washington, one of the
lawyers who filed the suit, said he was contacted by workers at
many other banks and mutual funds who said their 401(k) savings
suffered because their employers ``are engaged in similar practices
to boost their fee income.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottesdiener added, ``Unless these financial companies have
controls in place, there is going to be a creeping infringement of
business objectives on the needs of the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that First Union's conduct was the most egregious he had
found but that more such lawsuits were being planned. &QL;

LYCOS BUYS QUOTE.COM INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest effort to extend its network of popular Web sites,
Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass. will pay $78.3 million in stock to
acquire Quote.com Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Quote.com, of Mountain View, Calif., delivers stock quotes and
other financial information. About 616,000 Internet users visited
the site in June, according to Media Metrix, a Web site ratings
service.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos chief executive Bob Davis called the Quote.com deal ``a
very logical extension of what is our existing network strategy.''
Davis wouldn't say whether privately held Quote.com is currently
profitable. But, he said, ``Lycos is profitable and I don't expect
that to change because of this acquisition.'' A report from
Hoover's Inc. estimated that Quote.com had $12 million in revenue
during its 1998 fiscal year, which ended last September.
</P>
<P>
   Quote.com relies on three revenue streams. The free version of
the service is supported by advertising, but the company also
offers a subscription service that provides financial planning
assistance and real-time stock quotes. Subscriptions range in price
from $25 to $80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Quote.com also operates a service that provides real-time stock
quotes to the Web sites of other financial companies. About 150
firms subscribe to this service, including Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and
Bank of America Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Lycos will build chat rooms, message boards, and
other features linked to Quote.com in order to create a community
of loyal users who will rely on Lycos as a primary source of
financial information.

 &HT;    HOPES FADING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM THIS YEAR
 &HT;    Adds new grafs 9-10 with White House response to Archer.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's little chance Social Security will be
reformed this year, and no agreement is likely until after the
November 2000 elections, advocates said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's dead for this year,'' said Michael Tanner, who
heads the Social Security privatization project for the libertarian
Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Max Ritchman, vice president of the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said Congress's attention
for the next few weeks will be focused on passing appropriation
bills and a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they're out of here until next year,'' he said. Reform
advocates have repeatedly said they do not believe the program can
be dramatically changed in an election year such as 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bixby, policy director of the bipartisan Concord
Coalition, called failure to reform the program, expected to run
out of money by 2034, a squandered opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one moment in time. It will never come around again,''
he said. ``It's a sore subject for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, White House chief of staff John Podesta did not
include Social Security in a list of priority issues this fall, and
the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee expressed dismay
Tuesday at that omission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will reconsider your reluctance to saving Social
Security this year, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a letter to
Clinton. ``As president, you must choose between employing your
powerful position and leadership to achieve real progress for
America's next generation or squandering those considerable assets
on political victories in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the letter, White House spokesman Barry Toiv said
Social Security reform is not dead, but remains ``a top priority''
for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this president who put it on the serious agenda for this
country,'' said Toiv, ``and he intends to keep it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly mentioned the need to save Social Security in
a speech Tuesday in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to, first of all, think about the long-term welfare
of the country: save Social Security and Medicare; get the country
out of debt; invest what we have to do in education and other
things; then give the rest in a tax cut,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming Social Security this year has long been a top
administration priority. In his 1998 State of the Union message,
Clinton set out a timetable for action. He urged spending that year
talking about the need for reform and the various options, then
convening a high-level summit of congressional and administration
leaders early this year to adopt a plan with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Last year was spent in discussions, and
congressional leaders met for two days in December to discuss the
need for reform with Clinton, but the summit meetings to draft a
plan never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, essentially, was Monica,'' Tanner said,
referring to the scandal involving Clinton and former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky which led to the president's impeachment and
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was real opportunity last year,'' Tanner said, noting
that Clinton had indicated a willingness to accept some version of
private investment accounts as part of a Social Security reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
   After impeachment, ``the president was forced to shore up his
left wing,'' which opposes privatization, Tanner said. And after
the Senate trial this spring, ``Republicans became unable to do
anything controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Bixby traced the collapse of momentum to this year's State of
the Union address, in which Clinton advocated using the projected
federal budget surplus to finance the system into the middle of the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was, we were going to prepare the nation for
these hard choices'' involved with reducing Social Security
benefits, Bixby said. ``But then, having done all that, comes the
State of the Union address this year and you'd think that the whole
hard choices never existed. We're going to use budget surpluses to
fix Social Security. ... It totally took the wind out of Social
Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the Ways and Means
subcommittee on Social Security, said he expects his panel to vote
later this month on a reform proposal he and Archer offered in May.
The plan would use the budget surplus as well as personal
investment accounts to improve Social Security's earnings and
extend its financial life without cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is still a little bit of momentum,'' Shaw said,
but ``it's not a tidal wave of momentum at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he believes the administration and congressional
Democrats are split over whether to push for Social Security reform
now or use its failure as a campaign weapon against the
Republican-led Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said both parties are more likely to benefit _ and the
country will be better off _ if Social Security is reformed now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a joining in by the president in order to
go ahead with reform,'' Shaw said, later adding: ``I hope this
letter will shake loose some help.''

BUSH STRESSES LOCAL CONTROL IN OUTLINING EDUCATION POLICY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, N.H. _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush, who last week proposed a new federal hammer for forcing
improvements in public education, took pains Tuesday to insist he
was still a local control man at heart.
</P>
<P>
   In stops in three southern New Hampshire towns, the front-runner
for the Republican presidential nomination said his plan to take
federal dollars from poorly performing public schools was not an
attempt to put local schools under federal control.
</P>
<P>
   ``My education policy is, first and foremost, trust the people
of New Hampshire to make the right decisions (for their schools). I
keep saying that,'' Bush told about 300 people in a campaign stop
at the Milford fire station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that one size should not fit all when it comes to
federal education policy.``
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the differences in educational needs between two
states, such as Texas and New Hampshire, could be large, he added:
``Those who look to the federal government to solve our educational
problems are misguided. So, step one is to pass power back from
Washington to local jurisdictions``
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Milford audience applauded the message, which Bush also
delivered during visits to an elementary school in Bedford and a
high-tech facility at Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles speech last week, Bush laid out proposals for
reforming public education that could transfer millions of dollars
from failing public schools to private and religious ones.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would require all states receiving federal education
dollars to test their pupils and report the results to Washington.
If a school was rated low-performing for three years in a row under
Bush's plan, parents could withdraw their children and take the
school's federal Title I money to help pay for educations in
charter or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was immediately attacked by political opponents. Some
said it would increase the federal government's control over
education. Others attacked it as a voucher plan, which Bush has
been unable to convince the Legislature to approve in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday more accountability was needed over the
expenditure of federal education funds to ensure that tax resources
were not wasted and that every American child had an opportunity to
receive a quality education.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that ``local control'' was still an important
part of his plan because the individual states would design their
own student tests to determine which schools were passing or
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against a national test. I believe a national test will
undermine local jurisdiction,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent about two hours in Milford. In addition to his stop
at the fire station, where he fielded numerous questions on a
variety of subjects from New Hampshirites, he got a light, but
well-photographed trim at Joe's Barber Shop, dropped in on the
lunch crowd at the Riverhouse Cafe and shook dozens of hands along
downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, a fifth-grader at the Peter Woodbury Elementary
School in Bedford turned the tables on Bush, who has made
educational improvements a high priority of his campaign, and asked
if the would-be president had been an outstanding student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not particularly,'' Bush replied. ``I was a pretty good
student. I was interested in things I really loved, for example,
history.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard, but I wasn't what you would call a great
student ... Some people say, and I agree, that if you can get a C
average, you can end up being successful in life,'' he added.

COMMENTARY: THE MEAN SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For the past decade, Australian strategists
have referred to the Southeast Asian nations to their north _
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand &AMP; Co. _ as Australia's ``strategic
shield.'' Today, Australian strategists refer to Southeast Asia as
``the arc of instability formerly known as Australia's strategic
shield.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a point. When you look up at Asia from down under,
what you see today is a region more explosive than at any time
since the Vietnam War. For years it has been widely assumed that
all these countries, even China, were in ``transition'' from
underdeveloped to developed, from confrontation to multilateral
cooperation and from closed political systems to more open ones. It
was going to be the Pacific Century.
</P>
<P>
   But today it is now the fear of implosion, not the inevitability
of transition, that dominates political discussions here. It starts
with Indonesia. For the past 25 years Indonesia has been the
keystone holding together Southeast Asia as a pro-Western,
free-market bloc counterbalancing China. Today that keystone is
crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is the Yugoslavia of Southeast Asia. Its economic
downturn has weakened the center, and civil wars have erupted at
both ends of the Indonesian archipelago, from Aceh in the north,
where Muslim separatists want to secede, to East Timor in the
south, where 80 percent of the population voted for independence
and the Indonesian military simply won't let go.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations are right to lay down
an ultimatum to the Indonesian government: Either stop the gangs
marauding East Timor, and permit a U.N. peacekeeping force to go in
_ which the Australians would gladly provide the forces for _ or
Indonesia will be treated as a pariah state and its tentative
economic recovery aborted. (The Aussies are ready to put troops
into Timor because they know if Indonesia implodes, the boat people
are heading for Australia.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is not the only problem in the neighborhood.
``Whether it is Indonesia, or the Korean Peninsula, or Taiwan, or
the South China Sea or India-Pakistan _ all the most sensitive hot
spots today are in Asia,'' remarked Gerard Henderson, director of
the Sydney Institute. America's role in the region has gone from
containing communism to containing chaos. The Pacific Century is
now officially on hold.
</P>
<P>
   It need not be forever, though. There are still positive trends
here that have a lot of human energy and aspirations fueling them.
Look at Thailand. Its central bank, responding to the Asian
economic crisis, just announced a whole new strategic approach
``emphasizing new values of honesty and integrity, teamwork,
competence, accountability and efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Singapore's government, which has always kept a very
tight lid on what its citizens can read and say, indicated it may
ease up a bit because it realizes this is the only way to attract
more brains to Singapore. The Asian Wall Street Journal quoted
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as saying, ``We have to create a
Silicon Valley state of mind in Singapore _ creative and willing to
take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Korea's government is dismantling Daewoo, one of the
four bloated family-controlled conglomerates in Korea that helped
sink the country in a pool of foreign debt. China has even
restarted talks on joining the World Trade Organization, which
would open and regulate its economy as never before.
</P>
<P>
   But then, when you look closer, you see that even these silver
trends have cloudy linings. Korea may be dismantling Daewoo, but it
isn't actually closing down any of its companies, for fear of
unemployment, so they will limp along. There have been several
unexplained bombings in Chinese cities, and billions of hot dollars
are being smuggled out of China.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that the two countries that emerged unscathed
from the Asian economic crisis also happen to be the two most
democratic in Asia, with the freest media _ Australia and Taiwan.
The others are like kids who spurted up economically, but never
adjusted their political clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now they are, and that adjustment is going to produce
stresses and even implosions throughout this region. And that's why
this yin and yang, between positive and negative trends, is going
to be with us in Asia for a long time. So welcome to the ``New
Asia'' _ the arc of instability formerly known as Australia's
strategic shield.

GORE UNVEILS HEALTH-CARE PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to avoid the missteps of the early Clinton
years, Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore unveiled a modest
health-care proposal Tuesday that would ensure universal coverage
for children and provide some adults with more access to medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a Los Angeles hospital, the vice president pledged
to make health care accessible to every child by 2005, to give
adults under retirement age the ability to buy into Medicare, and
provide tax credits to small businesses and individuals to defray
the cost of purchasing health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also endorsed efforts to give patients in HMOs more rights
to challenge decisions made by their insurers and to see
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care announcement reflected how unusually early the
presidential campaign is heating up, with candidates under pressure
to give detailed presentations of their proposals more than a year
before the election. Last week, Republican front-runner George W.
Bush spelled out his education agenda during a campaign swing in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may also have wanted to grab some attention on an issue
dear to many Democrats a day before his rival for the party's
nomination, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, is expected to announce
his candidacy in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he rolled out a health-care agenda aimed at
placating more liberal voters, the vice president seemed intent on
proposing a plan that bore no resemblance to the complicated and
massive health proposal devised by President Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton during the president's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans successfully characterized their plan as an effort
by the Clintons to have government take control of the largely
private health care system. Voter dissatisfaction with that plan,
aimed at guaranteeing universal coverage, contributed to the GOP
winning control of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it clear he was not going to make the same mistake,
saying he preferred the incremental approach taken by Congress and
the president after the 1993 debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one fell
swoop,'' he said. ``Experience has taught us that there is a way to
keep what is right, while fixing what is wrong with America's
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most dramatic proposal, guaranteeing health care coverage
for children, would rely largely on the expansion of the Children's
Health Insurance Program, approved by Congress in 1997, to help
states provide medical coverage for young people.
</P>
<P>
   Currently children in families who earn up to 200 percent of the
poverty level are eligible. Gore proposed increasing the limit to
250 percent of the poverty level, or $41,000 a year for a family of
four.
</P>
<P>
   Gore estimated that raising the cap would add about 1 million
children to the program. He also said states must do a better job
of tracking down eligible children who have not yet enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   And in a jab at Bush, Gore singled out Texas for what he called
a poor job of providing health coverage for impoverished children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some states _ Texas springs to mind _ one quarter of all
children are still out in the cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that the CHIPs program in
Texas will cover 423,000 of the 1.4 million uninsured Texas
children by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, during the legislative session that ended in May, pushed
for a lower income cap on the Children's Health Insurance Program
than what legislators passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's office wanted to cover children living in
families that earn up to 150 percent of poverty level, $25,200 a
year for a family of four. The Legislature agreed to, and Bush
eventually embraced, a cap of 200 percent of the poverty level, or
$36,600 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first opportunity the Texas Legislature and Governor Bush
had, they enacted the CHIPs program, which increased Medicaid
eligibility for children up to 200 percent of the poverty level,''
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president did not detail how he would pay for the
additional coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kiki Moore said the vice president was
``convinced that this can be paid for ... within the context of the
balanced budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plans for covering adults was far less comprehensive than
his plans for children.
</P>
<P>
   To help those forced into early retirement he backed a plan
already proposed by Clinton that would allow people between the
ages of 55 and 65 to enroll in Medicare if they were willing to pay
the premium costs that are subsidized by the government for those
over 65.
</P>
<P>
   To make health care more affordable to those who work for small
businesses, Gore proposed tax credits for small businesses that
band together to buy insurance for their employees and to
individuals who are forced to buy health insurance without the help
from employers.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an issue that is dear to his wife, Tipper, Gore said
he would require Medicaid to pay for treatment of mental illness,
such as depression.
</P>
<P>
   He also touched on a hot topic now in front of Congress by
vowing to support efforts to give patients in HMOs more ability to
challenge health plans decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he supported HMO reform that ``will hold health care
plans accountable for unfairly depriving patients of coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore did not directly address the most controversial issue
of whether consumers should be allowed to sue their managed care
plans for malpractice. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans
support such legislation while the GOP leadership, along with
health insurance companies, adamantly opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much of a dent Gore's proposals would make in
the approximately 43 million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But one health care expert said the vice president has to walk a
fine line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at real risk of sounding like he's got Hillary's plan all
over again,'' said Bob Blendon, professor of health care policy at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Blendon said, ``He's got to propose something
because people are worried about health care, particularly on the
Democratic side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blendon said Gore has to worry about defections from those
Democrats who care deeply about health care and may be tempted to
vote for Bradley, who in his stump speeches talks about supporting
universal health care. However, Bradley has not has not provided a
detailed plan for doing so.

 &HT;    CISNEROS PLEADS GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR, ENDING CONSPIRACY CASE
 &HT;    Eds: In graf 4, corrects date affair started to 1987.
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former housing secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded
guilty Tuesday to a single misdemeanor charge, ending a four-year,
$9 million federal investigation into his extramarital life and
allegations that he lied to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, reporters and onlookers who had gathered in U.S.
District Court for the start of jury selection in Cisneros's
long-delayed trial instead saw Cisneros plead guilty and agree to
pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret my lack of candor and accept responsibility for my
conduct,'' Cisneros said in a prepared statement. ``I hope that all
who follow me in public service learn the lesson that truth and
candor are important in the process of selecting our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, a former San Antonio mayor, had faced a possible
90 years in prison on 18 felony counts stemming from an affair he
began in 1987 with fund-raiser Linda Medlar, who now uses her
maiden name, Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, he will get no prison time or probation and
could apply for a presidential pardon. A felony conviction could
have kept Cisneros from running for office again.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement also saves Cisneros from the public airing of
most of the contents of 26 recordings Jones secretly made of her
conversations with him.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros pleaded guilty to telling an FBI agent in 1993 that he
lied when he said he paid Jones about $2,500 a month over a
three-year period. He paid her considerably more, in excess of
$250,000, according to federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros lied during an FBI background check pending
confirmation of his appointment as secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. He stepped down from the post in
1996 and is now president and chief operating officer of Univision,
a Los Angeles-based Spanish-language television network.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who earlier pleaded guilty to similar charges stemming
from the case, is serving a 3-1/2 year federal prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin that he wasn't
sure how much he had been paying Jones because he never calculated
a total. He said his wife of 30 years, the former Mary Alice Perez,
didn't know how much he was paying his former mistress. Cisneros
said he lied to the FBI in ``the pressured and confused fog of the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough for Sporkin, who pressed Cisneros to
admit guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know ... you were, in effect, not being candid with the
FBI?'' Sporkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros responded: ``That's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the outcome, Sporkin said, is that ``we
cannot permit an individual to lie his way into high public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by independent counsel David M. Barrett, a Republican
activist and lobbyist, the federal government spent at least $9
million on the Cisneros investigation. The final cost won't be
known for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The probe was part of the closing chapter of the independent
counsel law, which expired June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the outcome was worth the time and money spent to
pursue Cisneros, Barrett said: ``Ask me in a week.'' He otherwise
declined to comment, as did Cisneros and all the lawyers involved
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Di Genova, a former federal prosecutor and independent
counsel, called the misdemeanor plea ``a win for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Sporkin decided to let the tapes in, Cisneros had his
back against the wall,'' Di Genova said. ``He had to make some very
important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he said Cisneros's lie to the FBI was ``a very serious
matter,'' Di Genova also criticized the independent counsel
statute, calling it a ``very bad law that created a lack of
confidence in federal white-collar law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Cisneros supporters were crowing over what they
considered a clear victory for the charismatic man who electrified
Democrats at their 1984 national convention and who was once talked
about as a possible first Hispanic president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, he's paid the equivalent of a white-collar parking
ticket,'' said Austin political consultant George Shipley. ``I
think it's clear the government could have ended this case years
ago, perhaps with an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisneros's reputation, although tarnished, is intact,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley is mentioned 33 times in tape-recorded conversations
between Jones and Cisneros. He wouldn't say if he tried to help
Jones in an effort to get her to leave Cisneros alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of Henry's friends were concerned about Linda, but she
refused all offers of help,'' he said.

   After the controversy hit, the WB, for instance, announced that
``For Your Love's'' Bowser would produce a pilot for a multiracial
family drama, a project the producer admitted had been sitting
around unwanted for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The WB is also developing the sitcom ``Loose Cannon'' with the
black stand-up comic Nick Cannon. NBC has turned to ``In Living
Color's'' Keenen Ivory Wayans for an interracial family sitcom
under the working title of ``Not the Bradys.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of those all-white new series set in diverse
environments, like ``Manchester Prep'' and ``Wasteland,'' dashed
out to find minority actors, if only to keep the critics off their
backs. Even existing series such as ``Suddenly Susan'' became so
aggressive in their hunt for minority characters that Robert
Townsend referred to it as ``a Kmart blue light special on black
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing all this from the comfy set of his new series is

``The Parkers.'' All-black fare _ along the lines of the
dead-and-buried Kirk Franklin project _ are relics of the past, he

said. ``At the end of the day, which show you choose and for what
reason has nothing to do with anything that can be outlined by a
judge. Or he'd be a network executive, wouldn't he?''

 &HT;    Delta loses finance chief to Amazon.com
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a short ride at Delta Air Lines for Warren
Jenson.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier's executive vice president and chief
financial officer resigned Tuesday, 16 months after arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson, 42, will become finance chief at Amazon.com, the
Internet retailer. Although his tenure at Delta was marred earlier
this year by an incident involving his family's free-flying
privileges, Jenson was regarded as a savvy and aggressive finance
chief.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't considering leaving until approached by
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those rare opportunities _ once in a generation
_ to play in a field where history will be made,'' Jenson said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be succeeded as Delta's CFO by Edward West, 33, a senior
vice president who's been at the airline five years. West won't
carry the executive vice president title.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo Mullin noted that West, despite his
youth, has already held several key financial jobs at the airline
and was briefly interim CFO before Jenson was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin added he has no plans for an outside CFO search.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson came to Delta in April 1998 from NBC, the first of
several outsiders brought in as Mullin retooled top management.
</P>
<P>
   He is credited with strengthening Delta's finance department
through several lower-level hires. He also cut a lucrative deal for
stock purchase rights in Priceline.com in return for Delta's sale
of seats at the site. The rights now are worth about $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson was tarnished by a flap last spring involving his
children's use of flight passes.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta flight at Hartsfield was delayed 24 minutes after three
of Jenson's children and a friend, driven to the airport by his
secretary, arrived late. The secretary had agents seat the youths
in first class, while passengers who'd been upgraded got vouchers
and seats in coach.
</P>
<P>
   After flight crew complaints became public, Jenson relinquished
his family's flying privileges and paid the airline more than
$1,000 for the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson said the matter played no role in his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing in my decision process that
related to anything negative about Delta,'' he said. ``I loved my
time there and loved working with Leo and the rest of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta stock fell $2.56 1/4 to $50.12 1/2 on a down day for
airline shares.

FOR KATE WINSLET, BEING A MOVIE STAR IS `A BIT DAFT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India, Britain, Australia, New Zealand)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  (DW) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Kate Winslet likes to say that she is not one for
planning ahead _ which is probably a good thing, since she could
hardly have expected to land a lead role in the biggest
money-spinner of all time just four years into her screen career.
On the other hand, once ``Titanic'' thrust global fame upon her
when she was all of 21, it was soon apparent that this
strong-willed young Englishwoman was not about to allow stardom to
dictate her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm an exception because I really didn't let it get to
me,'' she said. ``Before `Titanic,' yes, I had done some things
and, yes, I had been nominated for an Academy Award, but I had
never been sort of world-famous. And I suppose, yes, I am really
famous now. But I feel embarrassed to say that because it's just a
bit daft for me. When I thought about becoming an actress, I never
had fantasies about being a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is not that surprising that Ms. Winslet has not
surrendered to Hollywood. Her first film released after ``Titanic''
_ Gillies MacKinnon's hippie romance, ``Hideous Kinky,'' shot on
location in Morocco _ was in fact made before the blockbuster was
released. But last year, when she was already a household name from
Mexico to Manila, she again opted for a low-budget movie, in order
to work with the Australian director Jane Campion (''The Piano,''
``The Portrait of a Lady'') and Harvey Keitel. The movie, ``Holy
Smoke,'' is a selection of the New York Film Festival and opens in
the United States Dec. 3..
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the script, I loved the character, I admired Jane
Campion, I wanted to do it with Harvey Keitel, and fundamentally I
thought the story was incredibly interesting and really, really
brave,'' she explained over lunch in Black's, a small Soho club,
where she arrived dressed, appropriately, all in black. ``I think
more and more people these days go for the safe option in
film-making. `Holy Smoke' is very brave because I don't think it's
easy to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, co-written by Ms. Campion and her sister, Anna,
Ms. Winslet plays Ruth Barron, a 20-year-old Australian who has
joined a cult in India headed by a guru called Baba. When her
parents discover this, they bring her back to Australia under the
pretense that her father is dying and then recruit an American
religious ``exit counselor,'' or deprogrammer, , P.J. Waters, to
talk her back to ``normality.'' P.J., played by Keitel, insists on
working with her in isolation, so the location moves to the
Australian outback, with the eccentric Barron family ensconced in a
nearby ranch house while Ruth and P.J. go mano a mano in the
so-called Half-Way Hut.
</P>
<P>
   Still wearing a white sari and unhappy to have been hoodwinked
into returning home, Ruth is in no mood to exchange Baba's wisdom
for that of a 60-year-old American macho man with dyed black hair.
The ever-confident P.J., though, believes he needs just three days
to execute his cure, and the arguing begins. While Ms. Campion
spoofs her compatriots through the Barrons' comic turns, the
struggle between Ruth and P.J. quickly intensifies to the point
that they end up making love. As the film turns darker, it becomes
apparent that P.J. has met his match in Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Holy Smoke' is the type of film that some people are
going to love and some are going to go, `What is this all about?'''
Ms. Winslet said, rolling a cigarette between courses. ``It's a
deep psychological story in the sense that you have to understand
what's going on inside these people's heads as well as the
relationship they are starting to form. I think Ruth wants to give
him the reality check that he wants to give her. There are times
when you think, `God, you manipulative cow.' At the same time, you
sort of love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campion said she had Ms. Winslet in mind for the role early
on, but she first looked for an unknown Australian actress with the
necessary strength and energy to be able to duel with Keitel's P.J.
When none appeared, she called Ms. Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty clearly as soon as I saw her that she was the
right girl,'' Ms. Campion said in a telephone interview from
Australia. ``Kate was very determined. She had done her homework.
She had already worked on her Australian accent, she knew the lines
for her audition. She wanted to do it, that's what I felt. She knew
the girl. In her heart, she felt she knew Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Keitel, whom the Campion sisters imagined as P.J. from the
beginning (he had starred in ``The Piano''), said he was impressed
that Ms. Winslet was willing to audition for the role of Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just came off `Titanic,''' Keitel said in a telephone
interview from New York, ``and I'm sure she was offered many, many
lucrative roles for which she would not have had to go through the
auditioning process, which for actors is a dreadful business. It's
an ordeal. So, right away before meeting her, I had a great deal of
respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Titanic,' she chose to go where the work excited her.
`Hideous Kinky' and our project were not paydays. I think she sets
a wonderful example for young actors today. She chose the work over
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this work involved the increasingly familiar screen
ritual of a young woman going to bed with a much older man. Ms.
Winslet, who has appeared naked on screen, said that she would
consider it ``pretty weird'' for a woman of her age to have a
sexual relationship with someone two generations her senior. Last
November, just after her 23d birthday, she married Jim Threapleton,
a 24-year-old aspiring movie director whom she had met when he
worked as an assistant director on ``Hideous Kinky.'' Having
recently watched ``Holy Smoke'' with her husband by her side, she
felt that in this case the sex scene and nudity were crucial to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was a bit shell-shocked and I was too,'' she recalled with
a laugh, ``but he understood completely. He trusts me enough to
know that I would never do a nude scene if it wasn't for absolutely
a good reason. I think that could be said of all the nudity I have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, this was not the scene in ``Holy Smoke'' that
caused her the most difficulty. Rather, it was when, having
returned to Australia from India, Ruth is visited by an excited
pair of schoolgirl friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it hard to become girly because I felt I was 30
compared to those girls who were 21 and 19,'' she recalled, even
though she was herself only 22 at the time. ``I think it's because
of the stuff I have experienced in my life and starting working
young and I was about to get married. But I was never fond of being
girly. I was much happier climbing trees.''

LONDON: climbing trees.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born and raised in Reading, 40 miles west of London, Ms. Winslet
was only 11 when she decided to become an actress. With her
maternal grandparents (Oliver and Linda Bridges), father (Roger
Winslet) and uncle (Robert Bridges) all in the theater, she was
carrying on a family tradition, one that her elder sister, Anna,
and her younger sister, Beth, have also followed.
</P>
<P>
   Kate attended a theater school in nearby Maidenhead and made her
stage debut at 13, followed by some television appearances in
commercials and sitcoms. Then, after leaving school at 16, she won
her first movie role as one of two teen-age murderesses in Peter
Jackson's ``Heavenly Creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So off I went to New Zealand when I was 17 and spent four
months on my own,'' she said, ``but the film didn't come out for 15
months, so no one still knew who I was. I carried on doing my
sitcom and I did a play in Manchester and I went back to work in a
delicatessen because I didn't have any money. I then did a film
nobody talks about any more.'' (She was referring to Michael
Gottlieb's ``Kid in King Arthur's Court.'')
</P>
<P>
   But with Ang Lee's ``Sense and Sensibility'' in 1995, where she
appeared alongside Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant, Ms.
Winslet was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting
actress and her career began to take off. She followed almost
immediately with two other adaptations of literary classics:
Michael Winterbottom's screen version of Thomas Hardy's ``Jude the
Obscure'' (the movie was called only ``Jude'') and Kenneth
Branagh's full-length ``Hamlet,'' in which she played Ophelia. Then
came James Cameron's ``Titanic,'' with Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Titanic' was totally different and nothing could have
prepared me for it,'' she recalled. ``I was in a terrible state
when we got to Mexico because I was exhausted and I was panicking.
Leo was, too. We were really scared about the whole adventure. It
was such a hard job because we couldn't let the film be just about
a sinking ship. We had to get that love story in there. Jim is a
perfectionist, a real genius at making movies. But there was all
this bad press before `Titanic' came out, and that was really
upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   After the film's release, of course, everything changed. When
the location for ``Holy Smoke'' moved to India, for example, it was
``the star of `Titanic''' who had local paparazzi in a tizzy. Even
in Ms. Winslet's home country, everything from her boyfriends to
her fluctuating weight became fodder for local tabloids. Ms.
Winslet is currently in London shooting Philip Kaufman's ``Quills''
in which she appears alongside Geoffrey Rush, Michael Caine and
Joaquin Phoenix in an adaptation of Doug Wright's Obie
Award-winning play about the Marquis de Sade. After that? Her
immediate concern is to find work that will not separate her from
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a young actress not given to detailed career
planning, she has a surprisingly good idea of where she would like
to be decades hence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end up like Judi Dench,'' she said with a look of
delight on her face. ``I want to have nice consistent work, doing
lovely things, no matter how big or small they might be. I'd like
to turn into a wise old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a wise old dame, like Dame Judi, it was suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise old dame,'' she mused. ``That would be nice. To be a
dame.''  &QL;

`THE END' OF THE WORLD AS FILMED BY DON MCKELLAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Brazil, Taiwan)   By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we barrel toward the millennium, there's something bothering
the writer and actor Don McKellar: the dearth of good,
old-fashioned end-of-the world movies. McKellar was so perturbed
that he decided to make his own. The result, his feature-film
directing debut, is cheekily titled ``Last Night,'' and opens Nov.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Modestly budgeted at $2 million, the movie, which was released
in McKellar's native Canada in 1998, boasts none of the special
effects that characterize films like ``Deep Impact'' and
``Armageddon,'' two blockbusters from last summer in which the
earth was threatened. On the other hand, those films lack the
intellectual and emotional heft of ``Last Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are probably unfamiliar with McKellar. But in
Canada, his work as an avant-garde playwright and actor had brought
him to the attention of the Toronto independent film community. He
was co-writer, with Francois Girard, of ``Thirty Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould'' and ``The Red Violin''; he appeared as an actor
in Atom Egoyan's widely acclaimed ``Exotica'' and more recently in
David Cronenberg's ``Existenz.'' Like Cronenberg and Egoyan,
McKellar brings a wry, offbeat sensibility to his work. That
quirkiness seems the perfect way to approach the imminent
destruction of the planet in a post-modern age.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar, who is 36, had made a short film, ``Blue,'' when he
was approached in 1997 by Haut et Court, a French production
company with the grand ambition of having 10 directors from 10
different countries make movies about the turn of the millennium.
(Walter Salles of Brazil, Hal Hartley of the United States and Tsai
Ming-Liang of Taiwan were among the other filmmakers selected.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this strange, unnatural pressure on me,'' McKellar
said by telephone from his home in Toronto. ``People kept asking
when I would direct a full-length film, and this just seemed the
right opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was so excited about his new project (he wrote the
screenplay as well) that he forgot to ask if there were any
guidelines. In fact, there were, but he learned of them only after
his film was completed. ``I guess I disobeyed some of the rules,''
said McKellar, ``including the one that specified that the action
was to take place on Dec. 31, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McKellar avoided setting his film on any particular
date. He even went to some length to disguise Toronto, where the
story takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' recounts how a random, though interconnected,
group of ordinary Torontonians spends its final six hours on earth.
At the film's center is Patrick, a snide, insular architect played
by McKellar himself. After enjoying a final dinner with his parents
(Roberta Maxwell and Robin Gammel) and sister (Sarah Polley), he
retreats to his apartment to await the apocalypse alone. But his
plans come a cropper when he finds Sandra (Sandra Oh), a complete
stranger, despondent on his doorstep because she cannot get home to
her husband before the world ends.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar is wary of calling his film science fiction, for these
days the term connotes expensive, action-packed pictures. He hoped
that by avoiding certain topics _ ones often dealt with in science
fiction movies _ he could get his audience to focus on more
important issues. As a result, ``Last Night'' never answers, or
even poses, the question, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that on the last day, people would be beyond
discussing the reason,'' McKellar said of his decision not to
explain how the world is ending in his film. ``I didn't want people
wondering what Bruce Willis would do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors also contributed to what some may see as a glaring
omission.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar wanted to steer clear of blaming someone or something
for the catastrophe, fearing that moralizing would dilute the
content of his picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to point a finger at corporations or the Chinese
or global warming or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than focus on the causes of the world's demise,
McKellar has trained his lens on the disaster's human impact. ``It
sounds very corny,'' he said, ``but the film is about living, and
about allowing yourself to be open around others despite the
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The openness that McKellar refers to is a theme refined from his
days on the stage, when his primary creative outlet was the Augusta
Co., a theater collective with which he is still associated.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, the late 1980s and early 1990s, McKellar
wore several hats simultaneously and began to think about the
creative process in ways that would shape his future endeavors.
``It was there that I began to get these disciplines _ acting,
writing, directing _ confused,'' he said. For the theater, McKellar
advances an imagistic esthetic, but his foray into film required a
shift to naturalism that he says better suits movies.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg, whose unconventional films have inspired McKellar,
plays a supporting role in ``Last Night.'' He calls the movie
``quietly brilliant.'' Naturally, he has his own interpretation of
the picture's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has an eccentric emotional power that kind of sneaks up on
you,'' Cronenberg said. ``If an American writes an end-of-the-world
story, it's `Armageddon.' Don's take is so innately human. It
really deals with mortality in a way those others don't. They
pretend to, but they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortality is central to any film dealing with an apocalypse, of
course. But for McKellar, the issue was more personal. He traces
his fascination with the subject to his youth. ``I obsessed about
the end of the world a lot when I was a child,'' he said. In those
years, McKellar suffered from nightmares, and the destruction of
the planet was a recurring theme. Once, he became so agitated that
he ran from his parents' house to warn neighbors that the end was
nigh. ``I thought I could do something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' touches on that sort of domestic drama in scenes
of family farewells and last-chance indulgences, recalling such
films as ``On the Beach'' (1959) and ``Miracle Mile'' (1989). In
those movies, the world ends in nuclear annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my film resuscitates some of those themes,'' he said.
``Pictures like `On the Beach' and `Dr. Strangelove' meant a lot to
me growing up, and I wanted to recapture the tone of those films.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellar, who will be the subject of a retrospective at the
American Museum of the Moving Image on Oct. 23 and 24, has chosen
to evoke the past. Though clearly set in the present _ cellular
phones and computer chat rooms drive some of the action _ ``Last
Night'' overflows with design elements from the 1960s and 70s. Cars
like the Pacer, furniture made from plastic and garish clothes
signal bygone times. Yet for McKellar, these things are symbols of
the modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as retro-futurism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Musically, too, ``Last Night'' poaches from the past. The
soundtrack mixes pop songs from the 70s with an orchestral score
that recalls the 50s. The songs, like ``Takin' Care of Business,''
were in the air when McKellar was a child, and the associations
remain important to him. ``They have an optimistic,
pre-adolescent-angst quality for me,'' he said, only half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   For the score, McKellar relied on the husband-and-wife team of
Alex Pauk and Alexina Louie, two Canadian composers. Though Pauk
insists that he and Ms. Louie avoided imitating a specific style,
he acknowledges that they drew on a ``vast pool of musical
memories'' to create a score full of foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don was quite actively involved in the scoring process,'' said
Pauk. ``In some cases, he even dampened our romantic impulses for
something more restrained. It's all about trying to extend the
director's imagination in sound, not just mood supporting
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All the characters in ``Last Night'' die by the end of the film.
But McKellar sees them as valorous nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a heroism to these people,'' he said. ``The kind of
heroism it takes just to continue living.''

CUTTING THE APRON STRINGS, A DIRECTOR TURNS TO WAR

(DW) 
 By BRUCE NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ His first film was about a young man's relationship
with his mother. His second was about a young man's relationship
with his mother and his other mother. His third is about a young
director's determination not to make three films in a row about his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two movies were pretty stressful for her,'' says
David O. Russell, referring to his real-life mother, Maria Muzio
Russell. The mothers in his first two pictures, ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster,'' are variously depicted as
manipulative, shrill, even sexually predatory. ``A lot of that was
probably inspired by my mother,'' Russell concedes. ``She's very
happy that this has nothing to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' which has everything to do with ``that,'' is ``Three
Kings,'' an action movie about the last days of the Persian Gulf
war, a caper movie about a gold heist in the Iraqi desert and a
satire about black quarterbacks, political footballs and exploding
cows. The film is so insistently not about Russell's mother that _
at least on the vast plane of self-consciousness where Russell
roams _ in the end it seems somehow to be about her after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie was definitely a step in the direction of hanging
with the guys,'' he says, ``and not looking at women in their
underwear, particularly when they're your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether biting off something inoedipal is more than Russell, 41,
can chew will become apparent when ``Three Kings'' opens on Oct. 1.
``I had watched his other films,'' says Mark Wahlberg, who plays
Sgt. Troy Barlow, one of the soldiers who have observed the war
mostly from the sidelines. ``And when I was reading the script, it
was hard to picture the guy who made those two movies directing
this film.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell was accustomed to the interior terrain of what he calls
``these neurotic family movies,'' and now he was staking out an
infinite landscape in the desert. ``It's fun being out there in the
open,'' he says. ``They would call lunch, and I would just start
running into the vastness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Flirting With Disaster'' had the manic pacing of
screwball comedy, Russell had composed the shots in his first two
films with the approximate abandon of a pointillist painter. ``One
of the appealing things to me about this movie was the canvas,'' he
says. ``This whole process was one of breaking loose, of not being
so careful as a filmmaker. It feels very alive to me, in a way that
`Spanking the Monkey,' in some regards, felt frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   His earlier pictures were black-humored, with casts that were
blindingly white. He has varied his palette in this film, and not
merely in the pigmentation of his actors, but also by shooting on
three different kinds of film. Nearly half the movie is shot in
Ektachrome, usually found in Instamatic cameras. ``The colors seem
kind of odd and bright, and it makes you feel like you're in a
different place,'' Russell says. ``That's the intention. We want it
to look crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell is remorseless in showing where the bombs landed. By
showing exactly where the bullets hit, he makes every one count.
``He didn't just make it count by showing what it did to your
body,'' says George Clooney, who plays the de facto king of ``Three
Kings.'' ``He showed what it did to your family. He showed
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He was similarly unsparing in the excavation of his own family's
skeletons in ``Spanking the Monkey.'' That 1994 film brought
Russell instant acclaim, just as he knew it would, winning the
audience prize at that year's Sundance Film Festival. But the
story, in which a mother and a son enact feelings for each other so
toxic that they result in incest, paralleled Russell's own
relationship with his mother closely enough that even his sister
asked him if that part of the movie was true.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only one. Russell had spent the summer of 1980
marooned at his family's home in Larchmont, N.Y., caring for his
mother after she suffered a broken leg in an auto accident. His
father, Bernard, was away on business as a sales executive for
Simon &AMP; Schuster. Maria, daughter of Italian immigrants, was
displeased that her brilliant son was about to throw away an
Amherst education to become a political organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Making ``Spanking the Monkey'' felt dangerous to him, and
thrilling. ``There was something in me that compelled me to do
it,'' he says. ``It was autobiographical, except the extremeness of
it and the literalness of it was not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember feeling very liberated when I wrote it,'' he adds,
``and there were still great feelings of liberation in making the
movie, reclaiming something that she appropriated, by making your
own point.'' But the point, having been made, will not go away, and
now his mother has cancer. ``It's horrible to even talk about,''
Russell says of his film. ``I don't know where I was five or six
years ago when I wrote that. I don't know if I could even watch
that movie now.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Flirting With Disaster,'' the women are brassy and sure of
themselves, the men passive and comically inept. Even in ``Three
Kings,'' the toughest, most unrelenting character is a female
network correspondent, modeled on Christiane Amanpour of CNN. ``I
did wonder sometimes,'' says Nora Dunn, who plays the role, the
only substantive female one in the movie. ``why does he want her to
be so hard, and bossy, and villainous?''
</P>
<P>
   The film's most enthralling villain is an Iraqi interrogator,
played by the Moroccan actor Said Taghmaoui, who tortures
Wahlberg's character while asking him questions about Michael
Jackson. Warner Brothers wanted dialogue about Jackson's
relationships with little boys modified, but Russell remained
defiant until the day the scene was to be shot. The studio finally
made him sign a document promising he would not shoot the scene in
a way that might be offensive to Jackson or his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Having filled two of the picture's principal roles with the
rapper Ice Cube and the recovering rapper Wahlberg (formerly Marky
Mark), Russell happily marinated in what he calls the ``street
energy'' on the set. He became friends with Wahlberg (``a real
thug'') and Taghmaoui (``a total thug'').
</P>
<P>
   When Wahlberg and Ice Cube decided to overhaul his Larchmont
look, outfitting him in the baggy cargo pants, hooded sweatshirt,
boots and beret of the hip-hop nation, Russell proudly wore the
ensemble everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   When Warner Brothers opened its vast mausoleum of undeveloped
stories to him, a log-line about a gold heist in the closing days
of the Gulf war immediately caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Russell spent 18 months writing a script after receiving
assurances from Bill Gerber, then the studio's co-chief of
production, that Warner Brothers was not afraid to make a picture
that was provocative and different. Then Gerber was fired. But the
script was embraced by Gerber's partner in the production office,
Lorenzo di Bonaventura, who further encouraged Russell to hire a
gold-plated movie star for the important role of Capt. Archie
Gates, a ne'er-do-well from Special Forces who is about to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Nicolas Cage all passed. Clooney began
to pursue Russell, sending him a handwritten note self-effacingly
signed ``George Clooney, TV actor.'' Then, he showed up twice in
New York, where Russell and his wife, Janet Grillo, live, to
prostrate himself before the director.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Russell was plotting to sneak into Iraq for a look
around, another plot, worthy of anything ever cooked up at the
presidential palace in Baghdad, was being hatched on the Warner
Brothers lot in Burbank. ``There was one very high-up executive on
the business side at Warner Brothers who felt Lorenzo was
vulnerable,'' Russell says. di Bonaventura left for a week's
vacation, ``and this coup, this assassination attempt, happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive called Clooney into his office and tried to
persuade him to drop out of the movie, Russell said. Having worked
so hard to get in, Clooney was not eager to get out. He declined.
``The coup attempt failed,'' Russell says, ``but there's definitely
a parallel between the strange world of multinational politics and
negotiating your way through Time Warner.''  &QL; 
(MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he made the film he wanted, he says, ``but every
step of the way, there were forces within the studio who wanted me
to keep sanding down the edges.'' Time Warner executives expressed
dismay at the look of the film, the casting of one of Russell's
friends (Spike Jonze, a director who had never acted before) in a
crucial role, references to Jackson's friendships, the
special-effects cost of blowing up a cow, shots of infections
forming inside human body cavities and a scene showing birds
drenched in oil. (The studio said that dying birds would be too
upsetting for audiences. Blowing up humans was not a problem.)
</P>
<P>
   The one thing no one ever challenged was Russell's central
theme: that the American government had encouraged Iraqi insurgents
to rise up against Saddam Hussein at the end of the war and then,
when they did, abandoned them. ``The whole thing just got swept
away with the yellow ribbons and everything,'' he says. Russell
perceived a betrayal by the Bush administration, and said so in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he was invited to the home of Terry Semel, who
recently resigned as a co-chairman of Warner Brothers, to meet
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate. ``Everybody
had suits on,'' says Russell, who was wearing shorts and a
windbreaker. Bush looked at the way Russell was dressed, and said,
``I'm so glad somebody like you has come down here to meet me,''
the director recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Bush's remarks to the Hollywood crowd,
Russell decided to tell him that ``Three Kings'' would be coming
out just before the primaries and did not reflect favorably on his
father's leadership in the Gulf war. ``You could see this look of
uncomprehending concern and panic wash over his face,'' Russell
recalls. Bush again seemed to be studying Russell's clothes. ``And
then he immediately snapped into presidential mode, and said,
`Well, am I going to have to go finish the job?'''
</P>
<P>
   Russell had not come through the war unscathed: he cut himself
prying apart some frozen hamburgers while attending the Sundance
Film Festival that year. He said he didn't think another military
campaign would be necessary, and then he walked away _ thinking
about the really complex relationship between a young man and his
father.

AL PACINO: NONSTOP PERFECTIONIST OF FEW WORDS AND MUCH WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KAREN DURBIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compact and loose-limbed, with the energy level of
someone much younger _ say, the average 3-year-old _ Al Pacino
practically bounces around the kitchen of his office suite high
above midtown Manhattan. He lives in Los Angeles and suburban New
York, but this is his working base, Chal Productions, the company
he started with the acting teacher Charlie Laughton, his friend and
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Chal's motto could be Men at Work. There are men on the job in
every room, from editors and producers working on Pacino's
independent film projects to his longtime personal assistant to the
young acting student who serves as receptionist and all-around
helper. Even Pacino's hair looks busy, springing out in various
directions from what might once have been a brush cut, and the big,
brown, sad-sack eyes glint with humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shots of hot chocolate,'' he announces, setting out cups on a
green-topped poker table by a floor-to-ceiling bay window, site of
the long-running game he plays with a group of cronies.
</P>
<P>
   An ebullient host, Pacino has assembled our afternoon repast:
bottles of spring water and the first of two large thermos carafes
of the cocoa he likes to sip instead of coffee or tea. (Hours
later, he will apologetically exclaim, ``Food!'' and produce a bag
of potato chips.) He doles out the Swiss Miss in two-finger drafts,
explaining that he's not being stingy; it's just that if he pours
more at one time, it won't stay hot.
</P>
<P>
   As the conversation warms up and his own chocolate cools below
the desired Fahrenheit, he dumps it into an extra mug he has
brought to the table and pours himself a fresh dose: the Mad
Hatter's cocoa party.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the extent of my eccentricity,'' Pacino says, sounding
more hopeful than convinced. He's known for the intensity and
obsessive attention to detail that he brings to his work, and
sometimes he is kidded about it.
</P>
<P>
   While we sit by the window, with its sweeping views of the
Hudson River and Central Park, two men are at work in another room
editing a film. The film is ``Chinese Coffee,'' from a play by Ira
Lewis that Pacino performed on Broadway in 1992 and then decided to
make into a movie starring himself and Jerry Ohrbach. Shooting
ended more than two years ago. Editing proceeds apace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heading into three years on `Chinese Coffee,''' he says,
adding with a laugh, ``If I'd shot it right in the first place, we
might be done already.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of self-deprecation is a minor motif in Pacino's
otherwise exuberant conversation. But however ``Chinese Coffee''
turns out, he has already demonstrated that when you marry
intensity and obsession to great talent, the results can be
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino took four years to make ``Looking for Richard,'' his
star-strewn, multilayered investigation into the mysteries of
playing Richard III and bringing Shakespeare fully alive for a
contemporary audience. He also managed to act in three other films
and two plays during that time, but even if he hadn't, it would
have been time well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for Richard,'' which won the Independent Spirit Award
in 1996 for best documentary, is one of the smartest and funniest
movies ever made about art, audiences and the creative process.
It's also a rare window on the deep work of acting, as Pacino
struggles to burrow his way into the soul of one of the theater's
darkest villains. He gets there in the end, with bells on, but not
before the process has left him gasping on the ground in
not-quite-mock despair.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino is the sort of nervy actor who's prepared to go all the
way down _ or right over the top _ if he thinks that's what a part
requires. Out of the spotlight, however, his shyness is the stuff
of legend. I once saw him come into a party, find a quiet corner
and plant himself there for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted with anyone who had the nerve or a better reason to
sit beside him; the rest of the time he gazed at the floor. He
famously dreads interviews, even the kind that don't try to poke
into his private life (girlfriend: the actress Beverly D'Angelo;
children: a 9-year-old daughter, Julie, whom he is close to).
</P>
<P>
   But those days, apparently, are behind him. This time around, he
couldn't be warmer or more engaging, talking through the long
afternoon with obvious pleasure and sometimes touching eloquence
about his work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather like Borges' metaphysicians of Tlon, he describes his
learning years as a series of amazements: seeing a traveling
production of ``The Sea Gull'' at age 13 in a nearly empty
vaudeville theater in the South Bronx; dropping out of the High
School of Performing Arts at 16 to go to work, only to end up a few
years later as a grateful, unpaid stagehand for Julian Beck and
Judith Malina's fearlessly experimental Living Theater (``It was
like walking into somebody's heart _ the thing was that alive'');
and, finally, winning lifelong membership in the Actors Studio,
whose most famous acting teacher, Lee Strasberg, would make his
film debut years later at Pacino's urging in ``The Godfather Part
III.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacino regularly interrupts his own film career to ``walk the
wire,'' as he puts it, of live theater. Acting in all its forms is
his life's passion and its organizing principle. Quoting a
particularly heart-stopping bit of ``Othello,'' he likens his
discovery of it 40 years ago to finding love:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perdition catch my soul, but I do love thee.
</P>
<P>
   When I love thee not, chaos is coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuckling over the telephone, Oliver Stone says: ``I hate that
you should hear it from me, but Al is a very sensitive person. He's
got a reservoir of feeling.'' Pacino most recently tapped the
reservoir for a couple of big new films, playing a hard-driving
television journalist in Michael Mann's ``Insider,'' opening Nov.
5, and an aging professional football coach who must contend with a
changing sports world in Stone's ``Any Given Sunday,'' opening on
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes are a new breed of worldly young players and a
team inherited by the widowed Ann-Margret and managed by her
daughter, Cameron Diaz. To prepare for the role, Pacino immersed
himself in the world of pro football, meeting at length with two
coaches, Bill Parcells of the Jets and Mike Shanahan of the Denver
Broncos, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sieves football coaches,'' Stone says. ``He sieves them
into the character, and the character grows out of him. He's the
filter. Al has a sense of authenticity about that. He can't always
tell you how he would do it, but he can tell you what's wrong if it
doesn't feel right.'' The director says making a film with Pacino
is like having a fellow explorer to struggle along with in the
search for meaning.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mann says: ``Some directors may or may not view actors as a
necessary pain in the neck. I don't come from that place. I have
tremendous regard for what they do; it's incredibly brave. I'm
talking about great actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he's talking about Pacino, who stars opposite
Russell Crowe in Mann's controversial, fact-based thriller about
unbridled corporate power.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand, the head of research and development
at Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. who became a whistleblower
after he was fired for protesting the company's decision to abandon
the search for a safer cigarette. Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, the
``60 Minutes'' producer who persuaded Wigand to blow the whistle in
the first place by sitting for an interview with Mike Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson is portrayed as launching a pre-emptive
strike, first with a campaign of intimidation against the Wigand
family and then with one of disinformation to destroy Wigand's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   When CBS ordered the interview pulled and ``60 Minutes''
acquiesced, Bergman went into overdrive to restore Wigand's
reputation and force the interview into the light.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent people at CBS and ``60 Minutes'' are unhappy with
the way they're portrayed in ``The Insider,'' including Wallace,
who comes off looking less than stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse Mann of unduly glorifying Lowell Bergman, but the
director says he and Pacino worked hard not to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many times when some vintage Al Pacino moments were
happening and I'd look at him and he'd look at me and we'd both
reject it. He'd say, `I felt myself acting, it's no good, let's do
it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   As played by Pacino, Bergman is forceful but unglamorous, a
typically aggressive muckraker who prides himself on getting there
first and protecting his sources. Pacino may be the movie's biggest
star, but he lets the attention go to the man at the center of the
story, Crowe's tormented Jeffrey Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino is arguably one of the best American actors of this
century. He's also, on occasion, such a shameless hambone that a
variety show called ``Cartoon Planet'' on the Cartoon Network,
which includes fake Italian lessons with a space alien as a host,
translates ``actore hamboni'' as ``Al Pacino.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the show's creators had in mind his raucous Satan in
``The Devil's Advocate,'' or the tangoing, suicidal, blind Lt. Col.
Frank Slade in ``Scent of a Woman'' (for which the much-nominated
actor won his only Oscar).
</P>
<P>
   Pacino can make a good thing out of extravagance, as anyone who
saw him as the violent, chaotic Teach in David Mamet's ``American
Buffalo'' can attest. I still carry a 30-year-old mental snapshot
of his shambling, charismatic young junkie in his Tony-winning
Broadway debut, ``Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?''
</P>
<P>
   But on screen, at least, Pacino's greatest work is his quietest.
In 1972 he embarked on his most famous role, the Harvard-educated
Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Godfather'' trilogy,
with such elegant minimalism that it was nearly taken away from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Pacino's cool, unreadable young Sicilian in the
dailies, Paramount executives hounded the director to fire him,
only backing off after viewing the scene in which Michael avenges
his father and commits his first murders. It is an extraordinary
piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino shoots two men at close range _ they're his dinner
partners _ but the real action of the scene has already happened.
As he tries to summon the nerve to stand up and start firing,
Pacino's dark eyes dart around frantically in his otherwise
immobile face, creating a tension so intimate you feel as if you're
inside his head. The character's whole future, his rise to power
and incalculable loss of humanity, is anticipated in that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he matched that performance with its reverse
image in Mike Newell's ``Donnie Brasco,'' one of the best movies in
recent memory. Instead of the supremely powerful, soul-destroying
young don, Pacino plays Lefty Ruggiero, an aging and not terribly
bright Mafia foot soldier who, in a misbegotten act of loneliness
and thwarted ambition, takes Johnny Depp's character, an undercover
FBI agent, as his protege and surrogate son.
</P>
<P>
   In laying out this tragi-comic blunder of a relationship, the
movie doesn't fudge Lefty's reality. We see him dutifully bludgeon
someone to death and then cut the body up afterward for disposal.
Like good soldiers everywhere, he does what's asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   But in Pacino's beautifully detailed performance, he is a figure
of unsentimental pathos: the little man as moral grotesque,
sandbagged by his own stupidity, deformed by the choices he's made,
yet with a fugitive core of generosity, even integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, when Lefty dutifully waits to be killed, Pacino
keeps the moment small: he doesn't look anguished; he looks miffed
and depressed. Just before he goes out the door, he pauses to
remove his only valuables, a ring, a watch, the money from his
pocket and a chain he has trouble pulling over his head. He places
them neatly in a dresser drawer. At the last minute he thinks to
leave it slightly ajar, so his unsuspecting girlfriend will be sure
to look inside.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino talks about this work with typical self-deprecation. He
says he would gladly have changed his performance in ``The
Godfather'' to placate Paramount, but he couldn't figure out how:
``I saw Michael as a kind of enigma. I had a beeline on him and I
thought, I can't see doing it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   And he credits Coppola for getting him through the ordeal: ``I
mean, he wanted me to play that part like nobody has ever wanted me
to play a part, ever. He wanted me to do it so much more than I
wanted to.'' As for Lefty, he insists on calling it ``an
actor-proof role'' and credits Paul Attanasio's excellent script,
pointing out that it was nominated for an Oscar. It deserved to be,
but so did Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Certain American actors _ alpha males like Clint Eastwood and
John Wayne, sensitive boy-men like Montgomery Clift and James Dean
_ excel at being able to convey what it is to be a man navigating
the Byzantine, frequently brutal hierarchies of masculine power.
One thinks of an impossibly tender-looking James Dean playing
chicken in ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' Wayne and Clift battling it
out in ``Red River'' or Eastwood's astonishingly acute critiques of
his own myth in ``Tightrope'' and ``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Pacino's singular gift to be able to play both ends of the
spectrum equally well. His losers and little guys are as convincing
and as detailed as his kingpins. When I ask him about this, I don't
just get modesty; I get incomprehension: ``You're saying something
about masculinity or something? Macho? Oh, gee. I have no idea what
you're talking about, but that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough that Pacino should do such work; he doesn't have to
explain it, too. But perhaps in answering another question, he
already has. At one point, we joke about the mystery of his
vanishing shyness _ he has, after all, just spent several hours
answering questions with ease and forthrightness. Pacino assures me
that his shyness is innate and still there somewhere in the bottom
of his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he says, ``I think there comes a point where you have
to state who you are. You can't run away, you can't hide, really.
Finally, you just have to say here I am.''
</P>

MELANCHOLY BABIES: ANGST IS IN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: For release Sunday, Sept. 12.) 
(th) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popular music, the id of American culture, market-tests
attitudes along with rhythms and tunes.
</P>
<P>
   For most of 1999, the pop charts have been divided among four
disparate, teen-centered moods: the gooey romance of groups like
the Backstreet Boys, the peppy Spanglish pop of Ricky Martin (who
is scheduled to perform amid bilingual squeals at Madison Square
Garden on Oct. 28), the frat-boy boorishness of bands like Limp
Bizkit and the action-movie nihilism of gangsta rap. Part of the
audience is soaking up sweet nothings; another part fantasizes on
lashing out.
</P>
<P>
   What has been missing for some time amid pop's puppy love and
acting up is a mentality that was a staple of early-1990s rock:
brooding, questioning, self-lacerating angst.
</P>
<P>
   With a buoyant economy and a pop-cultural landscape full of
pumped-up wrestlers and invincible action-movie heroes, pop
audiences grew impatient with troubled rock stars who turned their
frustrations inward, especially when they proclaimed their need to
be alone while they worked the arena circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1999 season, angst is going to try for a comeback.
Leading the misery brigade is Trent Reznor, who has taken five
years to come up with a sequel to ``The Downward Spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Between albums, he has steered Marilyn Manson to notoriety and
supervised the soundtrack to ``Natural Born Killers,'' but Nine
Inch Nails' particular blend of industrial crunch and Beatles
melody, self-loathing and blurted confessions of bad impulses went
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Worked over in studio solitude for years, the new Nine Inch
Nails album, ``The Fragile,'' which is due Sept. 21, seeks new
nadirs of bitter disclosure matched to fine-tuned sonic assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Another forlorn character, Fiona Apple, returns in November with
her second album, which, cantankerously, has a 90-word title. Her
songs provide a corrective to the dewy-eyed, happy-ever-after
romance that has retaken the Top 10; she remembers the ups and
downs and messy, self-destructive details of love and lust, and she
sings about them in a voice with a melancholy bitterness that makes
her seem far older than 22.
</P>
<P>
   The reception of both albums will measure whether adolescents
still want to admit they're tormented from within. Other
songwriters who are about to release albums that are neither sunny
nor belligerent include Tori Amos and a subdued David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   But all those performers have to wonder whether listeners are
still interested in the continuity of a career. From the 1960s
onward, rock songwriters have been able to depend on loyalty from
radio programmers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   But newer bands face shorter attention spans and the
proliferating choices open to listeners on radio, cable television
and the Internet. Having bought one sample of a musical persona,
consumers may decide they don't need more of the same _ even as,
for instance, Mel C. of the Spice Girls (remember them?) releases a
solo album this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks, a commercial champion of the 1990s, has come up
with a strategy to beat the burnout. On his next album, he becomes
an invented character, Chris Gaines, who wears a toupee instead of
a cowboy hat. A tie-in film is expected in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks conquered country music by merging it with 1970s pop-rock
tactics, from Don McLean to Billy Joel, and turning a country band
into an ever-smiling choreographed revue. His less than startling
strategy for ``Chris Gaines'' is to straightforwardly revive 1970s
and early-1980s rock in new songs, providing one more reprise for
people who miss the sounds of John Denver, Loggins and Messina or
Styx.
</P>
<P>
   Since it put the band in bandwagon, pop will also be following
through on current hit-making styles in the new season. Expect more
teenypop sensations _ recording companies are probably scouting
high-school assemblies by now _ and a salvo of tough-talking rap,
with new albums due from Nas, DMX, Jay-Z and Method Man before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rappers like DMX and rap-rockers like Limp Bizkit are sharing
bills for this fall's second annual Family Values tour, to the
enrichment of insurers and security guards nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of Latin pop holds more promise. It has created
opportunities that could stimulate new cultural hybrids, as
Hispanic singers with voices to match pretty faces _ notably Marc
Anthony, the celebrated young pop-salsa tenor who will release his
English-language debut on Sept. 28 _ get a chance to be heard
outside their ethnic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   An infusion of Latin rhythms can only perk up popular music;
rumba, guajira and son montuno have already revitalized 1990s dance
music and jazz. And for concertgoers who want to look beyond Ricky
Martin's grin, this fall brings the chance to hear a plentitude of
more seasoned Latin musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of music from Cuba brings national tours by Eliades
Ochoa, Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez, all from the Buena Vista
Social Club, as well as Cuba's long-running dance band, Los Van
Van.
</P>
<P>
   A Brazilian master, Gilberto Gil, is touring the United States
this month, and this fall so are the genre-crunching rock en
Espanol bands Cafe Tacuba and Jaguares, both from Mexico, and Los
Fabulosos Cadillacs, from Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of their neighbors north of the border, Latin rock
musicians don't sound jaded or rule-bound. Following the example
that Gil set in the late 1960s with Brazilian tropicalia, Latin
rockers bend old forms and borrow from all over the place with a
gleeful disregard for precedent.
</P>
<P>
   As they mash up styles and cross borders, the Latin bands show
by example that pop doesn't have to confine itself to predetermined
forms and attitudes _ a lesson that, sooner or later, ought to
reach the U.S. mainstream.

 &HT;    Questions and answers on the East Timor crisis
 &HT;    By Keith Graham and Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 30, residents of East Timor voted on whether to become
independent from Indonesia. Since then, violence has exploded,
forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. Here is a quick look
at the territory, the referendum and the crisis that has followed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has caused the crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A: Trouble has been brewing in East Timor for a quarter-century.
Portuguese sailors first reached the island in 1512, and Portugal
long governed it. But in 1975, Portugal abruptly ended its colonial
rule. Indonesia invaded that December and later annexed the
territory, an action never recognized by the United Nations. But
Indonesia has had to fight a separatist insurgency ever since,
resulting in the loss of some 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Shouldn't the election have resolved the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not many people expected this process to go smoothly. In the
days before the vote, pro-Indonesia militias carried out violent
attacks in an effort to influence the outcome of the referendum.
After the vote, violence erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the results of the vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: Independence was the choice of nearly 79 percent of the
450,000 registered voters. The vote still must be ratified by the
Indonesian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the main participants in the crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A: The long-time leader of rebel, pro-independence forces has
been Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, who was released from house
arrest this week after being held since 1992. He is widely expected
to be elected president of an independent East Timor. The
anti-independence, pro-Indonesia militias now causing most of the
havoc are believed to have been created with help from the
Indonesian military. Eurico Guterres is one of the most flamboyant
and feared of the militia leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the Indonesian government stand on this issue?
</P>
<P>
   A: It says it is trying to quell the violence. To its credit,
the government of President B.J. Habibie did allow the referendum _
giving voters a choice between independence and an autonomous
relationship within Indonesia _ to go forward. But witnesses say
the Indonesian military has been aiding the anti-independence
militias, and Habibie really might not be able to control them.
Many generals reportedly resent the idea of surrendering the
province and fear East Timor's secession will encourage separatists
in other regions of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is East Timor anyway? Geographically, should it be
considered part of Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, is an
archipelago in the Indian and Pacific oceans, stretching one/eighth
of the Earth's circumference, according to the Encyclopedia
Britannica. It is composed of about 13,700 islands. Timor is one of
the islands, lying 1,250 miles east of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta. East Timor, with a population of about 800,000, covers
about 5,600 square miles of the island. The western part of Timor,
like most of Indonesia, was colonized by the Dutch, while the
Portuguese long ruled the east.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't someone from East Timor win a Nobel Peace Prize?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. In 1996, East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos
Ximines Belo and exiled independence activist Jose Ramos Horta
jointly won the prize for ``self-sacrificing contributions to a
small but oppressed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wasn't the Carter Center involved in monitoring the election?
</P>
<P>
   A: A 15-person team from the Carter Center was among the
numerous international observers monitoring the election. Former
President Jimmy Carter, who did not go to East Timor, later issued
a statement praising the high turnout and the peaceful conduct of
the election. Carter also has called on the Indonesian government
to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should international peacekeepers intervene?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Clinton administration and several other governments have
urged Indonesia to quell the disorder or invite in outside forces
to keep the peace. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said if the
violence continues ``the international community will have to
consider what other measures it can take.'' Australia and some
other countries have volunteered to send in peacekeepers. But the
Indonesian government has so far been unwilling to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what happens next?
</P>
<P>
   A: If peace is restored and the Indonesian Parliament ratifies
the independence vote, East Timor still faces a hard road. During
the years of occupation, Indonesia provided the territory's
administration, schools, utilities and police force. East Timor has
few people trained for such tasks. Jose Ramos Horta, the Nobel
winner, has said the United Nations should administer the territory
for a three-year transition period.

 &HT;    Political battle brewing over new church leader
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It's fitting that members of the National Baptist
Convention USA are holding their annual conference this week in an
arena used by a hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty thousands delegates are expected by today, braced for a
punishing political battle as they prepare to elect a new leader
Thursday for one of the nation's largest black church
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it to be very tense, even more than that, electric,''
said Riggins Earl, a convention member and professor of ethics and
theology at Atlanta's Interdenominational Theological Center.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the tension is due to the organization's tumultuous
history, filled with bitter schisms and rioting delegates. One
member actually died during the 1960 convention after a group of
preachers became angry and traded blows.
</P>
<P>
   This year's session, held in the Ice Palace arena, home of the
National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning, comes with fresh
drama.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the organization's last president, the Rev. Henry
Lyons, resigned and was imprisoned on charges of grand theft,
racketeering, tax evasion and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of swindling millions from corporations wanting
to market products to members of his denomination. He also was
found guilty of stealing more than $200,000 donated from the
Anti-Defamation League to help rebuild burned black churches.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas of mercy from some convention members, a Florida
judge recently declined to reduce Lyons' 5 1/2-year state sentence,
which he is serving concurrently with a federal sentence of four
years and three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a nightmare,'' said the Rev. Cameron
Alexander, a member of the convention's transitional committee and
pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta. ``Before, the
Baptist Convention was probably at arm's length with a lot of
Baptists. Now it (the Lyons scandal) has raised the consciousness
of the black pew.''
</P>
<P>
   And many are demanding change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is going to be on the election of the new president,
and that is very critical to how National Baptists can regain our
credibility,'' said Warren H. Stewart Sr., executive secretary of
the Home Mission Board. ``All of our focus will be on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many candidates claim to be the frontrunner, with so
many in the race _ there are 11 announced candidates, more than
double the 1994 number _ it is hard to determine who is the real
favorite, said the Rev. John Chaplin of Washington, the
convention's vice president at large and chairman of its electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
   However, three often cited as frontrunners for the five-year
post are the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson of Mount Vernon, N.Y., a
former NBCUSA general secretary; the Rev. William J. Shaw of
Philadelphia, a former president of the Pennsylvania Baptist State
Convention; and the Rev. E.V. Hill of Los Angeles, a former NBCUSA
vice president, vocal supporter of Lyons and prominent
African-American in predominantly white evangelical circles.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the mood of delegates will decide who will become
the new president. The question, yet to be decided, is do the
majority of delegates want a reformer or someone who answers only
to God.
</P>
<P>
   Earl said many delegates actually prefer an ``imperial'' leader.
A reformer, he said, will have to battle this notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to be a cakewalk ... followers have been so
conditioned by an imperialistic personality,'' he said, ``that they
will see democratic leadership as a sign of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, however, is optimistic about the convention's future.
</P>
<P>
   The National Baptist Convention will eventually rebound from
this year's scandal, he thinks, much as it has moved on from the
stormy politics of its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention is so resourceful,'' Alexander said. ``We
realize that the nightmare is over.''

 &HT;    Pilots, airline begin negotiations in hopes of avoiding
nastiness of previous talks
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fasten your seatbelts. What's expected to be a long
and bumpy contract negotiation between Delta Air Lines and its
powerful pilot union gets under way today.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline and its only major union exchange
opening proposals on a deal to replace the last contract, signed in
1996. Both sides hope to avoid the kind of meltdown that led to a
strike last year at Northwest Airlines and a sickout at American
Airlines last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's Air Line Pilots Association unit, which represents the
carrier's 9,000 pilots, will seek significant boosts in pay rates
and other contract changes, said Chairman Charles Giambusso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Delta pilots to be the best paid, have the best
working conditions and the best benefits,'' said Giambusso, a Salt
Lake City-based Delta captain who became ALPA chairman last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said many pilots feel ``tricked'' by the 1996 deal, which
included 2 percent pay rate cuts at a time when Delta was on the
verge of record profits. The cuts, which were offset by stock
options, were rescinded this year.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy read a brief company statement on
the eve of the talks, which will run for at least several months
and could go longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with all employee groups, Delta is committed to an
industry-leading compensation package for pilots commensurate with
top performance and productivity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If recent history is any guide, the gap between the two sides'
opening positions could be yawning.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in talks over pay rates for the new Boeing
777, Delta offered $239 an hour, which it said is 5 percent above
the highest rate paid by any other carrier flying the plane. ALPA
wanted $319 an hour, based on a calculation of the plane's
productivity. Delta shelved its 777 buying plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Triple 7 fiasco highlights the extreme expectations of the
pilot group and reinforces our expectation that these will be very
difficult negotiations,'' said Samuel Buttrick, veteran airline
analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Pay won't be the only big issue. ALPA also is expected to seek:
</P>
<P>
   -- New limits on how much flying Delta's regional affiliate
carriers can do on behalf of the airline. Unions view the use of
regional affiliates to augment their schedules as a form of
outsourcing, since pilots at regionals are paid less.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has intensified with regional airlines' burgeoning use
of small jets capable of flying longer routes. Delta's current
contract restricts affiliates to aircraft of 70 seats or less but
imposes no other limits.
</P>
<P>
   -- A voting union seat on Delta's board of directors. ALPA got a
non-voting representative in the 1996 deal. It sought a voting seat
in 1998 as a condition for allowing a domestic marketing alliance
with United Airlines, but Delta rejected the demand and shelved the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   -- Elimination of lower pay scales for newly hired pilots or
those working for Delta Express, a Florida-based low-fare division.
Giambusso said any form of two-tier wage scale is ``illegitimate''
in ALPA's view.
</P>
<P>
   The talks come as Delta's new management team, led by CEO Leo
Mullin, seeks to repair the airline's culture and stave off union
organizing efforts among other workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there is a culture at Delta right now,'' said
Giambusso. ``It's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the outcome of the pilot talks may not establish one but
added, ``This negotiation has the potential to turn around the
level of dissatisfaction the pilot group has right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Giambusso said relations between ALPA and Delta are ``cordial
and professional,'' but added: ``This management is still finding
its way in how to deal with a pilot union.''
</P>
<P>
   Kit Darby, president of Atlanta pilot career counseling firm AIR
Inc., said the industry's prolonged profit upturn works to ALPA'S
advantage. Delta has logged $2.1 billion in profits in its last two
fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots want their share of the pie and right now the pie
is fully baked,'' he said. ``It's a great time to be negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darby added the Delta pilots complaints about the 1996 deal
may be overblown. It came after a grueling financial slump, during
which pilot pay rates had risen three times under the previous
six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, compared to other airlines where the cutbacks were
deeper, their pilots have done pretty well through the '90s,''
Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   Base pay for Delta pilots ranges from $33,400 for a first-year
hire to $209,300 for senior captain, according to Darby's firm.
Despite the 2 percent cuts in the 1996 deal, pilots who advanced to
bigger airplanes or to a higher rank have still received raises.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Delta doled out 10 million stock options to pilots _
about 1,100 each _ in three disbursements under terms of the 1996
contract. Delta's recent stock slide has deflated their value but
analyst Buttrick said the average pilot still will net thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 contract doesn't expire but becomes amendable next May.
Under laws governing airline labor, it will remain in force until
an agreement is reached. Federal mediators would have to declare an
impasse before pilots could strike.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are opening about six months earlier than usual at ALPA's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Giambusso said he hopes that's ``an indicator that the company
may be motivated to get to work and have a deal done by May.''

 &HT;    CEO rises with long-distance industry
 &HT;    By Michael Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He talks fast, flips through papers on his desk,
whirls in his seat, pats the phone and gestures toward the model
airplanes on the shelf behind him _ one a miniature version of the
Citation Ultra that he owns _ then he nods toward Executive Vice
President Tod Chmar, laughs and then talks some more.
</P>
<P>
   He has reason to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   John D. ``Jack'' Phillips, 56, has, during his 17 years in
telecommunications, seen his own career parallel the business of
the alternative long-distance industry, which has surged from a
tiny footnote to multibillion dollar markets in both the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has roared through a series of companies starting with
Transcall America and and is now president and chief executive
officer of Atlanta-based World Access Inc., a provider of
long-distance telephone service in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been on a tear, reporting a series of
acquisitions _ and promising more.
</P>
<P>
   World Access has become one of the largest alternative
long-distance companies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the recently announced purchase of Facilicom International,
World Access will become the largest in a crowd of competitors
angling for the $70 billion-a-year business in international
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, the company is positioned so that its largest
shareholder, MCI WorldCom, just might be interested in buying the
whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom, the telecommunications giant headquartered in
Mississippi, is not only a backer, occasional competitor and
sometimes customer to World Access, but is also potentially a
suitor _ if, a few years down the road, World Access has amassed a
global network with the right kind of breadth and clout.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, World Access is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stephen Shook of Wachovia Securities recently wrote:
``The international telecom market is highly fragmented, with
significant consolidation expected over the next few years. We
expect (World Access) to capitalize on this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   With Facilicom in the tent, World Access will have annual
revenues of about $1.2 billion as it vies for the rapidly growing
market.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips doesn't want to stop there.
</P>
<P>
   He took the helm in late 1998 after the company he headed,
Resurgens Communications Group, was merged with World Access in a
transaction arranged by MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips began his long, crowded career in telecommunications
when he founded Transcall America in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   His intention was to sell long-distance service at a time when
AT&AMP;T's domination of the market was near total.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Phillips engineered a merger with Advanced
Telecommunications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 acquisitions followed as ATC grew to about $160 million
in revenue by 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That year, ATC merged with Microtel, a subsidiary of Alltel, to
whom Phillips sold his interest.
</P>
<P>
   The company was later acquired by LDDS.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Phillips was part of a group that took control of
Central Corp., a pay phone company that was then reorganized and
renamed Resurgens Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company grew through a series of purchases, and in 1993, was
merged with Metromedia Communications Corp. and LDDS, which became
WorldCom and later, MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Now he presides over his growing empire from his office in the
Resurgens building near Lenox Square.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said his company was at one time the only tenant.
</P>
<P>
   When he was searching for a name for a reorganized company, he
hit on using Resurgens _ making it look like the building was named
for the company, rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution there recently
before taking off for his farm in Virginia where he raises horses
and cows.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A: JACK PHILLIPS
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is it that you could do all you've done and still be
relatively obscure in your hometown?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never did run for ``CEO of the year'' or those type of
things. I never had anybody running the traps (for public
relations) here. Most of my transactions required higher visibility
elsewhere in the world. So I am better known in New York than I am
in this town.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Just what are we going to see in the next few years _ in the
industry and from World Access?
</P>
<P>
   A: The rest of the world has begun to deregulate, so the
situation is like the early '80s in the United States. Like when it
became apparent that AT&AMP;T no longer had the monopoly and other
people could get into it. What I see is an opportunity to
consolidate. To grow the same internally would take longer and cost
a lot more ....
</P>
<P>
   ... But the opportunities _ On my desk right now are (Phillips
flips through a stack of papers) one, two, three, four, five
transactions with companies across the world. We are in
conversations, negotiations, talks about mergers or acquisitions.
Europe, Asia, Australia ... (He pats the stack of papers.) These
five represent maybe $700 million, $800 million, maybe $1 billion
(in deals). The moment that someone looks like a winner, suddenly
everybody else wants to get in. It's happening to us right now ....
</P>
<P>
   ... Within the next 18 months to three years we will exceed $3
billion in revenue, and it will come from consolidation of
companies that exist out there today. The pieces are there. As
companies grow, they can reach a certain level and then stall out.
Everything from $20 million companies to $300 and $400 million
companies _ those are opportunities for us ....
</P>
<P>
   ... It took MCI WorldCom 15 years to become what it is today _ a
$40 billion company. Well, this is going to happen much faster _ at
mach speeds _ because it has already been done in the U.S., so
people know how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the genesis of World Access? It's not very old to
have such big plans.
</P>
<P>
   A: This company, we really started in October of 1997, when
WorldCom (the chief stockholder) asked me to take over. Basically
we had no revenue, and now we have created a company with
approximately $1.2 billion (counting the recently announced
purchase of Facilicom) ....
</P>
<P>
   ... This company in three to five years will be one of the
largest in Georgia. How many are there that have more than $1
billion in business? Not that many. We may not have the historical
heritage that some of them do, but at least one of 'em _ Home Depot
_ didn't exist a few years ago either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are you holding on to the equipment business when your
service side is where the growth is?
</P>
<P>
   A: The equipment side is a cash cow. It keeps me from being held
hostage to the whims of the market, if suddenly the service side
has a problem. I can always monetize (the equipment) business and
back up my service play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the main obstacle to (World Access) success?
</P>
<P>
   A: Execution. Making sure that you have the graybeard talent
in-house. You buy a company _ He's got 500 people, you've got 500
people _ but you don't need 1,000. You have got to be very
decisive, cut what needs to be cut. You have to work the street.
You have to make sure you don't lose the focus of the two
companies. You put together a SWAT team of people to go out and do
due diligence and then help with the integration, too. It takes a
separate group, a group to have day-to-day responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don't you have problems doing so many acquisitions and
needing to run the businesses as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: Problems? It's like the common cold. You are going to get one
now and then. You have to have picked some key people from the
companies you are buying now and then, too. On Thursday, every
week, we have a (video) conference call. At 11 a.m., we do the
equipment side of the business and at 1 p.m. we do the service
side. Anywhere you are in the world, you phone in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what is your management style?
</P>
<P>
   A: It takes an old warlord like me, and he (cocking his chin
toward Executive Vice President Tod Chmar) is my pacifist. I'm the
old sumbitch. You've got to love 'em, and you've got to kick 'em,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How fast is consolidation happening? Isn't alternate
long-distance still pretty fragmented?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 400 companies operating (in alternate
long-distance) just in Europe. Those are the opportunities. It has
all grown so fast. Telecom was a sleepy business that your
grandmother invested in, and now there are multibillion-dollar
companies being founded overnight. Just look at Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   There will be _ in the next three to five years _ maybe
half-a-dozen multibillion international long-distance companies. We
are going to lead that effort. And with that last transaction
(Facilicom), we are the largest of the wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The international long-distance business is a $70 billion-a-year
business and it is growing 15 per year. But it is Pac-Man. There
are predators out there. As soon as someone has enough presence,
enough base, enough infrastructure, all of a sudden they look
strategic to someone else. It's the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what gives World Access any advantage?
</P>
<P>
   A: No company has a deeper pool of graybeard, been there, done
that, got the T-shirt mentality and knows how to run a telecom
company better than we do. I know how to consolidate companies, and
I run 'em until they become significant enough to sell 'em to
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you run a global business from Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do it with faxes. I use this (pats the phone). I have my
plane when I need to go somewhere _ use it about 350 or 400 hours a
year. That plane shrinks the world, like the telephone shrinks the
world. But I have worked all over the world, and the hardest thing
for me is to put on a necktie. I can sit here and look at the
Atlanta skyline, and I pick up the phone and call the U.K. or
Russia, and I am efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you comfortable with the pace of change, the path you are
on ... ?
</P>
<P>
   A: You either change with it or it changes you. And eventually
everything will be merged and bought into about a half-dozen
mega-mega companies. How long? Three years, maybe five. That is
all. The technology is here. It's affordable, so everybody in the
world can afford television, cable and telephone. It is coming.

ADVERTISING: A BEHEMOTH CASTS ITS SHADOW ON MADISON AVE. 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VIACOM-CBS) 
(mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reaction Tuesday along Madison Avenue to the news of
the blockbuster deal that will bring together under a single
ownership many powerful media brands _ among them CBS, MTV, The
Nashville Network, Nickelodeon, Paramount, Simon &AMP; Schuster, VH1
and, well, Blockbuster _ ranged from outrage to outright
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal call for CBS Corp. to be acquired by Viacom
Inc. in what would be the largest media takeover ever. By one
calculation, the combined advertising revenue of the behemoth
merged company, encompassing properties across the television,
radio and outdoor media, would be close to $11 billion for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of revenue from national TV networks, the merged
entity, which will go by the Viacom name, would be ranked first,
according to Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media
newsletter. The broadcast and cable networks to be controlled by
the new Viacom have national revenue of $5.5 billion, he estimated,
ahead of Walt Disney Co., owner of networks like ABC and ESPN, at
$4.9 billion, and the NBC unit of General Electric Co., at $4.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good for advertisers in terms of negotiating
clout,'' Mandese observed, ``because of the control of assets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS already has a stranglehold on the radio marketplace,'' he
added, referring to its Infinity Broadcasting Corp. division. ``The
new Viacom will own more local TV stations than any other entity as
well as cable networks popular with kids, teens and young adults
and CBS, the leader in household viewers among the broadcast
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, consolidation has been a constant in the media world
for the last decade, as evidenced by the creation of giants like
Time Warner Inc. It was a previous owner of Paramount, Gulf &AMP;
Western, that inspired the comedian Mel Brooks to mock the media
mega-merger trend with the derisive sobriquet Engulf &AMP; Devour.
</P>
<P>
   But to some leading agency executives, the continuing
concentration of the strongest media brands in fewer and fewer
hands is no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of CBS by Viacom is ``obscene,'' said Jean Pool,
executive vice president and director for North American media
services at J. Walter Thompson in New York, part of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible amount of power being concentrated in
one person's hands,'' she added. ``It's a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reference was to Mel Karmazin, the longtime radio industry
maven who rose to become chief executive of CBS, engineering
expansion moves that included the purchase of Outdoor Systems, the
out-of-home advertising powerhouse. While Sumner Redstone will
remain chairman and chief executive of Viacom, Karmazin will become
president and chief operating officer of the merged company, with
all operating units reporting to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting such control, you can't buy around him,'' Ms.
Pool said of Karmazin. ``It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the media policy council of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies, the trade association, Ms.
Pool has been outspoken on the subject of consolidation in the
realm of radio. In some cities, CBS controls as much of 50 percent
of ad revenue in the market by owning multiple stations with
various programming formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concentration of station ownership in individual markets
drives media buyers nuts,'' said John Kamp, a Washington-based
senior vice president of the agency association, known as the Four
A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work with the Justice Department and the Federal
Communications Commission to make sure those agencies do what they
are supposed to do,'' he added, in terms of scrutinizing media
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS-Viacom deal ``is just the first you'll see in the next
couple days,'' Kamp predicted, as media companies rush to take
advantage of a recent liberalization of rules intended to limit
concentration of ownership of TV stations in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   That forecast was also forthcoming from several agency
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you ask, `What else could happen?' something
does,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom in New
York, the media services unit of Grey Advertising Inc. He too said
he expected more mergers that would bring under one roof disparate
media properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a company, Viacom can now compete for any budget in just
about any medium for just about any demographic group,'' Mandel
said, ``from the 2-year-olds who watch Nickelodeon to the
90-year-olds who watch `Touched by an Angel' on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``it will be difficult to offer `cross-platform' deals''
that span the variegated Viacom properties, he added, because ``how
many brands want to go from two to 90?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To steal a quote from Jon Nesvig,'' Mandel said, referring to
the top sales executive at the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of News
Corp., ```Rupert Murdoch thinks if I sell you everything, I can
charge you more, and you think if you buy everything, you can pay
less.'''
</P>
<P>
   That issue was on the minds of others apart from Mandel.
</P>
<P>
   ``History says that cross-selling has almost never worked,''
said Alan Gottesman, managing director at West End
Communications/Consulting in New York, because ``the customer is
under no compulsion to use the medium'' that is being offered in
tandem with sibling media by huge conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, what tends to ``drive up rates is that the smarter,
stronger media companies tend to do whatever it takes to make their
properties more attractive to consumers, which tends to make them
work harder for advertisers,'' he added. ``So if they cost more,
they cost more.''
</P>
<P>
   Alec Gerster, chairman at Mediacom and another member of the
Media Policy Council of the Four A's, said: ``The challenge for
merged companies is to rationalize their collections of assets. And
for all the combinations and cross-marketing, each individual
property still has competitors, so we can still play people off one
against the other.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bill Konigsberg, president and chief executive at Horizon Media
Inc. in New York, a leading independent media services agency, said
that cross-promotion may be as important an aspect of the deal as
cross-selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If CBS wants to target the 18-to-49-year-old,'' Konigsberg
said, referring to the viewer most preferred by marketers, ``there
are tremendous vehicles to promote new shows via the Viacom cable
properties: Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1.''
</P>
<P>
   Most CBS fare currently appeals to older consumers, requiring
the network to prospect elsewhere for younger viewers for
youth-oriented programs like coverage of the Grammy Awards or the
Miss Teen USA pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The keys for any great brand are great distribution, an
ability to sell the product and an ability to promote and market
the product,'' Konigsberg said. ``Now they'll have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the spectrum from Ms. Pool was Jim
Dougherty, the analyst at Prudential Securities in New York who
follows the agency industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound flip, but my answer to questions about
the merger is `So what?''' Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been convinced it makes a lot of difference who
owns the media,'' he added. ``What sets prices is not how many
properties are united under one corporate banner but supply and
demand.''

 &HT;    Teen accused of school shooting indicted
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKDALE CO., Ga. _ A grand jury indicted Anthony ``T.J.''
Solomon on 29 felony counts Tuesday for the May 20 shooting and
wounding of six students at Heritage High School near Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who turned 16 Friday, next faces an Oct. 7 arraignment
in Superior Court. A juvenile court judge earlier ruled that
Solomon should be prosecuted as an adult, although his lawyers plan
to appeal that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charges returned by the grand jury _ aggravated
assault and cruelty to children _ carry maximum prison terms of 20
years upon conviction. Some of those sentences could run
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Several students and school officials have testified they saw
Solomon fire the .22-caliber rifle and .357-caliber revolver he
carried to school a month. His lawyers don't dispute those
accounts. In juvenile court, they focused on his mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the case will not discuss a possible plea agreement.
Plea negotiations are more likely in cases where eyewitness
testimony weighs so heavily against a defendant, said Seth
Kirschenbaum, a past chairman of the Atlanta Bar Association's
criminal law section.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's really a little early for the lawyers to be making
decisions about plea bargaining,'' Kirschenbaum said. ``As the case
goes on, with pretrial rulings, it will begin to crystallize.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, trials are scheduled about two months after indictment
in Rockdale. However, this case could be delayed as two veteran
defense lawyers, Ed Garland and Don Samuel, prepare pretrial
motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not the normal scheme of things,'' said District
Attorney Richard Read.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers did not return calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to charges that Solomon shot the six students, all
of whom survived, the Rockdale County grand jury added charges
referring to three other students who were not wounded. Two were
girls whose books were struck by bullets. One was a boy who had
been labeled a target, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also charged Solomon with carrying a weapon at
school, using a firearm while committing a crime and possession of
a pistol by someone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to Superior Court Judge Sidney Nation.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As international pressure mounted on
Indonesia on Tuesday to halt a continuing surge of violence in East
Timor, analysts here were stumped by two fundamental questions: who
is orchestrating the carnage and why?
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of players in this sprawling country, which
is experimenting with democracy. The military is divided and the
president is weakened. New political alliances are coalescing as
Indonesia's first democratically elected assembly prepares to be
seated and a new president is about to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop it has become clear that irregular
militias backed by the Indonesian military are carrying out an
organized campaign of terror that involves widespread killing,
arson and the forced evacuation of tens of thousands from the
remote territory of 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear is what the campaign is meant to achieve and
what degree of control the government in Jakarta has over the
people who are carrying it out. These are key questions as the
United Nations and a number of foreign countries seek to put
pressure on Indonesia to bring the violence to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the people of East Timor voted 78.5 percent in favor
of independence from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese
colony in 1975 and has fought against separatist guerrillas there
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That vote, organized by the United Nations, is now, as one
diplomat put it, ``part of history.'' It was unclear whether the
current violence was an attempt somehow to turn back history, to
seek some sort of bargaining power in a new East Timor, to send a
warning to other separatist movements or simply to wreak vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these elements may be involved, but none seem to
explain fully what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear whether the policy, whatever it is, was
ordered by Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, or whether it was
the work of military elements in East Timor that have rampaged
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto is in a tenuous position of command as he seeks to lead
the military toward reforms that reduce its power and privileges at
a time of dangerous instability in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say he may find it difficult to bring to heel the
entrenched units that have had their way in East Timor for 24 years
and are unwilling to let it go now.
</P>
<P>
   If Wiranto is in fact commanding the campaign of violence, he
would be undermining the policy of President B.J. Habibie, who
offered the East Timorese their freedom early this year. That
sudden shift in policy by the president was deeply unpopular among
many in the military.
</P>
<P>
   With an electoral assembly due to choose the next president
later this fall, Habibie's East Timor policy could cost him the
potentially decisive political backing of the armed forces for a
new term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Jakarta does have the power to halt the violence
if it is pressed hard enough, Australia announced Tuesday that it
had dispatched two warships with 500 troops to the waters off East
Timor with the intention of leading a peacekeeping force if
Indonesia agrees to its presence.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, a five-member delegation from the
Security Council was due to arrive here Wednesday to press for
quick action. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Indonesia had 48 hours to show that it could control the situation.
If not, he said, ``the international community will have to
consider what other measures it can take to assist the Indonesian
government in meeting its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, though, the options of the international
community are extremely limited. It is most unlikely that any
military action will be taken without Jakarta's consent _ and that
consent is also most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   And any economic sanctions would jeopardize hopes for the
recovery here that foreign nations have worked so desperately, and
at such huge cost, to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Though the carnage in East Timor arouses moral outrage, the
territory is a tiny one with little international importance. Any
intervention on its behalf must be weighed against the costs to
relations with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation,
with more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In his warning, Annan was referring to Indonesia's announcement
Tuesday that it was imposing martial law on East Timor, which has
descended into chaos since it voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   If the military cracks down now on the campaign of violence, it
will be cracking down on a campaign that it instigated and that is
being controlled now by at least some of its own elements.
</P>
<P>
   The militias that are carrying out the carnage were created by
the military early this year in an evident attempt to skew or
derail the vote through violence and intimidation. Until election
day, that plan seemed straightforward enough.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly and inexplicably the militias backed off. On the
day of the vote, East Timor became an island of peace, with
virtually no attempt made to disrupt the vote. Once the voting was
complete, no one tried to steal the ballot boxes. And during five
days of vote counting in an unguarded building, no attempt was made
to spoil the process.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a real attempt to derail the vote, one diplomat
said, it seemed a rather halfhearted one.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the result was announced last Saturday, the
militias took heart again, launching a rampage of terror that has
continued for four days.
</P>
<P>
   They have intimidated most foreign journalists, aid workers and
election observers into fleeing the territory and Tuesday even
Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, whose residence was burned
Monday, fled to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The militias have been rounding up tens of thousands of
residents and trucking them, in organized convoys, across the
border into West Timor, which is part of Indonesia. The
International Committee for the Red Cross said refugees were
pouring across the border Tuesday at the rate of 3,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But why? With four out of five East Timorese voting for
independence, it seemed futile to try to expel all independence
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation here that the anti-independence forces
could be hoping to create an Indonesian enclave within a new East
Timorese nation, but this theory too seemed inadequate to explain
the tactics of the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the declaration of martial law early Tuesday morning,
residents of the capital, Dili, reported that the violence and
terror were continuing. It was unclear whether the state of
emergency was a serious attempt to bring order and whether it could
succeed even if it tried to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation here in the United Nations compound is
deteriorating very rapidly,'' said Tjitske Lingsma, a Dutch
journalist who has remained in Dili, speaking by telephone Tuesday
evening. ``All day around Dili buildings have been set on fire.
Just after dark we saw two huge fires not too far from the United
Nations compound. The whole city is being destroyed and houses are
being looted. The situation is getting worse and worse.''

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Refined gay policy is not enough
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon's recent refinement of its ``don't-ask,
don't-tell'' policy regarding homosexuals in uniform is the
equivalent of slapping paint on an old wreck of a house. In neither
case does the prettifying hide the basic unsoundness within.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old policy, an ill-conceived compromise between
President Clinton and Congress, was intended to put a stop to the
harassment of gays and lesbians in the armed forces so long as they
kept quiet about their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that policy's basic premise is that homosexuals, by their
very nature, are inimical to good order and cohesion within the
services. That is tantamount to condemning a segment of Americans
as outcasts unfit to defend their country, without proof or due
process.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the ``don't ask'' portion of the policy isn't
being observed at all. Judging from the rising number of complaints
about the pursuit and harassment of suspected gays and lesbians in
the services, persecution may be even worse than it was before the
policy went into effect. It is especially galling to learn that,
more often than not, service personnel who report anti-gay abuse
are themselves targeted for investigation and dismissal, while
those who perpetrated the abuse go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Though still short of the mark, two of the new policy changes
should curb this kind of maltreatment _ that is, if the Pentagon
proves serious in carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to subject all investigations of suspected
homosexuals to top-level review should minimize low-level witch
hunts. And inculcating strict no-harassment guidelines from boot
camp onward ought to reduce the incidence of gay-bashing within the
services. One such outrage was the ordeal of Army Pfc. Barry
Winchell, who was badgered for days on end and eventually
bludgeoned to death in July in his barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia over the presence of gays within the armed services
certainly seems misplaced. Considering the nature of recent
military sex scandals, it appears that heterosexuals are a far more
common threat to good discipline and cohesion than homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon brass ought to find these embarrassing escapades
instructive. What should matter in a properly functioning military
organization _ and what should be covered by its regulations _ is
the conduct of individuals, not their sexual orientation.

 GINA MCKEE TAKES THE ROAD TO STARDOM, QUIETLY AND CAREFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Sept. 12)  
(DW) 
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gina McKee played Bella, Hugh Grant's disabled friend,
in the recent hit ``Notting Hill,'' so it seems appropriate that a
movie obsessed with stardom should find Ms. McKee well on the road
to it herself. It helps, of course, to possess Ms. McKee's
singular, decidedly unglamorous beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Even rarer is the quiet integrity of her performance as Bella,
which commands attention without relying on histrionics or bathos.
``It's there without comment,'' Roger Michell, the film's director,
said of Bella's confinement to a wheelchair. As Ms. McKee plays the
role, her director said, ``she's no martyr to her disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Winterbottom, director of Ms. McKee's forthcoming film,
``Wonderland,'' spoke in turn of her compellingly transparent
presence. ``She seems quite still, quite retiring,'' he said.
``Once you become absorbed by her, you're able to project your
hopes and emotions onto her; she makes you feel for her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' and ``Women Talking Dirty,'' due in the coming
months, should find Ms. McKee, at 35, confronting her own increased
celebrity. A charming conversationalist who draws a firm if polite
veil around matters not pertaining to her job, Ms. McKee, one
senses, is in it for the work, not the trappings _ interviews
included. ``When I first started, I used to think, `Well, why do
you want to know?''' Ms. McKee said of the interview process,
speaking over tea one brisk morning at the top of Hampstead Heath,
a short drive away from the Crouch End home in north London that
Ms. McKee and her husband share.) ``I suppose it's because I come
from an environment where you didn't really examine what you
thought and did; you just sort of moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely what Ms. McKee has done, moving on from her
working-class roots in County Durham, northeast England, to the
relatively classless community of British actors. At 18, she
followed her brother to London and began taking the requisite
courses to hone her craft. Ask her if the move felt brave, and she
deflects the implicit compliment: ``It felt absolutely right; I was
impatient for it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ms. McKee won a best-actress Bafta award, the British
equivalent of the Emmy, for playing Mary Cox, the downtrodden
housewife who is elected to Parliament in the nine-part BBC drama
series ``Our Friends in the North.'' Among the admirers of her
performance was Michell, who saw Ms. McKee at the very start of
casting ``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a quality of unaffected goodness which is pleasantly
un-nauseating,'' said Michell. ``In real life, she's the reverse of
the slightly saintly presence she can have on screen; she's bubbly
and mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to ``Notting Hill,'' ``Wonderland'' and ``Women
Talking Dirty'' grant the actress the leads. In ``Wonderland,''
Michael Winterbottom's odyssey through a London far from the chic
capital of ``Notting Hill,'' Ms. McKee plays Nadia, a cafe worker
whose nascent compassion breaks through the bleak circumstances of
what seems, at first glance, a loveless life. ``Women Talking
Dirty'' casts Ms. McKee and Helena Bonham Carter as two Scotswomen
whose friendship is dramatically tested over time. (Both movies
will be shown at this month's Toronto Film Festival.)
</P>
<P>
   Coky Giedroyc, the director of ``Women Talking Dirty,'' said Ms.
McKee was ``not frantic to please like so many, particularly
younger actresses are. You just felt that she would wrap her arms
around a part, that it would feel safe with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKee is now wrapping her arms around the next phase of her
career, having recently done the Los Angeles rounds for the first
time and acquired American agents in the process. ``I literally
stepped off the plane and was recognized instantly,'' Ms. McKee
said of her time on the West Coast. ``Everyone was terribly
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Ms. McKee, about a profession whose growing respect for
her she is keen to repay. ``I really love acting,'' said Ms. McKee,
``even if what I'm doing is the most difficult thing to portray.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
HED: New family drama comes off too clever, not real enough
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' seems hopelessly caught at cross purposes _ its aim
to be an honest depiction of a contemporary dysfunctional family
gets hopelessly muddled in its synthetic melange of stylistic
techniques taught in Filmmaking 101 and cliches. And what does it
portend for the series that the only portions that seem, indeed,
``real'' are the parents' arguments and the kids' reactions to
them?
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, the debut episode's opening, we soon discover, is
unreal: Mary (Debrah Farentino) enjoying a passionate moment with
her husband, Mitch (Jon Tenney). Given what we soon learn about
their relationship, it's a major triumph that Mary's fantasies
about Mitch are romantic and not violent.
</P>
<P>
   Midclinch, the young couple is joined, unself-consciously, by
their three loving teen-age kids _ Meghan (Anne Hathaway), Kenny
(Jesse Eisenberg) and Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen). The kids, in
just one of ``Get Real's'' irksomely precious storytelling devices,
all chime in on voice-over narration, even addressing the camera to
drive home a particularly cute point; they finish one another's
sentences and even saunter into one another's fantasy sequences.
All that's missing is a subtitle reading, ``See how clever we
are?''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch and Mary married and had kids young, are swamped in their
respective jobs and, in their mid-30s, have slowly drifted from one
another. Kenny's a sardonic nerd; of the three kids, his narration
is the most palatable. Cameron is a extreme-sports hell-raiser who
tears through girlfriends _ who spend the night with him over his
parents' watery protestations _ faster than Kleenex; he blows
through four in tonight's episode alone, which means by season's
end he'll have conquered the entire high school. Meghan smiles
coyly at the camera as her voice-over informs us that she's both up
for class valedictorian and ``I have this killer bod that I don't
even have to work out for.'' Memo to executive producers: Consult
your title at this point.
</P>
<P>
   A lot gets crammed into the first episode. Meghan declares that,
intellectual prowess aside, she's skipping college _ ``I am doing
this for me,'' she declares; ``Now, it's time to please myself''
(when, exactly, do kids do otherwise?). Kenny survives a beating at
the hands of a bully; Cameron survives a car wreck. Mary and
Mitch's attempts at romance are repeatedly rebuffed. Mitch's
buddy's affair (with a Laker girl _ again, aside from TV
executives, for whom is this show supposed to be ``real''?)
implodes during dinner at the Greens', when his aggrieved wife
bursts in on them and, ``realistically,'' exposes her breasts to
all. (With all the boob jokes in this pilot, the show might more
honestly have been titled, ``Get Mammillae.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' trots out a huge array of technical gimmickry that
obscures its human story _ shock cuts and dissolves, swirling
cameras, slow-motion, spiritual-seeming fade-to-whites. It's like
watching a spin-art machine and a Cuisinart for an hour. Dennis
McCarthy's music is rife with moaning female voices and acoustic
guitars strumming sensitively, straining for a soulfulness that the
artificial storytelling can't achieve. The show is brazen about
wearing its hip influences on its sleeve, with references to ``Ally
McBeal,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``My So-Called Life'' (inside
joke: Scott Winant, who directed ``Get Real's'' pilot, also
executive-produced ``My So-Called Life'').
</P>
<P>
   Most vexing is the fact that most of the characters exude a
basic appeal _ one wouldn't mind spending time with them if the
writers and director could just tone down the frantic level of
puppy-dog-desperate, eager-to-please storytelling. Farentino and
Tenny's faces evoke their character's pain exquisitely (dialogue
during their arguments have more of a lived-in edge than any of the
rest of the material); Eisenberg and Hathaway are witty and
empathetic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all their other woes, the Greens throughout must
contend with obstructive home remodeling efforts (with relentless
comic asides by contractors and construction guys) that exact an
ever-escalating cost. It's a pretty obvious metaphor for this
family in transition, but with some smart tinkering (by the
executive producers, not the remodelers), audiences may grow to
want to see the Greens get their house in order. &QL;

`GET REAL' WOULD WORK A LOT BETTER IF IT TRIED TO BE LESS
SELF-AWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in Wednesday night's premiere of ``Get Real'' on Fox,
Meghan Green, the eldest of the three Green children, says to the
audience, ``I know what you're thinking: This is another one of
those smart-ass shows where the kids talk to the audience like on
`Dawson's Creek,' which, actually, come to think of it, I'm not
even sure does voiceovers. See, personally, I wouldn't be caught
dead watching it because there's nothing more obnoxious than
self-aware teens who know more about life's great mysteries than
their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after we've gotten to know every shade of Green
imaginable, Meghan says: ``You want everything tied up in a bow? Go
watch `7th Heaven.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since The WB network spends none of its ad budget on the rival
Fox network, The WB's executives are probably delighted to have two
of their series plugged by the competition, even if they are being
body slammed. As they say in show biz, bad publicity is better than
no publicity at all.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``Get Real'' is more like Fox's own ``Ally McBeal,''
with lots of fantasy/dream sequences, extreme close-ups and clever
lines that are supposed to make us sit up and pay attention. For
example, here's another one from the ever-quotable Meghan, talking
about her mom and her younger brother, Cameron: ``It's not easy
being the mother of a sexually active teenager, especially when
he's the only one in the house who's getting any.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's this little exchange between Cameron, the
promiscuous one, and a bimbo who's having an affair with the best
friend of Cameron's dad:
</P>
<P>
   Cameron: ``You have excellent breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo: ``Thanks. They were a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Which prompts Meghan to whisper to her mother: ``My God! You
could hide Ann Frank in that cleavage!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so some precocious TV teens know less about life's mysteries
and more about where to find a quipmonger. If the producers of
``Get Real'' are hoping their dissing of the heightened reality in
``Dawson's Creek'' and the cloying sweetness of ``7th Heaven''
makes their show the de facto authentic portrayal of the American
family, then they're as confused as Mary Green.
</P>
<P>
   Mary is the nonplused mother of 17-year-old Meghan, 16-year-old
Cameron and 15-year-old Kenny; the frustrated wife of Mitch, and
the insecure daughter of Elizabeth. Mom, Dad, kids and Grandma all
live together in a lovely house with a renovation contractor who
frequently helps himself to breakfast. While open warfare hasn't
broken out, let's just say the lines of communication are
experiencing technical difficulty. Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen)
is having sex in his bedroom. Meghan (Anne Hathaway) is rebelling.
Kenny (Jesse Eisenberg) is getting beaten up at school. Mitch (Jon
Tenney) isn't paying attention. And Mary (Debrah Farentino) is
having a hard time dealing with any of it. (Grandma Elizabeth,
played by Christina Pickles, is the only one not likely to get an
ulcer.)
</P>
<P>
   It's Farentino's best performance since ``EZ Streets.'' And the
kids, especially Hathaway and Eisenberg, are refreshingly honest.
But if ``Get Real'' really wants to look real, it's going to have
to try to be less self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, another Fox series, ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which
isn't scheduled to debut until January, is essentially the same
show in a half-hour format _ and far more real.
</P>
<P>
   Get Real. Hourlong comedy/drama about a family struggling to
stay functional. Starring Debrah Farentino, Jon Tenney, Jesse
Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Eric Christian Olsen and Christina
Pickles. Series premiere Wednesday night on Fox. Parental guideline
rating: TV-14.

FOX FAMILY SERIES DOESN'T FEEL REAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Get Real'' seems hopelessly caught at cross
purposes _ its aim to be an honest depiction of a contemporary
dysfunctional family gets hopelessly muddled in its synthetic
melange of stylistic techniques taught in Filmmaking 101 and
cliches. And what does it portend for the series that the only
portions that seem, indeed, ``real'' are the parents' arguments and
the kids' reactions to them?
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, the debut episode's opening, we soon discover, is
unreal: Mary (Debrah Farentino) enjoying a passionate moment with
her husband, Mitch (Jon Tenney). Given what we soon learn about
their relationship, it's a major triumph that Mary's fantasies
about Mitch are romantic and not violent.
</P>
<P>
   Midclinch, the young couple is joined, unself-consciously, by
their three loving teen-age kids _ Meghan (Anne Hathaway), Kenny
(Jesse Eisenberg) and Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen). The kids, in
just one of ``Get Real's'' irksomely precious storytelling devices,
all chime in on voice-over narration, even addressing the camera to
drive home a particularly cute point; they finish one another's
sentences and even saunter into one another's fantasy sequences.
All that's missing is a subtitle reading, ``See how clever we
are?''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch and Mary married and had kids young, are swamped in their
respective jobs and, in their mid-30s, have slowly drifted from one
another. Kenny's a sardonic nerd; of the three kids, his narration
is the most palatable. Cameron is a extreme-sports hell-raiser who
tears through girlfriends _ who spend the night with him over his
parents' watery protestations _ faster than Kleenex; he blows
through four in tonight's episode alone, which means by season's
end he'll have conquered the entire high school. Meghan smiles
coyly at the camera as her voice-over informs us that she's both up
for class valedictorian and ``I have this killer bod that I don't
even have to work out for.'' Memo to executive producers: Consult
your title at this point.
</P>
<P>
   A lot gets crammed into the first episode. Meghan declares that,
intellectual prowess aside, she's skipping college _ ``I am doing
this for me,'' she declares; ``Now, it's time to please myself''
(when, exactly, do kids do otherwise?). Kenny survives a beating at
the hands of a bully; Cameron survives a car wreck. Mary and
Mitch's attempts at romance are repeatedly rebuffed. Mitch's
buddy's affair (with a Laker girl _ again, aside from TV
executives, for whom is this show supposed to be ``real''?)
implodes during dinner at the Greens', when his aggrieved wife
bursts in on them and, ``realistically,'' exposes her breasts to
all. (With all the boob jokes in this pilot, the show might more
honestly have been titled, ``Get Mammillae.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' trots out a huge array of technical gimmickry that
obscures its human story _ shock cuts and dissolves, swirling
cameras, slow-motion, spiritual-seeming fade-to-whites. It's like
watching a spin-art machine and a Cuisinart for an hour. Dennis
McCarthy's music is rife with moaning female voices and acoustic
guitars strumming sensitively, straining for a soulfulness that the
artificial storytelling can't achieve. The show is brazen about
wearing its hip influences on its sleeve, with references to ``Ally
McBeal,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``My So-Called Life'' (inside
joke: Scott Winant, who directed ``Get Real's'' pilot, also
executive-produced ``My So-Called Life'').
</P>
<P>
   Most vexing is the fact that most of the characters exude a
basic appeal _ one wouldn't mind spending time with them if the
writers and director could just tone down the frantic level of
puppy-dog-desperate, eager-to-please storytelling. Farentino and
Tenny's faces evoke their character's pain exquisitely (dialogue
during their arguments have more of a lived-in edge than any of the
rest of the material); Eisenberg and Hathaway are witty and
empathetic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all their other woes, the Greens throughout must
contend with obstructive home remodeling efforts (with relentless
comic asides by contractors and construction guys) that exact an
ever-escalating cost. It's a pretty obvious metaphor for this
family in transition, but with some smart tinkering (by the
executive producers, not the remodelers), audiences may grow to
want to see the Greens get their house in order. &QL;

UN CONSIDERS PEACEKEEPING ROLE AS EAST TIMOR VIOLENCE SURGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ With the capital city ablaze and gunfire shattering
the night, systematic violence escalated in the disputed territory
of East Timor Tuesday despite Indonesia's announcement that it had
imposed martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the movement seeking independence for the region,
along with a Catholic bishop who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner,
begged the international community to send in peacekeeping forces
to restore order despite continued opposition by Indonesia, which
annexed East Timor 23 years ago and insisted Tuesday it could
maintain control.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian authorities said they had ordered soldiers to shoot
on sight anyone violating an unspecified curfew. But a week after
79 percent of the people of East Timor voted in favor of
independence from Indonesia, rogue elements of the military
appeared to be intensifying a campaign to destroy the region's
infrastructure and forcibly relocate its people.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Security Council said it would make no decision on a
peacekeeping force until it heard from five UN ambassadors sent to
Jakarta last weekend to persuade Indonesia either to control the
violence or invite in foreign peacekeepers. Once authorized, forces
from volunteer nations could be deployed within 72 hours, said UN
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has told Australian and United Nations
officials that it is ready to commit troops to a peacekeeping
force, a Clinton administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very quietly, we said we would assist them if the
international community wants to move,'' said the US official.
``Australia would probably be the lead country, and we told them we
could possibly throw in with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said while exact numbers of US troops haven't been
decided, the most likely ground troops to participate would come
from the Okinawa island base. The official said US aircraft would
be available from central Japan. A second option for ground troops
would be a small US army division in Hawaii, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is going to be very tricky,'' the official
said. Indonesian President B.J. ``Habibie is in a really shaky
position, . . . and there's concern now that this could lead to
much greater destabilization in Indonesia if the violence in East
Timor continues to erupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia offered to lead a peacekeeping force and contribute
2,000 to 4,000 soldiers. Portugal, France and Britain also said
they would support a UN force, but no one seemed willing yet to
deploy troops against the wishes of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Dili, the capital of the disputed island territory,
said armed men believed to be linked to the military torched the
university, the court house, and telecommunications facilities.
Soldiers marched thousands of East Timorese to Dili's docks, firing
shots over their heads and forcing them to board ships leaving the
province, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what the difference is'' under martial
law, said a UN official interviewed by telephone from Dili, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The military was ``in control
before, and they are in control now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian military commander General Wiranto again rejected
calls for an outside force, saying, ``We have all the capability to
handle the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats were increasingly skeptical, however, and some likened
the deployment of more Indonesian troops to sending foxes to guard
the chicken coop. Wiranto's inability to curb the violence, they
said, hinted at a split within the military and a campaign by rogue
elements to overturn the vote _ or to cripple East Timor to the
point where independence would be irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   As the international community considered its response and gave
Indonesia 48 hours to stop the violence, a quarter to a third of
East Timor's population of 870,000 was fleeing or being forced out
of the territory, said a UN spokesman in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees poured into the neighboring province of West Timor at a
rate of 1,000 per hour on Monday, the International Committee of
the Red Cross said. Reports of mass killings surfaced repeatedly
but could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from New York, Nobel Peace Prize winner and resistance
leader Jose Ramos Horta accused gunmen associated with the military
of ``a Serbian-style emptying of villages.'' He said an Indonesian
source told him, ``One day when you come back to your country, it
will be a country of widows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wiranto is getting ignored'' by the military's special forces
branch, Kopassus, which is led by rival generals, Ramos Horta
asserted. ``If the US does not intervene forcefully, there is going
to be a major humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Navy said Tuesday it dispatched a catamaran
carrying an estimated 100 troops into international waters off East
Timor, 400 miles north of Australia, to evacuate Australian
nationals if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian police, meanwhile, fired automatic weapons at the
United Nations office in the eastern town of Baucau, UN officials
said. The Associated Press said 200 UN workers and 2,500 East
Timorese were trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 UN staff and aid workers, as well as the
territory's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Ximenes
Belo, were airlifted out of Baucau to Darwin, Australia Tuesday,
but a UN spokeswoman said the gunmen prevented any UN workers who
were East Timorese natives from boarding the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Belo, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with Ramos Horta,
said he would fly to Rome to meet with Pope John Paul II. ``Now,
more than ever, we need an international peace force,'' Belo said.
</P>
<P>
   Belo's home was shot up Monday and thousands of people who had
sought shelter there were herded away. Sources said the home of
Baucau Bishop Basilio de Nascimento was burned Tuesday, but the
report could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   A UN official interviewed by telephone from Dili said all eight
regional UN offices had been forced to close, and 300 international
UN staff, of an original 1,200, remain. They were hunkered down
with 1,500 East Timorese refugees and a handful of journalists in
the UN headquarters in Dili, where electricity and telephones were
cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, Indonesia freed East Timorese rebel leader Jose
Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao Tuesday after seven years of a 20-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise as a free man I will do everything to bring peace to
East Timor and its people,'' said a beaming Gusmao, 53, a former
priest, poet and guerrilla considered the likely first president of
an independent East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a suit and tie instead of his customary guerrilla
fatigues, Gusmao moved temporarily to the British Embassy in
Jakarta, rather than return to Dili and almost certain death while
anti-independence gunmen are in control.
</P>
<P>
   One pro-Indonesia militia leader Herminio da Silva Costa,
speaking from the West Timor capital of Kupang, told Reuters news
service, ``We will burn (East Timor) down and start all over again
. . . we are ready to go the jungles for 20 years.''

 &HT;    RENO ASKS DANFORTH TO HEAD WACO PROBE
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has asked retired
Republican Sen. John Danforth _ an Episcopal priest and former
attorney general of Missouri _ to investigate FBI actions during
and after the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound near
Waco, Texas, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the job offer was informal and ``no final deal
has been reached,'' the official said details of the scope of the
independent probe are still being worked out, but that the
appointment could be announced within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has recently talked to several potential investigators and,
for now at least, Danforth ``has emerged as the guy,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Reno promised an outside investigation after new evidence
emerged that FBI agents fired pyrotechnic tear gas grenades as it
ended a 51-day siege of the religious sect. For six years, federal
officials had denied that the military-issue canisters were used in
the April 19, 1993, assault that ended in deaths of Branch Davidian
leader David Koresh and 75 of his followers, including 21 children.
</P>
<P>
   As Danforth emerged as a top candidate for the job, many
commentators have said he could bring credibility to a case fraught
with religious and ideological suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, was regarded as politically independent during his
three terms in the Senate. After serving for two years as
co-chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax
Reform, he left the Senate after the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation as a non-partisan moderate, Danforth was
a central figure in one of the Senate's most bitter political and
ideological partisan battles of the decade _ the confirmation of
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. A longtime personal friend of
Thomas, Danforth served as the nominee's principal sponsor during
the televised hearings before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Danforth could quiet Republican calls for
congressional hearings into the Waco incident.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a mistake, said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member
of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inquiry run by the Department of Justice _ no matter who is
named to head it _ is not substitute for public hearings before
Congress,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had suggested Atlanta attorney Griffin Bell for the
job, Barr said he has ``no problem'' with Danforth heading the
outside probe. But Barr stressed that Congress must also act.
</P>
<P>
   Any investigation ``conducted predominantly behind closed
doors'' would not ``assure the American public the truth is being
told about Waco,'' said Barr. ``In fact, it would have the opposite
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her search for an outside investigator last week
amid Republican calls for her resignation, Reno said she was
looking for someone who ``has no conflicts, would be well-received
and has the time to handle the task in an appropriate manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth would appear to fit the bill. Before entering the
Senate, he was attorney general in Missouri for eight years before
entering the Senate. Upon leaving Capitol Hill, he returned to St.
Louis and has practiced law and served as chairman of St. Louis
2004, a regional revitalization project.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In another development in the Waco case, a former CIA official
has sought congressional protection from alleged government
intimidation as a whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Cullen, who publicly charged that secret Army Delta Force
personnel were present during the assault on the Davidian compound,
has appealed for assistance from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who
chairs the Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Grassley has not decided whether to take Mr. Cullen
under his wing, but he has agreed to talk to him,'' said the
senator's press secretary, Jill Kozeny. ``If his story is credible
and if he's being pressured for any reason that's improper, then
Senator Grassley would work to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator has a history of defending whistle-blowers. However,
Cullen would need a vote of the full Judiciary Committee to be
granted immunity from charges of breaking his secrecy agreement
with the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Dallas Morning News last month, Cullen
said he had worked with three members of the Delta Force who gave
detailed descriptions of their role in the tear-gas assault on the
Davidians. A direct military role would be in conflict with federal
law forbidding U.S. troops to participate in civilian law
enforcement.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Refined gay policy is not enough
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to reflect Atlanta Constitution in tagline.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon's recent refinement of its ``don't-ask,
don't-tell'' policy regarding homosexuals in uniform is the
equivalent of slapping paint on an old wreck of a house. In neither
case does the prettifying hide the basic unsoundness within.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old policy, an ill-conceived compromise between
President Clinton and Congress, was intended to put a stop to the
harassment of gays and lesbians in the armed forces so long as they
kept quiet about their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that policy's basic premise is that homosexuals, by their
very nature, are inimical to good order and cohesion within the
services. That is tantamount to condemning a segment of Americans
as outcasts unfit to defend their country, without proof or due
process.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the ``don't ask'' portion of the policy isn't
being observed at all. Judging from the rising number of complaints
about the pursuit and harassment of suspected gays and lesbians in
the services, persecution may be even worse than it was before the
policy went into effect. It is especially galling to learn that,
more often than not, service personnel who report anti-gay abuse
are themselves targeted for investigation and dismissal, while
those who perpetrated the abuse go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Though still short of the mark, two of the new policy changes
should curb this kind of maltreatment _ that is, if the Pentagon
proves serious in carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to subject all investigations of suspected
homosexuals to top-level review should minimize low-level witch
hunts. And inculcating strict no-harassment guidelines from boot
camp onward ought to reduce the incidence of gay-bashing within the
services. One such outrage was the ordeal of Army Pfc. Barry
Winchell, who was badgered for days on end and eventually
bludgeoned to death in July in his barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia over the presence of gays within the armed services
certainly seems misplaced. Considering the nature of recent
military sex scandals, it appears that heterosexuals are a far more
common threat to good discipline and cohesion than homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon brass ought to find these embarrassing escapades
instructive. What should matter in a properly functioning military
organization _ and what should be covered by its regulations _ is
the conduct of individuals, not their sexual orientation.

 &HT;    Air travel at low point
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For frequent flyers, this has been one long, hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Delays have been more numerous and of greater duration than
ever. Once aloft, overcrowded airplanes feel more like a Calcutta
transit bus than the airline experience of now-fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   It's not your imagination: The Federal Aviation Administration
reports that delays through August were up 20 percent over the same
period last year. July was particularly brutal for air travelers,
who saw a 70 percent increase in delays over July 1998. (Any flight
more than 15 minutes late is considered delayed.)
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have blamed the mess on the FAA and its management
of the air traffic control system. The FAA, until last week,
staunchly defended its creaking system and instead blamed the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Weather is, indeed, behind about 75 percent of the delays. But a
Sept. 1 report from the FAA indicates that the agency itself is
behind a large share of the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 34 air traffic control operations, done in
conjunction with the airlines, cites a number of factors, including
poor communication between regional control centers and the
agency's national command center in Herndon, Va.; plans to avoid
severe weather that were too slow to be implemented and poorly
coordinated; controllers who space planes dozens of miles apart not
for safety reasons, but for their own convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The report is an eye-opener, making plain the true miracle of
modern aviation: Given antiquated technology and the continued
adherence to a 1960s route structure designed for far less traffic,
it's a wonder the system can handle its 56,000 daily flights at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Delta CEO Leo Mullin says bluntly. ``The
aviation system right now ain't working.''
</P>
<P>
   But the airlines aren't by any means blameless for the passenger
discontent. The major carriers continue to deliberately overbook
flights, knowing some passengers will get bumped and that those who
do fly will be cramped. They still cancel flights with little
notice when flights are underbooked. Meals these days come not on
warm plates but in cold paper bags not unlike those dispensed for
less savory purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA can and should work to increase dramatically the
efficiency of air-traffic management. FAA Administrator Jane Garvey
took a step in that direction last month by shifting authority from
regional centers, which sometimes caused nationwide backups by
focusing too narrowly on their own sectors, to the national center.
But more dramatic action is needed, including a complete rethinking
of traffic management that will allow airlines to take advantage of
new technology making it possible for pilots to choose their own
fastest, safest route under FAA guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The American public also must acknowledge the role played by its
own, often unrealistic, expectations for air service. We want it
safe, but we want it fast. We want it cheap, but we want the
roominess of half-empty planes. We not only want the right to
carry-on steamer trunks, we also expect seats to swell in concert
with our expanding posteriors. (A recent New York Times piece
suggests that coach seats on the large jets are, in fact, a tad
wider now than in years past.)
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that air passengers and Congress should not
continue to press the FAA and airlines for the greatest, most
customer-friendly efficiency possible. But sooner or later _ and
more likely, sooner _ we'll have to come to grips with the fact
that as long as the economy is good and air fares relatively cheap,
air-traffic jams and crowded seating will be a permanent fact of
life.

U.S. AND FORD SETTLE HARASSMENT CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (With FORD-DOCUMENTS) 
(nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Ford Motor Co. reached a settlement on Tuesday
with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, agreeing to
pay nearly $8 million in damages to as many as 900 women who
complained of racial and sexual harassment at two Ford factories.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the largest the commission has reached with an
automaker based in the United States and the fourth largest in the
commission's history. It also calls for 30 percent of the
supervisory positions at the plants, which are in Chicago and
Chicago Heights, to be held by women within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The commission began an investigation based on harassment
complaints by 19 black, white and Hispanic women at the two plants.
The women said they had been subjected to a hostile work
environment, including obscene graffiti, verbal and physical
harassment by fellow employees and retaliation against women who
reported such conduct. The complaints dated back to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement calls for Ford to set up a $7.5-million
fund, which will pay damages to settle complaints by up to 900
women. In addition, Ford has pledged $10 million to further train
its employees nationwide on preventing job discrimination and
harassment. Two of the original 19 women whose complaints prompted
the investigation have agreed to the settlement and will split an
additional $250,000. The other 17 rejected the deal, saying they
intend to sue the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Padilla, Ford's group vice president for manufacturing,
said, ``This agreement further strengthens Ford's longstanding
policy of zero tolerance and will help move us toward our goal of
zero occurrence of harassment of any kind in our facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ida L. Castro, chairman of the commission, said the agreement
``will not only better the lives of the female employees at Ford,
but will also serve as a model to employers nationwide who are
committed to providing harassment-free environments to their
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-member panel will oversee the agreement. The panel,
consisting of one Ford appointee, one commission appointee and a
member chosen by the first two appointees, will award damages to
women who file claims.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the second major harassment case that the
commission has settled with automakers in two years. Last year, the
Mitsubishi Motor Corp.'s American subsidiary agreed to pay $34
million to workers in Chicago, the largest such settlement with the
commission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing the settlement, Padilla was
confronted by one of the women who had complained of harassment. He
responded, ``Certainly to the extent that any one of our employees
has felt an environment that treated them with less than full
dignity, we apologize.''

VIACOM-CBS UNION CREATES WORLD-CLASS MEDIA PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest media marriage in history Tuesday brought together
Viacom Inc. and CBS in a $37.7 billion merger that creates a new
global conglomerate with a vast presence in television, movies,
radio, books, and billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling a sweeping consolidation in ownership of the production
of entertainment and news, Viacom, founded by Newton, Mass. native
Sumner M. Redstone, will join Time Warner, Disney-ABC, and Rupert
Murdoch's empire as a top-ranking world media titan.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust rules may force Viacom to unload an undetermined
number of television stations, and perhaps its 50 percent stake in
the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS and Viacom officials were bullish the merger will go
through early next year. They said they will be in Washington
Wednesday to lobby federal regulators to ease rules that would
require divestment of TV stations and UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will create an $80 billion giant,'' Redstone told reporters
at a New York news conference Tuesday, calling the combination ``a
momentous occasion in the life of the media industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Viacom's Paramount unit, CBS will get a major TV and film
studio to create shows for broadcast. The combined company will
also have multiple outlets _ billboards, radio, and television
stations _ to cross-promote offerings that brought in combined
revenues of $21 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, CBS shareholders will get 108.5 shares
of Viacom class B stock for every 100 shares they own. Redstone
will be chairman and chief executive and control a majority of
voting stock, with current CBS chief executive Mel Karmazin chief
operating officer and heir apparent when Redstone, 76, retires.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted enthusiastically. CBS shares rose 1 3/4 to
50 11/16 in New York Stock Exchange trading, while Viacom's Class B
shares jumped 1 7/8 to 46 15/16. At that price the deal is worth
$50.93 a share for CBS shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just slapping two big companies together to make a
bigger company _ they complement each other very well,'' said Bruce
Leichtman, an analyst with The Yankee Group in Boston. ``CBS really
missed the boat on cable, and Viacom has a strong presence there,''
Leichtman said, while the CBS network provides wider outlets for
the entertainment content Viacom creates.
</P>
<P>
   The move represents a reunion of sorts. Federal regulators
forced CBS to divest its Viacom stake in 1971 when it was a
television syndication company, ruling it was illegal for a
broadcast network to control reruns. Viacom's roots go back 90
years to a small chain of drive-ins and cinemas founded by
Redstone's father; Sumner Redstone bought Viacom in 1987 for $2.3
billion and began building it into a multifaceted media juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   One trigger for the Viacom-CBS deal was the recent announcement
by the Federal Communications Commission that it would relax rules
that have forbidden a single company from owning more than one
television station in a market.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have two stations in six markets and
at least one station in 18 of the top 20 US TV markets, Karmazin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, however, their viewership totals about 41 percent of
American television watchers, 6 percent above the FCC limit. Also,
FCC rules forbid a company from owning two TV networks, although
there may be some wiggle room for Viacom to assert that UPN is not
a true network and thus should be exempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have for a long time said those (FCC) rules are outdated,''
Karmazin said. ``It's almost like like having black-and-white rules
in a color environment. Those rules need to be modified.'' FCC
officials made no comment other than a standard promise to review
the merger carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin would not say where the company might look to sell off
stations to get below the 35 percent cap, but said, ``Obviously, we
like bigger markets better than smaller markets. The population is
there, the advertising is there _ we want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin, the hard-nosed former radio executive who brought CBS
back to top ratings last year, approached Redstone two weeks ago to
discuss a merger of their television stations as a result of the
proposed FCC ownership rule change.
</P>
<P>
   From there, talks took off. ``He seduced us,'' Redstone said of
Karmazin. ``I was originally a little bit skeptical, but as I heard
and began to see . . . this guy is the master salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men emphasized that their companies were strong enough that
they did not need to merge, but they saw huge possibilities in
combining. ``This was a deal I wanted to make I think from the time
I was bar mitzvahed,'' Karmazin said.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, who has been in the process of unloading assets to
improve Viacom's balance sheet, including its stake in the
6,000-store Blockbuster video-rental chain, said the new company
would have the financial power to consider additional takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone's top two lieutenants, deputy chairmen Tom Dooley and
Philippe Dauman, will step down but continue to serve on Viacom's
board, Redstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospect of layoffs or cutbacks, Karmazin told
reporters: ``You're too hung up on cost savings. The reason for
this deal is putting this set of assets together and growing
them.''

SCIENTISTS, FISHING INDUSTRY WORRY ABOUT BARREN AREA IN GULF OF
MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCODRIE, La. _ Fifteen miles out in the Gulf of Mexico, schools
of fish _ sheepshead, drum, even a few snapper _ make their watery
homes amid the massive steel legs of an offshore oil rig.
</P>
<P>
   From the deck of the research vessel Pelican, the marine life
appears abundant and the water remarkably clear. Only a skyline of
oil platforms off the Louisiana coast mars the pristine seascape.
</P>
<P>
   But as scuba divers plunge into the ocean and swim to the base
of the hulking oil platform, they disappear into a layer of murky
water. Below the turbid water, a sickly looking jellyfish is the
only sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   The divers have entered the Dead Zone, a swath of water nearly
the size of New Jersey, stretching from the Mississippi River delta
to the Texas-Louisiana border. Monitoring devices at the base of
the platform confirm what the researchers' eyes tell them: There
isn't enough oxygen in the water at a depth of 65 feet for fish to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen-depleted area, known to scientists as a ``hypoxic''
zone, has not yet had an economic effect on the $680 million Gulf
fisheries industry, but officials are watching the growing Dead
Zone with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 7,000 square miles of trollable space lost to shrimpers _
regardless of what state they're from,'' said Wilma Anderson,
executive director of the Texas Shrimp Association. ``Shrimp don't
follow manmade boundaries, and neither do shrimpers. It's an area
that's essentially off-limits to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Zone is fed by the Mississippi River, which drains
farmlands, prairies and cities from the Appalachians to the
Rockies. The zone first captured national attention in 1993 _ the
year of the last great Mississippi River flood _ when its size
doubled. Scientists say that runoff from the nutrient-rich
Mississippi River watershed, which encompasses about 40 percent of
the United States, triggers a complex series of events that has
caused the zone to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen-rich fertilizer tops the list of factors believed to be
contributing to the zone's growth. Hypoxia, or oxygen depletion,
occurs when excess nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus,
accumulate in a body of water and cause algae to flourish into
algal blooms. These blooms thrive on nitrates and phosphates and
deplete the water of nearly all dissolved oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is strongly challenged by farm groups, which point to
other factors cited by scientists for creation of the Dead Zone.
These include the containment of the river within levees, loss of
wetlands to development and the interaction of fresh water with
salt water.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the constantly changing Dead Zone covered 7,700
square miles, the biggest it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   One of the divers, Nancy Rabalais, a marine biologist who has
studied the Dead Zone since 1985, has been trying to understand the
forces that cause the oxygen-deprived area to expand and how to
control it. But as research data indicate a link between fertilizer
runoff in the Midwest and expansion of the zone, the debate has
become increasingly strident and political.
</P>
<P>
   A White House Task Force is preparing a report that is expected
to be released in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate has raged in Congress, in the Farm Belt states
and on the Louisiana coast, Texas has been largely on the
sidelines. Texas officials contend that the conditions causing the
zone are unique to the Louisiana coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a dog in this hunt,'' said Bruce Moulton, a
technical specialist with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission. Moulton also serves on the advisory panel of the Gulf
of Mexico Program, a multiagency group set up to encourage
cooperation on Gulf environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Texas officials agree. Larry McKinney, senior director
of aquatic resources for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
said the state would be foolish to ignore the Dead Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a dog in this hunt,'' McKinney said. ``Now that dog
may be far off and not at the top of my plate, but this dog could
get big in a hurry. And if it gets bigger, the currents are going
to bring it farther toward Texas. There's not much we can do as a
state on our own _ it's too big an issue for any one state to
tackle alone _ but I would be very interested in working with the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabalais, a Texas native and a professor for the Louisiana
Universities Marine Consortium in Cocodrie, has not had the time or
the funding to monitor Gulf waters off the Texas coast, but she
said Texans should be concerned. This year, for example, her
eight-day survey of the Dead Zone stopped at Sabine Pass for lack
of time. It's likely, she said, that the zone extended farther west
along the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the 105-foot Pelican, operated by the Louisiana
consortium, Rabalais and her team of scientists were making their
monthly cruise to nine offshore monitoring sites that extend about
30 miles into the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   At each of the stations, tests showed that the dissolved oxygen
level was close to 2 milligrams per liter, the level at which
marine life is scarce. At some stations, readings were nearer to 1
milligram per liter, the level at which fish die.
</P>
<P>
   Close to shore, the oxygen-depleted zone may be only a couple of
feet deep. Farther out to sea, the band may be much thicker.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means to the Gulf's fisheries _ which account for
about 40 percent of all commercial fish brought to U.S. shores,
including much of the nation's shrimp _ is as murky as the Gulf's
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimpers in both Louisiana and Texas have mixed opinions about
whether the zone affects them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature makes our shrimp _ you can't predict it,'' said
Rocky Pavia, captain of a large shrimp boat based in Port Arthur.

A MARRAIGE OF OPPOSITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past few years, as the rest of the television
industry turned itself inside out in a race to become young,
younger, and youngest, CBS stubbornly clung to its identity as the
one network where viewers could actually find characters with gray
hair.
</P>
<P>
   But in merging with Viacom Tuesday, CBS paired up with a lively
young dance partner that could teach the old network some new
steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beavis and Butt-head meets Dan Rather,'' was the waggish
description of one analyst on CNBC. Or, in the words of Viacom
chairman Sumner Redstone, `` `Blue's Clues' meets `60 Minutes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While we won't see MTV's Beavis or Nickelodeon's Blue anchoring
the evening news, CBS is a good bet to develop a more youthful
profile now that its solid family base is united with the hipper,
fleeter, and much more cable-savvy Viacom. If younger is better in
the TV universe, so is bigger, and the merger results in an
Goliath-like entity that is now ``on that upper tier with Disney
and Time-Warner,'' according to Bruce Leichtman, director of media
and entertainment strategies for the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   But will UPN, the struggling broadcast network half-owned by
Viacom, remain in the family long enough to benefit from corporate
and creative synergy? That depends on the Federal Communications
Commission, which has a rule against companies owning more than one
broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the merger illustrates the financial clout
that a media company can build nowadays if it targets and captures
the right niche audience, and if it knows how to operate in the
cable universe.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been notably lacking on the latter count, but not so its
new partner: Viacom boasts a large stable of successful cable
channels. Nickelodeon is the top-rated network among children aged
2 to 11, MTV is a must-see channel among teenage rock fans, VH1 is
a magnet for nostalgic baby-boomers, and Showtime has carved its
own slice of the audience by specializing in what programmers like
to call ``edgy'' movies and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, meanwhile, has hewed to a more traditional
family-programming path that brought the network to the top of the
overall household ratings last season, but only to fourth place
among the 18- to 48-year-old viewers advertisers pay a premium to
reach. ``While they were the No. 1 network last year, everybody
sort of wrote it off,'' observed Leichtman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Viacom's cable holdings, CBS can enjoy the revenue
streams and cross-promotional opportunities that NBC and ABC have
had with their far-flung cable properties. ``In large part, the
network is the primer of the pump for the rest of the product,''
said Leichtman.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is also expected to turn to Viacom-owned Paramount as its
in-house production studio for new prime-time programs. Paramount
produces ``Frasier'' for NBC, the sort of cosmopolitan comedy CBS
has had trouble developing _ and the sort of sitcom that gets
especially strong ratings in big cities. CBS owns stations in most
of the major cities, but has tended to focus much of its
programming energies on shows with strong rural appeal (``Walker,
Texas Ranger,'' ``Touched by an Angel).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity to send a message out that we didn't
have before,'' said one CBS insider. ``There will be more sampling
of us by younger viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger will also result in Viacom control over a vast amount
of syndicated programming ranging from ``Wheel of Fortune'' to
``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' to ``Hollywood Squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond drawing from the Paramount pipeline, CBS can also use its
added financial strength to outbid rivals for the best new shows
from the hottest producers. CBS chairman Mel Karmazin Tuesday said
the merger will result in ``a bigger investment in programming'' by
the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be the major television broadcasting company,''
proclaimed Karmazin.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear amid all the trumpet blasts of hype, though, is
what the merger will mean for UPN, a network that had begun to show
the first faint signs of a turnaround. FCC rules prohibit a company
from owning more than one broadcast network, meaning that Viacom
could not own both CBS and UPN, and also does not permit ownership
of TV stations that collectively reach more than 35 percent of the
country (Viacom will now reach 41 percent of the country).
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin and Redstone said they will be in Washington Wednesday
to try to persuade FCC regulators to change those rules. If they
cannot, Viacom would have to divest itself of UPN and of some local
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone hinted that if he was forced to divest some local
stations, he would look to enhance opportunities for minority
ownership at the stations.

COCODRIE, La.: in Port Arthur. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pavia and other longtime shrimpers are as worried about
increased competition from Vietnamese shrimpers as they are about
the Dead Zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the docks of Cocodrie, a small fishing town two hours
southwest of New Orleans, shrimpers who fish for white and brown
shrimp in Louisiana's rich estuaries and offshore reported mixed
results in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimper James Blanchard of Houma was practically giddy after
returning from two weeks at sea with 12,000 pounds of shrimp caught
off Louisiana's barrier islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last nine or 10 days, we had all we could handle,''
Blanchard said. ``It was around the clock. We were doing so good
that I really ought to head right back out, but I'm going home for
a few days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard's success would seem to indicate that the Dead Zone
poses little problem. But Rabalais said Blanchard's haul shows that
the Dead Zone is forcing shrimp into different areas and keeping
them from reaching deeper waters, where they would grow larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, they would be out deeper in the Gulf, but they are
being trapped along the shore,'' Rabalais said. ``They aren't
reaching deeper water, and the shrimpers can just camp along the
beach and catch them. The shrimp don't have anywhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The zone currently extends into the spawning grounds of some
species of shrimp, which then move into the estuaries, mature, and
head back out to sea. Although there has been no drop-off in the
shrimp catch, scientists warn that it could come very suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, there hasn't been enough research to determine the
location of low-oxygen areas. But Don Harper, a marine biologist at
Texas A&AMP;M University at Galveston, said he believes there are
oxygen-depleted areas off the upper Texas coast about every other
year.
</P>
<P>
   During a seven-year study, 1977 to 1984, Harper twice found
hypoxic zones as far south as Freeport and found evidence
suggesting that they could have been present in two other years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coastline of Texas is so huge it depends on what part of
Texas you're talking about,'' Harper said. ``If you're talking
Brownsville, where I don't think it ever happens, the impact is
probably nothing. But if you're talking the upper Texas coast,
where conditions are more favorable, like Galveston, Sabine Pass _
or from Matagorda Bay all the way up _ you're talking a potentially
huge economic impact.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many who do not agree with the conclusions of Rabalais
and other scientists on what causes oxygen depletion. Six
assessments compiled for the White House task force have been
criticized by fertilizer and farm groups, as well as Midwestern
states, for suggesting a reduction in fertilizer use by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal assessments focused narrowly on a single cause of
Gulf hypoxia and failed to prove the stated hypothesis,'' the
Fertilizer Institute said in response to the task force's findings.
``Thus, they serve as interesting scientific inquiry but fail to
provide a foundation for regulatory efforts to `solve' hypoxia.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George H. Ryan took a similar tack. In a July 27
letter, he said the reports ``do not present a clear cause-effect
relationship between fertilizer use and hypoxia in the Gulf.''
</P>
<P>
   Larinda Tervelt-Norton, co-chairman of a nutrient enrichment
focus team for the Gulf of Mexico program, said the White House
group may not reach any clear-cut conclusions about the cause of
the Dead Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's going to be a consensus,'' Tervelt-Norton
said. ``It's going to be what are our options, how are we going to
move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf of Mexico is not the only body of water with
oxygen-depleted zones. Scientists say about one-third of the Baltic
Sea is hypoxic. Nitrogen and phosphorus have also posed a threat to
the Chesapeake Bay, which is bordered by Maryland and Virginia and
takes runoff from Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, Delaware
and the District of Columbia; Long Island Sound, which borders
Connecticut and New York; and Sarasota Bay in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For Rabalais, who was born in Wichita Falls in North Central
Texas and lived in Corpus Christi on the Texas coast before moving
to Louisiana, studying the Dead Zone has consumed much of her 49
years. Commuting between her home in Baton Rouge and Cocodrie, she
stays at the university several days at a time poring over data.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every month, she hits the Gulf to check the nine stations
that collect data on the changing nature of the Dead Zone. Prone to
seasickness, she battles rough seas to gather research and dives to
check the monitoring sites.
</P>
<P>
   Her research has shown that the Dead Zone expands in the summer
and contracts in the winter. Weather systems such as cold fronts
and hurricanes can affect the cycle of expansion and contraction.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, many people believed that the zone would not
expand unless there was a major flood on the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But Rabalais' weeklong survey of the Gulf in July found that it
had grown larger than ever. She said she believes the Mississippi
River was running higher than normal during most of the winter, but
is waiting for river data to confirm her theory.
</P>
<P>
   Since she sounded the warning in 1993, Rabalais has had to deal
with her share of criticism. To many agriculture-based groups who
oppose suggestions that farm runoff is to blame, she has become the
personification of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At town hall meetings, she has been heckled and shouted down.
But she has also won converts in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling off from the August heat inside the Pelican's
air-conditioned laboratory, she recalled a group of farmers who
were not persuaded by her research when they came on board the
research ship this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds of data and research papers would not change their minds,
she said, but a computer screen did. Once they saw the oxygen
readings drop as the gauges got closer to the ocean floor, they
grasped the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research has been reviewed by my peers, but that chart
seemed to make all of the difference,'' Rabalais said. ``I guess
they had to see it to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's why I'm convinced, in the end, the science will win
out. The numbers don't lie. We didn't make this up, and it's a
problem that's got to be dealt with.''

   &UR; THE FALL SEASON: A SPECIAL REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEAD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-NEWSEASON-BRANTLEY (Undated) _ Where, you may well ask,
do you find hope in a field of ashes? That would seem to be the
landscape of the Broadway musical at the moment, at least as seen
from the vantage point of the end of last season. Hope, however,
springs as buoyantly in the hearts of the genre's diehard fans as
it does in an uptempo Irving Berlin song. And there is indeed the
bright flicker of promise in the slate of musicals that begin
opening this fall. By Ben Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-MASLIN (Undated) _ As the year's most auspicious
film season approaches, at least this is certain: the approach of
the century's end will not go unexploited by Hollywood. But for
sheer promotional chutzpah, it may be hard to beat the trailer for
``Lost Souls,'' which uses sci-fi ominousness to heighten its
pitch: ``They had their 2,000 years,'' one character declares.
``Now it's our turn.'' That will be one extra reason to brace
oneself for the movie onslaught this fall. By Janet Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEWSEASON-JAMES (Undated) _ Here is the season's only
foolproof advice: take a deep breath and wait until January. That
brings the debut of what promises to be one of the most engaging
new series, ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and the return of ``The
Sopranos.'' By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PREVIEW-NEWSEASON (Undated) _ Stephen Holden offers a brief
look at the 140 new films opening this season.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-PACINO (Undated) _ Al Pacino famously dreads
interviews, even the kind that don't try to poke into his private
life (girlfriend: the actress Beverly D'Angelo; children: a
9-year-old daughter Julie to whom he is close). But those days,
apparently, are behind him. This time around, he couldn't be warmer
or more engaging, By Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-RUSSELL (Hollywood) _ His first film was about a
young man's relationship with his mother. His second was about a
young man's relationship with his mother and his other mother. His
third is about a young director's determination not to make three
films in a row about his mother. Whether biting off something
inoedipal is more than David Russell can chew will become apparent
when ``Three Kings'' opens on Oct. 1. By Bruce Newman.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ Cinema history is
punctuated by the work of visionary mavericks who will go to any
lengths to get their films made, and who require their
collaborators to share their obsessive dreams. The latest would-be
member of this club is Harmony Korine, the prodigiously talented
writer of ``Kids'' (1995) and writer-director of ``Gummo'' (1997)
and ``Julien: Donkey-Boy,'' which will be screened at the New York
Film Festival prior to its Oct. 15 release. By Graham Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-WINSLET (London) _ Kate Winslet likes to say that
she is not one for planning ahead _ which is probably a good thing,
since she could hardly have expected to land a lead role in the
biggest money-spinner of all time just four years into her screen
career. On the other hand, once ``Titanic'' thrust global fame upon
her when she was all of 21, it was soon apparent that this
strong-willed young Englishwoman was not about to allow stardom to
dictate her life. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-MCKEE (London) _ Gina McKee played Bella, Hugh
Grant's disabled friend, in the recent hit, ``Notting Hill,'' so it
seems appropriate that a movie obsessed with stardom should find
Ms. McKee well on the road to it herself. It helps, of course, to
possess Ms. McKee's singular, decidedly unglamorous beauty; as has
been pointed out frequently by the British press, she looks as if
she could have been painted by Modigliani. Even rarer is the quiet
integrity of her performance as Bella, which commands attention
without histrionics or bathos. Michael Winterbottom, director of
Ms. McKee's forthcoming film, ``Wonderland,'' spoke in turn of her
compellingly transparent presence. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-HOLLYWOOD (Hollywood) _ The jury is still out and
a healthy sense of skepticism is advised, but perhaps we are
beginning to see with this year's fall and holiday lineup, just
what kinds of movies the Hollywood studios and major independents
are going to be making in response to the cost-cutting and the
hand-wringing. By Rick Lyman.

FED APPROVAL LAUNCHES MERGED FLEET-BANKBOSTON VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as SOVEREIGN-FLEET)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Federal Reserve Board Tuesday approved Fleet
Financial Group Inc.'s acquisition of BankBoston Corp., clearing
the way for the creation of the nation's eighth-largest banking
company, to be known as Fleet Boston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's 5-0 approval of the Fleet-BankBoston deal, in an
afternoon meeting, came hours after Fleet had signed an agreement
to sell 278 branches in four states _ Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, and New Hampshire _ to Sovereign Bancorp for $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, in a short statement, said it approved the formation of
Fleet Boston Corp. after a review of lending, market activity, and
community investments of the two banking companies. ``To address
competitive concerns, Fleet is required to divest'' branches and
deposits totaling $13 billion as a condition of the Fed's approval,
the agency said. Most of those branches and deposits are slated for
sale to Sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   With Sovereign's agreement in place and Fed approval in hand,
Fleet is now through the most difficult work required in putting
together the complex merger.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet officials hope to finalize the deal within weeks, possibly
by early October, but full integration of the two banks' operations
will not occur until the the second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's chief executive Terrence Murray, in a statement Tuesday,
predicted Fleet Boston Corp., with $170 billion in assets, would be
a ``world-class financial services institution that can grow and
compete in the global financial world of the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of negotiations with Fleet, Sovereign on Sunday
night agreed to pay $1.4 billion for the package of business, which
would transform Philadelphia-based Sovereign virtually overnight to
the third-biggest banking operation in Massachusetts and a dominant
institution throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign said it agreed to retain 3,500 employees of Fleet and
BankBoston in four states as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty critical day,'' Charles ``Chad'' Gifford,
BankBoston's chief executive, said Tuesday. Sovereign's agreement
to hire employees of the branches on the sale block ``was a huge
plus to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture to Sovereign was a condition placed on the
merger by the US Department of Justice last week to ensure
competition. Justice also carved out a smaller piece of
Fleet-BankBoston's operations for sales to small community banks in
Massachusetts. Fleet is negotiating with several community banks to
sell them 28 branches.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting Sovereign to buy the banking operation, Fleet
effectively hand-picked its competition. But Sovereign has
fashioned a deal that gives it a strong foothold in Fleet's turf in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign currently operates in New Jersey, Delaware, and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign chief executive Jay S. Sidhu, announcing the deal
Tuesday in a press conference, immediately began what is expected
to be an aggressive campaign by the out-of-state bank to retain or
win customers in this market.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign plans to close the deal and assume the
Fleet-BankBoston branches by April 2000. Sovereign's banking
operation in New England will be based in Boston and will be called
Sovereign Bank New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our vision that within a short period of time, New
Englanders will find Sovereign Bank New England as a household
name,'' Sidhu said. Sovereign hopes to deliver its services with a
``small-bank touch'' and by ``not treating people like numbers at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street liked the deal. Sovereign's stock, which has sagged
in recent weeks, gained 1 1/16 and closed at $11 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign officials hope their biggest advantage will be
employees inherited from Fleet or BankBoston _ veterans of the
region's banking market.
</P>
<P>
   Sidhu also named a Sovereign banker based in Boston to run its
new operation in New England. Joseph Campanelli, Babson College
graduate who started his banking career at Hartford National Bank
and previously ran Fleet's auto-loan business, will become
president of Sovereign Bank New England.
</P>
<P>
   Sidhu disclosed in an off-the-cuff remark that he hoped to
recruit long-time Fleet executive Thomas Lucey, who is overseeing
Fleet's divestiture of branches, after the branch purchase is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign's encroachment on Fleet's territory is so complete
that the out-of-state banking company is assuming Fleet's lease of
five floors of office space at the gold-trimmed 75 State Street
building, which once served as Fleet's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Sovereign would retain some 3,500
employees _ from tellers to loan officers _ who currently work in
the branches and offices being acquired. To ensure their commitment
to Sovereign, Sidhu said the employees would be offered stock
options or retention bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts said it will be difficult for Sovereign
to move into the region. Any time a bank buys branches, it takes a
risk that some of the branch's business _ whether a small business
with a loan or a customer with a checking account _ may choose to
migrate back to the original owner, said James Moynihan, senior
vice president of Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihand said Sovereign would be ``well-positioned'' under
the Justice Department-approved plan. ``The most difficult thing is
to maintain their current loan and deposit base, and I think that's
doable,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 176 branches and 116 ATMs being purchased by
Sovereign in Massachusetts are currently owned by Fleet; Sovereign
also is acquiring BankBoston's back-office operation in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut (39 branches) and Rhode Island (50 branches),
Sovereign is mainly buying branches currently owned by BankBoston.
Also included in the deal are BankBoston's consumer lending and
telephone banking centers in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   If Fleet and BankBoston employees agree to become Sovereign
employees, they would ensure his company ``retain the customers and
make sure we don't miss a beat when'' the Fleet's branches are
finally divested, Sidhu said.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign will also honor all existing loan agreements or
certificates of deposit. As for fees on ATMs, Sidhu said, ``There
is no way Fleet-BankBoston is going to charge less than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, until Fleet's sale of branches is completed, Sovereign will
be in the odd position of allowing its biggest future competitor to
run its operations, one banking insider noted.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign is no newcomer to such deals, having completed 19
acquisitions over the past decade. After buying 93 branches from
CoreStates when CoreStates merged last year with First Union,
Sovereign made $600 million in new loans in the first six months of
business, Campanelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We totally understand why you need local decision-making,'' he
said.

   FILM-NEWSEASON-MENDES (Hollywood) _ An interview with Sam
Mendes, the 34-year-old Englishman who directed the Broadway hits
``Cabaret'' and ``The Blue Room,'' and who is now the director of
the dark, phantasmagoric view of suburban life revealed in
``American Beauty.'' It's the story of a desperately dissatisfied
middle-aged man married to a grasping, equally dissatisfied real
estate broker. Their family life is a sham, their teen-age daughter
despises them and her sultry best friend has the father's sexual
fantasies going full-time. The movie, with Kevin Spacey and Annette
Bening in the lead roles, opens on Sept. 15. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NEWSEASON-MCKELLAR (Undated) _ As we barrel toward the
millennium, there's something bothering the writer and actor Don
McKellar: the dearth of good, old-fashioned end-of-the world
movies. Indeed, McKellar was so perturbed that he decided to make
his own. The result, his feature-film directing debut, is cheekily
titled ``Last Night,'' and opens Nov. 5. By David Mernelstein.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-NEWSEASON-GUSSOW (Undated) _ As a conceptual director,
Martha Clarke is a creative body in motion. On a recent morning in
her airy Greenwich Village apartment (many years ago the home of
Marcel Duchamp), she was brimming with activity. She was in the
middle of casting ``Hans Christian Andersen,'' her deromanticized
Broadway musical version of the 1952 movie. By Mel Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-NEWSEASON-KISSELGOFF (Undated) _ There is one thing you
can say about the Swedish choreographer Mats Ek: at his best, he is
outrageous. The provocative image, its basic truth leavened with
absurdity and dark humor, is his forte. ``Carmen'' and ``Solo for
Two'' make up the all-Ek program that the Lyons Opera Ballet from
France will perform at the Brooklyn Academy's Harvey Theater from
Oct. 19 to 24. Other troupes that dance Ek's works have already
shown why he is one of Europe's most talked about choreographers.
By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART/ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-NEWSEASON-KIMMELMAN (New York) _ The painter James Ensor,
the great Belgian eccentric of 19th-century art, developed his
style looking at Bosch and Bruegel. He was thoroughly European.
Jose Guadalupe Posada, his contemporary, a native of
Aguascalientes, Mexico, apprenticed in the workshop of a renowned
Mexican broadsheet publisher, Antonio Vanegas Arroyo. He became a
printmaker of big, cheap, mass-produced engravings in Mexico City.
Neither Ensor nor Posada seems to have had the slightest idea that
the other existed. But they are to be paired in ``Modern Starts''
at the Museum of Modern Art, a giant exhibition that opens Oct. 7.
By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-NEWSEASON-REIF (New York) _ A pioneer at the outset and
a trendsetter ever since, the American Wing of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art has advanced the nation's passionate interest in
American art throughout most of this century. Now, on Nov. 10, it
will mark to the day the 75th anniversary of its opening with
``Celebrating the American Wing: Notable Acquisitions 1980-1999,''
a yearlong exhibition of American paintings, sculpture and
furnishings of the late 17th century to the early 20th century. By
Rita reif.

   TV-NEWSEASON-BURNS (New York) _ More than five years in the
making, ``New York,'' an admiring portrait of the city from Henry
Hudson's arrival, in 1609, to the millennium, is 12 hours in six
equal parts, or as Ric Burns puts it, the story of Prometheus
retold from era to era. The first five parts will be broadcast in
November (Sunday through Thursday, Nov. 14-18, 9 p.m.). A sixth
episode, scheduled for the spring, will focus on the last 60 years
of the century. By Charles Strum.

   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POPMUSIC-NEWSEASON-PARELES (Undated) _ What has been missing for
some time amid pop's puppy love and acting up is a mentality that

self-lacerating angst. But in the 1999 season, angst is going to

   WASHINGTON _ Having declared itself ready to deal with any
computer glitches as the year 2000 arrives, the Pentagon is now
worried that 500,000 American troops and military dependents
stationed overseas may face problems if foreign power grids, water
systems or phone lines go haywire.
</P>
<P>
   With less than four months to go before computers around the
world have to cope with the Year 2000 software flaw, senior
Pentagon officials say that only about 40 percent of the 130 key
foreign bases that the military is monitoring meet American
standards of assurance that essential services will remain
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials say that number is expected to climb rapidly
as more information is gathered from local officials. The American
military uses more than 300 installations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The questions commanders are asking include: Will foreign air
traffic control systems work? Will seaport cargo handling equipment
function properly? Will automated security networks go down? Will
civilian hospitals suffer power outages?
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate there will be some disruption, but we don't
think it'll affect our war-fighting ability,'' Deputy Defense
Secretary John J. Hamre said in an interview. ``We are concerned
about what happens to dependents living on the economy overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-October, Hamre said the Pentagon will decide where it
might need to send back-up equipment, such as auxiliary generators,
water purification machines and air-traffic control systems, as a
hedge against possible problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon effort has touched some raw diplomatic nerves, as
some countries or local officials have been reluctant or unable to
give American officials technical details about safeguards against
the problems that could arise because some computer software cannot
recognize that the two-digit date 00 means 2000, not 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most countries aren't going to tell you they have problem, so
you have to read between the lines of what they say,'' said Hamre.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the reliability of their overall assessment, the
Pentagon late last month began dispatching teams of experts to
Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. The experts were drawn
from the military, American embassies, the departments of Energy,
Commerce and Transportation and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   They are meeting with their foreign counterparts to fill gaps in
information about specific bases and to ask about scores of ports,
airfields and other overseas facilities the American military
relies on but does not control, like the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Most European countries, including Britain and Germany, are
passing with flying colors, as are Japan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
officials familiar with the assessments say. But the essential
services provided to large numbers of American troops and
dependents by some key allies, like Italy and Turkey, require
greater scrutiny, these officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The military, of course, plans for all kinds of contingencies.
Pentagon officials say the point of their review is not to demand
Year 2000 computer safeguards or to provide corrective measures,
but to identify where the military may need to step in with help.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's not important whether a foreign port works or
doesn't work, but that we have a plan for that situation,'' said
Peter F. Verga, a senior Pentagon troubleshooter for overseas
issues.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-October, Hamre said, the Pentagon will decide where it
needs to send backup equipment, like auxiliary electrical
generators, water purification machines and air traffic control
systems, as a hedge against potential problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regional commanders are also taking steps. The military's
European Command is planning a major drill at Ramstein Air Base in
Germany in early October to test routine operations, like sending
an electronic computer message or making a secure telephone call to
another base.
</P>
<P>
   Important bases in Italy, like Aviano, from which allied
warplanes flew missions in the air war over Kosovo, are mostly
self-sufficient, military officials say. But officials are less
confident about services outside the gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is between the bases,'' said Maj. Jim Dudley, a
logistics specialist and expert on Year 2000 computer issues for
the military's European Command. ``We use leased communications
lines mostly from in-country utilities. They seem to be doing well,
but we don't have a complete picture of where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials express concern that the major earthquake in
Turkey last month could set back that country's efforts to assess
its potential computer problems. The military is also worried about
outposts in South America and Africa, because many countries in
those continents were late in addressing the issue, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Using information gathered by government teams and other
sources, the State Department plans later this month to issue
country-by-country travel advisories of possible problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and its regional worldwide commands have created
task forces to examine the issue of host nation compliance. Hamre
has ordered monthly briefings on the subject, beginning this month,
and top military aides to the Joint Chiefs of Staff will brief the
four-star regional commanders in Washington on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   To assess its progress, the Pentagon is using a rating system
for the 130 key installations, using stoplight colors as
benchmarks. The system evaluates seven variables: communications,
energy, finance, safety, sewage, transportation and water.
</P>
<P>
   A green light means the Pentagon is confident that a service
will be unaffected. A yellow light indicates that the military has
yet to be persuaded that the system will function properly. A red
light means the foreign country acknowledges that it will have
problems. ``By and large, we have very few cases where it's red,''
Hamre said.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the assessments provided by the Pentagon reflects
how much the review is a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, for example, most lights were yellow on the
chart for the Navy base in Rota, Spain. Camp Humphries, an Army
helicopter base in South Korea, showed a mixture of yellow and
green. An Army garrison in Hanau, Germany, showed solid green. None
of the briefing charts provided had any red lights.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an important fourth category: white lights, which
means the information is unknown. Right now, many installation
charts are filled with white lights, and coloring in those blanks
will be a top Pentagon priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be surprised,'' said Rear Adm. Robert F.
Willard, who is overseeing the Year 2000 computer assessment for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

FORMER MOUSKETEER AT TOP OF CHARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pop music's teen dream machine has delivered
another star _ and she's got a mouse in her closet.
</P>
<P>
   Like fellow chart-topping thrush Britney Spears, 18-year-old
Christina Aguilera is a graduate of the Disney Channel's ``New
Mickey Mouse Club.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new kid in town has range, and nobody's begun accusing
her of mutiny on the high C's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Aguilera's unexpectedly broad singing voice is the
element mentioned most when talking about her smash single, ``Genie
in a Bottle,'' or her No. 1-reaching self-titled debut album.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have Britney's teen queen look, so she's different
that way,'' observes Michael Steele, music director at Top 40 radio
KIIS-FM (102.7). ``But this girl's a talent. I've seen her live,
and her voice is as big as Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey. Not
only that, but the album is the real deal. It's not just candy pop.
There are some very clever songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera, who has lived in Japan, Florida and Texas and is now
based in New York, appeared on TV's ``Star Search'' at age 8, four
years later beginning a stint on Disney's cheery fantasy factory
alongside Spears, Justin Timberlake and J.C. Chasez of 'N Sync, and
the star of ``Felicity,'' Keri Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Aguilera cut ``Reflection'' for the ``Mulan''
soundtrack, garnering a Golden Globe nomination for best original
song in a motion picture. The same week, RCA Records heard her
demo, invited her to audition a cappella and signed her. Label
executives have taken to calling her ``our Streisand.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon its release two weeks ago, fans snapped up 252,800 copies
of Aguilera's album, beating the new Puff Daddy disc to the top of
the Billboard 200. The record includes sassy pop-r&AMP;b tunes like
``Genie in a Bottle'' and midtempo ballads such as ``So Emotional''
and the Diane Warren-penned ``I Turn to You.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up an Army brat in suburban Pittsburgh, Aguilera, who's
half-Ecuadorean and half-Irish, sang along with cast albums of
roof-raising show tunes. She also had a thing for blues belters
Etta James and B.B. King.
</P>
<P>
   We caught the petite Aguilera, who turns 19 in December, as she
dashed from the airport to a Los Angeles studio to cut a Christmas
song.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you predict ``Genie in a Bottle'' would do as well as it
did?
</P>
<P>
   Aquilera: I could only hope. I had a good feeling about it. When
it was released, I did all I could to make sure. But I never
expected it to stay at No. 1 for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were those ``New Mickey Mouse Club'' years like?
</P>
<P>
   Aquilera: Being a Mouseketeer was definitely an experience. To
be around so many kids who were so passionate and driven and
serious about their careers was great for me. There was such
energy. I'm not surprised at the success of my fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you come across ``Genie in a Bottle''?
</P>
<P>
   Aquilera: Well, we already had all the songs we wanted when
``Genie'' came in at the last minute. My a&AMP;r (artists and
repertoire) guy brought me into his office and said we should
record this. He said it had a very good chance of being a hit. I
was a little unsure and didn't want to release it as a single
because it was too similar to what's going on in pop right now. I
had my doubts, but I have no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What !ital!do you think of the pop scene at the moment? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aquilera: I think a lot of pop today lacks real soul.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get into blues and r&AMP;b?
</P>
<P>
   Aquilera: I grew up hearing Aretha Franklin. Me and my mom and
grandma would go to used record stores and find old Billie Holiday
songs and blues records and sift through them and check them out.
Blues was definitely a huge influence on me. It's probably my first
musical love. I just connect with it somehow. Even as a younger
child, I was a weird kid who would take B.B. King records and ad
lib over his guitar licks. I really connected with it. And Etta
James is my favorite blues singer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your relationship with Britney Spears? Are you
friends? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aquilera: We were very close on the ``New Mickey Mouse Club,''
but it's hard to keep connected. We really bonded back then. She
was 11 and 12, and I was 12 and 13. So we were the babies of the
cast. I miss her now. She's a sweet girl. People always want to
make out that there's competition between us because of our age,
but there isn't any. Really.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've played some pretty big shows. What does it feel like
to look out there and see a sea of faces singing along? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aquilera: That's the most amazing feeling ever. I can't even
describe it. Performing is what I like most. I find the studio very
confining. You can do a lot in there, and you get the opportunity
to try again and again. But on stage you have the adrenalin going,
and you've got one shot and the energy is so intense. You can't
help but give it all you've got.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of the stage, would you ever lip-sync in concert? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aquilera: I would never do it. But I can understand why people
do, because you have to dance and sing at the same time. And that's
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you've become such a hit, how have your friends back
home been treating you? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aquilera: I haven't seen a lot of them because I haven't had a
lot of time. But my friends have been nothing but supportive. I'm
sure my true friends won't treat me differently. I learned the hard
way a long time ago who were my friends. It's sad, because I don't
hear from them often, and they get mad because I'm so busy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are you spending New Year's Eve?
</P>
<P>
   Aquilera: It's one of my dreams come true. I always watched Dick
Clark live from Times Square on TV, and I'm going to be hosting
something with MTV at their Times Square studios.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your reaction when you heard you'd beat out Puff
Daddy for No. 1 in the albums chart? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aquilera: Amazed. It's like dancing on air. I didn't believe
it. I still don't believe it. I haven't seen it on paper yet, so
I'm just waiting for someone to call up and say it was all a big
mistake, they added the numbers wrong. &QL;

CISNEROS PLEADS GUILTY TO LYING ABOUT PAYMENTS TO FORMER MISTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas) (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's former housing
secretary, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor count of lying
to the FBI about payments to a former mistress, Under a plea
agreement that brings to an abrupt end the four-year, $10 million
investigation that led to his resignation, he avoids both a trial
on 18 felony charges and jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros would have faced up to five years in jail on each of
the counts in what probably would have been the last criminal trial
conducted under the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the plea agreement with the independent counsel,
David Barrett, Cisneros agreed to pay a fine of $10,000 and will
serve no jail time or probation. ``I accept responsibility for the
conduct as outlined,'' Cisneros said in federal court Tuesday.
Cisneros, a former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, added that future aspirants to public office
should learn that ``truth and candor are important.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the courthouse without talking to reporters but later
issued a statement through his lawyer saying that he ``was not
candid'' in statements he made to FBI agents doing a background
check on his suitability to serve in the Clinton Cabinet. But he
said that he hoped he would be most remembered for his actions as
housing secretary for three years at the beginning of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros told the agents that he paid the former lover, Linda
Jones, about $60,000 over the years. Ms. Jones, once known as Linda
Medlar, secretly tape-recorded some 88 telephone conversations with
Cisneros, who is heard acknowledging that the actual figure was
closer to $250,000 and that he had not been honest with
investigators about the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection was set to begin Tuesday in the trial that was
expected to last more than a month. Instead Barrett told reporters
outside the courthouse: ``We are just glad to have this over and
done with.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his office, Barrett defended the
investigation and suggested his decision to end the case was based
on compassion and sympathy for Cisneros, who had a long career of
public service and once was considered a rising political star.
Cisneros is now the president of Univision, the Spanish-language
television network based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disposition should in no way be viewed as minimizing the
serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros,'' Barrett said in the
statement. ``However, a just disposition of any prosecution must
include an evaluation of the defendant's overall conduct. In this
case, the conduct, while egregious, was committed by a person whose
life has been otherwise dedicated to public service, and this fact
must season the final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But many lawyers viewed the case against Cisneros as deeply
flawed, a judgment seemingly confirmed by the prosecution's
decision Tuesday to end the matter. The main problem for Barrett
was that his chief witness against Cisneros was Ms. Jones, who has
been portrayed as a liar not only by Cisneros' defense lawyers but
also by Barrett's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones is serving a 42-month sentence in federal prison for a
bank fraud case brought by Barrett's office related to the money
she received from Cisneros. Prosecutors also exposed as a lie her
assertion that the audio tapes of her conversations with Cisneros
were untouched originals. In fact, the prosecution showed they were
copies, many of which had been altered by her to conceal some of
her statements.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' lawyers had tried to have the tapes ruled inadmissible
at trial. But Judge Stanley Sporkin, who was to preside over the
trial, ruled that the jury would be told the tapes were doctored
and its members could decide what to make of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin said that the plea agreement was appropriate and that it
upheld the principle that, ``We cannot allow an individual to lie
his way into office.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence G. Barcella, a former federal prosecutor,
characterized the result as ``basically a wipe-out, a prosecutorial
implosion.'' Barcella, who is a prominent white-collar defense
lawyer in Washington, said the result shows that the independent
counsel law has sometimes led to prosecutions that are ``gigantic
wastes of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was allowed to expire in June by a
Congress troubled by the controversy wrought by the law and
especially wearied after the impeachment of President Clinton that
resulted from the investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the plea agreement Tuesday, Sporkin said that he
anticipated that it would lead to much second-guessing. He said his
first impression upon hearing the proposed agreement was that the
penalty was far too light for the time and money expended.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has concluded that what ultimately occurred was
wholly appropriate and that Barrett did not ``have much choice in
the matter.'' Barrett and his associates ``had an obligation to
maintain the integrity of their oath of office and in pursuing this
matter they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sporkin said he believed that matters should have been
concluded more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent inability or unwillingness of the prosecutor to
achieve anything near what he charged follows other setbacks for
independent prosecutors. Mike Espy, the former agriculture
secretary, was acquitted on charges he accepted favors and bribes.
The last two cases brought by Starr, against Susan McDougal in
Arkansas and Julie Hiatt Steele, ended in mistrials and eventual
dismissals.

MARKET PLACE: CBS AND VIACOM HOPE FOR NO OTHER BIDDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VIACOM-CBS) 
(mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The biggest deals of Sumner Redstone's life have
featured bitter takeover battles, lots of debt and some of the
strangest securities ever seen on Wall Street. But now, he says,
things will be different.
</P>
<P>
   Doing deals the old way enabled the 76-year-old Redstone to
parlay control of a chain of movie theaters first into control of a
cable empire, then into control of a company that is a leader in
everything from book publishing to motion pictures. Along the way,
there were periods when it looked as if the debt taken on to do the
deals might overwhelm the company.
</P>
<P>
   But his latest deal, in which his Viacom Inc. will take control
of CBS Corp., is supposed to be completely different. The
transaction announced Tuesday calls for the company to borrow not
even one dollar and involves no security more unusual than
nonvoting stock.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone was preaching the virtues of fiscal conservatism
Tuesday with all the fervor of a newly baptized convert. He
reminded Wall Street that he had once promised that Viacom would
never go deeply into debt again. Now the combined company will have
the money to invest in expanding the business and in continuing to
buy back stock. That tune played well on Wall Street, and the
shares of the two companies rose nicely on the news.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not Redstone can deliver that vision depends on
whether he can get away with acquiring CBS without offering any
premium over the stock's market price. And that in turn depends on
whether other bidders surface.
</P>
<P>
   CBS and Viacom are trying to discourage any such offer. The deal
includes a $1 billion breakup fee that would have to be paid to
Viacom if anyone else took over CBS. And Mel Karmazin, the CBS
chief executive, said in an interview that he would quit if another
buyer got control of CBS. He added that he knew of no other
companies that were interested.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the way the stocks traded Tuesday suggests that
investors are not expecting another bid. The speculation centered
instead on Chris-Craft, Viacom's partner in owning the UPN network.
It leaped $5.5625, to $57, on the hope that it might be acquired as
well. Redstone allowed that he would be talking to Chris-Craft, but
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, another bid for CBS is possible, perhaps from an
Internet company blessed with a high stock price _ and a desire to
acquire some assets that actually bring in cash. If a new bidder
does appear, Redstone will have to decide whether to fight. His
history says he is not one to walk away from a battle.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Viacom began in 1971, when it was spun off from,
of all places, CBS. In those quaint days, it bothered people when
companies owned too many media properties, and CBS, owner of one of
the three major television networks, was forced by the Federal
Communications Commission to unload its cable television and
syndication operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the management of Viacom tried to buy the company in a
leveraged buyout, only to have Redstone appear. After a bidding
war, his National Amusements, the movie theater company, won
control in a highly leveraged transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1993, Redstone set out to expand the company with
another huge transaction. He reached a friendly deal to acquire
Paramount Communications, whose assets included the Paramount movie
studio and Simon &AMP; Schuster, the publisher. Martin Davis,
Paramount's chairman, was to be chief executive of the combined
company, with Redstone as chairman, and Viacom was to take on
little debt, as most of the deal was financed with stock.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bidding war began, as QVC, a cable television company
run by Barry Diller, a former Paramount executive, entered the
bidding. When the smoke cleared, Viacom had gone deeply in debt and
issued some very odd securities, with names like contingent value
rights, whose value depended on how Viacom stock traded. Davis
ended up out of a job, the promised chief executive's role having
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's deal, Karmazin negotiated as much job security for
himself as could be hoped for _ given that Redstone will control 66
percent of the votes in the new company, although he has only 13
percent of the total stock. Karmazin has promises that CBS
directors will hold eight of the 18 board seats, and that the votes
of 14 directors would be needed to change his duties _ which
include supervising all operations of the combined company _ any
time before 2003. If Redstone should step down as chief executive
while Karmazin is on board, he is promised the chief executive's
job. But the reality will be that his job is safe only as long as
Redstone is happy with him.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no bidding war, the most interesting fight will come
in Washington. Redstone and Karmazin say they will abide by
whatever the regulators say, but they will travel to the capital
Wednesday to try to water down or eliminate the few rules remaining
on media concentration. They want to be able to own stations that
reach 41 percent of the country, rather than the 35 percent now
allowed, and they want to be allowed to retain control of both the
UPN and CBS television networks.

 &HT;    Southern Co. seeks tech skills to fill 3,000 jobs
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co., the huge Southeast utility, is hiring
more than 3,000 new employees for deployment throughout its growing
market, many of them engineers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Womack, senior vice president for human resources at
Southern Co., said the changing shape of the company has required
more people and new kinds of skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power generation businesses, which we are acquiring, building
and operating around the country, drive much of our hiring,''
Womack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also require other skills such as information
technology and financial specialties.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack said the search for new talent _ it is hiring the
equivalent of nearly 10 percent of its work force of 32,000 _ has
been tough because the hunt puts Southern up against a national
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we have had to use many resources, including
search firms, we have managed to hire about 2,000 people and expect
to complete our hiring by the end of the year,'' Womack said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people will be put to work in Georgia, but many will
be employed in New England, California and in the Midwest, where
Southern is now doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the new forces are being employed in the design,
construction and operation of the latest and most efficient power
generation plants we can bring online,'' said Womack.
</P>
<P>
   Southern consists of traditional power companies such as Georgia
Power, which sell electricity on a regulated basis.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also competitive in electricity generation right
in the back yards of other power companies.
</P>
<P>
   New endeavors also include unregulated businesses, such as the
division that concentrates on communications and may eventually
include data transmission via electric lines.
</P>
<P>
   Like a few other companies, Southern has the capability to train
and retrain employees at its teaching campus in Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   This flexibility allows the company to contemplate new
businesses outside its traditional role of generating and
distributing electric power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have special needs we can install courses, and move
employees into residential quarters on the campus and teach in a
concentrated way,'' Womack said.
</P>
<P>
   The facility could become a key factor if Southern Co. should
decide, after the trial run, to offer Internet connections to homes
by way of electric power lines.

   In a letter from the editor in the latest issue of National
Geographic's newish Adventure magazine,  &UR; John Rasmus &LR;  discusses the
spirit of adventure and the accident that killed &UR; John F. &LR; 
 &UR; Kennedy Jr. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Because the magazine was new, Rasmus had been interviewed by
MSNBC just before the tragedy. He said then that adventurers'
accidents were usually caused either by experienced adventurers
pushing their limits or by beginners who didn't understand their
limits. Pieces of that interview were played again during the
coverage of the Kennedy death.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the New York Times quoted him as saying, ``We are going
to do as many of those stories as we can.'' The headline on that
piece: ``Fatal Adventures Bolster Sales of Magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are drawn to stories of tragedy,'' writes Rasmus in the
letter. ``Consequently, disasters probably do increase book and
magazine sales and TV ratings. But to me that's a measure of the
importance of these stories.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been worth the risk, he says, for  &UR; George Mallory &LR; 
to unsuccessfully attempt to climb Mount Everest in 1924. But
``John Kennedy didn't have to risk his life to get to Martha's
Vineyard. If we don't have to, let's not.''

FORD LOSES BID TO KEEP DOCUMENTS OFF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Asserting that an Internet site has the same
free-speech rights as newspapers and other traditional media, a
federal judge ruled here on Tuesday that the Ford Motor Co. could
not stop the owner of the site from using information that he had
gleaned from confidential Ford documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had requested a preliminary injunction barring Robert Lane,
the owner of the site about the company, from using, copying or
disclosing the documents, which Ford described as containing trade
secrets. But U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds ruled that free
speech under the First Amendment took precedence over Ford's
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines have won various cases over the years
preventing corporations from exercising so-called prior restraint
on the publication of sensitive information. Tuesday's ruling adds
to a small but growing number of court decisions granting the same
constitutional protection to Internet sites, said Mike Godwin, a
lawyer specializing in free-speech issues on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important case because it further establishes the
scope of First Amendment protections in cyberspace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first cases involving prior restraint on the Internet were
filed by the Church of Scientology in an effort to stop the
electronic posting of church documents, Godwin said, adding that
the church had prevailed in some cases and lost in others.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Edmunds couched her decision Tuesday in broad language. ``In the
realm of law, we are only beginning to grapple with the impact of
the communications revolution, and this case represents just one
part of one skirmish _ a clash between our commitment to the
freedom of speech and the press, and our dedication to the
protection of commercial innovation and intellectual property,''
Edmunds wrote. ``In this case, the battle is won by the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmunds did grant Ford a preliminary injunction barring Lane, a
32-year-old nursing student, from infringing Ford's copyrights.
This could prevent Lane from posting Ford documents in their
entirety on his Web site, as Lane had done until Ford sued him two
weeks ago. But the copyright decision had little legal
significance, several First Amendment lawyers said Tuesday, because
Lane's lawyer had already promised the court last week that his
client would not post any more Ford documents on the site. Land can
write about the documents and quote them extensively without
worrying about copyright issues, the lawyers added.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's lawsuit, accusing Lane of violating its trademarks,
copyrights and trade secrets, is still pending and could result in
financial damages against Lane. Lane's lawyer, Mark Pickrell, also
agreed in court last week that his client would tell Ford whatever
he knew about who provided the internal documents. But Lane said in
court last week that he did not know who had mailed the documents
to his post office box or dropped them off at his home, so this
agreement may not help Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's site, www.blueovalnews.com, is named for Ford's corporate
logo, a blue oval with the Ford name inside. Lane started the site
last year to provide news for Ford Mustang fans, but broadened it
this summer after Ford became critical of some of the news he
posted.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell welcomed Tuesday's ruling as a victory for free speech.
Ford said that it was pleased that Lane's constitutional rights had
been respected but also glad that its copyrights would be
protected. Ford lawyers want to discuss the ruling with Pickrell,
and have not yet decided whether to appeal, said Terry Bresnihan, a
Ford spokesman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The case is particularly awkward for Ford because many of the
secret documents say the company may someday be able to build
automobiles, particularly sport utility vehicles, that emit less
pollution and have better fuel efficiency than current models. Yet
the company is lobbying against tighter emission and fuel economy
regulations as unrealistic. The company does build the least
polluting sport utility vehicles on the market, although not the
most fuel-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new rules that
would crack down on tailpipe emissions from sport utility vehicles
in particular. Separately, the Senate is considering whether the
administration should be allowed to raise fuel-economy standards
for sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bresnihan, a Ford spokesman, said Tuesday that the company
had been frank in discussions with the EPA about the feasibility of
designing lower-emissions vehicles. Documents regarding fuel
economy describe technologies that may not be feasible for
technological and marketing reasons, Bresnihan said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman David Cohen declined to comment on the documents
because of the lawsuit. But he added, ``We're convinced that the
rules we've proposed and the final standard will be the toughest
ever.''

 &HT;    Holan skating for new lease on life
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Milos Holan left his family in Ostrava, in the
Czech Republic, last week, setting out to add another miracle to
his life. Holan kissed the wife who had to give birth while her
husband was in another hospital bed struggling for his life. He
kissed the son he couldn't hold for six months and the daughter who
can't fully grasp what happened a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is 7, so doesn't understand what leukemia means,'' Holan
said Tuesday, his English fighting through a heavy Czech accent.
``But she understands that something happened to me. When I came to
USA for this training camp, she said, `Don't get hurt again.' She
knows I was sick. But she thinks I was hit in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   This Thrashers training camp marks either the beginning of a new
career for Holan or the final chapter of the old one. The
28-year-old is trying to earn a roster spot on a free-agent tryout
_ four years after being diagnosed with chronic leukemia, which led
to radiation, chemotherapy, a bone-marrow transplant and resulting
infections and complications that nearly ended his life.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder, then, that Holan says, ``I want to play hockey,
of course. But if I don't, it doesn't matter.''

<P>
   A former most valuable player of the Czech Elite League and a
defenseman with the Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Mighty Ducks,
Holan was out of hockey for nearly two years. He was invited back
to training camp with the Mighty Ducks last year but was cut
without even being allowed to play in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really upset,'' Holan said. ``They invited me to camp,
but for what? I mean, I was very grateful for what they did for me
before it happened. But I came to play, not watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Holan returned home and played 30 games in the Czech League,
scoring nine goals and 13 assists in 30 games. He decided to give
his NHL career one last chance, and the Thrashers obliged. Although
deep in numbers at defense, general manager Don Waddell said Holan
probably will get some ice time in exhibition games, the first of
which is Saturday against Nashville in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch him here, and it's clear his skill level is at the
NHL level,'' Waddell said. ``What you lose is timing and tempo.
Three years is a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months can be longer. That was the length of Holan's stay
in a Southern California hospital. ``You wake up in the morning,
you are nauseous, and every day something happens that you never
thought could happen to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holan's medical history would fill a book. And it does. He wrote
his life-and-near-death story in a book that was published in the
Czech Republic last month. In it, he tells how he was first
diagnosed in a routine preseason physical in 1995. Doctors told him
he needed a bone-marrow transplant, because the levels of radiation
and chemotherapy required to kill the cancerous cells in the blood
also would destroy his own marrow and immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But Holan had to wait four months for a donor with enough
genetic similarities to be found. In the meantime, he actually
played 16 games for the Ducks in 1995-96. He finally left the team
in January '96, and he had the transplant a month later. He was
released from the hospital that April but returned soon after
because of complications. He had numbness in his limbs, his gall
bladder was removed, and he developed pneumonia. He lost more than
50 pounds. During that time, his wife, Irena, gave birth to Milos
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Holan thought often about death. But in time, he grew strong
enough to be released from the hospital. He wanted to thank the
donor but was told that it is standard to keep the identity secret
for at least a year. He eventually had a telephone conversation
with Robert Stransky Jr. of Jessup, Md., and met him for the first
time only two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that Stransky is a nuclear engineer. ``So I will be
smarter on the ice,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Holan says if he doesn't make the Thrashers, he will retire and
take a coaching job in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to lose,'' he said. ``I am here. Everything
else is just a bonus in my life.''

FOOD CHAIN: SORTING PEPPERCORNS; MYSTERIOUS PECTIN; SAFFRON
SUBSTITUTE; SAFE `RAW' FISH; TASTES OF HUNGARY

<P>
   Q. Are all peppercorns, regardless of color, from the fruit of
one plant at different stages of ripeness? And why do some recipes
call for white pepper?
</P>
<P>
   A. Black, green and white peppercorns are all berries of the
same plant, the climbing vine Piper nigrum (so-called pink
peppercorns are not actually members of the peppercorn family).
</P>
<P>
   Black peppercorns are picked when the berries are almost ripe,
then dried until the outer skin turns black. Green peppercorns are
picked when the berries are even less ripe, and they have a fresh
but pungent flavor. Since they are very perishable, green
peppercorns are sold either in brine or freeze-dried.
</P>
<P>
   If the berries are left to ripen completely, they develop a
bright red skin that has to be removed to reveal the white
peppercorn. Since most of the berry's heat is contained in the
skin, white peppercorns are the mildest of the three peppercorns.
They are especially useful for those who want to maintain a
pristine white sauce, unmarred by black pepper specks, or for those
preferring a more mellow pepper flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious Pectin
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to make jellies and jams, but I can't find
pectin in my supermarket. What is it exactly, and where can I buy
it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Pectin is a naturally occurring water-soluble substance that
is found in some ripe fruits like apples and plums, especially in
the skins and seeds. When pectin-rich fruit is boiled with sugar
and a bit of acid, the pectin reacts and causes the mixture to gel.
Extracted and sold in powdered form, pectin can be added to those
fruits that do not have enough pectin to gel on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan supermarkets tend not to carry pectin, but you can
usually request that it be ordered. Dean &AMP; DeLuca (560 Broadway at
Prince Street; 212-431-1691) sells one-ounce packets for $4, enough
for 10 pints of jam. It also has a mail-order service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using commercial pectin, you can simply mix fruits
that are naturally high in pectin, like apples, plums, cranberries
and red currants, with fruits low in pectin, like strawberries,
peaches, cherries and blackberries. For jams, which need not gel as
much as jellies, you can also just cook the fruit and sugar
together until the desired consistency is reached. The jam may be a
bit runnier than commercial jams but will still be delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Saffron Substitute
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a traditional French soupe de poisson, is there an
alternative to the inordinately expensive saffron?
</P>
<P>
   A. One little-known substitute is dried marigold petals. They
have a similar musky flavor and will also impart that
characteristic golden hue. Substitute marigold for saffron in equal
measure. The petals, called calendula, are 55 cents an ounce at
Aphrodisia, 264 Bleecker Street (at Seventh Avenue; 212-989-6440).
</P>
<P>
   Safe `Raw' Fish
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does marinated raw fish, like herring fillets, pose a danger
to humans because of a risk of infection by parasites? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although marinated fish are technically indeed raw, they have
been soaked in a highly concentrated solution of vinegar and salt,
which kills any lurking parasites and cures the fish in the
process. Once cured, the fish are removed from the pickling
solution and rinsed well, then packed in a very dilute pickling
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Tastes of Hungary
</P>
<P>
   Q. Having just returned from Budapest, I'd like to know where to
find Hungarian specialties, like paprika sauce or goulash.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Yorkville Packing House, 1560 Second Avenue (81st Street;
212-628-5147), sells a wide array of Hungarian specialties,
including an authentic Hungarian goulash and paprika sauce. It also
has a mail-order service.

<P>
   VUCITRN, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo's police school began training its
first cadets on Tuesday, with only one Serb among a sea of
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials in charge conceded that they were failing
to create a multiethnic force for the province.
</P>
<P>
   There were to have been 200 men and women starting five weeks of
classes on Tuesday in the former Serbian-run police school here in
northern Kosovo. But of the 26 Serbs selected for the first course,
only one showed up.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why the others did not appear, but Garry Day,
the U.S. police officer in charge of recruitment, suggested that
there may have been intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from the U.S., I never realized what intimidation
really means,'' he said as the recruits headed for the classrooms
after hearing opening speeches. ``We will be sending people out
straightaway to their homes to see why they did not turn up today.
It may be first-day jitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Serbian applicants were threatened, and even assaulted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet if they cannot manage to come today,'' he said, ``how are
they going to cope with the job of being policemen?''
</P>
<P>
   Selection for the Kosovo Police Service has been the school's
thorniest problem, and it delayed the opening by a week. The
absence of the Serbs on the first day was a reminder of the losing
battle that peacekeepers are waging to create a multiethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first class, of 105 recruits, has ended up dominated by
Albanians, more than half of whom are former members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo's other minorities are also poorly
represented, with just four Turks and three Gypsies in the first
class. There are more than 40 women, a fact the organizers are
proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The men in charge of the training face an unusual task. The
students will be taught ``democratic policing,'' including lessons
on community relations and human dignity, along with normal police
duties and crime investigation, a training program document shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to change the way people think about the police in
their country,'' the school's director, Steve Bennett, an ex-Marine
and former director of the Board on Public Safety Standards in
Oregon, said of the recruits. ``They know that and they are proud
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is run mainly by Americans but is part of a broad
international effort to reconstruct Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After five weeks in the classroom, the cadets will go through 19
weeks of field training, each patrolling the streets of Pristina
alongside a U.N. police officer. The goal is to train a police
force to take over when the U.N. force departs.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women selected have been given background checks,
but Bennett said he expected some ``bad apples'' to emerge during
the training.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 30 Serbs originally selected were dropped following
accusations of involvement in war crimes. Some Albanian applicants
were sidelined when allegations arose that some had worked for the
Serbian secret service. Since the secret service was infamous for
abuse, Bennett said, the men were passed over until further checks
could be made.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Serbs who applied was disappointing, he said, but
even one or two success stories may help others come forward in the
future. ``One of the necessities is to mobilize the moderate
majority of people of Kosovo who aren't being heard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment is only one of the technical difficulties in postwar
Kosovo. Police uniforms, donated by Denmark, have yet to arrive, so
the recruits were dressed in a motley of jeans and track suits on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The school premises are rudimentary, and the weapons the police
will be trained to use _ 9mm Glock handguns to be donated by
Austria _ were also not in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the mood was optimistic. Many of the recruits were
experienced men, in their 30s and 40s, and some served in the
Yugoslav police force until 1989, before Albanians were dismissed
from public service. They were glad to be back in a job.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior KLA commanders were among the class, as well as a
number of former members. They spoke of ``serving the people,'' a
common refrain among fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the class was Nejmeddin Kastrati, 28, a former Yugoslav
army officer and brigade commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
The entry test was easy, he said, and working alongside Serbs will
not pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think who and what someone is,'' he said. ``I am
going into this as a professional. And of course they have not
taken on the criminals, who will be dealt with in the international
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, decked out in cowboy boots, said, ``There are a lot of
things to be optimistic about.'' By next September he said he
expected to have 3,500 police officers trained. ``In two years we
will have provided the foundation,'' he said.

SWISS PHARMACEUTICAL GROUP NAMES PRESIDENT OF US UNIT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ares-Serono Group of Geneva, Switzerland, a leading
developer of pharmaceutical products for female reproductive
health, has named Ellen R. Frank president of Serono Laboratories,
its US subsidiary in Norwell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Frank is among only a handful of women who have risen in the
biotechnology industry to the chief executive level.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeds Hisham Samra, who had been president since 1992 and
has now been promoted to director of clinical development and
regulatory affairs for the entire company in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who has been with the company for seven years, served as
executive vice president of metabolic and immune therapy, the
biotechnology operation that has enabled the company to expand into
making drugs for some AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Serono Laboratories is best known for marketing hormone growth
deficiency products to help women with infertility problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under Frank, the company developed a drug to help seriously ill
AIDS patients from losing their strength and body mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 250 people in Massachusetts, also
plans to break ground in January on a 200,000-square-foot corporate
resesarch and development and new US headquarters facility in
Hingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an excellent product pipeline and are poised to see
major growth in the coming years,'' said Frank Tuesday, noting that
this year, Serono Laboratories should post about $300 million in
sales _ about one-third of Ares-Serono's anticipated revenues of
nearly $1 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The new construction comes after Serono shut down its
three-year-old manufacturing operations in Randolph, Mass. last
year, dismissing 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company moved production to Switzerland, Spain, and a new
manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico that opened in February.
Frank said there are no plans to produce any drugs in the Bay
State.
</P>
<P>
   Frank takes over a company that has lost several significant
legal challenges from US rivals that were first to market new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Serono tried to enter the US market for multiple sclerosis drugs
against Biogen's Avonex, but was prevented from entering because
the Cambridge biotech company had a seven-year market protection
from rivals under the Orphan Drug Act.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Serono tried to sell Seizen, its human growth hormone
drug, but was blocked under the Orphan Drug Act by Genentech Corp.
of South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Serono lost a US Court of Appeals case when it tried
to thwart generic drug maker Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Tarrytown, N.Y., from marketing a bioequivalent version of
Pergonol, Serono's 30-year-old infertility drug.

INDONESIA IS WARNED IT COULD LOSE WESTERN AID
</HEADLINE>
   (With TIMOR-UNREST, TIMOR-U.N) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and the International
Monetary Fund separately warned Indonesia on Tuesday that the
financial aid that has kept the country economically afloat for the
past two years could be suspended if violence in East Timor is not
brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said on Tuesday
that ``productive relations between Indonesia and the international
community, including the IMF, depend on Indonesia adopting a
constructive approach towards ending the humanitarian disaster in
East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, the fund, which has administered the
multibillion-dollar emergency package to Indonesia since the Asian
economic crisis struck two years ago this month, said it was
considering holding up a review later this month of Indonesia's
economic troubles. Without it, the fund's board cannot approve the
next loan installment.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the statements on Tuesday
were clearly intended as a warning to President B.J. Habibie that
his biggest claim to success so far _ that he has worked with the
IMF and kept national bankruptcy at bay _ would be imperiled if he
could not get Indonesia's military to stop the violence aimed at
pro-independence East Timorese and U. N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is likely to have a chance to make that case
to Habibie directly this weekend, when both leaders attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of running around right now, but no clear sense
of what direction we should go and how hard to push,'' one senior
administration official said on Tuesday. ``No one is sure how much
the U.S. could contribute to a U.N. peacekeeping force, even if one
was invited in. No one is sure whether Habibie can control the
military, even if we threaten to cut off the money.''
</P>
<P>
   If the administration carried through on its warnings, it would
be suspending an aid package that the Treasury and Clinton's
national security advisers scrambled to assemble in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the rest of Asia on the road to economic recovery,
several of the Asian specialists inside the administration who
talked two years ago about propping up the Indonesian state now
wonder aloud _ though always off the record _ about whether the
East Timor eruption might mark only the start of a breakup of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was quick to say on Tuesday that his warning to Indonesia
``doesn't mean that any specific loan or any specific fund'' might
be frozen. But the only real economic leverage the United States
holds is its power within the IMF to block disbursement of the next
payment of loans.
</P>
<P>
   Those loans are partly designed to stabilize the banks, but they
also allow Habibie to continue using government money to subsidize
food and fuel. If those subsidies ended and prices soared, it could
easily set off the kind of violence that helped oust President
Suharto last year.

12 PUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS ACCEPT CLEMENCY OFFER, WHITE HOUSE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House announced Tuesday that 12 jailed
members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group have accepted President
Clinton's conditional offer of clemency. Eleven will be eligible
for release within days while the 12th had his 55-year sentence
drastically reduced and will be paroled in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Two other members of the radical group, known as FALN, the
Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National Liberation,
refused to accept the president's offer to commute their sentences.
Clinton demanded as a condition of their release that they renounce
the use of violence to achieve their aim of independence for the
Caribbean commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Another two FALN members, who have been released from jail but
still owe tens of thousands of dollars in fines, have not yet
responded to the president's offer to forgive their penalties. They
have until Friday to accept the terms of the grant, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president expects all those who accept the conditional
clemency grant to abide fully by its terms, including refraining
from the use or advocacy of the use of violence for any purpose and
obeying all the statutory conditions of parole,'' Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary, said in a written statement issued
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of the clemency offer further roiled an emotional
political debate that has pitted Hillary Rodham Clinton against her
husband and riven the Democratic party in New York. Mrs. Clinton,
who has all but announced her intention to run for the Senate from
New York, announced her opposition to the commutations on Saturday,
saying that the Puerto Ricans had shown insufficient contrition for
their acts and those of their comrades in the independence
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican nationalists are serving sentences of as long
as 90 years for offenses including sedition, possession of
unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen
vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and
interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a
crime. None of those whose sentences Clinton planned to commute was
convicted of crimes that resulted in deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has not spoken publicly on the matter, said through
a spokesman that the sentences were out of proportion to the FALN
members' offenses and that the prisoners, some of whom have already
served 18 years in prison, deserved to be released if they forswore
future acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 members of the group who accepted the clemency offer,
originally announced on Aug. 11, did so after consultation with
their lawyer, Jan Susler of Chicago, who said at a news conference
Tuesday evening she was ``elated by the prisoners' impending
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a tremendous victory and accomplishment for the
Puerto Rican people and people who love justice,'' Ms. Susler said.
</P>
<P>
   But she and another lawyer for the FALN members, Michael
Deutsch, added that they were concerned that after their release
the nationalists would be subjected to harassment by law
enforcement officials and denied the right to peaceable political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said they planned to create a network of monitors in
the United States and Puerto Rico to assure that the freed
prisoners' rights are not abridged.
</P>
<P>
   The two FALN members who rejected the president's grant of
clemency and who will remain in prison are Oscar Lopez Rivera and
Antonio Camacho Negron.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Rivera was convicted in August 1981 in Chicago of numerous
charges, including weapons violations and conspiracy to transport
explosives with intent to destroy government property, and was
sentenced to 70 years in prison. Clinton offered to reduce his
sentence to 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho Negron was convicted in Connecticut in June 1989 of
conspiracy to rob a bank and foreign transportation of stolen
money. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, which Clinton
offered to commute.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of the commutations further fueled the uproar
over the president's actions, which has been opposed by most law
enforcement agencies, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., numerous other lawmakers and victims of
acts of terror committed by pro-independence Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said on Saturday that the president should rescind
the clemency offer because the tardy response from the Puerto
Ricans ``speaks volumes'' about their continuing advocacy of
violence as a political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Her opposition to the president's position angered many Puerto
Rican elected officials in New York, who accused her of betraying
them in order to appear tough on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for the first lady's exploratory
committee, said that Mrs. Clinton understood the strong emotions on
the issue but she ``stands by her statement'' of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that the Puerto Ricans have never
expressed remorse for their acts or those of their comrades in the
nationalist movement, which has been involved in more than 100
bombings of political and military installations in the United
States in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ a Republican and the first lady's likely opponent in
a race to succeed Moynihan in the Senate _ said that the president
has undercut his own government's efforts to combat terrorism and
called upon the president to release files on the cases and the
recommendations from federal law enforcement officials, who
virtually unanimously opposed the grants of clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can emotionally be on one side or the other of this
issue,'' Giuliani said, ``but to say that it doesn't raise some
very serious and legitimate questions and now to see his own
political allies and close associates abandoning him like a sinking
ship, you wonder what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said the panel will hold hearings next week to review the clemency
offer, which he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends and relatives of the jailed Puerto Ricans were
grudging in their thanks to the president and highly critical of
Mrs. Clinton's opposition to the clemency grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an olive branch that the president has extended in the
process of reconciliation between the United States and Puerto
Rico, but it's a very scrawny one,'' said Gloria Quinones, one of
hundreds of activists and religious leaders who worked for the
release of the Puerto Rican nationalists. Ms. Quinones, of New
York, was a childhood friend of Dylcia Noemi Pagan, convicted of
conspiracy and firearms violations in 1981 and sentenced to 55
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinones was critical of the president's condition that none
of the prisoners meet or mingle after their release, particularly
citing the fact that two of the prisoners, Alicia Rodriguez and Ida
Luis Rodriguez, are sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way sisters should be kept away from one
another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinones called Mrs. Clinton's repudiation of her husband's
clemency grant ``a real insult'' to the nearly one million Puerto
Ricans living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks that we are politically expendable, insignificant
to her campaign,'' Ms. Quinones said. ``We'll just see about that
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Josefina Rodriguez of Chicago, the mother of the two sisters who
accepted the commutation of their sentences, said she was trying to
ignore the political controversy ignited by the prisoners' release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want them to come home,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said. ``I
really don't care if Hillary Clinton wins or loses.''

</P>
<P>
   Eli Escobar, a 24-year-old disc jockey in New York and son of
one of the prisoners, a painter who has the same name who has been
in jail for 19 years, said the prisoners and their families have
been in ``purgatory'' since the president announced the clemency
grant a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the minute we found out it was a mixed reaction of
disappointment and excitement,'' Escobar said. ``We have been
waiting a long time for that but when it came there were strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his father has not changed his views on Puerto
Rican independence but no longer believes that terrorism is the way
to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different time,'' Escobar said. ``They have gotten
older and wiser. It was more than 20 years ago. They have all
renounced violence.''

CISNEROS ENTERS SURPRISE PLEA IN 4-YEAR FEDERAL CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA E. RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded
guilty Tuesday to a federal misdemeanor for lying to the FBI about
payments he made to a former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise plea agreement with federal prosecutors brought to
an end a four-year investigation by independent counsel David
Barrett. The cost of the inquiry was estimated at more than $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea bargain, Cisneros agreed to pay a $10,000 fine in
return for prosecutors dropping an 18-count felony indictment
against him. He will not have to serve any time in jail or on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   A trial on the charges of conspiracy and lying was to have
started Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, a former mayor of San Antonio and once the
nation's best known Hispanic political figure, did not speak to
reporters. But he issued a statement expressing regret that he had
concealed information from the FBI during his background check for
the Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was secretary of housing and urban development from
1993 to 1997 during President Clinton's first administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my background investigation, I was not candid with the
FBI about a personal matter,'' Cisneros said. ``I regret my lack of
candor and accept responsibility for my conduct. I hope that all
who follow me in public service learn the lesson that truth and
candor are important in the process of selecting our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin said that he was
initially reluctant to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there will be some second-guessing about this plea,''
he said in accepting the plea agreement. ``There will be some who
will say that the sanction is not tough enough and others who will
say, `Here is more evidence of the Independent Counsel Act as not
serving the public interest.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We cannot permit an individual to lie his way
into high public office. ... The work of the independent counsel in
this case reaffirms the importance of telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said, ``This disposition should in no way be viewed as
minimizing the serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros. Deception by
public officials and those seeking public office erodes trust and
must be addressed and sanctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``in this case,'' the independent counsel said, ``the
conduct, while egregious, was committed by a person whose life has
been otherwise dedicated to public service, and this fact must
season the final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The ending of a multimillion-dollar investigation with a guilty
plea on a single misdemeanor conviction was seen by critics of the
now-expired Independent Counsel Act as evidence that the
legislation was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, Cisneros shouldn't have been made to suffer as
much as he did for his alleged crime,'' said Bruce Buchanan,
professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. ``He
was lying to the FBI about an embarrassing personal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, now president of Univision Inc., a Spanish-language
television network, was facing a protracted trial over charges that
he and his former mistress, Linda Medlar Jones, conspired to
conceal the amount of payments he made to her. Friends of Cisneros
say his legal defense cost more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The former San Antonio mayor had publicly acknowledged his
relationship with Jones in 1988. He told FBI agents vetting him for
the Cabinet post that, after the affair ended, he paid her $2,500 a
month out of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros formally acknowledged Tuesday in his plea that he had
understated the amount. He had told the FBI that his payments
amounted to about $60,000 when they actually totaled more than
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been serving a 31/2-year sentence at the Federal
Medical Center prison in Fort Worth for bank fraud in a related
case brought by Barrett. She was to have been the government's star
witness against Cisneros and was expected to receive a reduction in
her sentence in return for her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had secretly taped conversations with Cisneros in which
the former housing secretary spoke of the FBI inquiry into his
relationship with her. Jones sold some of the tapes to a television
tabloid program, ``Inside Edition,'' for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-trial motions this summer, Jones testified that she had
made 88 tapes but also revealed that none of the tapes were
originals. She told the court that she had copied all the tapes and
deleted portions of a few of them because the conversations were
either personal or could expose her to charges of threatening
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' lawyers denounced the tapes as tainted, but Sporkin
ruled that most of the 26 tapes the government wanted to use
against the former housing secretary were admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended that the payments amounted to hush money
and that the tapes provided proof that Cisneros intended to lie
about the size of the payments. Barrett initially charged two of
Cisneros' aides but dropped the case against them this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was also under indictment in the Cisneros case but Barrett
dropped the two counts against her Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of the Cisneros investigation came amid
widespread disillusionment over the Watergate-era independent
counsel statute engendered by the protracted inquiry of President
Clinton's behavior by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Congress
allowed the statute to expire at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this really what we had in mind when we passed the
independent counsel law?'' asked Katy Harriger, a Wake Forest
University professor who wrote a book about independent counsels.
``I think it was a good thing it expired. It was over-used and the
Cisneros case is a good example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsels are still investigating the activities of
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
Another independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, lost a case against
former Agriculture Secretary Michael Espy but is still wrapping up
his investigation.

VIACOM SET TO ACQUIRE CBS IN BIGGEST MEDIA MERGER EVER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viacom Inc. said Tuesday that it would acquire CBS
Inc. for $37.3 billion, a deal that is the biggest media merger yet
and would create the world's second-largest media company after
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For Viacom and its 76-year-old chairman, Sumner Redstone, who
will run the combined companies if the merger is completed, the
deal adds a major broadcast television network, 15 CBS-owned
television stations and the nation's biggest group of radio
stations to a media portfolio that includes the highly profitable
MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon cable networks, the Paramount film studio
and the Blockbuster video-rental chain.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' 56-year-old chief executive, Mel Karmazin, will become
Redstone's second-in-command and heir apparent, as chief operating
officer, and all units of Viacom and CBS will report to him.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition places the last of the original big broadcast
networks into the hands of a conglomerate. NBC has been owned by
General Electric since 1985, and ABC was purchased in 1995 by Walt
Disney Co. for $19 billion _ the previous record for a media
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps even more significant than Viacom's ascension to
second-largest media company, Viacom could very likely emerge as
the world's largest seller of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the television and radio properties, Viacom's
acquisition includes CBS' pending deal to acquire the billboard
giant Outdoor Systems Inc. Analysts estimate that a combined
Viacom-CBS would generate $11 billion a year in advertising _
nearly twice that of the current leader, Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., which sells $5.8 billion in annual advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's cable networks are popular with children, teens and
young adults, while CBS' emphasis on television news and prime-time
fare like ``Touched by an Angel'' have tended to attract older
viewers. Bringing the children's program ``Rugrats'' and the
sophisticated news magazine ``60 Minutes'' under a single corporate
nameplate is meant to offer advertisers one-stop shopping to reach
audiences of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be global leaders in virtually every facet of the
wonderful, diverse media and entertainment industry,'' predicted
Redstone, who has built Viacom into one of the world's most
successful entertainment companies since acquiring it 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CBS shareholders will get 1.085 Class B shares of Viacom stock
for each share of CBS, an offer worth about $50.93 a share at
Tuesday's closing price of Viacom stock, and including no premium
above CBS' current market value. Viacom will assume about $1.4
billion of CBS debt.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' stock prices rose on Tuesday's news. And
analysts almost universally lauded the deal, not just for its size
and global scope, but for the complementary fit between the
young-skewing audiences of Viacom's cable networks and the older
audiences of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   As Fred Moran, an analyst at the investment firm ING Barings,
said, ``You can literally pick an advertiser's needs and market
that advertiser across all the demographic profiles, from
Nickelodeon with the youngest consumers to CBS with some of the
oldest consumers, and with the Country Music Network, the Nashville
Network, MTV and VH1 right in the middle.''

CISNEROS' POLITICAL CAREER MAY BE IRREPARABLE
</HEADLINE>

By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Henry Cisneros ended his legal problems by
admitting that he lied to the FBI, but his once promising political
career may be beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he's pretty tainted,'' said James Riddlesperger,
who is on leave from Texas Christian University to write a book on
presidential transitions. ``It's another in a long saga of the
very, very high cost of being in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, offered no hints of his plans as he pleaded guilty
Tuesday to a single federal misdemeanor count of lying about his
payments to former girlfriend Linda Medlar Jones. Prosecutors said
Cisneros wanted to hide more than $250,000 in payments from the FBI
because he feared it would derail his 1993 appointment as secretary
of housing and urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the plea bargain, Cisneros will pay a $10,000
fine, but will not be subjected to jail time or probation.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who resigned from HUD in 1996 to become chief
executive at Univision, the Spanish-language television network,
has given no indication that he would like to return to politics.
But one close friend expressed confidence that the former San
Antonio mayor could win statewide office in Texas despite the
guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a white-collar parking ticket,'' said Democratic
consultant George Shipley, who worked on all of Cisneros' political
campaigns. ``I think the path is clear for Henry to come home to
Texas and run for whatever he wants to run for.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipley, who said he thinks of Cisneros ``like a brother,'' said
Cisneros has never talked to him about returning to politics.
</P>
<P>
   For most political observers, the guilty plea was another
reminder of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Until his affair with Jones became public in 1988, Cisneros had
been one of the brightest stars in Texas politics. As one of the
most successful Hispanic politicians, his future seemed almost
limitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly would have been the first Mexican-American governor
or senator. I think that was almost a certainty,'' said Jerry
Polinard, a political science professor at the University of
Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, Texas. ``He so clearly was the
anointed one. This was the future of Texas politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Polinard is not alone in dating the Democrats' current political
difficulties in Texas to October 1988, when Cisneros confessed what
he called his ``close personal friendship'' with Jones, then known
as Linda Medlar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a loss that had a major ripple effect,'' Polinard said.
``They really had hitched their wagon to his star. There was no one
else there to step up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of Cisneros' allies thought that he could overcome
his personal indiscretions. By the end of 1989, he had reconciled
with his wife, Mary Alice, and seemed to restore his family ties.
He got another chance at political rehabilitation when newly
elected Bill Clinton nominated him for the HUD job.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation secretly taped by Jones, Cisneros
speculated about the impact that his new job would have on his
political future. The tapes, which included talk of Cisneros'
payments to his former girlfriend, led to the indictment that cut
short his HUD appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this job takes me out of circulation in Texas because,
I mean, you know, this agency is thought of as a minority agency,
(a) black agency, a big-city agency, (a) housing projects agency,''
he said in mulling over the nomination. ``It doesn't have any
stroke in Amarillo (or) Midland.''
</P>
<P>
   In another phone call, Cisneros acknowledged the pull of
politics when Jones asked him about rumors that he planned to
challenge Republican Sen. Phil Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly want to be in the United States Senate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you want to be governor,'' Jones replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know I would if I could,'' Cisneros conceded, ``but
I see John Sharp ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, the former Texas comptroller, lost a race for lieutenant
governor last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cisneros could re-start his political career, he might
not want to give up his lucrative private-sector job, especially in
light of his legal bills. Univision's stock has been soaring since
he became the network's top executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, when they get caught in this kind of thing,
lose their fire for politics. They feel burned,'' Riddlesperger
said. ``This is a guy with really great talent. He's bright, he's
articulate, he ambitious. He had everything going for him. It's a
human tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Polinard speculated that Cisneros has probably reached a similar
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that in the loneliness of night, sometimes when he's
sitting by himself, there's a point where what might have been
comes to mind,'' he said. ``I don't know how you'd prevent that. It
must be difficult to look up and say, not only what might have been
for me but what might I have been able to do for others.''

3 MOMA SHOWS GRASP THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Belgium, Mexico, The Netherlands)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The painter James Ensor, the great Belgian eccentric
of 19th-century art, developed his style looking at Bosch and
Bruegel. He was thoroughly European. Jose Guadalupe Posada, his
contemporary, a native of Aguascalientes, Mexico, apprenticed in
the workshop of a renowned Mexican broadsheet publisher, Antonio
Vanegas Arroyo. He became a printmaker of big, cheap, mass-produced
engravings in Mexico City.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ensor nor Posada seems to have had the slightest idea
that the other existed. They lived far apart. They didn't really
belong to the same profession, considering that Posada was part of
the Mexican graphic tradition of newspaper satire, and Ensor,
although he made prints that closely paralleled Posada's, was never
an illustrator in a journalistic sense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they are to be paired in ``Modern Starts'' at the Museum of
Modern Art, a giant exhibition that opens Oct. 7. The first in a
series of three shows, each of which will occupy the entire museum,
``Modern Starts'' will focus on art from 1880 to 1920. The two
subsequent shows will cover 1920 to 1960 and 1960 to now.
Altogether, they extend into the winter of 2001, a vast enterprise,
and include works from the museum's own collection and commissions.
``Modern Starts'' has commissioned works from Sol LeWitt, Michael
Craig-Martin and Maria Fernanda Cardoso. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the Modern having embarked on its latest expansion, the
exhibitions are experiments in preparation for the new building,
which won't be completed for several years. The museum wants to
test ways of displaying the history of modern art to supplement the
version that it has stuck to pretty much for as long as it has been
around, which is now the classic account of modernism, with one
historical movement succeeding another, from Impressionism to
Cubism to Abstract Expressionism to Pop and so on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every version of history being tendentious, the Modern's story
has left out a lot of what took place in the past, an elegant
narrative, too pat for some tastes. ``MOMA 2000,'' as the three
combined exhibitions are called, is an attempt to appease the
critics, expand the museum's account of the past and exploit its
own resources: by putting Ensor with Posada, for example, two
artists not generally on view.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Starts'' is being organized by a team of curators from
different departments _ already a novelty at a museum historically
so balkanized that simply exhibiting paintings with prints, mixing
media overseen by different departments _ is a radical move. John
Elderfield, the museum's chief curator at large, who did the recent
Matisse and Bonnard shows, has teamed with Peter Reed, a curator of
architecture and design, Mary Chan, a curatorial assistant in the
department of drawings, Elizabeth Levine, from the department of
painting and sculpture, Maria Carmen Gonzalez, from the department
of education, and George Bareford, an assistant to Elderfield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, they have decided to split the exhibition into
three categories: people, places and things. The layout won't be
chronological or by style, medium or nationality. Good works will
occasionally be with not such good ones. The show won't even stick
strictly to its period: Cezanne's male bather is twinned with a
1993 photograph by Rineke Dijkstra, a Dutch photographer, showing a
boy on a beach, the idea being that the two works be seen to share
a common source in the academic tradition of posed models and a
similarly awkward interpretation of it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other day, in an office he is occupying during the museum's
renovation, Elderfield shuffled Xeroxed pictures of the works in
the show around a bulletin board, figuring out their arrangement.
Tacked to a wall were pictures of an 1894 poster of ``Hamlet,''
with Picasso's ``Harlequin'' from 1915 and Andre Derain's
``Rehearsal'' from 1933. A photograph by Cartier-Bresson,
``Alicante, Spain,'' of three gesturing women, hung a foot away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elderfield wondered aloud whether the photograph might be put
with the Derain and the ``Hamlet'' poster, as examples of
theatrical gesture in the people section. The works wouldn't
normally be presented together, of course, being separated by time,
medium and style, not to mention quality, but having created a
subcategory called actors, dancers and bathers, the curators found
that disparate works fit more or less in a group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cartier-Bresson photograph seemed to go particularly well,
Elderfield decided, with the Derain. Cartier-Bresson, a modernist,
and Derain, who was pretty much a reactionary as a painter, knew
each other and belonged to a social circle in Paris that also
included Balthus. Linking them _ or, for that matter, linking
Matisse with Picasso or Posada with Ensor _ may ultimately be more
relevant to understanding the past than pairing Cartier-Bresson
with Atget or Matisse with Dufy or Picasso with Metzinger,
according to style.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether an unusually improvisatory
experiment for the Modern will turn out to look just vague from an
outsider's perspective. Like displays of the permanent collection
before, it promises to be mostly French. There won't be much
Surrealism, or much Italian Futurism or Russian Constructivism _
even less than usual. American artists are thin on the ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of a century whose history of art the museum has
significantly defined, ``Modern Starts'' at least suggests that the
Modern is preparing to think in terms of a new perspective for the
next millennium. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where, you may well ask, do you find hope in a field
of ashes?
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be the landscape of the Broadway musical at
the moment, at least as seen from the vantage point of the end of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Running a short gamut from the merely proficient (the bloodless
anthology revue, ``Fosse'') to the simply appalling (``Footloose,''
``The Civil War''), from ambitious exercises in earnestness
(``Parade'') to spirit-crushing revisions of classics (``Annie Get
Your Gun''), the song-and-dance shows that opened during the
1998-99 theater season indicated that this most American of popular
art forms was dangerously low on oxygen at the end of the century
in which it was born.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, however, springs as buoyantly in the hearts of the genre's
diehard fans as it does in an uptempo Irving Berlin song. There is
the bright flicker of promise in the slate of musicals that begin
opening this fall, enough to make us all look past such pre-sold
theme-park hits as the mechanical stage version of ``Saturday Night
Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   First, two words guaranteed to inspire optimism: Stephen
Sondheim. No single artist has done more to extend the boundaries
and forms of the musical over the last several decades, and that
this composer and lyricist will again be represented on Broadway,
with his first new offering since ``Passion'' (1994), is
automatically cause to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wise Guys,'' the story of two archetypal American dreamers and
schemers of the 1920s, the Mizner brothers, would seem to offer
especially fertile terrain for Sondheim: a chance to again
anatomize both all-American ambition (as he did in ``Merrily We
Roll Along'' and ``Assassins'') and the show business legacy of
vaudeville (as in ``Follies''). It should be added that few
performers today embody that legacy with the style and swagger of
Nathan Lane, who will be playing one half of the fraternal team of
the title. (His co-star is another nicely seasoned pro, Victor
Garber.)
</P>
<P>
   That Lane, who was temporarily marooned in the world of film and
television, still has what it takes to capture a theater audience
was amply demonstrated when he appeared last season in the brief
run of ``Do Re Mi,'' part of the priceless Encores series of
vintage American musicals in concert at City Center. It is also
heartening that one of the actors with whom Lane shared the stage
in ``Do Re Mi,'' Brian Stokes Mitchell, will also be on the boards
again in the revival of Cole Porter's ode to Broadway narcissism,
``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who registered as an intense dramatic presence in
``Ragtime,'' demonstrated a self-parodying suaveness and vital sex
appeal in ``Do Re Mi'' that should translate ideally into the
backstage (and onstage) posturings of ``Kate,'' which is directed
by Michael Blakemore and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, the
inventive artistic director of Encores.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another seriously talented performer who sparkled
seductively in a recent Encores production (``St. Louis Woman''),
Vanessa Williams, is expected to return in the New York Shakespeare
Festival's production on Broadway of ``The Wild Party,'' the
composer Michael John LaChiusa's adaptation of Joseph Moncure
March's narrative poem about Prohibition-era hedonism. Ms. Williams
will not necessarily walk away with the show entirely, however,
given that its other stars are likely to include Mandy Patinkin,
who has rarely met a scene he couldn't steal, and the eternal,
slinky siren Eartha Kitt.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, one of the more intriguing descendants of the School
of Sondheim, will also be represented by the Lincoln Center Theater
production of his ``Marie Christine.'' This American retelling of
``Medea'' stars the incandescent Audra McDonald, the young
three-time Tony winner and arguably the finest vocal interpreter of
the new generation of theater composers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald's presence alone turns ``Marie Christine'' into an
Event, just as the presence of a star of another but equally
alluring stripe, Carol Burnett, makes an Event out of the Broadway
show in which she stars, ``Putting It Together.'' That, by the way,
is a revue of songs about relationships by Sondheim, who bids fair
to own the forthcoming season, the last of this century. Given that
he has done more than any other individual in recent years to keep
the American musical breathing, this seems entirely appropriate.

IN STUNNING ANNOUNCEMENT, WHITMAN SAYS SHE WILL NOT RUN FOR
SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Facing the daunting task of raising the millions
of dollars needed to mount a campaign for the U.S. Senate, Gov.
Christie Whitman reversed course Tuesday and said she no longer
planned to run for the seat being vacated next year by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's announcement stunned leaders of both political parties
and sent New Jersey Republicans scrambling to identify another
candidate capable of beating either of the two leading Democratic
candidates: Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co., or former Gov. James Florio, whom Whitman narrowly defeated in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Haytaian, head of New Jersey Republican Party, said
Whitman's move ``leaves us in a position without a front-runner for
the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the New Jersey Statehouse, Whitman said
she had made the decision while on a recent family vacation after
determining that a race would be ``a distraction from finishing the
work New Jersey voters had asked me to complete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about whether I can run for the United States
Senate and at the same time fulfill my duties as governor,''
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Whitman said that
she was also concerned about ``the amount of money that needs to be
raised and just the time that it takes to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In private conversations with aides and associates, Whitman was
said to have acknowledged that the demands of fund-raising, and the
prospect of needing to outspend Corzine, who is estimated to have a
net worth of $300 million, had become a factor in her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her heart wasn't in the grueling prospect of raising money and
facing up to a multimillionaire,'' said a Republican political
consultant from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's announcement surprised some of her campaign advisers,
who said she had had little trouble raising money _ more than $2
million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who has never run for public office and is virtually
unknown in state political circles, has said he will spend whatever
is necessary of his personal fortune to be competitive. He has
already given his campaign $500,000 in seed money.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at the Newark offices of his Senate exploratory
committee, Corzine said that Whitman's departure would sharpen his
battle with Florio for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does raise the intensity and focus that falls on the
Democratic primary,'' Corzine said. ``The Republicans will
undoubtedly come up with a formidable and well-financed
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear Tuesday that Whitman's decision instantly
reversed the political momentum, prompting Democrats to predict
easy victory in next November's election while sending Republican
hopes into a political freefall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Governor Whitman in the race, the Democratic nominee
clearly becomes the favorite,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli said in a
telephone interview Tuesday afternoon. ``It greatly increases our
chances of gaining control in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls taken over the summer showed that Whitman was
faring well with the state's voters. A Quinnipiac College poll
released in July showed Whitman leading Florio by 52 percent to 35
percent in a possible race, and leading Corzine by 56 percent to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics were very much in her favor,'' said Roger A.
Bodman, a Republican political strategist who was advising
Whitman's exploratory committee. ``But campaign fund-raising is
enormously time consuming. She just found that it would interfere
too much with her gubernatorial duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of her remarks Tuesday, Whitman refused to concede
her decision has left her party reeling for a substitute, saying,
``I don't think I'm the only Republican who could win this seat.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to suggest anyone in particular, but within minutes
of her announcement, the names of several possible replacement
candidates began bubbling in Republican circles, among them Lewis
M. Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey; Rep. Robert Franks; Jim Treffinger, the Essex County
executive; Rep. Frank LoBiondo, and state Sen. William Gormley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whoever the candidate is, Democrats and Republicans said, he or
she will need to raise a large amount of money to compete with
Corzine. And Florio, an old-line Democrat who, though voted out of
office six years ago, can boast of years of experience as governor.
``The Republican campaign is going to have build $10 million in a
little over 12 months,'' Torricelli said. ``It could be done, but
it's never been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's election to the Senate in 2000 was hardly a sure
thing. In a state with more registered Independents than Democrats
or Republicans, Whitman won both her gubernatorial elections by a
combined margin of some 26,000 votes. And she has never been tested
in a campaign held in a year of national elections, when turnout
among Democrats is usually highest.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, rumors about other reasons for Whitman's
abrupt turnabout surfaced in Trenton, ranging from concern over her
health to her availability to become Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither rumor carried a shred of truth, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they were apprised of Whitman's decision
during a brief telephone conversation shortly before 3 p.m. as Bush
rode through New Hampshire in a multistop presidential campaign
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his reaction, Bush said, ``I was surprised. I told her I
was sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the race to fill Lautenberg's Senate seat, Whitman's
decision also has profound impacts on New Jersey's gubernatorial
race in 2001. If Whitman had won the race, state Senate President
Donald T. DiFrancesco would have become acting governor and the
likely frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a disappointment,'' DiFrancesco said Tuesday.
``From a personal standpoint, sure it would have been kind of neat
to be there as acting governor. Now we need to rally around another
candidate.''

FORMER SENATOR LIKELY TO INVESTIGATE CULT SIEGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Texas)  (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has all but decided to
select Republican former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri to head an
independent investigation into the FBI's disastrous assault on the
Branch Davidian compound in 1993, law enforcement officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials continued Tuesday to review
Danforth's background and deliberated the breadth of the legal
mandate for the re-examination of the ill-fated tear-gas operation
and deadly fire that swept through the ramshackle building near
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and her aides have concluded that they have little
alternative but to grant Danforth wide latitude to fully explore
every aspect of the Waco operation, the officials said. He is
likely to be granted full prosecutorial power to summon witnesses,
seek documents, videotapes and other materials, and convene a
federal grand jury should he determine that one is needed to
complete his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had been close to offering Danforth the job over the
weekend, and Danforth had said he would accept the position, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But she wavered and at one point considered dropping him as a
candidate when Justice Department officials learned that Danforth _
when he was a senator _ had contacted the Justice Department on
behalf of a company with a legal matter pending before the agency.
But the contact was deemed to be a routine inquiry, not an effort
to interfere with the process.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Reno was said to have settled on Danforth and was
preparing to offer him the job, the officials said, in part because
initial feedback from Republicans in Congress, who have been most
critical of Reno, was positive and suggested that Danforth would
bring immediate credibility to what is almost certain to be a
controversial inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's associates would not discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Reno's motives in selecting Danforth seemed clear, his
reasons for taking the job were less apparent. An Episcopal priest,
with a long commitment to public service, Danforth was known in the
Senate as a principled politician and moderate conservative. He
once said that what he liked most about the chamber was a ``a
fight, a big fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Waco inquiry he would face a fractious battle and fierce
partisan rivalries. Waco has become a battle cry among
anti-government critics who blame the FBI for the deaths of about
80 people, including children, in the Branch Davidian compound,
even as an official inquiry by the Justice Department concluded
flatly that the evidence showed overwhelmingly that the Davidians
were responsible for igniting the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who is 63 years old, was once attorney general in
Missouri. He served three terms in the Senate and retired in 1994
to return to a private law practice in St. Louis. In the upper
chamber, Danforth was an ardent defender of Clarence Thomas during
a tumultuous confirmation battle in 1991 when Thomas was accused of
sexual harassment before the Senate narrowly confirmed him to a
seat on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Reno prepared to give the job to Danforth after she endured a
week of withering criticism over disclosures that FBI agents had
fired combustible tear gas canisters on the morning of the April
19, 1993, siege. For years, Reno and FBI officials insisted that
they had done nothing that could have ignited the fire that ravaged
the cultists' compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been under intense pressure to seek a Republican
outsider to head the inquiry since the FBI acknowledged last week
that it had found in its files infrared videotapes which showed
that agents had sought and received permission to fire the
flammable tear-gas rounds from Richard Rogers, the former commander
of the Hostage Rescue Team, the FBI's elite paramilitary unit which
carried out the assault.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have said that they cannot explain why the tapes
did not surface earlier. But they added that the new information
does not change their conclusions about who started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the agents shot the combustible tear-gas rounds
hours before the fire broke out. They said the round bounced
harmlessly off a concrete bunker many yards from the main compound
and that only nonburning tear gas was used during the assault on
the main compound.

   Leaders of Northern Ireland's smaller parties gave former Sen.
George Mitchell little encouragement in the second day of his

leaders of Lockheed Martin followed them, warning key legislators
in their home districts that hundreds of jobs would be lost if
there was not enough money to build the Air Force's newest fighter
jet.
</P>
<P>
   In four cities, they brought along an elaborate computer
simulator of the plane's cockpit to put on a dazzling, video-game
like demonstration of the fighter's potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has also been pushing to save the F-22. Senior
military leaders, from Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Gen. Wesley Clark, the head of NATO
forces, undertook a rare letter-writing campaign warning Senate and
House leaders that American pilots ``who will put their lives on
the line'' in the future are counting on the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   And the Air Force Association, with its 155,000 members, has
spent the last month and a half blanketing Congress with letters,
visits and a videotape (``F-22: Does Air Superiority Matter?'') as
well as mailings and a ``call to action'' by its president.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with Congress back and preparing to decide whether to
restore or cut the money, officials from Lockheed Martin, Boeing
and Pratt Whitney are holding a conference and pep rally in the
Virginia suburbs Tuesday and Wednesday to pump up top
subcontractors of the F-22 and then send them off to lobby Congress
in a bid to save the $70 billion program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the massive scale of it _ with people swarming all over
the Hill,'' said Dale Bumpers, the former Arkansas senator who
heads the Center for Defense Information, which opposes the
program. ``There are no real heavy hitters who can counter them,
especially since the officials at the Pentagon want this worse than
they want to go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, a small group of Washington research institutes are
the only opponents outside of Congress countering the lobbying
onslaught from the armed forces and military industry, and they
admit that they will probably lose this battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon says it's not lobbying, but there's about a half
a dozen of us in the think tank world and about a thousand of them
talking to Congress,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, of the Brookings
Institution, who also opposes full financing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials are even challenging the fellows of
these research institutes on their home ground, the opinion pages
of newspapers, arguing that from the Persian Gulf War to the Kosovo
campaign this year, the United States has become ever more
dependent on air superiority to win at war.
</P>
<P>
   But in this uneven lobbying effort, critics of the F-22 program
are holding their own by pressing the Pentagon on how it plans to
pay for this hugely expensive weapons system as well as two other
fighter jet programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., who heads the House subcommittee
that cut the financing, held his deliberations in private and
announced the results without warning so panel members could
evaluate the program without pressure from the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lewis has been visited by Gen. Michael E. Ryan, the
Air Force chief of staff. He has also flown to Marietta, Ga., to
visit the huge plant where Lockheed Martin is manufacturing the
first F-22s, and has received a stinging letter from Defense
Secretary William Cohen warning him that ``I cannot accept a
defense bill that kills this cornerstone program.'' None of this
has altered Lewis' position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the discussions didn't change his mind and his
determination to get the Air Force to reassess its priorities,''
said Jim Speck, a top aide to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Those priorities include asking the Pentagon what threat exists
that would require full financing of three fighter jet programs
that would cost $300 billion. Analyses by the research institutes,
from the conservative Cato Institute to the more liberal Brookings
Institution and the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
all conclude that one of those programs will have to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that the Pentagon should scale back its F-22 program,
O'Hanlon said that with the current budget constraints, the
Pentagon could not justify spending its scarce dollars on one
fighter jet program to the detriment of programs like troop
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the world's overwhelming aerospace power
and will remain that way, with or without the F-22, for many years
to come,'' O'Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have been countering that argument with daily
briefings for congressmen and their staffs, complete with slides
and handouts, said Lt. Gen. Gregory Martin, an Air Force deputy
assistant secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Defense and the Air Force are working their
tails off for this program,'' he said. ``It is unusual, but the
F-22 is more than a program _ it's a capability that the services
believe they need for the new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, which announced in June that it would have
drastically reduced profits for this year, is using dozens of its
lobbyists to put back the $1.8 billion and keep the F-22 in full
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything that could be reasonably expected under
the circumstances,'' said James Fetig, a Lockheed Martin spokesman.

GORE PROPOSES PROVIDING INSURANCE TO ALL CHILDREN BY 2005

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore proposed Tuesday to
guarantee access to affordable health insurance for all children by
2005, expanding on a program enacted two years ago that he conceded
has had limited success so far.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that the number of Americans without coverage
had increased steadily since he and President Clinton took office.
But in a speech at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, he said,
``If you elect me president, I will insure that by the year 2005,
every single child in our country has full access to fully
affordable health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 11 million children are now uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program in
1997, it gave the states billions of dollars and considerable
flexibility in how the money could be used. Gore said he would
expand eligibility for the program by increasing the limits on
family income and by allowing some parents to enroll with their
children. In addition, he would impose financial penalties on
states that fail to meet federal targets for the enrollment of
children, and bonuses for states that meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said in July that 1.3 million children had
been enrolled in the children's insurance program. Clinton said
that he would have expected at least 3 million to be enrolled by
now, and that he was therefore ``a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said his proposals, taken together, could provide
coverage for 11 million to 15 million Americans, most of them
children. The number of people without health insurance has been
climbing in the last decade and now exceeds 43 million.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of offering affordable health insurance to all
children, though ambitious, is modest by comparison with Clinton's
original plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one
fell swoop,'' Gore said in underlining the differences between his
approach and the grand schemes devised in 1993 by the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a dig at the leading candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, noting that
one-fourth of the children in that state lack insurance _ a higher
proportion than in almost any other state.
</P>
<P>
   While focusing on children, Gore offered several proposals
Tuesday to increase coverage of adults, too. He proposed a new tax
credit to offset 25 percent of the cost of health insurance
purchased by individuals who have no access to employer-sponsored
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, companies that provide coverage get a tax break,'' Gore
said. ``But not individuals who have to get coverage on their own.
That's just not fair, and we have to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans in Congress agree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's proposal to expand the Children's Health
Insurance Program, created in 1997, would extend coverage to the 7
million uninsured adults whose children are eligible for either
Medicaid or the new children's program.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the proposal is simple. Most uninsured children
come from families in which the parents are themselves uninsured.
But Gore's proposal raises a question of equity and fairness: Why
should the government provide subsidized health insurance to adults
with children while denying it to adults of working age without
children?
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not say how much his proposals would cost or how he
would pay for them. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice
president, said, ``This will be done in the context of a balanced
budget, and we'll put out a detailed budget proposal later, but we
have no price tag right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said the cost of Gore's proposals would
almost surely exceed $24 billion over five years _ the amount
appropriated by Congress to cover a maximum of 5 million youngsters
in the new health program for children.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have chided Congress and governors for
not doing more to increase health insurance coverage. But this is a
tricky issue for Gore, because the Clinton-Gore administration
shares responsibility for the failure to fulfill the promise of
programs already enacted at the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a vibrant economy, Gore said Tuesday, the number of
Americans without health insurance has been growing by about a
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``one of the few social indicators that have not
improved under the strong Clinton-Gore economy,'' says a new paper
on health policy prepared by the the Gore campaign. Even though
Congress has created and expanded several health programs,
enrollment has been ``woefully inadequate,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have known for several years that at least
4 million children have been eligible for Medicaid but not
enrolled, and there is no evidence that this number has gone down,
despite many efforts and exhortations by federal officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated administration proposals to define the rights of
patients in health maintenance organizations, to establish new
prescription drug benefits under Medicare and to provide a modest
tax credit for the cost of nursing home care. But the focus of his
speech was on uninsured children, and Gore offered these ideas to
deal with the problem:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government should impose financial penalties on
states that do not meet federal targets for enrolling youngsters in
Medicaid and in the new health program for children. At the same
time, the government would pay bonuses to states that meet their
goals. (Gore said this would make states accountable for their
performance. But critics said it would reward states that are
succeeding, at the expense of states that are struggling.)
</P>
<P>
   _ States could expand eligibility for the new Children's Health
Insurance Program, so families with incomes up to 2.5 times the
official poverty level could qualify. In most states, the ceiling
on family income is set at twice the poverty level. For a family of
four, the poverty level this year is $16,700.
</P>
<P>
   _ More affluent families should be allowed to buy insurance
coverage for youngsters through Medicaid or the new children's
health program if the parents work for companies that do not
provide health benefits. Such families would have to pay the full
premium, but this would often be a bargain compared with prices in
the private market, because large government programs have much
greater purchasing power than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said there were more than 2 million uninsured
children in families with incomes exceeding 2.5 times the official
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said Gore's proposals would clearly help
some working families, but could also take pressure off the states
to find and enroll children who are already eligible for health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would give states a bonus for enrolling children in a
program that already offers states a generous financial incentive
to do just that. In the new Children's Health Insurance Program, as
in Medicaid, the federal government and the states share the costs,
but the federal government pays a larger share of the costs in the
new program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's proposals are intended to restore health
insurance for tens of thousands of children who lost coverage when
their families were removed from the welfare rolls. In theory, most
such children were still eligible for Medicaid, but their parents
did not always realize it, and officials in some states improperly
cut off health benefits along with cash assistance.

U.N. SAYS 200,000 DRIVEN FROM HOMES IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related TIMOR-U.S., TIMOR-UNREST) 
(HLW) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As many as 200,000 people, nearly a quarter of
East Timor's population, have been driven from their homes within
the last four days by militias opposed to independence for the
territory, the secretary-general's spokesman said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many displaced people who had sought refuge in churches and aid
agencies are being rounded up and forcibly moved across the border
to Indonesian West Timor, and thousands of others have fled into
hills and forests, said Fred Eckhard, the spokesman, citing a
report from the U.N. mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Its figures are based on reports from refugees, the few
remaining journalists (who say the capital city seems all but
deserted), departing aid agencies, church officials and the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which until Tuesday had
officials on the border with West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   With most foreigners evacuated from East Timor and the remaining
335 U.N. staff trapped in a compound in Dili, the capital,
virtually all relief aid has ended, almost no food is available for
emergency distribution, and the fate of many refugees is unknown.
U.N. officials in East Timor say they face an emergency ``with
potential catastrophic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the absence of a call for international military
assistance from the Indonesian government, the Security Council
continued to stand by, giving President B.J. Habibie and his
military commander, Gen. Wiranto, at least another 24 hours to end
a reign of terror. That terror seems to have been orchestrated by
units of the military _ and the general may or may not be able to
call a halt to it. The U.N. believes that the Indonesian army, as
well as locally raised militias, have been involved in the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the Security Council will not give the
green light if there is no permission on the part of the Indonesian
government,'' Peter van Walsum of the Netherlands, the Security
Council president for September, said after a council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member council delegation is due to arrive in Jakarta on
Tuesday, overnight, to warn Indonesian authorities that they will
have to stop the violence in East Timor or allow others to do it.
In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said that the United States
still had hopes that the Indonesian military could restore order,
and that there were no plans at this point for the United States to
help an evacuation from East Timor or to send troops to a
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the situation drove the territory's Nobel
prize-winning religious leader, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, out of
the country to refuge in Darwin, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramos-Horta, an exiled East Timorese independence leader,
said in an interview on Tuesday that through all the years of
conflict in the territory, church buildings and convents had never
before been attacked as they have been in recent days. Ramos-Horta,
who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with Belo, is in the United
States campaigning for immediate military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta and some diplomats here raised the question of why a
military intervention has not been requested by Portugal, the
former colonial power in East Timor and the country still
recognized internationally _ if only technically _ as the
administering authority. Indonesia's seizure of the territory in
1995, after Portugal withdrew, was never accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative at the United
Nations, said in an interview that Portugal has been making this
request, saying that Indonesia has broken the agreement signed in
May with Portugal that allowed the East Timorese to vote on their
future. Last week, they decisively chose not to remain part of
Indonesia, and that vote set off the anti-independence violence
that now engulfs the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. has to go there because there is an emergency,
because there is chaos,'' he said. His view met resistance in the
council, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David L. Phillips, executive director of Columbia University's
Conflict Resolution Program, who visited East Timor earlier this
year, said there is a real question whether the Habibie government
can speak any longer for Indonesia on this issue because the
military seems to have control over the situation in East Timor.
But he agrees with diplomats that the United Nations cannot go in,
for political reasons, unless the government, however weak, makes
the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gen. Wiranto is being given the chance to demonstrate his
ability to re-establish law and order in East Timor,'' Phillips
said. ``If that fails, there will be need for an international
force.'' With a request from the government, he said, no questions
would be raised in the Security Council that would delay or impede
its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Indonesia also would be pressured to seek help
because it would not want to lose international aid.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fowler, Canada's representative on the Security Council,
said that it is obviously painful for council members to see
themselves portrayed as paralyzed in the face of this crisis. All
around, there are cries of, Why can't the United Nations do
something, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they mean, why can't the U.N. go to war with the
4th-largest country in the world?'' he asked. ``Is that what that
means?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia has very specific commitments under the May 5
agreement that it will look after security,'' he added. ``We have
all, in a variety of different ways, been trying to cajole,
convince, warn the Indonesians that they must do this, that their
international reputation depends on it, and the whole world is
watching. But up until now, they have made extremely clear that
they will not allow a foreign presence into this part of their
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no taste in the council or in the world for going to
war with Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, of Columbia University, said that Indonesia's
international reputation may not be foremost in the minds of those
military leaders responsible for the continuing violence in East
Timor _ or in the minds of civilian politicians in the capital,
Jakarta _ at this moment. But international opprobrium remains a
useful weapon, he said, toward a country that is in political
turmoil almost from one end to the other and that is trying to
crawl out of a severe financial crisis at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is turning into a huge embarrassment for Indonesia,'' he
said. ``They'll start to care when bilateral assistance and World
Bank and IMF funds are jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday in Washington, the World Bank, jointly with the IMF,
said that it is ``deeply concerned'' by the violence in East Timor
and added that the situation had to improve if Indonesia expected
continued help.

ANALYSTS SEE DEAL AS ACT I IN WAVE OF CONSOLIDATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VIACOM-CBS, VIACOM-NEW-MEDIA, VIACOM-MARKETPLACE,
VIACOM-AD-COLUMN) 
(th) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ To top entertainment industry executives and talent
agents, the acquisition of CBS by Viacom is not merely the largest
media marriage ever. It also accelerates the pressure and momentum
for further deals in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will bring about a new wave of consolidations, make these
companies even bigger,'' said David Geffen, a partner at the film
and music company Dreamworks SKG. ``It's a very powerful merger.
They always come in waves. Everyone becomes competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Howard Stringer, chairman and chief executive of Sony
Corporation of America, said in a telephone interview from New
York, ``After a deal like this, the urge to merge becomes feverish.
And right now temperatures are soaring all over the city.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, owned by General Electric Co., is now the only major
network left without a film studio and an entertainment industry
partner. By contrast, Walt Disney Co. owns ABC, News Corp. owns Fox
Broadcasting and now Viacom has a pending deal with CBS. Even
before Tuesday, there had been industry rumors of talks between NBC
and Time Warner. Executives said the talks had only reached a
preliminary stage and never got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Among the television station properties that are also possible
merger targets are Paxson Communications, USA Networks, the Tribune
Broadcasting Group and Hearst-Argyle.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant, several entertainment industry giants,
including Universal and Sony, are without television networks that
are almost crucial as outlets. But Sony, a Japanese company, is
hampered by government restrictions on foreign ownership of
broadcast networks, while Universal, a unit of Seagram Co., has
sharply diminished its television business to focus on films and
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like musical chairs,'' said Jeff Logsdon, an
entertainment analyst at Seidler Cos. ``You keep taking away one
more chair. There's a scarcity issue now. Disney has ABC. Warner
Brothers starts their own network and is in a fledgling stage of
success,'' he added, referring to Time Warner's WB network. ``CBS
now merges with Viacom. So NBC is sitting there. Whom do they go
after?''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry executives generally applauded the
Viacom-CBS deal as a good fit, especially in terms of television
programming and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, CBS, the nation's No. 1 network in household
ratings and total viewers, will be allied with Viacom's Paramount,
a television and film studio that will most certainly provide
programs for its network.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has several shows on CBS, including ``JAG,''
``Becker'' and ``Nash Bridges.'' Another show, ``Diagnosis
Murder,'' is produced by Viacom Productions, another unit of the
company. And in the season that starts this month, two shows are
co-produced by CBS and Paramount, ``Now and Again'' and ``Love &AMP;
Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Viacom, in turn, gains access to a major network to promote its
films and cable programs. Less clear is how the merger will affect
top television executives at both companies, as well as the fate of
UPN, a network that is 50 percent owned by Viacom and has not found
its niche yet among television audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's positive for both of them,'' said Lee Gabler, the top
television agent at the Creative Artists Agency. ``It's no secret
that UPN has been struggling and trying to build a network, and CBS
is looking for a younger demographic. It gives CBS a studio that
they've been lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top television executive said that the deal should help
shield Viacom and CBS from the vagaries of film and television
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie side of Paramount was an albatross around Viacom's
neck, and the CBS network was an albatross around CBS' neck,'' said
the executive, who insisted on anonymity. ``They've now created a
company so big that the relative performance of next week's new
movie and next week's television show is diminished. You've
insulated the stock from weak performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive added, ``You now have a bunch of businesses with
more predictable earnings flow. This takes the volatility out of
what you're doing.''

   NEW YORK _ Watch out for Gustavo Kuerten. He is the most gentle
soul on the tennis tour _ a trace of the samba in his walk, a hint
of a Brazilian beach in his smile _ but watch out for him, all the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Just by being on the same court with them, he has dispatched two
players from the U.S. Open, with sudden pain in their lower backs.
</P>
<P>
   First, he sent Pete Sampras home from a practice session before
the tournament ever began. Then he disrupted Magnus Norman's
alignment in one set Tuesday in the round of 16, without setting a
pick or tackling anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten is the human version of the killer artificial turf at
Giants Stadium, which disabled a Jets football receiver and a
MetroStars soccer midfielder in the past week without being touched
by friend or foe. In all, seven players have retired from Open
matches with injuries and three others withdrew beforehand, but
Kuerten is leading the league with two notches on his racquet.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't look like the poltergeist type. Known as Guga in the
one-name Brazilian fashion, Kuerten doesn't seem to have a mean
bone in his body. Or any bones at all. Willowy at 6 feet 3 inches
and allegedly 167 pounds, he seems a throwback to an age when most
tennis players could not be imagined committing any other form of
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you never became a soccer player?'' somebody asked
Kuerten Tuesday , a reasonable question of a man from the spiritual
home of the world's most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never watch me play soccer,'' he said with a laugh that
caused reporters to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Guga has that impact on people. Still two days short of turning
23, he has lived with his image of the onetime wonder who sambaed
his way through the 1997 French Open and supports a school for poor
children in his hometown, but has not won a Grand Slam event since.
``You know, I'm play a lot of match,'' Kuerten said Tuesday in
charming English. ``I won four match here in the Open. I don't have
to be worry about the surface anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He came here as the fifth-seeded player and was practicing with
Sampras when Pete suddenly lumbered off the court, later to be
found to have a herniated disk in the lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think sometimes you get injuries just that happen,''
Kuerten said. ``Like you drive your car, you have an accident. It's
the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the same effect Tuesday on Norman, who felt a pain in his
back late in the first set and retired after losing the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's things that can happen to your body,'' Kuerten said. ``We
all human. We have to know that these things can happen. Just try
to pass over and come back next time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful relaxed attitude that may very well be
popular in Brazil _ except when the Selecao, the national soccer
team, loses a game. Somebody asked Kuerten if he had heard any
Brazilian fans in the stands, and he said: ``Not today. It's too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazilians all party yesterday,'' he said, referring to Labor
Day. ``Nobody came,'' he added about Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He did have a big crowd Sunday night when he knocked off the
fading Croatian blaster, Goran Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this match against Ivanisevic, it was great
atmosphere,'' he said. ``A lot of people there. They was going
crazy. People start to go for Ivanisevic, the Americans, because
they saw there was a lot of Brazilians. That's the way I think it
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled having a Brazilian band show up in staid Cincinnati
for a Davis Cup meeting with the United States, but he added:
``Normally, I don't know, it's kind of big to bring over. I don't
know if they allow to get on court with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis would surely be different with the ubiquitous
do-it-yourself samba band that follows the Brazilian soccer team
all over the world. ``Yeah, a lot of fun,'' he said. ``Changeover,
they keep dancing. It's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked his views on the national soccer team, he showed far
more animation for his favorite club in Brazil, Avai _ ``like
Hawaii. You don't know my team, is in the second league now. I like
my team players, but they not famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperamentally, Guga said, he likes the strikers like Ronaldo
and Romario and Rivaldo, the geniuses who create goals, but in this
tournament he has had more in common with Dunga and other defensive
stalwarts who leave opponents sprawling and stricken.
</P>
<P>
   His next opponent is Cedric Pioline from the country that beat
Brazil in the World Cup final in 1998. The bongos might return for
this one. And Pioline just might want to watch his back.

 NEW YORK: the middle.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new company will be called Viacom, but the CBS television
network and all its units will continue to be called CBS. And
viewers will not suddenly find music videos appearing on CBS;
indeed, both Redstone and Karmazin said Tuesday that CBS News, CBS
Entertainment and CBS Sports will continue to be run much the way
they have been, under the leadership of Leslie Moonves, who is to
continue overseeing them.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger could mean, for example, that Viacom's MTV and
VH-1 music cable channels will find new outlets for their
programming on CBS' rock radio stations around the country _ just
as CBS' own cable channels, Country Music Television and The
Nashville Network, now provide programs for some of CBS'
country-music radio stations. And each will heavily promote its
sister networks.
</P>
<P>
   And promotional spots on MTV or VH-1 could induce some younger
viewers to sample shows on CBS, helping the broadcast network
eventually attract more of the 18-to-49-year-old audience that
advertisers pay the biggest premiums to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could also mean that Nickelodeon _ the most
profitable children's network, whether broadcast or cable _ would
provide programming to help bolster CBS' little-watched
Saturday-morning children's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   On the new media front, several of Viacom's networks, notably
MTV and Nickelodeon, have well-established and very popular Web
sites. Karmazin said Tuesday that it was his goal to make
Viacom-CBS one of the leading new media companies, adding that this
goal could be given a substantial boost by the promotional
opportunities available through the company's television and radio
networks and its outdoor advertising unit, the largest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have to divest itself of some broadcast
properties, or seek waivers from federal regulations. Redstone and
Karmazin said they would visit the Federal Communications
Commission Wednesday to appeal for changes in certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, to them, is the cap on television station
ownership, which restricts any company to owning stations that
reach no more than 35 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   With Viacom's 19 television stations and CBS' 15, the combined
company would own stations in 18 of the nation's top 20 markets and
reach 41 percent of the population. If the cap is not raised,
Karmazin said, the company will probably sell some stations to
comply with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But Karmazin and Redstone spoke of their eagerness to create new
business opportunities out of their six potential duopolies _
ownership of two stations in the same market. They have six such
potential duopolies, in Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Dallas,
Miami and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom also owns half of the UPN broadcast network, with
Chris-Craft, and under FCC rules that stake must be reduced to less
than one-third (unless an FCC waiver is granted).
</P>
<P>
   Redstone took pains to point out that UPN, which has struggled
with small audiences for most of its existence, has been ``doing
much better'' with a new focus on young male audiences.
</P>
<P>
   For the CBS television network, an important Viacom asset is
Paramount, the studio that produced the film ``Titanic'' and the
television show ``Frasier'' (on NBC), and that will now undoubtedly
create more television shows for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But Moonves said Tuesday that he saw the model being more like
the Fox network's relationship with its corporate sibling,
Twentieth Television, than like ABC's dealings with Disney. Disney
recently combined management of its television studio and broadcast
network, with the goal of producing more hits for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sister studio, in contrast, produces shows for all the
networks, and Moonves said he expected Paramount to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did feel like a second-class citizen,'' he said, ``when
we saw the advantages ABC-Disney had, and Fox had, and even the WB
had, having a direct link to a studio.'' The WB network is linked
to the Warner Brothers studio, and both are owned by Time-Warner.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is now the only one of the six major broadcast networks
without a major production studio in its corporate family.

IN EFFORT TO REVITALIZE, LEVI STRAUSS HIRES OUTSIDER AS TOP
EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (See also MARINEAU-PEPSI) 
(DW) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to revitalize an iconic brand that has lost some of
its cachet, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. has gone outside its controlling
family for a leader for only the second time in its 146-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Tuesday that Philip Marineau, the executive
given credit for helping to bring new energy to the Pepsi brand,
would take over as president and chief executive on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Although successful at the cola giant, Marineau, the president
and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, had a mixed record
as a marketer at the Quaker Oats Co., where he worked for 23 years.
Robert Haas, the family member who has been most closely involved
in running Levi Strauss over the last decade, will continue as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Levi, the maker of Slates, Dockers and Levi 501 jeans, has been
engaged in a desperate and mostly unsuccessful battle to reverse
the shrinking of its market share. In 1998, revenue dropped 13
percent, to $6 billion, largely because young people were
abandoning Levi's five-pocket button-fly jeans in favor of designer
brands like Tommy Hilfiger or cheaper private-label brands like the
Arizona line sold by J.C. Penney. In February, the company, which
prided itself on making blue jeans in America when many other
manufacturers had moved production overseas, closed half its sewing
plants in North America and laid off 5,900 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Levi has been looking for a president since January, when Peter
Jacobi announced his retirement. The company has made no secret
that it was looking outside of the company for an executive with
experience in consumer products instead of fashion. Still, the
company, which is feeling a bit burned by recent media coverage of
its problems, issued a terse statement hinting at what it hoped to
accomplish by selecting Marineau. `` Marineau is highly regarded as
a talented brand builder and an innovative leader with a track
record of expanding market share in competitive environments,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau made his reputation at Gatorade, a division of Quaker
Oats. During his 23 years with the company, he was part of the
executive team that expanded sales of the brand to more than $1
billion from $85 million when it was acquired in 1983. Marineau was
also a key player in the decision to buy Snapple, the quirky maker
of noncola drinks, for $1.7 billion in 1994. Poor marketing and
disastrous repositioning caused loyal consumers to abandon the
brand and Quaker was forced to sell it for a $1.4 billion loss to
Triarc in 1997. Marineau, who left Quaker in 1995, was blamed by
many for the fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as president of Dean Foods Co., the dairy and
vegetable processor in Franklin Park, Ill., for 10 months, Marineau
joined Pepsi where he quickly set about reinvigorating a tired
brand. He is credited with two marketing coups that might be
relevant to his new role as Levi chief. First, he helped create
Pepsi One, a new diet soft drink. ``The rollout of Pepsi One was
very effective,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of
Beverage Digest, who says the 1.4 percent market share the cola has
achieved is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau's other noted achievement was scrapping the
``Generation Next'' advertising campaign, which had an
unconventional tone that was supposed to appeal to those younger
than 25, in favor of a more broadly focused ``Joy of Cola''
campaign. It is too soon to say whether the new campaign will make
a difference with consumers, but it is popular among the company's
analysts and bottlers. Levi's advertising is now focused on
recapturing the youth market, but it is unclear whether Marineau
will make widening the appeal a new priority.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the announcement of the new chief executive, Levi
has taken several steps to revitalize its brand. Last month, it
opened a new flagship store in San Francisco that featured
attractions like a hot tub where teen-agers could hang out to
shrink jeans and a custom-design embroidery station. In Europe, the
company recently introduced an ``engineered'' blue jean that has
pockets lower down the pants leg than traditional jeans and side
seams that bend to fit the way legs move.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer products executives have been successful at
leading fashion companies before _ Paul Charron moved from Procter
&AMP; Gamble to Vanity Fair and then to Liz Claiborne _ many Levi's
analysts think that Marineau's lack of experience in the fickle
world of teen-age clothing tastes could be a real drawback.
``Apparel no matter how basic has a minimal shelf life'' said Harry
Bernard, a senior partner with Colton Bernard, a marketing
consultant based in San Francisco. ``That means you have to come up
with a new Pepsi One not once, but season after season.''

 &HT;    RENO ASKS DANFORTH TO HEAD WACO PROBE
 &HT;    EDS: Credits Drudge in first graf after optional trim.
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has asked retired
Republican Sen. John Danforth _ an Episcopal priest and former
attorney general of Missouri _ to investigate FBI actions during
and after the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound near
Waco, Texas, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the job offer was informal and ``no final deal
has been reached,'' the official said details of the scope of the
independent probe are still being worked out, but that the
appointment could be announced within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has recently talked to several potential investigators and,
for now at least, Danforth ``has emerged as the guy,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Reno promised an outside investigation after new evidence
emerged that FBI agents fired pyrotechnic tear gas grenades as it
ended a 51-day siege of the religious sect. For six years, federal
officials had denied that the military-issue canisters were used in
the April 19, 1993, assault that ended in deaths of Branch Davidian
leader David Koresh and 75 of his followers, including 21 children.
</P>
<P>
   As Danforth emerged as a top candidate for the job, many
commentators have said he could bring credibility to a case fraught
with religious and ideological suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, was regarded as politically independent during his
three terms in the Senate. After serving for two years as
co-chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax
Reform, he left the Senate after the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation as a non-partisan moderate, Danforth was
a central figure in one of the Senate's most bitter political and
ideological partisan battles of the decade _ the confirmation of
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. A longtime personal friend of
Thomas, Danforth served as the nominee's principal sponsor during
the televised hearings before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Danforth could quiet Republican calls for
congressional hearings into the Waco incident.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a mistake, said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member
of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inquiry run by the Department of Justice _ no matter who is
named to head it _ is not substitute for public hearings before
Congress,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had suggested Atlanta attorney Griffin Bell for the
job, Barr said he has ``no problem'' with Danforth heading the
outside probe. But Barr stressed that Congress must also act.
</P>
<P>
   Any investigation ``conducted predominantly behind closed
doors'' would not ``assure the American public the truth is being
told about Waco,'' said Barr. ``In fact, it would have the opposite
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her search for an outside investigator last week
amid Republican calls for her resignation, Reno said she was
looking for someone who ``has no conflicts, would be well-received
and has the time to handle the task in an appropriate manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth would appear to fit the bill. Before entering the
Senate, he was attorney general in Missouri for eight years before
entering the Senate. Upon leaving Capitol Hill, he returned to St.
Louis and has practiced law and served as chairman of St. Louis
2004, a regional revitalization project.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In another development in the Waco case, first reported Tuesday
by Internet columnist Matt Drudge, a former CIA official has sought
congressional protection from alleged government intimidation as a
whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Cullen, who publicly charged that secret Army Delta Force
personnel were present during the assault on the Davidian compound,
has appealed for assistance from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who
chairs the Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Grassley has not decided whether to take Mr. Cullen
under his wing, but he has agreed to talk to him,'' said the
senator's press secretary, Jill Kozeny. ``If his story is credible
and if he's being pressured for any reason that's improper, then
Senator Grassley would work to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator has a history of defending whistle-blowers. However,
Cullen would need a vote of the full Judiciary Committee to be
granted immunity from charges of breaking his secrecy agreement
with the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Dallas Morning News last month, Cullen
said he had worked with three members of the Delta Force who gave
detailed descriptions of their role in the tear-gas assault on the
Davidians. A direct military role would be in conflict with federal
law forbidding U.S. troops to participate in civilian law
enforcement.

BUSH CAMPAIGN TAKES A MORE PREDICTABLE TACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ There were no embarrassing questions for Texas
Governor George W. Bush during his press conference Tuesday, no
pesky queries about whether or when he might have have used
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   No, the fifth graders at Peter Woodbury Elementary School let
the GOP presidential front-runner off easy _ just as their teachers
had hoped they would.
</P>
<P>
   Though he retains a commanding lead in opinion polls, Bush has
struggled some in recent weeks, fending off demands that he
definitively answer questions about whether he ever used drugs. The
candidate stuck to a tight script in his visits with students and
supporters here, never deviating from his stump-speech answers,
even when the questions came in a mock press session of
grade-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers Ginny Toland and Diane Zito worked to make Bush's visit
a pleasant one by pre-screening their students' questions and
leading them in a song that glorified Bush's leadership as governor
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to all their questions in advance to make sure
they were appropriate and wouldn't make our guest uncomfortable,''
Toland said, adding that the students would study all the
candidates this semester in order to decide for themselves who they
like best.
</P>
<P>
   The song came in the form of a verse hailing Bush that the
students tacked onto a ditty about US presidents. Toland said the
students wrote the verse using campaign literature sent by the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush shows leadership as Governor of Texas,'' the
students sang with enthusiasm. ``He's improved education and he's
lowered the state taxes. This compassionate conservative has made
his reputation. All of his great attributes will surely help our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, expressed concern that the fifth-graders
were not learning quite enough about Bush's education record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the opportunity to go back to the school and say to
the kids, `Now let me tell you our side about what George W. Bush's
education plan is,' '' said Kathy Sullivan, chairman of New
Hampshire's Democratic party. ``They're not being given an objecive
view. It's clear to me he's following the radical right line in
trying to gut public education in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush delivered the first of three major speeches on
education, calling for local control of schools and for federal
funding for charter and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush reiterated that message, as well as his belief
that schools that fail should be penalized. ``The old adage is that
if something is failing you should pour more money into _ I don't
subscribe to that. . . . If the federal government spends money,
there needs to be results.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the classroom, Bush urged the students to spend more time
reading than watching television. ``If you can't read at all, it's
going to be hard to realize the American dream,'' he said. ``You
learn a lot more by being a good reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the students were assigned to research one past
president. Tuesday, they framed their questions in the context of
presidential history. Bush repeatedly praised the students for
asking such ``fantastic questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chester Arthur was not considered an outstanding school
student,'' asked one girl. ``Were you?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush laughed heartily and said, ``not particularly.'' He did say
he had done well in the subjects he liked, such as history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard, but I wasn't what you'd call a great student,''
he admitted. ``I don't want to admit the subjects I didn't do well
in because there are a lot of people writing this down,'' he said,
in a nod to the television cameras and newspaper reporters at the
back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Bush's answers were geared to the fifth-grade level.
One student who studied Millard Fillmore, the 13th president, said
Fillmore was known as a tough negotiator, and he asked if Bush
could live up to that reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The governor cited his negotiations with Texas lawmakers to
enact tort reform as an example of his skills. He said a good
negotiator understands what he is trying to achieve and is ``tough
but fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In other campaign developments, the Bush campaign announced that
Thomas D. Rath had signed on as an adviser. Rath is a prominent
Concord attorney who had led Lamar Alexander's campaign until
Alexander dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dallas Morning News reported Tuesday that
former Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes has told friends he was asked
in the late 1960s by a well-known Houston oilman to help George W.
Bush get a spot in the Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those friends, who spoke to the Dallas Morning News on
the condition of anonymity, said in recent interviews that Barnes
identified the businessman as Sidney A. Adger, a longtime Bush
family acquaintance who died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday that if such a contact occurred it wasn't
needed and it was without his knowledge or consent.

   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Clinton likes to think of herself as
Eleanor Roosevelt. Bill Clinton likes to think of himself as Jack
Kennedy. But the couple are a lot closer to Lucy and Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' marital pratfalls seem to be playing out in black
and white and Formica.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I Love Lucy'' show was driven by this dynamic: Lucy didn't
like waiting at home on that little couch while Ricky was out
babalooing and having a glamorous career at the club. She was
always conniving to get in on her husband's act. She wanted to be a
star, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary never wanted to wait on a big couch in the East Wing
while Bill was out babalooing and having a glamorous career in the
West Wing. She was always conniving to get in on her husband's act.
She wanted to be a star, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is how we always end up tangled in these dizzy policy
messes like the contretemps over clemency for the Puerto Rican
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   We keep getting yanked back to the Clintons' kooky connubial
deal, which seems much more '50s than '90s. Husband strays. Wife
gets mad. Husband brings flowers, and if he's been really bad,
earrings, and if he's been really, really bad, the health-care
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Bill tries to placate Hillary for his naughty behavior,
giving her a political gift in return for a personal betrayal, he
turns into a caricature of a bungling '50s husband, losing his
shrewd political instincts, doing anything just to get back in her
good graces.
</P>
<P>
   Bill repaid Hillary for her ``60 Minutes'' appearance that saved
his campaign after Gennifer Flowers by giving her health care
(disaster) and going along with her wish to have a female attorney
general, who turned out to be Janet Reno (disaster).
</P>
<P>
   Bill can never pay off his debt to Hillary, because he's always
falling deeper into arrears. After Hillary had to pay the Paula
Jones settlement, and after the Monica humiliation, the sky's the
limit on what the president owes his wife as she begins her own
political climb.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency flap crystallizes how downright strange it is to
have the first lady running for Senate in a state where she's never
lived, while her husband is still in the Oval Office making
decisions that have a big impact on New York and that race.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons deny that they ever talked about the clemency deal
_ even though the first lady told Talk magazine that they talk
constantly: ``I was cutting Bill's grapefruit this morning, and we
had the best idea we ever had about day care.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a measure of how much public trust the Clintons have
lost that as soon as they say they did not plot the clemency deal
to help Mrs. Clinton win the Puerto Rican vote in New York, we
suspect that they did.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been contorting itself for several days,
contending that marital politics and New York politics are not at
play in the deal to release terrorists from jail.
</P>
<P>
   But few people here buy it. Most agreed with Sen. Phil Gramm,
who said on ABC's ``This Week'' last Sunday: ``I think what
happened is that this was an effort by the president, by the first
lady, to manipulate politics in New York. I think it blew up in
their face and I think the first lady's trying to distance herself
from it, but even her distancing I don't think works.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' new dream house in Chappaqua is another part of
their wacky deal. So Hillary could hit the right demographics for
her Senate bid, and project a wholesome suburban image, the couple
bought a house that seems as wrong for them as that Connecticut
farmhouse did for the relentlessly urban Ricardos in those late ``I
Love Lucy'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that time Dick Morris poll-tested their vacation
options and sent them west on a camping trip.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Clintons would rather have had a tony co-op in
Manhattan. But the most disturbing part of the dream house is its
financial strings. The Clintons' resources have been strained by
their legal debts and the $850,000 payment to Paula Jones, much of
which came from Mrs. Clinton's blind trust. We have a president who
cannot qualify for a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.7-million Dutch Colonial house was financed by Terry
McAuliffe, the First Sugar Daddy, who put up $1.35 million of his
own money. The businessman has raised millions for the president's
campaigns, legal debts and library, and now he's fund-raising for
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the arrangement is legal, it is one more large and
awkward debt for a couple who never get out of debt, emotional or
financial.

CLEMENCY ACCEPTANCES THREATEN RODHAM CLINTON CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of Puerto Rican nationalists convicted for
a series of terrorist bomb attacks have accepted a presidential
offer of clemency, ending their lengthy imprisonment but leaving
behind a political firestorm that threatens the Senate candidacy of
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Tuesday that 12 of the 14 inmates, who
were part of a Puerto Rican group called FALN, for Armed Forces of
National Liberation, had agreed to renounce violence _ a condition
of the clemency offer. Two inmates are expected to reject the
offer, and two others, who are not in jail but could have their
fines reduced, have until Friday to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the FALN members, convicted of committing more than
100 bomb attacks in the 1970s and 1980s, divided the Clintons and
created a political upset among key political forces in New York,
where Mrs. Clinton is exploring a US Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Mrs. Clinton called for her husband's clemency
offer to be revoked, a move that plays well with New York's
law-and-order crowd but infuritated Puerto Rican activists in New
York City. Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat of the Bronx,
was so angered by Mrs. Clinton's annoucement that he said he was
considering withdrawing support for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president, too, is taking heat for his offer of clemency.
Senator paul Coverdell, Republican of Georgia, said Tuesday he
would hold hearings to examine the ``departure from longstanding US
policy on terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton's political aspirations, her statement last
weekend ``was not a good move,'' said Lee Miringoff of the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion, based in New York state. ``This did
not go over well with one of her core group'' constituencies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have a
strong love-hate factor in their expected candidacies, Miringoff
said: People tend to feel very strongly about the very
strong-minded, strong-willed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the ``undecided'' vote smaller, and the need to fire
up core voter constituencies even more critical. Speaking out
against the convicted felons might win her a few points among law
enforcment, but Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, already has
an edge in that arena, Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton cannot afford to alienate Latino voters, an
important voter consituency that is likely to react more strongly _
and negatively _ to her comments about the FALN inmates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory
campaign, said the first lady ``understands that her friends feel
very strongly about this issue, but she stands by her statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The FALN issue isn't the first, and likely won't be the last,
issue that could separate her politically from her husband. On
matters ranging from foreign policy to budget issues, the first
lady will be forced to either defend or deride Clinton
administration policies that affect New York.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mrs. Clinton has said she favors moving the Israeli
capital to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv (the administration opposes it),
and supports a dairy policy that would prop up milk prices in New
York. The US Agriculture Department opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   She is also being asked to pick sides on her husband's budget,
which would drastically cut federal spending for teaching
hospitals. New York would lose $5.2 billion over five years because
of the proposed cuts, and hospital administrators want Mrs.
Clinton's backing for a bill that would restore some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect New York state's senators to defend us to the
`nth' degree in Washington,'' irrespective of family connections,
said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Vice President Al Gore on the campaign trail
compicates things further, since Mrs. Clinton may be forced to
publicly disagree with the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Al Gore,'' said Miringoff. ``He has to run with one
Clinton, and against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Party,
said she didn't think Mrs. Clinton would suffer from her policy
disagreements with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton realizes that . . . the administration's policies
(sometimes) depart from what is in the best interests of New
Yorkers. When that happens, she might speak out. I think that's
what New Yorkers expect of her,'' Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the decision to offer
clemency ``was made on the merits,'' and was not intended to help
Mrs. Clinton's popularity among Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there have been many who sought to inject politics,
and many who have sought to inject a motive here, and all I can say
is that they're wrong,'' Lockhart told reporters Tuesday.

 NEW YORK: corporate family.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analysts and television industry executives were struck by
Redstone's solution to what had been a longstanding problem at
Viacom, the absence of a clear successor to the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Although Redstone has no plans to retire (and Karmazin said,
``Believe me, this guy still has his fastball''), the older man
said the merger was contingent upon Karmazin's consent to become
his heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   That decision forced Redstone's two longtime deputies, Philippe
Dauman and Thomas Dooley, to resign. Both men urged him to make the
deal, Redstone said, and will stay on the new Viacom's board of
directors, but not as employees.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin and Redstone said they expected no layoffs to result
from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Karmazin is admired for combining tight
financial controls with a willingness to take entrepreneurial bets.
Analysts note that he has sharply improved the financial
performance of the CBS TV stations and affiliates, while also
aggressively increasing the CBS investments in Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, and
Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Paine Webber, both predicted that
the new company would be one of the fastest-growing media companies
in the world, because of its blend of assets and its relatively low
debt, which would enable it to invest in expanding its assets,
acquiring new ones or buying back stock.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom and CBS, other analysts noted, are following the lead of
earlier deals like Disney's purchase of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and
Time Warner's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting. The merger
impulse is driven by the belief that at a time of increasing
uncertainty in the media business, there is an advantage in owning
both the programming and the distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are bet-hedging mergers in some ways,'' observed David
Nadler, chairman of Delta Consulting Group Inc., a management
consulting firm. The challenge ``is how to make these very large
companies with complex sets of relationships work in ways that pay
off,'' Nadler said. ``Just owning a bunch of different properties
doesn't mean you get the profit-making synergies that executives
talk about when they announce these mergers.''

COETZEE LEADS WAY FOR BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Coetzee doesn't regard himself as a historic
figure. But he is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do,'' he says, ``is play tennis _ hopefully for
my country in Davis Cup _ get better, and be able to send some
money home to my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual about that. What is unusual and makes
22-year-old professional Jeff Coetzee a pioneer is that it couldn't
have happened in his country, South Africa, only a few years ago.
You see, Coetzee is not a white man, and people of his shade did
not play games internationally for South Africa in the bad old days
of apartheid that ended in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Coetzee is the breakthrough guy in tennis, the only South
African of color to compete in a major championship (Wimbledon, the
US Open), and to win a match: three here in doubles alongside white
countryman Brent Haygarth.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting across the table in a dining room at the US Open, he
reminds me of a rhyme that erstwhile poet Muhammad Ali used to
voice: ``I ain't got the right connection because I'm the wrong
complexion.''
</P>
<P>
   A slight but wiry 150-pounder, the 5-foot-8-inch Coetzee finds
that now his complexion is acceptable for export, and it is similar
to Ali's: caffe latte, complemented by a brief goatee, amiable
olive eyes, and close-cropped black hair.
</P>
<P>
   He reminds me, too, of a night in Johannesburg in 1973 when
Arthur Ashe _ previously unwelcome _ had won a diplomatic battle to
be included in the South African Open. Ashe, with skin resembling
Coetzee's, was startled by some resistance within the black
community. He had been scolded by a black journalist: ``You
shouldn't have come, Arthur. Nothing will change. They'll still be
kicking our ass after you leave, but the government will look good
for letting you in.''
</P>
<P>
   However, that night, we also encountered a genuine poet, Don
Mattera, considered a subversive by the government. Mattera
consoled Ashe: ``You were right to come, if only so our children
can see that a black man can be the equal or better than whites _
in your case, tennis. Someday apartheid will end, and the children
will have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance has come for Jeff Coetzee, and he has been making the
most of it lately. He and Haygarth attained the quarterfinals in
doubles, losing Tuesday, 6-3, 6-3, to the Swedish-Zimbabwean
coalition of Jonas Bjorkman and Byron Black.
</P>
<P>
   As gales lashed Flushing Meadow, Bjorkman caught the jet stream
with a winning lob on match point. Coetzee chased it vainly, almost
climbing the back fence of the Grandstand Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Jeff,'' Haygarth commends. ``He competes, he has heart.
He's not a heavy hitter, but he's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Another white South African player, John DeJager, says, ``Jeff's
really coming along (up from nowhere to No. 109 in doubles, 217 in
singles) and it's good to see. He's on the Davis Cup squad, and I
think he'll play doubles soon. But he wants to be given nothing.
With our government now there's some sentiment that some guys of
color should be included on national teams whether they merit it or
not. Jeff would never accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll play only if he knows he belongs. When I started in
tennis, there would have been no chance for him. Even now it's
unlikely because they've started so far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coetzee story is indeed unlikely. One of eight children of a
copper miner in the small town of Okiep (``no stoplights, two
tennis courts, beautiful wildflowers'') in the Northern Cape, Jeff
couldn't have emerged from a less promising background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in our family knew anything about tennis,'' said
Coetzee. ``But we saw Wimbledon on TV, and my brothers sawed some
wooden boards in the shape of rackets and made a net from onion
bags in the backyard. We got a rubber ball somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally got a racket, I was 9, and it was too heavy.
That's how I got my style,'' he said, explaining his
double-barreled strokes from both sides. ``An older brother would
drive me to Cape Town, about 350 miles, for junior tournaments, and
I started to win. They gave small prizes of cash, so I had to win
to pay for the petrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trouble? Some tournaments refused me because of color. And I
was called `kaffir' (a racial epithet) a few times. But I didn't
want to go where I wasn't wanted, and . . . well . . . names . . .
I put it out of mind. Things weren't bad in Okiep. I am considered
`colored,' and the colored are the majority there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coetzee got noticed, and he left home at 12, for good, on an
odyssey, first to live in Johannesburg with a friendly family and
hone his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up for a while at John Newcombe's Tennis Ranch in New
Braunfels, Texas, and graduated from New Braunfels High,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has helped him with clothing, Dunlop with rackets, and MTN,
a phone company, is something of an angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling to make ends meet but it's fun,'' he says.
``I'm getting around, and I love the game. I'll be representing
South Africa in the All-African Games at Johannesburg. Davis Cup
would mean a lot to me, to prove I really belong in this game. I
was stunned when Haygarth asked me to play here, and pleased. He's
world class.''
</P>
<P>
   Coetzee and Haygarth opened by beating the second-seeded
US-Netherlands alliance of Jared Palmer and Paul Haarhuis. They
were on their way to ``unimaginable'' prize money, beams Coetzee,
splitting $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can send more home to mom. As a colored, I'm sort of in
the middle at home, between blacks and whites. Sometimes I wonder
who I am, but I don't care as long as I can be a tennis player.''
</P>
<P>
   He's that all right, and a historic figure.

A NEW FORCE IN DISTRIBUTING MUSIC ACROSS THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VIACOM-CBS, VIACOM-REACT, VIACOM-MARKETPLACE,
VIACOM-AD-COLUMN, VIACOM-REGULATE, VIACOM-PROFILES) 
(th) 
 By MATT RICHTEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed merger of Viacom Inc. and CBS would create a
formidable force in the sale, distribution and promotion of music
over the Internet, industry analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would marry Viacom's MTV Interactive, the parent of
two popular Web sites, MTV.com and VH1.com, with the music
properties of CBS, which include Country.com, one of the most
popular country-western music sites. The merger also involves 163
radio stations owned by CBS' Infinity Broadcasting subsidiary
(though many of those are talk or news formats).
</P>
<P>
   For record companies, that translates into a union of two of the
predominant sources of album promotion, namely, the powerful MTV
brand and one of the nation's largest chains of radio stations,
said Jordan E. Rohan, online media analyst at Wit Capital, an
online investment bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company wants to promote, market and sell music on line,
it needs to deal with the new Viacom,'' Rohan said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a New
York-based market-research firm, said the merger could be a boon to
the MTV brand in particular _ both online and off. He said MTV's
already tremendous influence over record companies could grow with
access to CBS' television network, affiliate stations, radio
presence and outdoor advertising. ``MTV now has this unprecedented
reach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Butterworth, president and chief executive of MTV
Interactive, declined to comment on the potential benefits of the
merger. However, at a news conference announcing the deal Tuesday,
CBS Chairman Mel Karmazin said the deal envisioned creating
relationships between the CBS-owned country-western networks, CMT
and TNN, and Viacom's MTV and VH1.
</P>
<P>
   In one aspect of music promotion, CBS thus far has been an
Internet laggard: it has declined to make available over the
Internet the audio from any of its 163 radio stations. It has
stated repeatedly that it would not do so until it could find a
profitable business model.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said, however, that the merger offered some
possible new business models given potential cross-marketing and
sharing of content with the MTV brand. In fact, SonicNet.com, owned
by Viacom, a music news, information and technology company,
assists radio stations in offering their programming over the
Internet, in effect giving CBS strong in-house expertise.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS spokesman, Dana McClintock, said the day was drawing
nearer when CBS would permit its stations to put its audio content
online.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, said he
expected the new entity to be a formidable new media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 million worldwide households to drive traffic to
all of our sites,'' he said, adding that while it was too early to
give specifics, the company considered the Internet a strong part
of the puzzle. ``As we've already told the financial community, the
Internet is not an add-on; it's a major giant new growth
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooradian said both companies have told Wall Street they intend
to spin off parts of their Internet business in separate public
offerings. During Tuesday's news conference, Karmazin suggested
those plans had not changed, alluding to Viacom's stated intention
to spin off MTV Interactive in a public offering in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies own or have an interest in Web sites visited
by millions of Internet users each month. According to Media
Metrix, Viacom's sites, including the Nickelodeon sites, received
6.5 million unique visitors in July.

   HOLDERNESS, N.H. _ Things are finally a little more neighborly
on Golden Pond.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debate, land deals gone sour, accusations of
landowner elitism and state threats to take lakeside property by
eminent domain, the state last month reached an agreement to
acquire its first public access to Squam Lake, where the 1980 movie
``On Golden Pond'' was filmed. Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda
won Oscars in 1981 for their performances in the movie, which also
starred Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of people taking credit for the deal that
has now officially provided everybody, including tourists, their
first beachhead from which to play on New Hampshire's
second-largest lake, after Winnipesaukee.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Squam Lakes Association, which helped broker the
donation of less than a half-acre of land, a boat ramp, four boat
slips and a dilapidated boathouse off State Route 113 to the New
Hampshire Fish and Game Department. There is the state Department
of Transportation and the private Science Center of New Hampshire,
which coordinated plans to move Route 113 farther from the shore
and make land available for parking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Holderness itself, a town of about 1,700 people in
central New Hampshire that has come to terms with the inevitable,
despite ``misguided fears,'' in the words of the late Sydney Howe,
a neighbor and lake activist, ``that the great unwashed public will
harm Squam.''
</P>
<P>
   But the parties involved in the deal, which will allow the state
to build a boat launch in the small channel that connects Squam
Lake with Little Squam Lake, have not always been so neighborly.
</P>
<P>
   Squam is surrounded by private homes and cottages and unspoiled
wilderness. Locals say the lake is great for swimming, boating and
fishing. There are islands and loons, and the water is so clear
that you can see the bottom in some places.
</P>
<P>
   So townspeople can imagine, Selectwoman Sue Webster said, that a
``hot dog crowd'' of tourists may bring fast boats and fast times
here and devalue properties that can fetch $2,000 or more per foot
of shore front.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know that a place can get loved to death,'' Ms. Webster
said. Tourists, she added, ``love to come up to some place because
it's the way it is, and then they change it into something that's
not the thing they came up for in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Squam Lake, like its smaller sister, today looks much the way it
did when the Preston family took its first camping trip to the lake
more than 100 years ago, a few decades before the Prestons bought
their lakeside camp in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Preston, the current landowner and a member of the Squam
Lakes Association, which he served previously as both a vice
president and board member, donated three boat slips to give the
state nearly $100,000 worth of land and docks along Route 113.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard for years, `Why is the second largest lake in the
state not available to the public?''' Preston said. ``There was a
perception that this was a private lake. We all speak of `our lake'
if you have a place there, but it belongs to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Vetter, executive director of the New Hampshire Fish and
Game Department, said the department thought it could secure access
to the lake more than a year ago, but a group of landowners stepped
in to block the state's bid for about six acres on Squam.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought the property right out from under us and for
$50,000 more than the state was prepared to pay,'' Vetter said.
</P>
<P>
   The state started exploring its eminent domain options, but then
the Fish and Game Department forged a partnership of sorts with the
Squam Lakes Association, which worked with Preston to arrange the
donation of land and docks.
</P>
<P>
   On an informal basis, Ms. Webster said, the public has had
access to the lakes for some time, with the cooperation of local
marina operators and the lakes association, which allowed some
public access from its Route 113 property.
</P>
<P>
   But Vetter said private interests really controlled public
access. ``The Squam Lakes Association at any time could shut off
access,'' he said, adding that ``there was always somebody standing
there with their hand out, looking for a donation'' from
out-of-town boaters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Vetter said, ``the association really pulled
together,'' and now both private and public interests are building
good relations.
</P>
<P>
   The lakes association, the Fish and Game Department,
conservationists and interested townspeople will begin meeting this
week to develop plans for the a launching ramp and parking spaces
that will probably be constructed next spring.

<P>
   MASHHAD, Israel _ There was no funeral in this village Tuesday
for Nazal Krayim, an Israeli Arab who was killed on Sunday when a
car he was in blew up in the port city of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   His body was not brought home, but taken directly to the
cemetery. There were no mosque prayers, no wreaths, no Koran verses
broadcast over loudspeakers. There was only a heavy sense of grief
and shame hanging over this community of 6,000, in the hills of
Galilee near Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Krayim's death, along with those of two other Israeli Arabs in a
second car that exploded in a resort at Tiberias, sent shock waves
through Israeli Arab communities Tuesday after the identities of
the men were made public by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Here and in nearby Daburiya, which was home to the other two
men, people struggled to come to terms with what looked like the
first suicide car-bombing attempts by Israeli Arabs _ the kind of
attacks carried out previously by Palestinian militants from the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Although doubts about the loyalty of the one million Arab
citizens of Israel linger among Jewish Israelis, and although the
Israeli Arabs sympathize with the national aspirations of their
Palestinian brothers, few Israeli Arabs have been involved in
anti-Jewish attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So the revelation that Israeli Arabs were involved in the
explosions on Sunday horrified many here, raising fears that they
might all be tarred with the same brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the blackest day of my life,'' said Krayim's brother,
Mohammed, a 56-year-old schoolteacher, as he sat in his house with
stunned relatives. ``In my worst nightmares I never imagined such a
thing. The whole family condemns this and we feel ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of our loyalty to the state, and we seek peace
and coexistence. We beg forgiveness from all the people of Israel,
first of all the Jews, as well as the Arabs. Islam calls for mercy,
not only to human beings but to animals and the trees. A person who
carries out terrorist attacks is a heretic.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the brother recalled, he had gathered his
students on the streets of Mashhad to demonstrate against suicide
bombings by Palestinian militants that had killed dozens of people
in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drew 20 signs,'' he said. ``We stood in the main street and
cried out against the despicable suicide acts. God hates murder
most of all. Murdering a human being is like murdering an entire
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Daburiya, a community of 7,000 at the foot of Mount Tabor,
knots of sullen relatives stood outside the homes of the two
villagers who had died in Tiberias: Amir Masalha, 25, a Muslim
cleric, and Jad Azaizeh, 23, a plumber. No one was paying
condolence calls.
</P>
<P>
   Masalha, who had studied religion in East Jerusalem, had led
prayers in a mosque in Mashhad and had been friendly with Krayim,
an unemployed construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Masalha's relatives argued that he was an unlikely candidate
for a suicide attack, suggesting that he had been duped into
driving the car laden with explosives to Tiberias. He had recently
refurbished a home and gotten married, they said, and his wife was
three months' pregnant. He drove to Tiberias with Azaizeh; suicide
bombers usually travel alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son wouldn't do such a thing,'' said Masalha's father,
Abdel Aziz Masalha. ``The whole thing is suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors of the three men who died insisted that
they had expressed no hostility toward Israel, and had acted
normally on the day they died, giving no indication that they were
embarking on a fatal mission.
</P>
<P>
   But details emerging from an investigation painted a different
picture, indicating possible links between the men and Islamic
militants in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Krayim's mother is from Qabatiya, on the West Bank. Five years
ago, investigators said, his Israeli identity card was found on the
body of a Palestinian suicide bomber from Qabatiya who died in an
attack in Afula, in northern Israel. Krayim said at the time that
he had lost the card, and that he did not know how it had come into
the possession of the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the three men were members of the Islamic
Movement, a political party and grass-roots group that conducts
educational and social welfare activities among Israeli Arabs.
Investigators are reportedly searching for possible links between
some members of the movement and the militant Palestinian Islamic
group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal Azaizeh, the mayor of Daburiya `nd another member of the
large Azaizeh clan, said the incidents have forced Israeli Arabs to
take a hard look at themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be deep soul-searching by the political
leadership, by the religious leadership, by the families and all
the residents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not only us,'' he added. ``As an Israeli society, Arab and
Jew, we have to see how we do this soul-searching as one family, to
maintain the fabric of relations built over more than 50 years.''

U.S. OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE EARLY NOTICE OF BANK CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration learned of the federal
investigation into allegations of Russian money laundering at the
Bank of New York five months earlier than it previously
acknowledged, senior administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After insisting as recently as Tuesday morning that the
administration had learned of the investigation only last month
after reading newspaper reports about it, the officials said the
State Department and the White House's National Security Council
were aware of the criminal inquiry in March, and that the Treasury
Department learned of it in April.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence of money laundering of siphoned aid
provided by the United States or the International Monetary Fund.
Still, the investigation has become a political issue for the
administration and Vice President Al Gore, who has long portrayed
himself as taking a central role in setting policy toward Russia.
As a result, the administration has had to explain what it knew
about the investigation, which was within the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of what it knew before the inquiry became public,
and what steps it took to get tough with Russia about corruption,
are likely to be examined in detail during congressional hearings
that Republicans are planning for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials, who spoke on the condition that
they not be identified, said neither President Clinton nor Gore
learned of the investigation before last month, when the Justice
Department briefed the White House and other government agencies
about the allegations for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that after reviewing records about the case
further, they determined that other members of the administration
had learned through two separate channels earlier this year about
the inquiry, which started around September 1998 and involves at
least $4.2 billion sent from Russia to accounts at the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   By the administration's new account, senior officials including
Robert Rubin, then the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers,
who was then deputy Treasury secretary and succeeded Rubin earlier
this summer, knew of the investigation before the United States
approved the latest round of IMF loans to Russia in July under
stringent conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department did not take the allegations into
account in setting conditions for the IMF loans because they did
not appear to involve misuse of official aid or wrongdoing by
Russian government officials, the administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the United States was concerned about separate
reports _ subsequently repudiated in large part _ that Russia had
misused nearly $5 billion in IMF aid the previous summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department had learned of the investigation from
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which regulates the Bank of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department learned of the investigation from a foreign
government in March, and immediately notified the division of the
National Security Council that tracks international crime and
corruption, officials said. They declined to identify the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The security council staff sought confirmation and further
information from the Justice Department, the officials said. But
the Justice Department did not respond, even after several further
requests, and provided a briefing to the White House and Cabinet
departments only after news of the investigation broke last month,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at the National Security Council who were informed
of the investigation did not pass the information along to higher
levels or to the people who coordinate policy to Russia, the
officials said.

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The 1999 Oakland A's appear to be direct
descendants of the old Oakland Raiders of Ken Stabler, John
Matuszak, and Ted Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's game against the Red Sox, the first of a
crucial two-game set, the A's locker room was a study in chaos.
Nirvana blared from a clubhouse stereo, volume set on 11. Guys with
mustaches and tattoos dressed in front of their lockers, or
slouched on sofas eating burgers and fries from McDonald's. Young
players wore their caps backward, and autographed photos of pro
wrestlers dotted the walls. This must be what it looks and sounds
like when the Hell's Angels pull into a truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   How did these guys miss Rod Beck?
</P>
<P>
   Veteran catcher Mike Macfarlane, one of the well-groomed and
mild-mannered A's, sat in the corner, observed his teammates, and
said, ``To a certain extent, the guys here aren't aware of what's
going on. You're not looking at a bunch of rocket scientists, but
they know how to play and they play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty impressed looking at the Red Sox team and how
they're doing it. They're more fundamentally sound than we are.
We're a bunch of softball players, fun-loving guys that play hard,
go home and forget about it, then come back and do it again the
next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's have captured the attention of baseball America. One of
the scourges of baseball in the 1990s is the hopelessness of
low-budget franchises. Only top-payroll outfits have made the
playoffs in recent years, but the A's offer hope for the poor and
disheveled. Oakland's payroll is $22 million, fifth-smallest in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``People across the country know what this team is about,'' said
traveling secretary Mickey Morabito. ``Unfortunately, the people
here haven't caught on. We'll do well if we draw 20,000 tonight,
and half of those will be rooting for Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's trailed the Sox by three games going into this series.
With 23 games remaining, the schedule favors Oakland. The Red Sox
still have to go to New York and Cleveland and have another series
with Toronto. After Wednesday, Oakland plays only three more games
against teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   They're paying attention to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some tough teams coming up and we just have to
keep playing good baseball,'' said Jason Giambi (.317, 28 HRs, 103
RBIs).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be lying if we said we weren't watching them,'' added
Macfarlane. ``We're asked about it constantly and sure, there were
some cuss words when we saw (Jason) Varitek hit the two-run homer
(actually, it was a three-run homer) in Seattle Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the Red Sox credit,'' said Oakland manager
Art Howe. ``They find ways to win. (Rod) Beck has pitched under
pressure and a guy like Nomar (Garciaparra) can carry your whole
team on his shoulders. It seems like it's somebody different all
the time. But hopefully, this will be a tough trip for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is the name that comes up most when you mention
the Red Sox in the A's clubhouse. Players know. They know that
Boston counts on a win every five days, and this is something the
A's don't have.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have free swingers (204 homers, second in the
majors) and free spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a ball,'' said Giambi, an Olympic teammate of
Garciaparra in 1992. ``We're really not supposed to be here. People
said we were going to lose 100 games.''

   Howe said, ``The worst scenario now is that we had a great run
and have something to build on. We'd like to sweep this series, but
if we lose two, we're still in it. And I think we've gained a lot
of support around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs (33 HRs, 92 RBIs), who along with Macfarlane played
with the Red Sox in 1995, said, ``There is no pressure on the
Oakland A's. Whatever happens, we're having a great year and it's
been good for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Red Sox have been a terrific story. Mocked throughout
the offseason, projected by most to be out of the running, they
have been in contention since April, playing a noble brand of
fundamental baseball. They have demonstrated uncommon resilience
and skillfully veiled their weaknesses. They are the front-runners
for the final American League playoff spot and there's a New
England fantasy that says any team with Pedro can win a short
series against a stronger foe.
</P>
<P>
   But the hand-me-down A's are the feel-good movie of the baseball
summer, worthy winners if the Sox should falter.

FOR RESURGENT PEPSI, A CHANGE AT THE TOP CAUSES CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., N.J.)   (See also MARINEAU-LEVI)  (DW) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a fresh and catchy advertising program, some successful
brands and what appears to be a steady climb in market share,
Pepsi-Cola North America had been shaking off its recent
underperforming history when its president and chief executive,
Philip Marineau, abruptly resigned Tuesday to take the top job at
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the loss of Marineau, who joined Pepsi
less than two years ago and had been widely admired by marketers
and bottlers, who rarely agree on anything, was an unfortunate
development for the No. 2 soft-drink maker. During Marineau's brief
tenure, Pepsi developed a more aggressive market strategy both in
the way it pursued business and in the way it followed through, in
what is known as ``execution'' in the soft-drink business and where
Pepsi so often fell down on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a substantial loss,'' said Andrew J. Conway, a beverage
analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Unfortunately he could
not fulfill his mission at Pepsi. I know he was very much embraced
by the bottler community, and his most significant contribution was
that he was beginning to instill what I call fact-based marketing,
rather than seat-of-the-pants marketing, which is what Pepsi had
done in recent years. Even Coca-Cola will tell you, he was doing
the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Pepsi's biggest bottlers also voiced concern. ``Phil was
a great marketer, and we're all going to miss him,'' said Harold
Honickman, chairman of the Honickman Organization, which holds
franchises for bottling Pepsi in New York and parts of New Jersey.
``He was a very honest guy, who shot really squarely with the
bottlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Marineau's first acts as president was to shut down what
bottlers regarded as an unpromising campaign, ``Generation Next'' _
its final set of television commercials, in January 1998, included
one set to the Rolling Stones song ``Brown Sugar.'' The marketing
executive who devised the campaign, Brian Swette, resigned a couple
of months after Marineau came aboard. The replacement slogan, known
as ``Joy of Cola,'' was developed with Dawn Hudson, Pepsi-Cola's
senior vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Roger A. Enrico, the chairman and chief executive of Pepsico
Inc., said Marineau's work had been important but that Pepsi would
not collapse without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil is a talented guy who made an important contribution
here,'' he said, ``but I would point out that the transformation of
Pepsico began three and a half years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was sure that Gary Rodkin, the head of
Tropicana who has been tapped to succeed Marineau, would also do
well. Rodkin has no experience in the carbonated soft-drink
business, and neither did Marineau, whose main achievement had been
building Gatorade into a billion-dollar brand for the Quaker Oats
Co.. Steven S. Reinemund, who in July had been named president of
Pepsico, was elevated further Tuesday to chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted negatively to the news, as well as to
continuing worries about volume growth at both Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
Shares of Pepsi fell 93.75 cents, to $33.6875, while Coca-Cola fell
$2.75, to $54.625. Coke warned last week that its long-heralded
turnaround in the second half of this year was not on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Sicher, the publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade
newsletter, said the resignation of Marineau ``is not an event that
will stop their momentum,'' noting that by now most of the planning
for next year was already in place. What happens after that,
another analyst pointed out, remains to be seen. ``The fact that
Roger feels confident filling these positions internally shows an
evolution from a year and a half ago, when they were going outside
the company,'' said the analyst, Marc Cohen of Goldman, Sachs.
Still, he added, ``the proof will be in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers said the spinoff of Pepsi's bottling
operations limited Marineau's power within the company to build the
Pepsi brands. The Pepsi-owned bottling franchises were separated
into a different publicly traded company at the end of May. That,
combined with turf battles with other Pepsi executives and the
continuing active role played by Enrico at Pepsi-Cola, may have
proved too much for Marineau, who could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil had his hands tied,'' one beverage expert said. ``Roger
is still running Pepsi, and I don't think Phil has been able to
control the business.''

PANEL RECOMMENDS SWEEPING CHANGES FOR ULSTER POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND JOHN O'FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ A commission appointed to reform the
force that polices Northern Ireland will recommend Thursday that
the Royal Ulster Constabulary change its name, recruit many more
Catholics, and demilitarize its attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 200 recommendations contained in the 300-page report
commissioned by the British government are expected to be highly
controversial. While the report calls for sweeping change in the
way the the force interacts with the public and recruits new
officers, it rejects the demand by hard-line Catholic nationalists
that it be disbanded altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it categorically states, the Royal Ulster Constabulary
``should not be disbanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recommendation that the 13,500-member force change
its name to the Northern Ireland Police Service and strip away
British trappings that Catholics find offensive will outrage
Protestant unionists, whose loyalty to all things British is often
more strident than sentiments expressed in England, Scotland or
Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping ``Royal'' from the police force's name as well as the
oath that its officers take to the British monarch, and barring
portraits of Queen Elizabeth II from police stations, would bring
Northern Ireland in line with police services in other parts of the
United Kingdom. Those reforms are considered essential to increase
the recruitment of Catholics, who make up 43 percent of the
population but just 7 percent of the police force.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists have attacked the idea of a name change as an insult
to the memory of the 302 officers killed and the more than 10,000
injured by paramilitary groups, primarily the Irish Republican
Army, over the last 30 years. The first ``Save the RUC'' rally is
planned for Thursday night in the Ulster Hall in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking the force to reflect the scaled-down threat to public
safety, while increasing the percentage of Catholics to reflect
their proportion in the population, will be a more daunting task
than a name change. The report calls for the Constabulary to turn
over to an outside agency the responsibility for recruitment,
another move aimed at chipping away Catholic resistance to joining.
An elaborate package aimed at encouraging early retirement, and
allowing for more Catholics to join, is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The report, according to a British parliamentary source who has
seen it and read parts of it to the Globe, will please and dismay
both sides. It will be criticized by some Catholic nationalists,
who seek unity with the Irish Republic, as not going far enough.
And it will be criticized by some Protestant unionists, who want to
remain British citizens, as being an ungrateful slap at those who
held the line against terrorism for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the political bickering has started even before the
report's publication, Kathleen O'Toole, the former Massachusetts
secretary of public safety who is one of the eight members of the
Independent Commission on Policing who wrote it, pleaded Tuesday
for a fair reading.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, O'Toole declined to make specific references to
the report's recommendations before their publication, but she
dismissed as inaccurate and inflammatory claims in some British
newspapers that ``terrorists will be doing community policing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing about terrorists having day to day
responsibility for policing is absurd,'' said O'Toole, who is now
an administrator at Boston College. ``The press reports in recent
weeks have troubled me because my hope has been and continues to be
that people will look at this objectively, that they will put the
political posturing aside and look at this as a model of excellence
for policing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong who chairs
the commission, made O'Toole his deputy as the commissioners broke
into two groups, criss-crossing Northern Ireland to ask people what
they wanted in a police force. O'Toole said the report is based on
that input and the ideas and practices of leading international
criminologists and police departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never claimed to be an expert on politics in Northern
Ireland, but I do know how police departments should operate in a
modern democracy,'' said O'Toole, who was a senior officer in the
Boston Police Department and Massachusetts State Police. ``I can't
predict how Northern Ireland politicians will react to the report,
but progressive police managers will recognize it for what it is.
It was meant to create a new beginning for policing in Northern
Ireland, and I think we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will call for ``a comprehensive programof reform to
focus policing in Northern Ireland on a human rights-based
approach,'' replacing the old oath to the crown with ``a new oath
for old and new officers with an explicit commitment to upholding
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constabulary has over the years been criticized by various
human rights groups for inhumane treatment of suspects,
heavy-handed tactics and the use of plastic bullets to control
crowds, and alleged collusion with loyalist paramilitary groups.
The report will not recommend the outlawing of plastic bullets, an
omission that will be attacked by nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists who oppose cross-border cooperation with the Irish
Republic will be outraged by the recommendation for ``more
structured cooperation with the Garda Siochana,'' the Republic's
police force, ``to be tested by cross-border exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   While some unionists see this as the ``slippery slope'' of
sliding into the Republic, cross-border cooperation among police in
Europe is increasingly common. The antiterrorist units of the Garda
and the Royal Ulster Constabulary have worked together closely for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report, called for under the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998, comes as that same agreement is on the verge of
collapse. It also comes as George Mitchell, the former US Senate
Majority Leader from Maine, returned to Belfast this week in an
effort to save the agreement he helped broker.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell decided to end three days of meetings with party
leaders Wednesday, suspending his review of the agreement until
next week, knowing the political fallout from the report will
dominate public debate for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been stalled
over a dispute between the Ulster Unionists, who represent
middle-class Protestants, and Sinn Fein, political allies of the
IRA. The unionists refuse to sit in local government with Sinn Fein
until the IRA begins turning in its weapons.

EAST TIMOR CHAOS IS SEEN AS IMPERILING INDONESIA RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A failure to quell the chaos in East Timor could
strangle Indonesia's fragile economic recovery, government
officials and independent analysts warned on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the violence takes on every appearance of a military-backed
terror campaign, officials fear that foreign lenders will shun
Indonesia while local business will lose confidence in the
government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not able to overcome this, the recovery could slip
away and we could fall into another deep crisis,'' said Umar Juoro,
an economic adviser to Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie. ``We've
got to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jakarta stock market, after plummeting on Monday, leveled
off on Tuesday. But Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, continued
weakening, reaching a rate of 8,250 to the dollar in Asian trading
and settling in New York later at 8,245. Analysts regard an
exchange rate of 8,000 rupiah to the dollar as a psychological
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Juoro said his greatest fear was that foreign lenders like the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank would cut off
billions of dollars in aid. Although these two agencies have not
directly threatened such action, both have expressed shock at the
flood of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're terribly concerned and worried about the East Timorese,
and we're following the situation closely,'' said Ben Fisher, the
World Bank's deputy director and country program coordinator in
Indonesia. ``For the entire international donor community, this is
a very difficult issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that it would
consider canceling a planned trip to Indonesia by its senior
officials to review its program. ``The IMF continues to view with
grave concern the deteriorating situation in East Timor,'' it said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said foreign donors had little choice but to
continue pouring money into Indonesia. Without the aid, they said,
the government would default on its debt and the country would be
ripe for further social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Japanese officials said on Tuesday that they were not
considering halting their aid to Indonesia. All told, international
organizations have pledged $47 billion to Indonesia since the onset
of the Asian crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The money is going toward rebuilding Indonesia's shattered
banking system and aiding tens of millions of people thrown into
poverty by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than the money is the message. If the IMF
and other groups suspend their programs, Juoro and other analysts
said, it will drive away prospective foreign investors, who regard
the aid as a stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really be a signal for foreign investors to get away
from Indonesia,'' Juoro said. ``It would also cause Indonesian
capital to flee the country again. If they stop the support, it
would be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the aid, the cou~try's economy has followed a
haphazard course. After contracting 14 percent last year, the
economy showed a few glimmerings of life. Exports began growing in
April for the first time in a year. In June, the stock market and
the rupiah soared after Indonesia held peaceful elections, the
first voting contested by candidates from more than one party in
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the euphoria dissipated the next month. Investigators
discovered that one of Indonesia's leading private banks, Bank
Bali, had diverted about $70 million in public funds to a top
official of Habibie's ruling party, Golkar. The money was
apparently intended to help gain support for a plan to keep Bank
Bali afloat. And it fed suspicions that Habibie's government was
guilty of the same corruption that marked his fallen predecessor,
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bank Bali scandal was a big blow to confidence,'' said
Mari Pangestu, an economist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Jakarta. ``Now, East Timor is dealing
another blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pangestu said the events in East Timor were particularly
damaging in the intangible, but important area of business
confidence. If executives doubt the government's ability to control
even a small province, she said it would discourage them from
making new investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, dispatching a United Nations peacekeeping force
to East Timor might steady nerves. But other analysts warned that
such a move could harm foreign companies with operations in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be an anti-foreign backlash,'' said James W.
Castle, an American consultant with the Castle Group in Jakarta.
``In general, that hasn't been a problem here. But this could bring
it to the surface.''

NEW YORK CITY MOSQUITO CONTROL IS POOR, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City has one of the least aggressive
mosquito-control programs in the region, with virtually no
preventive maintenance and a budget that is less than 6 percent of
that in nearby Suffolk County, whose human population is only
one-fifth the size of New York's.
</P>
<P>
   As City Health Department officials continued to distribute
pesticides in parts of the Bronx and Queens Tuesday in response to
last week's deadly outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis _ and to
field thousands of worried phone calls from residents _ mosquito
experts raised questions about whether New York's war on the
dangerous pests had come too late. They noted that the species
linked to the outbreak is particularly prevalent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Flushing Hospital said they feared that hundreds more
people in northern Queens might be infected, and said a third death
might be linked to the encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike nearby suburbs in Connecticut, New Jersey and Long
Island, New York does not routinely spray to kill mosquitoes, and
does not set traps to keep track of local mosquito populations,
leaving city officials without crucial information about viral
patterns. When the encephalitis was confirmed last week, the city
had to call in experts from Long Island and even borrow malathion,
the pesticide sprayed over the weekend, from Suffolk County's
Department of Vector Control, the agency that battles
disease-spreading pests.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials sprayed malathion from a helicopter again
late Tuesday in areas of the Bronx, but had not expanded their area
of concern to other parts of the city. They are still awaiting the
results of lab tests on 33 suspected cases, in addition to the five
cases already confirmed, which includes the two elderly residents
of Queens who died last month after contracting the virus.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the main areas of concern remained in Queens
and the eastern edge of the Bronx.

 &HT;    Ohio city the recipient of federal grant to rebuild
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Standing in the courtyard of a public housing
complex, U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton, Tuesday announced an $18.3
million federal grant to help ``a neighborhood come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Urban Development has chosen Dayton to
receive an $18.3 million grant to tear down three public housing
complexes, build more than 100 homes and rehab dozens more in the
Old Dayton View neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The area, which Hall called one of Dayton's first ``suburbs''
and home to early-century millionaires, is now one of the poorest
in the city. The city failed three years in a row to earn HUD
grants for similar proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Local sources have pledged $26 million more to the rebuilding
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that kind of money we can make a difference with this
neighborhood and we can make a difference with Dayton and
Montgomery County,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The complexes to be demolished and replaced with other housing
are Edgewood Courts, where Hall made his announcement; Metro
Gardens and Metro Annex. Officials estimate 300 residents will be
need to be relocated for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are part of a $571 million effort this year by the
federal government to tear down aging public housing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow hard working American families to be left out
in the cold because of insufficient or inadequate housing,'' Vice
President Al Gore said in Los Angeles Tuesday. ``These grants are
aimed at the heart of Dayton's public housing communities _
bringing change that will work to improve living conditions and the
lives of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, is visiting Dayton today and will take part
in a rally in celebration of the grant. The rally, which is open to
the public, will be at Omega Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Omega, one of the region's fastest growing and largest religious
congregations, has pledged to build a $5 million sanctuary along
Salem Avenue as part of the four-year redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   The church is also putting up $2 million for the construction of
a family life center, where church-run classes and activities will
be held for neighborhood residents and church members, said church
pastor the Rev. Daryl Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The work will coincide with several other efforts in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The city is spending $3 million to rehabilitate homes along
Lexington and Grand avenues, north of the housing complexes. The
Alliance for Education, a local charter schools proponent, is
studying whether to build a new charter school on the site of
Summit Courts, a fourth Dayton Metropolitan Housing Authority
complex, not far from the project area, that also is slated for
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton View revitalization effort will be the first major
local effort in the national trend to demolish large public housing
complexes and relocate the poorest residents throughout
communities. The grants, called Hope VI, have pumped billions into
urban centers to demolish public housing.
</P>
<P>
   The grant would replace the 213 public housing units that are
going to be demolished. In their place, DMHA would build a smaller
complex for senior citizens, as well as new homes and rental
duplexes. Sixty homes will be bought outside of the city for
current public housing residents to move into as new owners or
renters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Turpin, DMHA's executive director, said the shift may be
difficult for some residents but that it will help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we don't have unanimous support but the residents have
to be encouraged,'' Turpin said. ``We have to work diligently that
every resident who sets some goals with us achieve their goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents Tuesday in Edgewood Courts said the housing
complex is filled with drug users and is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can get that out of the way, the neighborhood will
come back together,'' said Regina Wiggins, 22, a two-year resident
of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Koneta Cochran, 47, who has lived in Edgewood Courts for six
years, said the concentration of poverty and crime makes it
impossible to raise a family there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so thankful when I moved here my children were grown
and gone,'' Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding neighborhood already has turned its back on the
public housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   North of Edgewood Courts, across an alley, the backyards to
homes on Superior Avenue are protected by fences that in some
places rise 10 feet. The parking lot to the Dayton Fifth District
police station is fortified with a wall and fences where it abuts
Edgewood Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hide the situation from federal officials, DMHA put
a photo of the police station's wall in its grant request to HUD.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Sen. Mike DeWine praised HUD for selecting Dayton's
proposal and praised the effort to turn Dayton View around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton residents can now look forward to a revitalized,
vibrant community where they have access to affordable, safe, and
decent housing for their families,'' DeWine said. ``By issuing this
grant, HUD has recognized that the Dayton Metropolitan Housing
Authority, as well as the entire Dayton community, is committed to
improving the living conditions of the citizens living in Dayton.

 &HT;    Hingis cruises against Huber
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The depth of women's tennis and good health on the
men's tour were called into question Tuesday at the U.S. Open as
Martina Hingis won 12 straight games in a 6-2, 6-0 rout of former
top-five player Anke Huber, and Magnus Norman became the 11th man
to withdraw or retire because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis trailed 2-0 against Huber, who had beaten Jana Novotna
and Amelie Mauresmo in straight sets and offered some promise of a
competitive quarterfinal. Instead, Huber made 39 errors, one more
than the total points she won, and Hingis was flawless in chasing
the German side-to-side on a windy afternoon inside Arthur Ashe
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess her game suits me well,'' Hingis said. ``She's not
going for the lines or big shots. She's playing behind the service
lines, like little angles. I always was able to get there and do
something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Huber plays the grinding game of the early-'90s, when
she got up to No. 4 in the world without a weapon and was never a
match for the game's superstars. Huber was 0-10 against Graf, and
she's 0-9 vs. Monica Seles and 1-9 vs. Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis spent most of her post-match interviews talking about
more interesting things, like the difference between Florida and
New York. Earlier this year, Hingis moved from Switzerland to
Wesley Chapel, Fla., to be near the Saddlebrook Resort, where she
trains, and to escape Swiss taxes. Her assessment won't amuse the
Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is very laid-back, easy-going; you don't really care
what kind of car, what restaurant you go to, what clothes you
wear,'' Hingis said. ``In New York, it's more snobby. You want to
always go to Bergdorf Goodman or Saks Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hingis, the tournament begins in earnest Thursday with a
semifinal against Venus Williams, a 6-4, 6-3 winner over Barbara
Schett.
</P>
<P>
   The first men's match of the day between Norman and fifth-seeded
Gustavo Kuerten was remarkable only in its ending, with Norman
retiring with a back injury following the first-set tiebreaker, won
by Kuerten 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a young Swede who won two clay-court tournaments in
July, had break point at 5-5, 30-40 when he felt a click in his
back that preceded ``an unbelievable amount of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's a shame because I'm playing the best tennis of
my life at the moment,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who beat Andre Agassi at the AT&AMP;T Challenge a couple of
years ago, is the seventh men's player to retire injured during a
match at this U.S. Open, and that represents one-eighth of all
men's matches played thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Four other men, all quarterfinalists a year ago _ Pete Sampras
(back), Patrick Rafter (shoulder), Mark Philippoussis (knee and
ankle) and Thomas Johansson (viral infection in his heart) _
withdrew before it began. Three other '98 quarterfinalists _ Carlos
Moya (back), Magnus Larsson (knee) and Karol Kucera (wrist) _ have
retired during their matches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hale is 30-year-old Cedric Pioline, the 1993 runner-up
who beat 15th-seeded Tommy Haas 6-4, 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline will play Kuerten in Thursday's quarterfinals.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday mocked the Russian
military's handling of an Islamic rebel invasion of Dagestan as
inexcusably careless, joining a chorus of critics who say the
nation's commanders appear to have learned nothing from their
humiliating defeat by rebels in Chechnya three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, palpably angry, appeared on national television as his
security council debated what to do about the rebels, who seized
villages along the border with Chechnya over the weekend and blew
up an apartment complex housing Russian military families.
</P>
<P>
   At least 64 people died in the bombing, which occurred hours
after Russian military leaders and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
confidently declared that they had subdued all rebel insurrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did we lose a whole district in Dagestan? Why are there
more terrorist acts in military compounds than in other places?''
Yeltsin asked, then answered himself: ``This can only be explained
by the carelessness of the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said after Tuesday's security council meeting that the
military would take quick action to quell the insurrection. A
spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry said troops were locked
in battle with rebels Tuesday night in the Dagestan town of
Karamakhi, and that a decisive battle could occur on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's major state-owned television network broadcast undated
film clips Tuesday night depicting torture and execution by Chechen
militants, suggesting that the government may be trying to prepare
citizens for heightened military action.
</P>
<P>
   It was already too late, however, for the military to avoid
scorching criticism of its performance in the latest uprising. The
Moscow daily newspaper Izvestiya declared in a banner headline
Tuesday that Russian generals ``slept through the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear already that the steps taken by the Russian
generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were insufficient to
handle the threat adequately,'' the newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the article, as well as others, was that Russian
generals had misread the strength and intentions of Islamic rebels
during a series of battles that ended with the withdrawal last week
of Chechen rebels from Dagestan. The Chechen forces, led by the
commander Shamil Basayev, have said they plan to establish in
Islamic fundamentalist state in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   By the reasoning of critics, the military prematurely declared
victory over the Chechens and turned its attention to suppressing a
separate movement in central Dagestan by the Wahhabis, a
puritanical Islamic sect.
</P>
<P>
   That proved disastrous: the Wahhabis struck back with the
terrorist bombing of Russian military barracks. And Basayev's
rebels in Chechnya, who apparently had only been testing the
readiness of Russian troops in previous weeks, regrouped and moved
by the thousands into Dagestani territory.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russian troops are now fighting a two-front war.
Reports Tuesday told of heavy fighting outside Khasavyurt,
Dagestan's second-largest city and the town that Basayev's movement
has declared the new capital of an Islamic republic in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow newspapers were speculating Tuesday on the possibility,
unthinkable even a month ago, that a new war on the scale of the
Chechnya campaign may be beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Putin did little to discourage such thinking Tuesday, saying
Russia ``must brush away the syndrome of guilt developed in
previous years,'' an obvious reference to the Chechnya debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been attacked,'' he said, ``and if no cardinal
measures are taken, the bandits will manage to penetrate into a
third district of Dagestan.''

CREDITORS ACCEPT MOSCOW'S TERMS IN OIL COMPANY BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ BP Amoco and other foreign creditors said on Tuesday
that they had accepted an offer by the Russian government to
resolve the bankruptcy of the oil company Sidanko, a move that
could bolster BP Amoco's yearlong effort to preserve its
$571-million investment in the troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   BP owns a 10 percent stake in Sidanko and is among its major
creditors, along with a consortium of Western lenders led by
Dresdner Bank of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the preliminary agreement, the main creditors
would turn their claims against Sidanko over to the government,
which would then take the lead in sorting out bankruptcy
proceedings brought against Sidanko and its three most important
operating units.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors said they welcomed the government's plan because
it would keep Sidanko and its subsidiaries together, rather than
auctioning off the units to pay debts. ``The major creditors and
shareholders of Sidanko have offered a turnkey solution for
Sidanko,'' a BP vice president, Peter Charow, said. ``The
government is providing the key. When it's turned, all the
companies will move out of bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what specific steps the government would take
to try to save Sidanko, one of Russia's largest oil companies, and
the country's first big industrial bankruptcy. Because bankruptcy
is so new, the process is particularly murky.
</P>
<P>
   Sidanko lost $1.9 million in the first six months of 1999,
according to preliminary figures from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors say they are surrendering their rights with no
preconditions and little more than a promise by the state that it
will act in their interests. Spokesmen for the government and for
Sidanko were unavailable for comment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sidanko creditors are scheduled to meet with a first deputy
prime minister, Viktor Khristenko, on Wednesday to begin
discussions on how to actually transfer their rights to Sidanko
debt to the state, and on the detailed terms of a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors say they will not sell their interests to the
government. Instead, the handover would presumably entail some sort
of trust agreement. Officials made the offer to the creditors late
last month, motivated perhaps by a desire to improve Russia's image
among foreign investors, analysts said. ``This case is a litmus
test for foreign investment in Russia,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan,
co-chief of research at United Financial Group, a brokerage house
here. ``It's very high-profile. So far, this has been a bad P.R.
case, and the government wants it to be resolved amicably.''
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco officials have asserted that the proceedings were being
manipulated by a rival Russian oil company as part of a hostile
takeover bid for Chernogorneft, a crucial Sidanko operating unit.
Without Chernogorneft, which accounts for a third of Sidanko's
production, the parent company would cease to function, BP has
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, creditors can initiate bankruptcy proceedings to
recover debts from a profitable company. A small, unknown creditor
did just that to Chernogorneft in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco officials think that the Tyumen Oil Co. is behind the
Chernogorneft bankruptcy. Court rulings regarding Chernogorneft
have gone against its creditors, the largest of whom favor BP
Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen Oil has said that it wants to acquire Chernogorneft, but
has denied it has been involved in bankruptcy proceedings against
it. Outside managers installed by the courts have taken steps to
aid Tyumen Oil in its bid to take over Chernogorneft, but Tyumen
says it has no relationship with the managers.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors run the risk that an agreement with officials in
the current Russian Cabinet might be abrogated by a new one, often
the case in Russia and one of the reasons behind the nation's
dismal foreign investment record.
</P>
<P>
   The key, analysts said, is for BP Amoco to have as many
guarantees as possible that Sidanko will remain whole. ``The word
to have in here is that Sidanko survives as a viable company,''
O'Sullivan said. ``For that, keeping Chernogorneft as part of
Sidanko is vital.''

   WASHINGTON _ If there were a nursery character to symbolize this
year's corporate deal-making, it would almost certainly be a
variation of Humpty-Dumpty, in which he was finally put back
together again.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years ago, Viacom Inc. became an independent company
after regulators forced CBS to sell its cable television and
syndication units. And about 60 years before that, the government
ordered the breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, which
led to the creation of Exxon and Mobil, two of the world's largest
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now regulators in Washington are nearing completion of their
review of the proposal by the Exxon Corp. to buy the Mobil Corp.
just as other officials begin their examination of Viacom's plan to
buy CBS in the richest merger of media companies in history.
Earlier this year, the regulators once again approved a merger of
two of the regional Bell telephone companies, companies that had
been created as part of the antitrust breakup of the AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While experts agreed Tuesday that CBS and Viacom may have to
shed a handful of television stations and other assets to complete
the deal, there is a widespread consensus that at the end of the
day Washington will bless the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   What has made all these corporate deals, which would have been
unthinkable a generation ago, possible?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that the companies and the economics of the
industries they serve has changed sharply and as a consequence, so
has the regulatory climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that the winds of competition are blowing and
therefore anything can happen,'' said Professor Eleanor Fox, an
antitrust scholar at the New York University School of Law. ``The
perception is that markets are more open than earlier times and
that barriers are lower. In any of these markets, firms are more
under the gun to survive growing competition. And of course, the
philosophy of regulation has changed. It used to be there was a lot
of socio-economic concern for the concentration of power in a few
hands. The concentration of power used to be seen in a dark light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Ms. Fox added, ``the concern is that businesses be free
from regulation in order to compete in the global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these changes, executives at CBS and Viacom Tuesday
conceded that important obstacles remain to the completion of their
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission generally has the
authority to approve or disapprove any telecommunications merger to
make sure it is ``in the public interest.'' The FCC, which has not
yet been formally notified by the companies, said in a statement
that its policy ``is to evaluate mergers to see if they meet the
public interest standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will certainly evaluate this one when it is filed with
us,'' the agency statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But three regulations in particular limit the ownership
concentration of networks and television stations. As a result, CBS
and Viacom will have to either persuade the regulators to change
the rules, seek waivers or, more likely, sell some of their
interests in television stations and one of the two networks that
the two companies own.
</P>
<P>
   So it was hardly surprising Tuesday when Sumner M. Redstone, the
chairman of Viacom, and Mel Karmazin, chief executive of CBS,
announced that they would spend Wednesday huddled with top FCC
officials to both explain the deal and criticize some of the
problematic broadcast ownership rules, some of which the agency
announced only five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One older regulation that is of particular concern to the
executives prohibits a company from controlling more than 35
percent of the television broadcasting market. The cap used to be
25 percent but was raised to 35 percent as part of legislation that
largely deregulated the telecommunications industry three years
ago. CBS already owns stations reaching 32 percent of American
households, and its acquisition by Viacom would increase that to 41
percent. But the FCC has indicated it is now reconsidering the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long said that those rules are outdated and those
rules need to be modified,'' Karmazin said at a news conference
Tuesday. ``But at the end of the day, this merger will take place
and we will be in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   A second FCC rule prohibits a company from owning two networks,
which is a problem because Viacom has a 50 percent interest in the
UPN network.
</P>
<P>
   A third rule, adopted last month, substantially relaxes the
limits that had restricted ownership of television stations for
most of the century.

 &HT;    Government asks judge to bar plaintiffs' expert witnesses in
Davidian trial
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The federal government Tuesday asked U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco to bar all the plaintiffs' expert
witnesses from testifying at next month's Branch Davidian civil
trial or grant both sides a continuance.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorney Marie Louise Hagen, who signed the U.S.
Department of Justice motion, argued that plaintiffs' attorneys
have turned over scant information on the qualifications of their
expert witnesses as well as the nature of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant has been prejudiced because plaintiffs' delay
and failure to disclose required information has impaired the
defendant's ability to obtain appropriate expert (rebuttal)
testimony,'' the motion stated.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Caddell of Houston, who represents several
plaintiffs, said the government only has itself to blame for the
incomplete reports on expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it a little disingenuous for the government to complain
about not having complete reports from our experts when they've
stonewalled us for six years and refused to allow us to see the
evidence in this case,'' Caddell said. ``If they had given us
access as they should have, we would have had our expert reports
completed a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   An Oct. 18 trial date is set for the lawsuit filed against the
government by surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of those who
died during the 1993 standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen cited Wayne D. Niemeyer _ who, according to the motion,
may testify for the plaintiffs about the pyrotechnic nature of
munitions recovered from Mount Carmel _ as an example of an expert
witness who is a mystery to it. The government said it wasn't told
Niemeyer's qualifications, the source of the material he is
testing, nor how his tests will impact the issues before the court.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the plaintiffs gave the government as much
information on their expert witnesses as can be expected under the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a vicious circle,'' Caddell said. ``It's
difficult to finalize the reports of our experts until they have
access to the evidence. The truth is that access to the evidence
through a filmmaker or a newspaper is not enough. We can't put on
experts who say, ``I saw this in Mike McNulty's new film, and I
have this opinion on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty produced the new film ``Waco: A New Revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government asked Smith, if he doesn't strike the plaintiffs'
expert witnesses, to grant a continuance to ``allow adequate time
for trial preparation by both sides to this litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen noted that Smith has already struck down two government
requests for continuances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, the United States respectfully urges the Court
to allow the parties sufficient time to prepare this substantial
case for trial, particular(ly) in light of the importance of expert
testimony,'' her motion stated.
</P>
<P>
   The government isn't the only one seeking a continuance. Caddell
himself filed for one a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate to have a short continuance,''
Caddell said. ``We've asked Judge Smith to delay the trial until
Dec. 6 or Jan. 10. He's had our motion for a while. I hope that
means he's considering it. He's usually pretty prompt. He doesn't
let grass grow under his feet when making a decision. I think a
short continuance would be fair to both sides. It would let us see
the evidence and prepare our experts' reports. It would let them
get their experts ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he will file another motion today asking for a
status conference to be held between Smith and the parties in the
lawsuit. He wants to discuss if it's realistic to go to trial next
month, Caddell said, and when the plaintiffs can see the evidence _
now technically in Smith's custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need answers to some of these issues,'' Caddell said.
``Judge Smith issued his ruling Aug. 9 on custody of the evidence.
Here we are a month later, and, as I understand it, he hasn't
gotten a scrap of paper yet. We need to know when we're going to
see the evidence. Otherwise, how can we get ready for trial? I
fully expect Judge Smith to grant a short continuance.''

SUN TO INTRODUCE AN EVEN MORE BASIC NETWORK COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Sun Microsystems Inc. will introduce a
second generation of its network computing business in New York on
Wednesday with a stripped-down ``computing appliance'' for
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Like all so-called network computers, the new device, named the
Sun Ray, relies on a central server computer for its processing
power, data storage and most software applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Ray is extremely basic, even by network computer
standards, with only enough processing power and memory to display
images passed to it by software on the server. It has no disk
drives or other storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   The first widespread commercial availability of the long-awaited
network computer comes three years after the device was made a
rallying cry against Microsoft by Sun's chief executive, Scott
McNealy, and Oracle Corp.'s chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison. The two
executives have waged war against the personal computer, which they
argue is too expensive and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a simple and inexpensive alternative to the PC, the
network computer centralizes most of the expense and complexity of
computing in the powerful servers.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of network computers from Sun and IBM, both
based on the Java programming language, have largely failed as PC
prices fell. But Sun executives said Tuesday that the company had
not given up on its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Ray will be priced as low as $9.99 a month for a
five-year lease, or it can be purchased for $499. A complete system
including server computers, software and monitors will be leased
for $30 a month for each user.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is network computing 2.0,'' said Ed Zander, Sun's
president and chief operating officer. ``We've learned a lot in the
last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Sun would focus on several corporate markets and
intended to use its recently acquired Star Office business to offer
users PC-type productivity applications like word processing and
spreadsheets as well as network applications like Web browsers,
e-mail and access to corporate data bases.
</P>
<P>
   Zander said it was also possible to link the system with a
Windows NT server so that Sun Ray users could run standard Windows
applications over the network.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.,
called Sun Ray a smart move _ not in terms of killing Windows or
Microsoft's Office suite, but in increasing Sun's corporate market
share. He added that eventually the technology would be well suited
to the growing number of networked homes with high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Ray itself is a small box that is connected to a
network, a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard. Each unit can be
personalized to the needs of an individual user by means of a Smart
Card that identifies the user's needs and preferences and also acts
as a security device.
</P>
<P>
   A software system called Hot Desk, which runs on the central
server, permits a user to insert his or her Smart Card into any Sun
Ray on the network and instantly personalize that unit.
</P>
<P>
   Zander said that the new Sun computing environment was a step
back toward an era of mainframe computers and so-called ``green
screen'' terminals _ but with a major performance difference. Sun
is guaranteeing that users will not have to wait longer than
one-tenth of a second between keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives said a typical network system would link two
servers and 50 to 200 active computer users.

2 NEW JERSEY STATE TROOPERS INDICTED IN TURNPIKE SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Two state troopers were indicted Tuesday on
attempted murder and assault charges in a shooting after a routine
traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1998 that left three of
four unarmed young black and Hispanic men injured.
</P>
<P>
   The incident focused national attention on decades-old charges
that the police often stopped drivers solely on the basis of race _
a practice known as racial profiling. That attention led to a
series of policy and political turnabouts, including an
acknowledgment by Gov. Christie Whitman that racial profiling was
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments against the troopers, John Hogan, 29, and James
Kenna, 28, who are both white, were handed up Tuesday by a grand
jury in Trenton. Prosecutors say that on April 23, 1998, the two
troopers stopped a van carrying three young black men and a
Hispanic man on the turnpike near Washington Township and fired 11
shots at them. The troopers have said that the driver of the van
had backed up in an attempt to hit them.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges the two troopers with the attempted
murder of Daniel Reyes, a passenger in the van, and with aggravated
assault for wounding Reyes, 21, of Queens County, N.Y., and two
other passengers, Leroy Jermaine Grant, 24, and Rayshawn Brown, 21,
both of Manhattan. The driver of the van, Keshon Lamonte Moore, 22,
of Manhattan, was not shot. The troopers face a maximum prison term
of 20 years on the attempted murder charge and 10 years on the
assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments came nearly 18 months after the shooting, and
five months after the two troopers were indicted on 19 misdemeanor
charges of falsifying their activity logs to conceal the
disproportionate number of minority drivers they are accused of
stopping. State prosecutors charged at the time that this method,
referred to as ghosting, in which white drivers who were not
stopped were added to the logs, was a way the two troopers and
others covered up the practice of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman issued a statement calling the indictments ``serious and
troubling,'' but added that they were ``only allegations, not
convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the judicial process to be fair and impartial, and
must allow the system to work as it was intended and withhold any
comments of judgment or speculation on the outcome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the lawyer representing Grant in a civil
suit against the state police, applauded Tuesday's indictments as
``the first step on the road to justice.'' He called the state
investigation and grand jury presentation, which included a
re-enactment by law enforcement officials along the turnpike,
``thorough and methodical.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when the two troopers stopped the van near
Exit 8 for speeding. The four young men in it, all between 20 and
23 years old, were on their way to North Carolina Central
University for a basketball tryout.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers have said they began firing on the van on the
highway's shoulder when it continued to roll backward toward one of
them, despite their order to stop. The van's occupants have said
that they were not speeding when they were stopped and that the van
rolled slowly after the stop because it had been mistakenly put in
gear rather than in park.
</P>
<P>
   The incident became the focal point of what proved to be a
significant upheaval in state policy and politics. In the wake of
the shooting, Carl A. Williams, the former head of the state
police, was dismissed by Mrs. Whitman after he made racially
insensitive comments.
</P>
<P>
   It also was at the center of pressure from a New Jersey black
ministers' group and black legislators opposing the appointment by
Mrs. Whitman of her then-Attorney General, Peter G. Verniero, to
the state's highest court. Many insisted that Verniero and the
Governor had willfully ignored and dismissed allegations of the
racial profiling, and that as a result, Verniero was unfit to sit
on the court. He was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   As the appointment was running into trouble in the State
Legislature and Federal civil rights agencies were descending on
the state for an ongoing inquiry into racial profiling, state
officials ended their long denials of the practice. Verniero and
Mrs. Whitman unveiled the findings of a two-month study that
concluded that minorities were three times more likely to be
stopped than whites, because of a culture in the state police that
rewarded zealous pursuit of suspected drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The study ended the state's long defense of its practices in a
pending civil suit alleging racial profiling and led officials to
drop charges in a number of criminal cases growing out of turnpike
traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the incident has continued as minority members of
the state police, in addition to offering evidence of the racial
profiling charges, have claimed there is an oppressive atmosphere
of racial discrimination and intimidation in the department.

VITAMIN MAKERS SAID TO AGREE TO PAY $1.1 BILLION TO SETTLE SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six of the world's largest vitamin makers have agreed to pay
about $1.1 billion to resolve a class-action lawsuit that accused
them of taking part in a global conspiracy to fix vitamin prices
over the past decade, people close to the talks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which could come as early as this week, would be
one of the largest antitrust payments made in a private
class-action suit in U.S. history, lawyers close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some tense negotiations under way, but if the
case is resolved, the six companies would all but admit that for
much of the past decade they artificially hiked the prices of
vitamins that went into everything from breakfast cereal and orange
juice to animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought by some of the world's largest food,
beverage and animal feed companies. It accused the vitamin makers
of forming an international cartel that met regularly in hotel
rooms, sometimes under the fictional name ``Vitamins Inc.,'' to
divide up the global market and artificially hike the prices of a
wide range of vitamins, including Vitamins A, C and E, as well as
Beta-Carotene, essential ingredients in the diet of virtually every
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an oral agreement on most material terms,'' said
Michael Hausfeld, one of the lead attorneys in the class-action
suit, which he said could be settled in the next few weeks. ``It's
a significant recovery as well as a demonstration of the
effectiveness of the antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit was brought by direct purchasers of
vitamins for consumers, such as Coca-Cola, Kellogg's and Kraft
Foods Inc., as well as by the animal feed companies, which supply
vitamin-supplemented rations for poultry and livestock. The
companies would have to decide whether to pass on settlement
proceeds to consumers but are not obligated to do so. Consumers,
who are indirect purchasers of vitamins, are pursuing their own
settlement in a number of class-action suits at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   If a final agreement is reached in the next few weeks, it would
come just months after two European pharmaceutical and chemical
giants _ Hoffman LaRoche, part of Roche Holding AG in Switzerland,
and BASF AG of Germany _ agreed to pay $725 million, the largest
antitrust fine in history, to settle similar price-fixing charges
brought by the Justice Department. Roche paid $500 million of that
sum, with BASF paying the rest. A third big European company,
Rhone-Poulenc SA of France, was accused of being part of the
conspiracy but the company avoided paying a fine because it
cooperated with the Justice Department investigation.
</P>
<P>
   All three European companies _ which produce more than 80
percent of the world's vitamins _ have been negotiating to settle
the private class-action suits, and will pay the bulk of the $1.1
billion settlement, which was first reported Tuesday in the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Three Japanese companies, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Eisai Co.
and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., are also part of the
settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc declined comment on the settlement
negotiations. But an official at Hoffman-LaRoche said the company
had already set aside $640 million to settle civil class-action
suits. ``Negotiations are under way, and we think it will be
settled soon,'' said Martin Hirsch, a spokesman at Hoffman-LaRoche.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilardi, a BASF spokesman, said in a telephone interview
Tuesday that the company was also moving toward an agreement. ``It
is our desire to reach a comprehensive settlement and to put this
matter behind us,'' he said. ``We are in negotiations but it is
premature to discuss the likelihood of success.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the talks said the six companies would pay
more than $1.1 billion to settle the lawsuits, with about $125
million being set aside for attorney fees. The three European
companies would pay the bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Daiichi, Eisai and Takeda were unavailable for
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the case say the big European companies are
eager to end the lawsuits, and resolve a case that has generated
bad publicity. But individual participants in the class-action suit
will have the opportunity to opt out of the case, and pursue an
independent settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At least one attorney is already considering such a move.
Kenneth Adams, who represents 63 companies, including Quaker Oats,
Tyson Foods Inc. and the former Continental Grain Co., as well as
smaller animal-feed operations, said that a $1.1 billion settlement
would be far too small.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the damages could easily push that $1.1 billion
figure 50 percent higher. ``I represent a group of companies
looking to get full compensation,'' he said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``I would be surprised if large purchasers
participated in a settlement that returns less than single damages,
particularly when the defendants have admitted to criminal
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case are expected to give U.S. District
Court Judge Thomas Hogan an update on the class-action suit at a
hearing Wednesday in Washington. A settlement is not expected to
come out of that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For Roche, the largest player in the vitamins market and a
company that has a long history of price-fixing in the U.S. and
Europe, the Justice Department investigation led to an executive
shakeup. Two executives who ran the vitamins operation, Kuno Sommer
and Roland Bronnimann, were fired last May. Both men pleaded guilty
to criminal charges and agreed to serve prison terms in the U.S.,
the first time foreign citizens have been sentenced to prison in a
federal antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Roche is the only company that has spoken out publicly about the
vitamin price-fixing conspiracy, but top executives suggested they
were blameless and clueless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will understand that this was not part of our
responsibility,'' Franz Humer, the chief executive, said at a press
conference last May, after the company settled Justice Department
accusations. ``It is certainly not easy to understand the reasons
for actions of employees who in secrecy organized a conspiracy of
this kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche and ouher vitamin makers are now facing similar
accusations and investigations in Europe and Canada, as well as
class-action suits by a number of American states.

CISNEROS PLEADS GUILTY TO LYING ABOUT PAYMENTS TO FORMER MISTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS that last four inquiries ended in setbacks from prosecutors
in 3rd graf; OUTLINES recent cases in grafs 16-18 beginning:
Tuesday's plea agreement...) (ATTN: Calif., Texas) (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's former housing
secretary, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor count of lying
to the FBI about payments to a former mistress, Under a plea
agreement that brings to an abrupt end the four-year, $10 million
investigation that led to his resignation, he avoids both a trial
on 18 felony charges and jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros would have faced up to five years in jail on each of
the counts in what probably would have been the last criminal trial
conducted under the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement also means that the last four cases brought
by independent counsels ended in setbacks to three prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the plea agreement with the independent counsel,
David Barrett, Cisneros agreed to pay a fine of $10,000 and will
serve no jail time or probation. ``I accept responsibility for the
conduct as outlined,'' Cisneros said in federal court Tuesday.
Cisneros, a former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, added that future aspirants to public office
should learn that ``truth and candor are important.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the courthouse without talking to reporters but later
issued a statement through his lawyer saying that he ``was not
candid'' in statements he made to FBI agents doing a background
check on his suitability to serve in the Clinton Cabinet. But he
said that he hoped he would be most remembered for his actions as
housing secretary for three years at the beginning of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros told the agents that he paid the former lover, Linda
Jones, about $60,000 over the years. Ms. Jones, once known as Linda
Medlar, secretly tape-recorded some 88 telephone conversations with
Cisneros, who is heard acknowledging that the actual figure was
closer to $250,000 and that he had not been honest with
investigators about the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection was set to begin Tuesday in the trial that was
expected to last more than a month. Instead Barrett told reporters
outside the courthouse: ``We are just glad to have this over and
done with.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his office, Barrett defended the
investigation and suggested his decision to end the case was based
on compassion and sympathy for Cisneros, who had a long career of
public service and once was considered a rising political star.
Cisneros is now the president of Univision, the Spanish-language
television network based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disposition should in no way be viewed as minimizing the
serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros,'' Barrett said in the
statement. ``However, a just disposition of any prosecution must
include an evaluation of the defendant's overall conduct. In this
case, the conduct, while egregious, was committed by a person whose
life has been otherwise dedicated to public service, and this fact
must season the final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But many lawyers viewed the case against Cisneros as deeply
flawed, a judgment seemingly confirmed by the prosecution's
decision Tuesday to end the matter. The main problem for Barrett
was that his chief witness against Cisneros was Ms. Jones, who has
been portrayed as a liar not only by Cisneros' defense lawyers but
also by Barrett's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones is serving a 42-month sentence in federal prison for a
bank fraud case brought by Barrett's office related to the money
she received from Cisneros. Prosecutors also exposed as a lie her
assertion that the audio tapes of her conversations with Cisneros
were untouched originals. In fact, the prosecution showed they were
copies, many of which had been altered by her to conceal some of
her statements.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' lawyers had tried to have the tapes ruled inadmissible
at trial. But Judge Stanley Sporkin, who was to preside over the
trial, ruled that the jury would be told the tapes were doctored
and its members could decide what to make of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin said that the plea agreement was appropriate and that it
upheld the principle that, ``We cannot allow an individual to lie
his way into office.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence G. Barcella, a former federal prosecutor,
characterized the result as ``basically a wipe-out, a prosecutorial
implosion.'' Barcella, who is a prominent white-collar defense
lawyer in Washington, said the result shows that the independent
counsel law has sometimes led to prosecutions that are ``gigantic
wastes of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was allowed to expire in June by a
Congress troubled by the controversy wrought by the law and
especially wearied after the impeachment of President Clinton that
resulted from the investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's plea agreement also means that none of the several
independent counsels deployed in the Clinton administration have
achieved a major conviction of their principal targets. Mike Espy,
Clinton's former agriculture secretary, was acquitted on charges he
accepted favors and bribes. The independent counsel investigating
Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, is on the verge of ending an
investigation into whether he improperly intervened in the matter
of a gambling license for an Indian tribe. An independent counsel
investigating Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown ended his inquiry
when Brown was killed in a plane crash in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   And Starr has decided not to seek indictments of Clinton or his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, law enforcement officials said. The
last two cases brought by Starr, against Susan McDougal in Arkansas
and Julie Hiatt Steele, ended in mistrials and dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining open investigation by an independent counsel
is that of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman on charges of influence
peddling in obtaining federal contracts before she assumed the
post.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the plea agreement Tuesday, Sporkin said that he
anticipated that it would lead to much second-guessing. He said his
first impression upon hearing the proposed agreement was that the
penalty was far too light for the time and money expended.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has concluded that what ultimately occurred was
wholly appropriate and that Barrett did not ``have much choice in
the matter.'' Barrett and his associates ``had an obligation to
maintain the integrity of their oath of office and in pursuing this
matter they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sporkin said he believed that matters should have been
concluded more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent inability or unwillingness of the prosecutor to
achieve anything near what he charged follows other setbacks for
independent prosecutors. Mike Espy, the former agriculture
secretary, was acquitted on charges he accepted favors and bribes.
The last two cases brought by Starr, against Susan McDougal in
Arkansas and Julie Hiatt Steele, ended in mistrials and eventual
dismissals.

``A STAR CALLED HENRY'' &QL; 
By Roddy Doyle (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll forgive us if we cut to the chase: This is one of the
best novels we've read all year, and better than Doyle's previous
books, although they were fine indeed. It's broader, richer than
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' and less introspective than the somber
``The Woman Who Walked into Doors.'' Doyle's narrator is Henry
Smart, who tells us the story of the first 20 years of his life. He
begins just before the turn of the century with the meeting of his
parents, a teenage maker of rosary beads and a one-legged bouncer
who turns lowlifes away from a Dublin brothel. They are doomed, and
we know it _ babies arrive sick and die, poverty closes in, and we
see their love fade into the dirt and disease of the Dublin slums.
But before it does, Henry Smart is born, handsome, inexplicably
healthy and full of a promise that is too bright for such a dark
place. By the time he is 5, he is living on the streets, smart but
illiterate, and aware of his own gritty charm. When he is 14, he
takes part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and later becomes a
terrorist for the Irish Republican Army. Through it all, Henry's
savvy, rock-confident voice gathers us in. We know he is telling us
a true story, and yet at the same time spinning a tale _ he
survived childhood, after all, by dazzling and conning the adults
around him. In the end, ``A Star Called Henry'' is not just a novel
about one man but about Ireland itself, from a gifted writer who
knows that misery and laughter are not strangers to one another,
and that even the most rancorous place is not a hell if dreams are
still alive there. This is the first volume of a trilogy that will
take readers through modern Irish history by way of the life of
Henry Smart _ and won't we be glad to see him again. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOOTBALL'S GREATEST PLAYERS'' &QL; 
(Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers
how much it hurts,' '' John Mackey said. ``He lived by that
philosophy and I always followed that advice.'' Mackey was talking
about Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns' offensive powerhouse from
1957 to 1965 and the man this book calls ``the greatest pure runner
in the history of the NFL.'' Brown is top dog on the list of the
100 best football players of all time, compiled by editors of the
``Sporting News.'' Unlike its counterpart, last year's ``Baseball's
100 Greatest Players,'' this volume doesn't dabble much in the
early days, although the list has Jim Thorpe (at No. 88), Bronko
Nagurski (35), Don Hutson (6) and Otto Graham (7). Among the top 10
are Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Johnny Unitas, Lawrence Taylor and
Dick Butkus. There are photos and a brief overview of each player's
career, and it's all football _ there's only a mention of the
acting career for which Brown left the game at 29, and no notice at
all of O.J. Simpson's retirement activities. Best of all are ``Top
10'' lists (they range from ``Best Players I've Ever Seen'' to
``Defensive Linemen I Admire'' and ``Smartest Quarterbacks'')
solicited from some of the great players themselves, including
Merlin Olsen, Deacon Jones, Charley Taylor, Lance Alworth, Jack Ham
and Troy Aikman. Clear some time before you pick this one up,
because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RIGHT SET'' &QL; 
Edited by Caryl Phillips (Vintage, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We began to enjoy this anthology of writings on tennis round
about Page 45, when James Thurber suddenly appeared and described,
delightfully, the 1926 match between France's Suzanne Lenglen and
American Helen Wills, which caught the world's attention at the
time (Thurber's piece is followed by an essay from Wills herself,
which is also great fun). Earlier essays on the history of the game
have interesting titles (``Lawn Tennis: The Sturdy Bastard'') but
are for tennis zealots. For a more general audience, Phillips
includes excerpts from books by John McPhee, Arthur Ashe, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Althea Gibson, and writings on
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. There's
a section on tennis etiquette, with a preponderance of attention
paid to the nasty demeanor of the young John McEnroe, although
there's a short essay by Martin Amis in which those other bad boys,
Connors and Ilie Nastase, are mentioned. It ends with a few pages
from Alistair Cooke, titled ``My Life with Gabriela Sabatini,''
which are blissfully free of bad manners _ just what tennis should
be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WORDS FAIL ME: WHAT EVERYONE WHO WRITES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
WRITING''By Patricia T. O'Conner (Harcourt Brace, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The best writer may not follow every rule every time,''
O'Conner says, ``but they follow most of them most of the time. And
even if you're a Tolstoy or a Balzac, a Thurber or a McPhee, it
doesn't hurt to learn the rules before you break them.'' O'Conner
was an editor at the ``New York Times Book Review'' before she
wrote her first book, the very popular ``Woe Is I: The
Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English.'' Now,
she's a self-described ``grammar maven'' (she's kidding) who
sometimes writes the ``Times' ''``On Language'' column when William
Safire is on vacation. She's obviously following her own advice _
know your audience _ because her approach to words and writing is
as engaging as it is authoritative, and she quotes lots of her
(and, presumably, your) favorite writers. Her justification for
writing this book, oddly enough, is the Internet _ we're all
writing more now that we have laptops and send e-mail, so we need
to brush up our skills. But truly, no hook was necessary. O'Conner
can be our grammar maven any day. &QL;

ALAN CLARK, BRITISH POLITICIAN AND AUTHOR, DIES AT 71  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Alan Clark, the outrageously acerbic Conservative
member of Parliament whose witty, waspish political diaries by
turns skewered his colleagues, gave vent to his splenetic opinions,
and unashamedly celebrated his love of women other than his wife,
died suddenly at home in Kent on Sunday, three months after an
operation to remove a brain tumor, his family said on Tuesday. He
was 71.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the family said that Clark, a passionate
animal-rights supporter, ``said he would like it to be stated that
he regarded himself as having gone to join Tom and the other
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Parliament _ from 1974 to 1992, and again from
1997 on _ Clark became known as one of its most charming and
flamboyant members and as probably the most unreconstructed of its
old-school conservatives. As a junior minister in Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government, he once gave a speech while drunk.
He called his non-slim colleague Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of
the Exchequer, ``that podgy life-insurance risk.''
</P>
<P>
   He named one of his dogs Eva Braun, after Hitler's mistress. He
dismissed Michael Heseltine, the former deputy prime minister and a
man who earned his own fortune, as ``someone who buys his own
furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke proudly of having inherited a 50-room, 17th-century
castle and an estate worth tens of millions of pounds. He told a
reporter how agonizing it was to have auctioned off some of his
family's art treasures to pay taxes: ``You'll never know what it's
like having to do without the Turner.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clark was a serious historian and the author
of several well-received books of military history. They included
``The Donkeys,'' an attack on the failings of Britain's generals
during World War I, which inspired the play and movie ``Oh What a
Lovely War.'' Last year, he published a history of the Conservative
Party from 1922 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Clark said he regretted that his philandering
and propensity for outrageous remarks had tended to overshadow his
intellect and his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Clark was a doughty parliamentarian, an accomplished
historian and a Tory to his fingertips,'' Thatcher said Tuesday.
``Politics is poorer and the world duller with his passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kenneth Mckenzie Clark was born into a family that had
earned its considerable wealth in the 19th century, from a cotton
thread business. His father was the art historian and life peer
Kenneth Clark, the presenter of the BBC series ``Civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Clark was unimpressed by his privileged education: Eton, he
said, ``was an early introduction to human cruelty, treachery and
extreme physical hardship,'' while Christ Church, Oxford, was ``a
waste of time and petrol.''
</P>
<P>
   After an early career in the Household Cavalry and the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force, he became a lawyer and was elected to
Parliament in 1974, representing Plymouth Sutton. He served in
several midlevel posts in the Thatcher government.
</P>
<P>
   He never advanced to the Cabinet. He was perhaps hampered by his
reckless tongue and by his sometimes overzealous promotion of the
arms trade, which led him, among other things, to be accused of
helping cover up British machine tool exporters' contributions to
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Thatcher had a special place in her heart for him, with
his saucy wit and roguish manner and let him get away with things
that no one else would have dared to do. Quizzed by her once about
his shoes, in a conversation in which she refused his request to
introduce an animal-protection bill, he replied that they were made
of leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure, prime minister, you would not want to see your
ministers walking around in plastic footwear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark spoke of the prime minister with awe, calling her ``a
force of nature'' and referring to her as ``the lady'' in his
celebrated, take-no-prisoners book, ``Mrs. Thatcher's Minister: The
Private Diaries of Alan Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of many of the women with whom Clark
came into contact. His wife, Jane, said he took a third person
along on their honeymoon _ his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries are full of accounts of various crushes and
conquests, including, most famously, a mother and two daughters
whom he said he had seduced. The woman's husband, Judge James
Harkess, sold the story, from his perspective, to The News of the
World, whereupon Mrs. Clark said, ``If you bed people of
below-stairs classes, they go to the papers, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Of Mrs. Clark, who married Clark when she was 16 and he was 30,
one newspaper pointed out that ``her name rarely appears in the
press without the prefix `long-suffering.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must remember,'' a friend once said to her, ``that Al is
65 going on 25.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm,'' Mrs. Clark is said to have replied, ``sometimes I think
it's 65 going on 12.'' She survives him, as do two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Being boring, and being bored, Clark felt, were perhaps the
worst things of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In common with many brilliantly clever people, Alan's
attention span is woefully short,'' Clark's younger brother, Colin,
once said. ``I remember an occasion when he asked all the most
amusing people he knew to a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halfway through, he suddenly announced: `I'm bored. If this is
the best you can do, I'm going to bed.' And he took a large glass
of milk and vanished upstairs, not to be seen for the rest of the
evening.''

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore proposed Tuesday to
guarantee access to affordable health insurance for all children by
2005, expanding on a program enacted two years ago that he conceded
has had limited success so far.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that the number of Americans without coverage
had increased steadily since he and President Clinton took office.
But in a speech at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, he said,
``If you elect me president, I will insure that by the year 2005,
every single child in our country has full access to fully
affordable health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 11 million children are now uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program in
1997, it gave the states billions of dollars and considerable
flexibility in how the money could be used. Gore said he would
expand eligibility for the program by increasing the limits on
family income and by allowing some parents to enroll with their
children. In addition, he would impose financial penalties on
states that fail to meet federal targets for the enrollment of
children, and bonuses for states that meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said in July that 1.3 million children had
been enrolled in the children's insurance program. Clinton said
that he would have expected at least 3 million to be enrolled by
now, and that he was therefore ``a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said his proposals, taken together, could provide
coverage for 11 million to 15 million Americans, most of them
children. The number of people without health insurance has been
climbing in the last decade and now exceeds 43 million.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of offering affordable health insurance to all
children, though ambitious, is modest by comparison with Clinton's
original plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one
fell swoop,'' Gore said in underlining the differences between his
approach and the grand schemes devised in 1993 by the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a dig at the leading candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, noting that
one-fourth of the children in that state lack insurance _ a higher
proportion than in almost any other state.
</P>
<P>
   While focusing on children, Gore offered several proposals
Tuesday to increase coverage of adults, too. He proposed a new tax
credit to offset 25 percent of the cost of health insurance
purchased by individuals who have no access to employer-sponsored
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, companies that provide coverage get a tax break,'' Gore
said. ``But not individuals who have to get coverage on their own.
That's just not fair, and we have to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans in Congress agree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's proposal to expand the Children's Health
Insurance Program, created in 1997, would extend coverage to the 7
million uninsured adults whose children are eligible for either
Medicaid or the new children's program.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the proposal is simple. Most uninsured children
come from families in which the parents are themselves uninsured.
But Gore's proposal raises a question of equity and fairness: Why
should the government provide subsidized health insurance to adults
with children while denying it to adults of working age without
children?
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not say how much his proposals would cost or how he
would pay for them. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice
president, said, ``This will be done in the context of a balanced
budget, and we'll put out a detailed budget proposal later, but we
have no price tag right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said the cost of Gore's proposals would
almost surely exceed $24 billion over five years _ the amount
appropriated by Congress to cover a maximum of 5 million youngsters
in the new health program for children.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have chided Congress and governors for
not doing more to increase health insurance coverage. But this is a
tricky issue for Gore, because the Clinton-Gore administration
shares responsibility for the failure to fulfill the promise of
programs already enacted at the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a vibrant economy, Gore said Tuesday, the number of
Americans without health insurance has been growing by about a
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``one of the few social indicators that have not
improved under the strong Clinton-Gore economy,'' says a new paper
on health policy prepared by the the Gore campaign. Even though
Congress has created and expanded several health programs,
enrollment has been ``woefully inadequate,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have known for several years that at least
4 million children have been eligible for Medicaid but not
enrolled, and there is no evidence that this number has gone down,
despite many efforts and exhortations by federal officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated administration proposals to define the rights of
patients in health maintenance organizations, to establish new
prescription drug benefits under Medicare and to provide a modest
tax credit for the cost of nursing home care. But the focus of his
speech was on uninsured children, and Gore offered these ideas to
deal with the problem:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government should impose financial penalties on
states that do not meet federal targets for enrolling youngsters in
Medicaid and in the new health program for children. At the same
time, the government would pay bonuses to states that meet their
goals. (Gore said this would make states accountable for their
performance. But critics said it would reward states that are
succeeding, at the expense of states that are struggling.)
</P>
<P>
   _ States could expand eligibility for the new Children's Health
Insurance Program, so families with incomes up to 2.5 times the
official poverty level could qualify. In most states, the ceiling
on family income is set at twice the poverty level. For a family of
four, the poverty level this year is $16,700.
</P>
<P>
   _ More affluent families should be allowed to buy insurance
coverage for youngsters through Medicaid or the new children's
health program if the parents work for companies that do not
provide health benefits. Such families would have to pay the full
premium, but this would often be a bargain compared with prices in
the private market, because large government programs have much
greater purchasing power than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said there were more than 2 million uninsured
children in families with incomes exceeding 2.5 times the official
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said Gore's proposals would clearly help
some working families, but could also take pressure off the states
to find and enroll children who are already eligible for health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would give states a bonus for enrolling children in a
program that already offers states a generous financial incentive
to do just that. In the new Children's Health Insurance Program, as
in Medicaid, the federal government and the states share the costs,
but the federal government pays a larger share of the costs in the
new program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's proposals are intended to restore health
insurance for tens of thousands of children who lost coverage when
their families were removed from the welfare rolls. In theory, most
such children were still eligible for Medicaid, but their parents
did not always realize it, and officials in some states improperly
cut off health benefits along with cash assistance.

   NEW YORK _ Rain or not, the remnants of Hurricane Dennis
continued to menace the U.S. Open players who, unlike top-seeded
Martina Hingis, had trouble recalibrating the tools of their trade
inside a virtual wind tunnel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the wind treated the tennis balls like stunt
kites, snatching them from the launcher and sending them on wild
trajectories that tried the receiver's retrieval skills. It made
for ugly tennis, and uglier tempers _ all except for Hingis, who
squeezed out just 15 unforced errors in her 6-2, 6-0 victory over
Anke Huber to advance to the Open's semifinal round for the third
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening session, third-seeded Venus Williams managed to
overpower 12th-seeded Barbara Schett of Austria, 6-4, 6-3, to land
herself in the semifinals a third straight time as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like weight lifting, you know, when you play against
the wind,'' said Hingis, who instead treated the wind in Arthur
Ashe Stadium like a teammate: together, they ganged up on Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have street smarts. Hingis has court smarts; just
ask her. ``I wouldn't be the No. 1 player if I wouldn't think a
little bit on court,'' Hingis, the Open's 1997 champion, said.
``You don't get born with that thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players have more and some less,'' she said, casting an
eye toward her semifinal opponent, the 6-foot-2-inch Williams, whom
she beat in the final two years ago. ``Some hit the ball hard; some
don't. Some are tall. I have to use other weapons to stay at the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hingis added a natural ingredient, the wind, to the
skills her coach and mother, Melanie Molitor, has taught ever since
Hingis was an infant. Molitor gave her daughter a head-start by
choosing Martina Navratilova as her namesake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I use the wind very much, and I was, you know, able to
handle it better than her because she was getting frustrated,''
Hingis said of Huber, who took 10 years to get to her first Open
quarterfinal and had just 57 minutes to savor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hitting against the wind, you have to play smart,
and that's what she did,'' said the dejected Huber, whose whimsical
plan to tie the knot with her beau, Andrei Medvedev, if they won
this Open had to be jettisoned once both lost. ``She's just a
smarter player than anybody else on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Haas, seeded 14th, displayed no weather smarts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, 20, admitted to being driven to the brink of insanity by
the unpredictable gusts that his unpredictable opponent,
30-year-old Cedric Pioline, handled without flinching. Haas'
irritability was evident in the X-rated monologue, punctuated by
slashes at the air with his racquet, he conducted with himself
while being upended, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3, by the 26th-ranked Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   After diving in vain after a wind-borne pass from Pioline, who
is happily settling into his role as Old Man Open, an angry Haas
sprayed a forehand wide at break point to put himself at a 2-0
disadvantage in sets.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, who made Open history by becoming the first man to
dethrone a defending champion in the first round with his 4-6, 4-6,
6-3, 7-5, 1-0 ejection of a sore-shouldered Patrick Rafter, proved
unflappable against Haas and the tricky weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm much better when I am with my wind because I try
to mix up a little bit my game; it's more comfortable for me
because I have experience,'' Pioline said after reaching the Open's
quarterfinal round for the first time since he was a finalist in
1993. ``If I'm 30 years old and I don't have experience, I have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Kuerten, the amiable fifth-seeded Brazilian whose
pre-Open practice serve put the four-time champion Pete Sampras out
of commission with a herniated disk, had his mojo working again in
the round of 16: this time, another serve from the unwitting
Kuerten inflicted a lower-back strain on Sweden's Magnus Norman,
who cringed away from their match on the losing end of a 7-6 (7-4)
default.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, uncomfortable about being cast as this event's Grim
Reaper, said he could have suffered the same fate as Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad just the way the conditions are already
tough,'' Kuerten said. ``Everybody could see we could not play our
tennis, just try to pass the ball over, run and see who is going to
miss first. Was not very nice to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, who reached his third straight Grand Slam quarterfinal,
added: ``The way we finished the match was kind of strange, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman became the seventh man to exit the Open on an injury
default. But he refused to rise to the bait when four-time Open
champion John McEnroe, wearing his broadcast hat as USA Network's
expert color commentator, suggested that creatine use might be
responsible for the rash of breakdowns here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I already have enough muscles,'' the 24th-ranked
Norman said. ``I've never taken it. I'm actually against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sampras, Norman didn't blame Kuerten, or the crowded tennis
calendar, for his backache. ``It's a shame because I'm playing the
best tennis of my life at the moment,'' Norman said. ``I had a lot
of bad luck today. If there were tournaments during the whole year,
I would play every week.''

BE PATIENT: THE BEST MAY BE LAST, AFTER THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 12) 
(jt) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is the season's only foolproof advice: take a deep breath
and wait until January. That brings the debut of what promises to
be one of the most engaging new series, ``Malcolm in the Middle,''
and the return of ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly about a taken-for-granted middle child who turns out
to be a genius, ``Malcolm'' (Sundays at 7 on Fox) is actually about
his refreshingly imperfect family, brotherly conversations (``You
shut up.'' ``No,  &UR; you &LR;  shut up!'') and the often politically
incorrect disasters of everyday life. Malcolm doesn't know what's
worse: that his mother has set up a play date for him with a kid in
a wheelchair or that he has to go into the smart class with the
geeky students. Frankie Muniz plays Malcolm with a maximum of
little-boyish, eye-rolling exasperation and a minimum of the cutes.
At least in the pilot, the family dysfunction is handled with a
finesse that recalls that other irreverent but lovable all-American
clan, the Simpsons.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the nature of series television, of course, that you
can't judge a show by its promise, its pilot or, especially this
season, its name. Two new shows come with the mind-muddling titles
``Once and Again'' and ``Now and Again.'' (What high-level
executive discussions went on here? ``You change your name.'' ``No,
 &UR; you &LR;  change your name!'') That's bad enough. It seems demonic that
the male stars of these shows look astonishingly alike, as if they
were ready-made examples of television's pathological fear of
anything new.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Once and Again,'' a mature romantic comedy from Edward
Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (the creators of
``Thirtysomething''), Bill Campbell plays Rick, a guy with a
congenial smile, cropped hair and lean good looks that are
ever-so-slightly bland. A divorced father of two, he falls for Lily
(Sela Ward), a divorced mother of two, and schemes to see her,
though he is often thwarted by his nagging adolescent children.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Now and Again,'' a sci-fi romantic comedy from Glenn Gordon
Caron (the creator of ``Moonlighting''), John Goodman plays Michael
Wiseman, who goes splat in front of a subway, only to have the
government transplant his brain into the body of another man (now
played by Eric Close). OK, so the shows do not share a sense of
gritty realism. Still, Michael wakes to find he is a guy with a
congenial smile, cropped hair and lean good looks that are
ever-so-slightly bland. Forbidden to contact his wife and his
daughter (Margaret Colin and Heather Matarazzo), he schemes to see
them, though he is often thwarted by his nagging government handler
(Dennis Haysbert).
</P>
<P>
   Pessimistic viewers may not get past the doppelgaenger titles,
but that would be too bad. The shows' divergent plots are more
revealing than their weary names. Though ``Once and Again'' is
already being called ``Fortysomething,'' it has an unexpected
tartness; the series is as much about the obstacles to romance as
it is about finding a second love. The future of ``Once and Again''
is fraught with uncertainty, though. After a six-week-run in the
``NYPD Blue'' time slot (ABC, Tuesdays at 10), it will vanish for a
couple of months, then return after football season (on Mondays at
10). A bigger question is: once Rick and Lily get together, what
will prevent the series from turning into ``The Brady Bunch''?
</P>
<P>
   A major problem also hovers over ``Now and Again'' (CBS, Fridays
at 9). The show has a slick, intriguing first episode. But will its
mixture of action-adventure and romantic longing create a fresh new
style? Or will the series turn into one of those
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink disasters?
</P>
<P>
   The track record of a series' creator guarantees nothing. With
``Wasteland'' (ABC, Thursdays at 9), its creator's past does offer
a broad hint, though. Kevin Williamson takes the small-town,
gossipy sensibility that made his ``Dawson's Creek'' an addictive,
smart soap opera and transplants it to New York City, where college
friends now in their 20s are trying not to grow up. This group
includes a closeted gay soap opera star, a bottom-rung lawyer in
the District Attorney's Office and a graduate student who has
managed _ even she doesn't quite know how _ to become a 26-year-old
virgin. Let's assume that a 34-year-old writer who is a master at
churning out successful teen-age flicks like ``Scream'' knows
something about arrested adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   And even if every promising fall series self-destructs before
our eyes, January will bring one sure thing, the second season of
``The Sopranos'' (HBO, Sunday nights), the most talked-about show
of this year and the most anticipated of the next. Coming up for
Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the mobster-with-a-midlife-crisis:
one of his sisters returns to New Jersey. Continuing the series'
terrific casting choices, she is played by Aida Turturro, who
should be a powerful match for their dear old murderous mom. With
the Sopranos, ``You shut up!'' ``No,  &UR; you &LR;  shut up!'' might pass
for family endearments.

DETAILS ON CARDINAL'S BRAIN TUMOR ARE SCANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DENISE GRADY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After Cardinal John O'Connor's recent surgery for
removal of a brain tumor, the Archdiocese of New York said that the
tumor was small, confined to the brain and on its surface, and that
he would soon begin several weeks of radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But the archdiocese released no information about the tumor's
precise type, size or location, leaving open the question of the
79-year-old cardinal's short- and long-term prospects of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Noncancerous brain tumors can often be successfully removed.
Malignant brain tumors are among the most feared forms of cancer,
and patients with the primary kind _ originating in the brain
rather than spreading from other organs _ have lower survival rates
than those with other types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When survival rates for all types of cancer are averaged, 60
percent of patients survive for five years or more. But for brain
cancer, the five-year survival rate is only 30 percent. Still, that
is a better prognosis than cancers of the esophagus, liver, lung
and pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 16,800 Americans are expected to develop primary
brain cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, compared
with 170,000 each for breast, prostate and lung cancer. If tumors
that spread to the brain from other organs, like the lungs or
breast, are also counted in the brain tumor total, the number of
brain tumors rises to about 100,000 a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Gansler, medical editor for patient information at the
American Cancer Society in Atlanta, said he did not know the
details of O'Connor's case, but speaking about brain tumors in
general, he said: ``Some tumors may be found in a part of the brain
that's not essential for survival, and surgery might be more
feasible. But the converse is, if it's in the brain stem, which
controls breathing and life-sustaining functions, then curative
treatment may be much less likely.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many types of brain cancer, and the outlook for
patients varies widely depending on the type as well as the
location of the tumor. Gansler said the most common type of primary
brain cancer in adults is a glioma.
</P>
<P>
   Those tumors form not in the nerve cells of the brain, but in
glial cells, which comprise several different types of cells that
carry out a variety of functions. Some help to support and nourish
nerve cells, some make the fatty material that insulates nerve
cells, others line cavities in the brain that contain cerebrospinal
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Gliomas vary in both the type of cell they affect and their
aggressiveness. In some cases, the average survival is six to eight
years, but in others it may be only 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases where the outlook is not very good, people might want
to explore clinical trials that offer new treatments that may be
more effective,'' Gansler said, noting that the National Cancer
Institute Web site (the address is www.nci.nih.gov) lists 106
studies now in progress, testing experimental treatments for brain
cancer in adults.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments include radiation, chemotherapy, biological
therapies that alter the immune system and gene therapy designed to
make tumor cells more vulnerable to certain cancer-killing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a spokesman for the archdiocese said that O'Connor, who
was released from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on
Saturday, was recuperating at home and still planning to say Mass
this Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is at his residence, and working,'' said the spokesman,
Joseph Zwilling. ``He has been working all the way through, even
while in the hospital. But he is taking it easy. No public events
are planned for him prior to Sunday.''

 &HT;    Rally in 9th as Braves Battle back
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves fans have come to expect a couple of things
from a St. Louis-Atlanta game over the past two weeks _ empty
swings from Mark McGwire and a close game.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the teams' past four meetings have been decided in the
ninth inning or beyond, and that's what it took Tuesday night for
the Braves to earn a 3-2 victory, their sixth in a row over the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league call-up Howard Battle played the hero this time
with a bases-loaded pinch single to left on the first pitch he saw
from Darren Oliver in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had scored only one earned run off Oliver in 15
innings over two starts before the ninth. Jose Hernandez singled to
right field with two out to start the rally, and Brian Hunter
followed with a single to bring up Eddie Perez, whom Oliver walked
to bring up Battle.
</P>
<P>
   Battle came through for the second time in two at-bats since
returning to the Braves from Richmond this month.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland, who has a 2.63 ERA over his past eight games,
including five starts, limited the Cardinals to two runs in seven
innings and left with a 2-2 tie. Mulholland gave up two early runs
to unlikely run-producers before settling into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Polanco, called up from Class AAA on Tuesday and a late
addition to the lineup because shortstop Edgar Renteria was sick,
led off the game with a home run, only the second of his 117-game
big-league career. In the second, with two outs and runners at
first and third, Mulholland allowed a RBI single by Oliver that
gave St. Louis a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver gave up four hits in the first four innings but
repeatedly pitched out of jams, using three double plays to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan singled in the fourth, breaking a streak of 15
hitless at-bats, and scored to tie it 2-2 on a botched play by
shortstop Luis Ordaz on Jose Hernandez's double-play grounder.
Ordaz was charged with two errors on the play, one for a bobble and
the other for a wild throw to second, allowing Jordan to score and
Andruw Jones to take third base.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had another opportunity with Andruw Jones at second
two innings later but lined out to Mark McGwire, who threw to
second for a double play. That made the Braves 0-for-7 with runners
in scoring position for the game.

RENO SEEKS FORMER SENATOR TO LEAD WACO INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. John Danforth has emerged as Attorney
General Janet Reno's top choice to head an independent
investigation into the fiery climax of the 1993 standoff at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, government sources said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Republican responded favorably to Reno's request
that he lead a team of investigators, and he is negotiating with
her deputies about the scope of the inquiry, according to Justice
Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth ``is clearly the only person (Reno aides) are talking
to right now,'' one Justice Department official said. ``But there
is no final deal, yet.'' An agreement and subsequent announcement
are expected this week, possibly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno aides are considering appointing a second person, possibly
a Democrat, to help share the top investigator's job and give the
inquiry bipartisan balance, according to an Associated Press report
citing unnamed congressional sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at the point where we can comment on the progress of
the search'' for an independent investigator, said Justice
Department spokesman Myron Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, was state attorney general of Missouri for eight
years before he was elected to the Senate. He retired from the
Senate in 1995 and has been practicing law in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was a ranking member of the dwindling group of
Republican moderates in the Senate. But at the end of his three
terms he was perhaps best known for his strong defense of the
nomination of conservative Clarence Thomas, a former aide, to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, Reno has been searching for someone to
oversee an independent investigation into the FBI's recent
disclosure of information that conflicts with sworn testimony by
Reno and bureau officials about the April 19, 1993, assault.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans _ some of them calling for Reno's
resignation _ are demanding explanations from the attorney general
and FBI Director Louis Freeh about how evidence, including video
and audio tapes, from the siege were withheld for six years despite
congressional and court inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which turned over the tapes last week, now acknowledges
that potentially flammable tear gas canisters were fired at the
compound, an action that violated Reno's orders that incendiary
devices not be deployed during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure has not changed long-held positions by Reno and
Freeh that members of the Branch Davidian religious sect, not the
bureau's hostage rescue team, were responsible for setting the
fires that engulfed the compound. More than 80 people, including 25
children, died during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   When Danforth announced that he would not seek re-election in
1994, he said he was leaving because ``I didn't want the claim of
government, the claim of politics, to be total.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is also an ordained Episcopal priest. He is an heir to
the Ralston-Purina fortune and had a blue-chip education, including
undergraduate work at Princeton and law and divinity degrees from
Yale. In the Senate, Danforth was on the Finance, Commerce and
Intelligence committees.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Senate, Danforth has been associated with a
Missouri-based law firm, Bryan Cave LLP. With 550 lawyers, the firm
is one of the largest 25 in the nation, its Web site says. The firm
lists Danforth as active in its international and real estate
development practices. Four of the firm's seven overseas offices
are in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator also is on the Dow Chemical board of
directors. Anne Ainsworth, a spokeswoman for the Midland,
Mich.-based chemical giant, said Tuesday Danforth was elected to
the chemical giant's board in 1996 and re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make a lot of end-use products,'' Ainsworth said,
adding that she did not know whether Dow chemicals figured in the
devices at issue in the Branch Davidian case.

 &HT;    Johnson: Collins doubtful to face Broncos Monday
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson took the optimism Cecil Collins has
been spreading around the locker room about a return for the season
opener and doused it with the dreaded d-word.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' coach Tuesday said that Collins, the rookie
running back who was one of the bright spots of training camp
before injuring his ankle Aug.28 in an exhibition game against
Detroit, likely will miss Monday's opener at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks real iffy,'' he said. ``If he is ready to go, it's
not going to be at full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins hasn't practiced since being injured. And with only
three practices remaining before the game _ the Dolphins take today
off, then work out Thursday, Friday and Saturday _ the chances of
him being ready are dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Collins no longer is on crutches. And in recent days, he has
been telling reporters he thinks he could be ready for the Denver
game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, sounded pessimistic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he'll be able to work (Thursday),'' Johnson
said. ``I do not expect him to be 100percent for game. I'd say
right now he's doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some good injury news. The Dolphins' other rookie
tailback, J.J. Johnson, continues to rebound from a hamstring
injury sustained in a scrimmage against Tampa Bay four weeks ago.
And it looks like fullback Stanley Pritchett, who sprained a knee
in the exhibition finale, will be able to play at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we're going to be able to get some of these
players back,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Johnson's mood has suddenly turned cheery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our injury situation may be better,'' he said, ``but it's
still not good.''

   Huard OK with company: A year ago, backup quarterback Damon
Huard admits, he might have been nervous if the Dolphins had traded
for a quarterback who was a former No.1 draft pick. But now he
insists he is ready for the competition that comes with the trade
for Jim Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a year under my belt as far as being the backup guy
and the pressure associated with being ready to go,'' he said. ``My
confidence is high. ... It will be good to have a good player like
him to come in and push me and Dan. It will be good for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching old dogs: Kevin Gogan and Kevin Donnalley are trying to
get used to the plan to have them alternate starts and split time
at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really tough situation because we've never done it
before, neither of us,'' Gogan said. ``I think it's going to take a
little bit of feeling out, seeing how many plays you go in a row.
Do you go quarters? Do you go halves? You don't want to get a
player out of the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Transactions: The Dolphins waived safety Rayna Stewart and
brought back four players who had been released to the practice
squad: fullback Kantroy Barber, guard O'Lester Pope and receivers
Derrick Steagall and Kevin McKenzie.

28 UTILITIES FAULTED ON YEAR 2000 READINESS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill., Texas, Neb., Fla., La., N.J., Mass., N.M., N.C.,
Wash., Colo.)  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department said Tuesday that it was
concerned that 12 electric utilities were not ready for the year
2000, as the electric utility industry was set to begin a
large-scale drill on Wednesday and Thursday in preparation for New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Another 16 utilities, all municipal or rural cooperatives, have
not reported on their state of readiness, and dozens of others are
not ready but have convinced the North American Electric
Reliability Council, which coordinates planning for power plants
and power lines, that they have only limited problems to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in a statement Tuesday
that ``until all the utilities across the country can say they are
Y2K-ready with full contingency plans, I cannot assure consumers
that we have done everything possible to keep the power on into the
year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, known as Y2K, arises from a long-time
practice of computer programmers to enter only the last two digits
of the year; some computers, facing the year after 1999, will
assume it is 1900, and could fail or produce bad data.
</P>
<P>
   The companies judged not ready are mostly small. Some much
larger ones, like the Ameren Corp., which serves 1.8 million
customers in Missouri and Illinois, are considered ``ready with
limited exceptions.'' Spokesmen for companies in that category,
though, said that they expected to be ready well before Dec. 31.
Some said the delays were the result of new equipment that had not
been tested, and others said there were economic and operational
benefits to waiting until after summer.
</P>
<P>
   By naming names, Richardson appeared to be trying to put
pressure on laggards.
</P>
<P>
   But the utilities expressed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   At one that was declared not ready, Tacoma Power, a municipal
utility in Washington state that serves 143,000 customers, Max
Emrick, an assistant generation manager, said that control systems
at two hydroelectric stations were unprepared for 2000. Hardware
was in hand to fix them, he said, but the stations would not be
shut down until later this month and October.
</P>
<P>
   If the utility had to, Emrick said, it could program the systems
to believe it was 1972, a leap year like 2000 with the same
day-date matchup.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the utility did nothing, Emrick said, the two
generators would keep working. ``With these pieces of equipment,
it's nice to have the right date on them, but we could do about any
date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emrick said he considered his company to be in the category of
``Y2K ready with limited exceptions,'' even though the Energy
Department does not.
</P>
<P>
   At Ameren, Susan L. Gallagher, a spokeswoman at the St. Louis
headquarters, said that the system had been running at full blast
all summer because of the heat, and ``we didn't want to monkey with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The devices that measure pollution on some of the company's
coal-fired power stations are not ready for 2000, Ms. Gallagher
said. The company's transmission system also has software that must
be upgraded, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be YK2-ready on September 30,'' Ms. Gallagher
said. ``We are now doing that work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another company on the Energy Department's ``limited exception''
list was Cilcorp Inc. of Peoria, Ill., the parent of the Central
Illinois Light Company. A spokesman, Neal C. Johnson, said a
30-year-old system that communicates between substations and a
dispatch center had been replaced this summer. The new equipment is
being tested now for Year 2000 compliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's rehearsal is expected to involve over 2,000
companies that will simulate operating if a generating station or a
voice link fails.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies that the Energy Department said were not
ready were traditional utilities, and others were owners of
scattered power generating plants.
</P>
<P>
   The department listed the Central Louisiana Electric Company;
City Public Service of San Antonio, Texas; Cogentrix Energy Inc. of
Charlotte, N.C.; Lafayette (Louisiana) Utilities System; the city
of Lakeland, Fla.; Milford (Mass.) Operating Company; the Utility
Board of Brownsville, Texas; and the Plains Electric Generation and
Transmission Cooperative of Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Department listed four companies that the North
American Electric Reliability Council said have since moved up into
the ``limited exception'' category: Tacoma Power; the Platte River
Power Authority of Fort Collins, Colo.; United American Energy
Corporation of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.; and the Calenergy Company
Inc., now known as MidAmerican Energy Holdings, of Omaha, Neb.

   NEW YORK _ The top two executives of Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp.
have been given identical compensation packages, and the two Viacom
vice chairmen who are stepping down are also set to profit
handsomely, Viacom disclosed Tuesday night in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner M. Redstone, the Viacom chief executive, and Mel
Karmazin, the CBS chief executive who is to become chief operating
officer of the combined company, are each to receive salaries of $1
million a year, plus $2 million in deferred compensation, and a
bonus of up to $10 million in 2000, with the figures rising in
later years.
</P>
<P>
   They will each also receive options to buy 2 million Viacom
shares at the market price of the stock when the deal is completed
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Dooley and Philippe P. Dauman, the Viacom vice
chairmen who Redstone said decided to remain on the board but leave
their jobs at the company, will each receive at least $34 million
in cash if they step down at the beginning of next year. They would
also retain their rights under the company's stock options and
other benefit plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Karmazin said the compensation was
somewhat less than he expected to receive, had he signed a new
contract at CBS.

 _ SF CHRON   It's Not Y2K, But 9/9/99 May Hit PCs 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Banks, airlines, electric utilities and corporations will be
keeping a close eye on their computer systems tonight as the
calendar date rolls over to ``9/9/99,'' a combination of four nines
that could trigger software problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a glitch similar to the Y2K problem, some fear that computers
may read Sept. 9, 1999, as a ``9999'' stop-program command. But
most experts think that tomorrow should just be another day at the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many programmers are keeping a close eye out for
potential malfunctions. Officials from San Francisco's PG&AMP;E, for
example, will be up late testing backup communications as part of a
nationwide Year 2000 computer problem drill for the electric
utility industry. The drill was timed to coincide with the
potential ``9999'' computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   And the Coast Guard last night went into a special 48-hour alert
mode to be prepared for computer-related malfunctions with maritime
traffic in San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about a computer meltdown due to the 9/9/99 date are ``all
hype,'' said Herbert M. Gottlieb, founder, president and CEO of
Attest Systems Inc., a Novato company that makes software to track
down potential Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone got it into their craw there was going to be a problem
and I've been laughing at that for months,'' Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, when computer data was punched into paper data
cards, programmers used a string of ``9s'' to signal the end of a
program. That led to fears that computers reading the date tomorrow
might shut down. The Year 2000 problem is similar because computer
systems that were programmed to read only the last two digits of a
year may misread the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But Gottlieb and other computer experts say the danger of the
9999 problem is overstated since most modern software no longer
uses that coding. And even if ``9999'' were a problem, computers
will read the date as ``090999,'' which wouldn't trigger anything.
</P>
<P>
   Similar fears were raised about the date April 9, 1999 _ the
99th day of the 99th year _ but that date passed uneventfully.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Martin, coordinator of Y2K consulting work for Mitre
Corp. of Bedford, Mass., said there were legitimate worries about
9999 at the start of the year. Mitre, which does Y2K consulting for
government organizations and private companies, last year even
issued a list of upcoming critical Y2K dates to watch, including
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But the work done this year to stamp out potential Y2K problems
has also helped eradicate most if not all 9999 problems, Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hype, because there have been a lot of systems where
we found this problem, such as military and government systems,''
Martin said. ``Most organizations have been treating this very
seriously and it will be a nonevent because they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit Bank President Mike Ziemann said his Oakland institution
has completed testing of its computer systems. The bank tested its
systems by setting the date forward to September 9 and didn't find
any problems. Ziemann, though, personally plans to keep a watch on
computer system reports tonight and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't anticipating any problems, I say with my fingers
crossed,'' Ziemann said.

 Locating Used Vehicles Online
<TEXT>

<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
IMotors.com of San Francisco plans to announce today a new way to
purchase used cars over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Most online car sites act like a referral service, connecting
prospective buyers with dealers and private sellers.
</P>
<P>
   IMotors goes much further. It takes customer orders and delivers
vehicles matching their precise specifications on year, model,
options and mileage. It also offers fixed prices and will even
install custom leather upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Wertz of Mill Valley spent three months researching the
purchase of a used van before buying a 1995 Ford Club Wagon from
iMotors this summer. He paid $14,200, about $5,000 below the Kelley
Blue Book retail value. ``The model I got actually exceeded my
specifications and expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IMotors has buyers around the country to find and acquire
vehicles that match customers' wishes. It sends the cars to a
reconditioning facility near Sacramento before they are delivered
to the buyer for hundreds or thousands of dollars below the blue
book value.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles come with a three-month, 3,000-mile warranty. But
if a customer doesn't like the car after driving it for one week
and up to 700 miles, he or she can return it and retrieve the full
$250 deposit.
</P>
<P>
   IMotors' business model may be risk-free to consumers, but some
auto industry veterans who were told of the company's bold business
plan suspect that it could have a tough time turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large supply of late-model used vehicles, which
could diminish the need for this service,'' suggested Chris Denove,
director of consulting for J.D. Power &AMP; Associates. ``And the
concept of centralized reconditioning centers was tried by
AutoNation and failed because it increased distribution costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, venture capital firms have invested $21 million in
iMotors and plan to commit an additional $50 million later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Internet company, we've done away with expensive
inventory, costly retail outlets and commissioned salespeople,''
said iMotors CEO Adam Simms, who has spent the past 16 years in
automotive retailing. ``IMotors allows shoppers to order the car
they desire instead of trying to switch them to something a dealer
has in stock.''
</P>
<P>
   The company offers consumers a chance to order a car from a
``virtual lot'' of 1.8 million used vehicles that are on the U.S.
market at any given point. The company will buy and deliver
vehicles from current models to 5 years old. Initially, the service
is only available in the Bay Area and Sacramento, but iMotors plans
to expand nationally over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the process works:
</P>
<P>
   _A prospective buyer logs onto www.imotors.com and specifies the
year, make, model, options, color choices and mileage of the
desired vehicle. To secure the order, the consumer pays a
refundable deposit, signs an agreement to have iMotors find the
vehicle at a guaranteed price and provides proof that he or she has
sufficient funds or financing to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   _IMotors has about 10 veteran buyers around the country who go
to auto auctions, look for cars in the Southeast where prices for
used foreign cars are comparatively low and employ other techniques
to find and buy specified cars.
</P>
<P>
   _Vehicles are sent to iMotors' vehicle certification center in
Elk Grove (Sacramento County), where 50 employees inspect and
repair each vehicle to ensure it is in excellent shape. That
includes making mechanical repairs, taking out dings, repainting
panels and replacing worn tires.
</P>
<P>
   _IMotors schedules delivery initially at three sites in the Bay
Area _ Foster City, San Ramon and Santa Clara _ as well as
Sacramento. Customers receive a complete history of the car called
an ``AutoBiography,'' finalize paperwork, inspect and drive the
vehicle, and take off with a no-risk return policy.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching iMotors on the Internet, Simms ran a used-car
superstore in Fresno called Auto Choice. Since March of last year,
he tested many of the concepts such as offering fixed prices for
used vehicles, letting shoppers specify what they were looking for,
finding the prescribed vehicle for them within two weeks and basing
sales peoples' pay on customer satisfaction rather than
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In designing iMotors, Simms used Dell Computer's model of
building products to match customer specifications and cut down on
expensive inventory. He also looked at Federal Express' efficient
hub-and-spoke distribution system and plans to eventually have
vehicle inspection and repair facilities at strategic locations
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 3,000 cars have gone through iMotors' Elk Grove
facility, and Simms said less than 1 percent of customers have been
dissatisfied and have returned their cars. (One was a woman who
discovered she could not see over the dashboard of the vehicle she
ordered.)
</P>
<P>
   IMotors realizes that to make it financially it must operate
with assembly-line efficiency and high volume. The company declined
to disclose how many vehicles it needs to sell to make a profit.
But by the end of this year, iMotors expects to be refurbishing and
selling 1,000 cars a month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the company's advantages are its rental costs. It pays $1
per square foot per month at its 4-acre inspection and fix-it
facility _ a fraction of what an urban dealer might have to pay.
Its average labor cost is about $15 per hour, which also is low by
industry standards. And perhaps most importantly, iMotors only buys
used cars when it has a firm order so it only has to finance
inventory for a week or two, versus two months or more for the
typical used-car dealer.
</P>
<P>
   While Simms knows about selling cars, iMotors hired Internet
expert Beth VanStory as president. She previously built and managed
OfficeDepot.com's profitable Web site as well as the Weather
Channel's online business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to change the used-car buying experience and, like
Nordstrom, delight the customer,'' she said. IMotors iMotors &LR;   &LR; has
cut out the high-pressure sales tactics and bait-and-switch
techniques employed by many car dealers and also the hassle and
risk of dealing with private sellers.
</P>
<P>
   IMotors has agreements with Napa Auto Parts for parts and
service. Besides the Internet route, iMotors is offering its
used-car buying service by toll-free telephone number and at kiosks
at four Costco stores in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Before discovering Auto Choice, the predecessor of iMotors,
Wertz, the Mill Valley resident who bought a vehicle from iMotors,
visited dealers and private sellers and also checked out online
used-car sites like Auto Choice, Autobytel and Auto Trader Online.
</P>
<P>
   He initially balked at having to have his bank disclose that he
had the financial capability to make the purchase. But he is glad
he went through with the deal and bought the 4-year-old Ford Club
Wagon with 63,000 miles on it for only $1,450 above its $12,750
trade-in value. ``With dealers and private sellers, the best price
I saw was more than $16,000,'' said Wertz.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Larson, a Southwest Airlines pilot who lives near Auburn
(Placer County), also is happy with the 1994 Chevy Suburban with
76,000 miles that he bought for about $18,500 last month. ``It was
less than what car lots were asking for older models with more
mileage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IMotors' financial backers are enthusiastic, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of e-commerce companies have billion-dollar market
caps (stock market values) and iMotors could be one of them,'' said
Gus Tai, a general partner of Trinity Ventures, which has invested
in Starbucks, BabyCenter, NextCard and other successful startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The used-car business is a $350 billion market, but it's hard
to find consumers who enjoy interacting with dealers or buying from
a private seller and taking the risk the car doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some consumers might try to take advantage of iMotors'
risk-free purchasing plan, Tai maintains that Americans are
generally trustworthy. Beyond that, there are a lot easier ways to
get a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   But there are risks. ``Offering a free seven-day trial shows
confidence in your product but is sticking your neck out big
time,'' said Jon Price, who sells high-end, used imported cars and
sport sports  &LR; utility vehicles through his A.M.M. Services in San
Rafael and charges a 4 percent sales commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logistics problems could be humongous,'' he added. ``There
are a lot of used cars in the middle-price range, and going head to

HILTON TO BUY PROMUS CHAIN, CREATING ONE OF BIGGEST HOTEL GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Tenn.)  (th) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. said Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire
Promus Hotel Corp. for $3.1 billion in cash and stock, creating one
of the largest hotel companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will combine Hilton's 275 luxury hotels in North
America with Promus' Doubletree Hotels, Embassy Suites and Hampton
Inns. The combined company will have 1,700 hotels, 290,000 rooms
and 85,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton will pay $38.50, or the equivalent in stock, for each
Promus share, a 23 percent premium on the closing price of Promus
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by shareholders of both companies, the merger would
be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen F. Bollenbach, president and chief executive of Hilton
Hotels, said Tuesday that Hilton and Promus were a ``perfect fit.''
A merger, he said, would help reduce Hilton's dependence on its 10
largest hotels, including the Waldorf-Astoria and the New York
Hilton in Manhattan. At the same time, he said, the move will help
Hilton compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important in our industry to have size and scale,''
Bollenbach said, ``and this will make us as big as our two closest
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Those competitors are Marriott International, which now has more
than 1,600 hotels and 324,000 rooms, and Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Worldwide, which has more than 670 hotels and 217,000
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market, which had already driven down the price of
Hilton's shares by 13 percent this year, did not react favorably to
the news. Shares of Hilton fell 62.5 cents Tuesday, to $11.1875,
while Promus rose $3.4375, to $34.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts said they feared that Hilton was
paying too much for Promus, which disappointed investors earlier
this year when it lowered its estimates of what it would earn in
the future quarters. It earned profits of $154 million last year on
revenues of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges that Promus faced don't go away with this
merger,'' said Keith A. Mills, a lodging analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said that the next 12 to 18 months could be difficult for
Hilton. He said he was advising investors to wait at least a year
before investing in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now,'' Mills said, ``this could prove to be a
profitable transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the acquisition is that it will lessen Hilton's
dependence on profits from the luxury hotels it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about 60 percent of Hilton's revenue _ $1.8 billion last
year _ comes from its 10 largest hotels. And, only about 13 percent
of its revenue comes from franchise fees earned from hotels owned
by others.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise fees serve as a more stable form of income for
hotel companies than revenue earned on owned hotels because the
franchise fees are most often calculated as a percentage of total
revenue rather than profits. Thus, the franchise fees are paid even
if a franchised hotel is not profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Promus' hotel franchises, about 30 percent of
Hilton's revenue would come from franchise fees, a Hilton spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Hilton will pay cash for 55 percent
of Promus' shares and stock for the rest. It will also take on
about $900 million of Promus' debt.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's headquarters will remain in Beverly Hills, Calif., but
the companies said that they would still have significant
operations in Memphis, Tenn., where Promus is now based.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton estimates that the merger will result in $55 million in
cost savings and additional revenue next year. After that, the
company estimates the merger will lift its bottom line by $90
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those figures, Hilton still expects its earnings to fall
slightly next year because of the amortization of goodwill that
will result from accounting for the Promus acquisition on Hilton's
financial books.
</P>
<P>
   Bollenbach was chief financial officer at Promus from 1986 to
1991. The company was then called Holiday Corp. He later worked for
Donald Trump, for Marriott, and for Walt Disney Co. He was hired by
Hilton about three years ago, and since then, has made several
unsuccessful attempts to acquire major hotel companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he pursued a hostile takeover of ITT Corp., which then
owned the Sheraton hotels and Caesars World casinos. He ultimately
lost the bidding war to Starwood.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bollenbach and other Hilton executives held
unsuccessful acquisition talks with Patriot American Hospitality
Inc., the company now called Wyndham International Inc. In 1996,
Hilton purchased Bally Entertainment Corp., and last year spun off
the casinos into a new company, Park Place Entertainment Corp.  &QL;

 Lycos Adding Investment Content In $78.3 Purchase of Quote.com

Lycos plans to announce today that it is acquiring Quote.com of
Mountain View for $78.3 million in a deal that will add more
financial content to the Lycos Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Quote.com, which provides investment information such as stock
quotes, mutual fund information, earnings forecasts and company
profiles, will become part of the Lycos Network.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which is best known for its search engine, features other
content on its Web site from partners like Wired News, Suck.com and
MailCity.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sege, executive vice president of Lycos of Waltham, Mass.,
said Quote.com will retain its name and its Web address but will
become the main provider of financial information on the Lycos Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings Quote.com's premier investment information, as
well as its community and message information, to Lycos users and
brings Lycos' reach to Quote.com,'' Sege said.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is among the five-most-visited sites on the Web, according
to Media Metrix. It has been trying to beef up its Web presence in
the face of competition from America Online, Microsoft and Yahoo.
Lycos and its competitors are trying to keep users coming back by
becoming one-stop-shops that offer everything from e-mail to news
to stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   With Quote.com under its belt, Lycos will also get access to
Quote.com's growing base of paid subscribers. In addition to free
financial content, Quote.com has a paid  &LR; subscription service that
allows users to access ``premium'' content and chart-making tools
that help investors track stocks. About 10,000 people subscribe to
the service, which costs from $25 to $100 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Sege said Quote.com will keep its headquarters in Mountain View
but said there may be some reshuffling of jobs after the purchase
closes. Quote.com would not disclose its number of employees.

 Used-Car Shopping Traffic Is Picking Up on Internet
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Before buying a car, most car buyers like to kick the tires rather
than take a virtual test drive on the information superhighway.
super highway.  &LR; Nevertheless, more Americans are using the Internet
to shop for new and used cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the percentage of people buying new vehicles
through online buying services more than doubled _ from 1.1 percent
to 2.7 percent _ and may go as high as 5 percent by next year,
according to a report last month by J.D. Power &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of new-vehicle shoppers using the Internet
to gather information to help them decide what model to buy
increased from 25 percent to 40 percent in the past year and is
projected to reach 65 percent by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power found that the average Internet shopper visits six
automotive Web sites and spends more than four hours researching
what make and model to purchase and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular automotive Web sites for new-car buyers,
according to the Los Angeles market research firm, are Kelley Blue
Book, which provides pricing information for new and used cars
(www.kbb.com) and Autobytel (www.autobytel.com), which accounts for
45 percent of all new vehicles sold through an online service.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation, the country's largest car dealer
(www.autonationdirect.com), recently teamed up with Priceline.com,
which is best known for its ``name your own price'' airline
tickets, to offer a similar Internet buying service for new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Several new-car buying services such as CarsDirect.com and
Carorder.com are often willing to buy cars from dealers for
hundreds to thousands of dollars higher than the price they sell to
consumers. In essence, these services are subsidizing the purchase
of vehicles to build awareness and sales in new markets.
</P>
<P>
   While new cars are basically commodities and low price is the
chief concern to many buyers, used cars are unique because they
vary so much in mileage and condition.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 26 percent of used-vehicle buyers log onto the
Internet for assistance during the shopping process, according to
J.D. Power, which recently surveyed 10,000 consumers who purchased
1994 through 1999 used vehicles. Buyers increasingly are going
online to research prices, reliability and safety data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always risks associated with buying used vehicles,
but the Internet provides easy access to the information people
need to avoid buying a lemon,'' said Chris Denove of J.D. Power.
``Despite the fact that online vehicle-locator sites are in their
infancy, we were amazed to find that some already offer a wider
selection of used vehicles than the typical newspaper
classifieds.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should realize that local dealers pay cash to online
services to advertise their cars and make sales.
</P>
<P>
   According to J.D. Power, favorite sites for used-car information
include Kelley Blue Book and Consumer Reports
(www.consumerreports.org), Autobytel and such online buying
services as Edmund's Online (www.edmunds.com); Auto Trader Online
(www.traderonline.com); Microsoft CarPoint (www.carpoint.com);
autoweb.com (www.autoweb.com) and cars.com (www.cars.com).
</P>
<P>
   While iMotors claims to have a unique model for delivering used
cars online, most other sites let consumers cull dealer and private
party listings for particular makes and models within so many miles
of their home.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel and several other services also offer money-back
guarantees on used vehicles if buyers return them undamaged within
three days after driving no more than 300 miles.
</P>
<P>
   And Auto Choice (www.theautochoice.com) offers ``Build a Car''
service where consumers can fill out a form if they can't find the
vehicle they want in the listings and have the company's buying
staff scour the country for vehicles that match their requests
</P>
<P>
   Online auctions also are expanding their automotive offerings.
EBay, for example, lists about 1,500 vehicles a week and two weeks
ago signed an agreement with collector-car expert Kruse
International to set up a new online showroom of more-exotic
vehicles.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since the House voted in July to strip $1.8 billion
from the F-22 fighter jet program, the Air Force and Lockheed
Martin have undertaken a relentless, multimillion-dollar campaign
to convince lawmakers to restore the money.
</P>
<P>
   When members of Congress left the Capitol last month, corporate
leaders of Lockheed Martin followed them, warning key legislators
in their home districts that hundreds of jobs would be lost if
there was not enough money to build the Air Force's newest fighter
jet.
</P>
<P>
   In four cities, they brought along an elaborate computer
simulator of the plane's cockpit to put on a dazzling, video-game
like demonstration of the fighter's potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has also been pushing to save the F-22. Senior
military leaders, from Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Gen. Wesley Clark, the head of NATO
forces, undertook a rare letter-writing campaign warning Senate and
House leaders that American pilots ``who will put their lives on
the line'' in the future are counting on the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   And the Air Force Association, with its 155,000 members, has
spent the last month and a half blanketing Congress with letters,
visits and a videotape (``F-22: Does Air Superiority Matter?'') as
well as mailings and a ``call to action'' by its president.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with Congress back and preparing to decide whether to
restore or cut the money, officials from Lockheed Martin, Boeing
and Pratt &AMP; Whitney are holding a conference and pep rally in the
Virginia suburbs Tuesday and Wednesday to pump up top
subcontractors of the F-22 and then send them off to lobby Congress
in a bid to save the $70 billion program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the massive scale of it _ with people swarming all over
the Hill,'' said Dale Bumpers, the former Arkansas senator who
heads the Center for Defense Information, which opposes the
program. ``There are no real heavy hitters who can counter them,
especially since the officials at the Pentagon want this worse than
they want to go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, a small group of Washington research institutes are
the only opponents outside of Congress countering the lobbying
onslaught from the armed forces and military industry, and they
admit that they will probably lose this battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon says it's not lobbying, but there's about a half
a dozen of us in the think tank world and about a thousand of them
talking to Congress,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, of the Brookings
Institution, who also opposes full financing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials are even challenging the fellows of
these research institutes on their home ground, the opinion pages
of newspapers, arguing that from the Persian Gulf War to the Kosovo
campaign this year, the United States has become ever more
dependent on air superiority to win at war.
</P>
<P>
   But in this uneven lobbying effort, critics of the F-22 program
are holding their own by pressing the Pentagon on how it plans to
pay for this hugely expensive weapons system as well as two other
fighter jet programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., who heads the House subcommittee
that cut the financing, held his deliberations in private and
announced the results without warning so panel members could
evaluate the program without pressure from the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lewis has been visited by Gen. Michael E. Ryan, the
Air Force chief of staff. He has also flown to Marietta, Ga., to
visit the huge plant where Lockheed Martin is manufacturing the
first F-22s, and has received a stinging letter from Defense
Secretary William Cohen warning him that ``I cannot accept a
defense bill that kills this cornerstone program.'' None of this
has altered Lewis' position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the discussions didn't change his mind and his
determination to get the Air Force to reassess its priorities,''
said Jim Speck, a top aide to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Those priorities include asking the Pentagon what threat exists
that would require full financing of three fighter jet programs
that would cost $300 billion. Analyses by the research institutes,
from the conservative Cato Institute to the more liberal Brookings
Institution and the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
all conclude that one of those programs will have to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that the Pentagon should scale back its F-22 program,
O'Hanlon said that with the current budget constraints, the
Pentagon could not justify spending its scarce dollars on one
fighter jet program to the detriment of programs like troop
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the world's overwhelming aerospace power
and will remain that way, with or without the F-22, for many years
to come,'' O'Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have been countering that argument with daily
briefings for congressmen and their staffs, complete with slides
and handouts, said Lt. Gen. Gregory Martin, an Air Force deputy
assistant secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Defense and the Air Force are working their
tails off for this program,'' he said. ``It is unusual, but the
F-22 is more than a program _ it's a capability that the services
believe they need for the new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, which announced in June that it would have
drastically reduced profits for this year, is using dozens of its
lobbyists to put back the $1.8 billion and keep the F-22 in full
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything that could be reasonably expected under
the circumstances,'' said James Fetig, a Lockheed Martin spokesman.

 S.F. Florist Gets Plucked by National Chain
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Another legendary San Francisco business has been picked off by a
national chain.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta Baldocchi, which has been peddling flowers in San
Francisco since 1871, has been sold to Gerald Stevens Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., marketer of flowers and related gifts
announced yesterday that it has acquired 31 specialty florists with
$22 million in combined revenues, including Podesta's $3 million in
annual sales and Azzaro's of Fresno, which has three locations and
about $1.8 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its campaign to create the nation's largest flower
retailer, Gerald Stevens completed its acquisition of San
Francisco's Calyx &AMP; Corolla catalog retailer of flowers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta Baldocchi now operates from Fourth Street South of
Market. But for most of the century, it operated in the heart of
San Francisco's Union Square shopping district. Every December for
decades, it was a Grant Avenue destination with its gorgeously
decorated Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Podesta has changed hands. Five years
ago, Michael Guelfi and his brothers Mark and Matt bought the
legendary San Francisco florist shop from Steve Podesta. Gerald
Stevens is not expected to change the Podesta Baldocchi name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has a great game plan,'' said Podesta Baldocchi
President Guelfi. ``It is buying well-known florists around the
country and setting up a hub and spoke system, so business stays
within the company-owned network.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gerald Stevens received its first $7 million in private
capital in May 1998 from an investment fund set up by two top
executives of Blockbuster Entertainment, it has grown quickly. In
the past 10 months, it has acquired 231 florists, including
publicly traded Florafax, whose name it changed to Gerald Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Another key acquisition for approximately $10 million in stock
was Calyx &AMP; Corolla. During the past decade, this company pioneered
the market for next-day delivery of flowers shipped directly from
the grower. It has the most widely circulated floral catalog, with
12 million copies mailed last year, as well as a growing online
business.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Stevens Chief Administrative Officer Adam Philips said
Calyx &AMP; Corolla appeals to ``higher-end customers'' with its
fresh-picked bouquets, plants or bonsai and custom-designed
packages delivered by Federal Express. The company generated $20
million revenues last year, and its average sale is $70 compared
with $40 for the typical florist, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Stevens is intent on delivering floral and related gift
products wherever consumers want them _ by phone, mail order,
Internet, direct from grower or visiting a store.
</P>
<P>
   Guelfi and Phillips declined to discuss the acquisition price
for Podesta Baldocchi, but industry sources estimate it sold for
about $1.4 million. Last month, Gerald Stevens also bought Jory's,
which has stores in Concord and Walnut Creek and revenues of about
$1 million.

 No Joke, Capitalism Goes Wild on eBay
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By David Lazarus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
First it was guns. Then human kidneys. Now it's babies. Is there
any limit to what can be listed for sale at online auctioneer eBay?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a nutshell, is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you could run a viable business by screening
300,000 new items a day,'' insisted Rob Chesnut, eBay's associate
general counsel. ``It just would be too expensive to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why a kidney, followed by assorted other body parts,
made their way onto the site last week, and why three different
listings for babies popped up over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Without any sort of screening or filtering system in place,
eBay's nearly 6 million users are free to list any item they
choose, no matter how weird, goofy, illegal or just plain
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   As for eBay's legal liability, the jury's still out. But current
interpretations of the law suggest that the company cannot be held
accountable for the contents of its site.
</P>
<P>
   EBay relies for the most part on its users to police the site
themselves. When someone comes across a suspicious listing among
the nearly 2.7 million items for sale, he or she reports it to the
company, which might then close the auction.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with the first of two kidneys posted for
sale last week, although the auction managed to avoid detection for
nearly a week and attracted no fewer than seven separate bids, the
highest reaching $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   EBay officials aren't saying that this was a hoax necessarily,
and they note that law-enforcement authorities in Florida, where
the seller resides, are looking into the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Chesnut said subsequent listings for other kidneys, livers
and ``a barely used brain'' were obviously ``joke auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the babies, one of which drew an offer of $109,100, ``Of
course they're kidding,'' Chesnut said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the press picked up the story about the kidney, we had
lots of other people putting up similar things,'' he observed.
``One item breeds copycats.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point, nearly a dozen other kidneys were listed for sale
as of yesterday afternoon, with one going for as much as $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Although eBay says it can do without such publicity, Steve
Weinstein, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland,
Ore., said reports of body parts and babies for sale only drive
more traffic to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Gosh I want to see that,''' he pointed out.
``It's like slowing down for a traffic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Franco, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in San
Francisco, said most eBay users haven't been fazed by these
repeated blows to the site's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like day trading,'' he said. ``You have to understand
what the risks are.''
</P>
<P>
   And eBay users are nothing if not fiercely loyal to their
favorite online flea market. EBay's chat rooms had no criticism of
the questionable sales yesterday, although there was considerable
carping about a brief interruption in the site's service on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although eBay does not screen items before they are put up for
sale, Chesnut admitted that eBay takes steps to filter listings
after they are posted _ a fact that previously had not been
acknowledged by the company.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't give any details. ``There are things we do that
we don't talk about,'' Chesnut said. ``I wouldn't want a user to
know what we look for and how we look for things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Zeilstra, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read in New York,
said eBay may be reluctant to filter prior to posting an item
because this could make them responsible for vetting all listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they police one thing,'' she said, ``they would be legally
liable for policing all things.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Samuelson, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, cited recent cases involving online
services that established a service cannot be held accountable for
content on its site, but only as long as the service is not
actively screening material up front.
</P>
<P>
   How such precedents apply to an operation like eBay, however,
remains anyone's guess, she observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lot of questions coming up for which there are no
certain answers,'' Samuelson said. ``Once they go down the
filtering path, how much filtering they do, and what their
responsibilities are, open up a whole can of worms.''

IN SEASON OF LOSERS, SOMEBODY MUST WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 1999 NFL preview magazines are out _ I think
some were out while the 1998 season was still going on _ and
they're all picking different teams to win the Super Bowl. Sports
Illustrated likes Jacksonville, The Sporting News likes Minnesota,
and Pro Football Weekly goes with Miami (over Minnesota in its
early-summer edition, over Green Bay in its ``kickoff'' edition).
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is not that the experts pick different teams. The
surprise is that they pick anybody.
</P>
<P>
   With the Denver Broncos taken down by John Elway's retirement
and the Green Bay Packers poorer for Reggie White and Mike
Holmgren's departures, the league is sinking into a new era of
``parity,'' loosely translated as ``hey, SOMEBODY has to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking a super team in the NFL this season is harder than
picking a Disney Sports employee of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some you can rule out immediately: Carolina, Chicago, Cincinnati
and the venerable expansion franchise in Cleveland. ``C'' is a
failing grade this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Others deserve no more than second glances: Philadelphia,
Detroit, Baltimore and San Diego. The Chargers felt good about
drawing ``bye'' in week one until ``bye'' was installed as an
8{-point favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the perennial underachievers: Buffalo, Kansas
City, New England and Washington. Don't waste your time with them.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with continuing this process of elimination is that
before you know it, you've eliminated everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona? It was a summer of car crashes, practice-field injuries
and contract holdouts. Quarterback Jake Plummer is ripping
management for haggling with top touchdown receiver Rob Moore.
Cinderella just called a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta? With Tony Martin gone, Chris Chandler's receivers are
all 5-foot-11 and under. They'll ride a Derby winner before they
return to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas? Chan Gailey was credited with a good job as the rookie
head coach, but how long before ballhandlers Troy Aikman, Emmitt
Smith and Michael Irvin begin pining for their first coach _ Amos
Alonzo Stagg?
</P>
<P>
   Denver? Head coach Mike Shanahan has written a book on the keys
to success, with chapter titles like ``Preparing,''
``Sacrificing,'' ``Learning,'' ``Believing'' and ``Persevering.''
He left out the key to his own success: ``Having John Elway on Your
Team.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay? It's back to the post-dynasty days of 1968. Minus the
actual dynasty this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis? Two-thousand-yard rusher-receiver Marshall Faulk
is gone. Rookie Edgerrin James is the new ballcarrier. The Colts
can whip UCLA, but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville? Head coach Tom Coughlin has been blowing his stack
at reporters who pick the Jaguars to win it all, and players are
grumbling about his intensity. I'm happy to do my part to lower
Coughlin's blood pressure and say I give the Jaguars no shot.
</P>
<P>
   Miami? It's Don Drysdale's joke about the '60s Dodgers applied
to football: ``Did you hear? The Dolphins shut out New England.''
``Did they win?''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota? The Vikings are a couple of key injuries away from
Jeff George at quarterback and Eleanor Mondale at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans? Mike Ditka will be gone before his Ricky Williams
gamble pays off.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants? They'll have to improve on last year's 8-8
record to win the NFC East; 8-7-1 might be good enough in that
division.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets? Going back to the Super Bowl III uniforms
coincided with a freakish season for 35-year-old Vinny Testaverde.
They'll need the second comings of Joe Namath, Emerson Boozer and
Heidi to overcome the league's second-strongest 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland? The Raiders will play THE strongest '99 schedule. The
good news for everybody is that they won't play it in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh? New offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride will try to
do for Kordell Stewart what he did for Ryan Leaf last year in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis? Head coach Dick Vermeil isn't long for this job. He
used to cry only when announcing major career decisions. Now he
cries when players get injured. Next he'll be breaking down at
``Don't Walk'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco? Signing Lawrence Phillips was the beginning of
the end for a great organization. Today you ignore your traditional
standards, and tomorrow you're the '99 Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle? Seahawks players wanted to dump the Gatorade on
Holmgren after their first exhibition victory with the new coach;
he talked them out of it. When a franchise has never won a thing,
and a city hasn't won a thing in 20 years, they must long for any
chance to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay? Two words: Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee? The team changed its name, clothes and address after
going 8-8. It didn't work _ they're still the Oilers and they're
still going 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be an 8-8 kind of year up and down the league.
There's not a great team in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Which might be why the NFL didn't give Los Angeles a franchise
this season. It was afraid we'd win the Super Bowl.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Visa Shuffles Its Cards
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Under pressure from its bank members to slash fees, Foster City's
Visa International, the giant credit card association, soon will
begin the most dramatic reorganization in its 25-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for Visa International to cut its budget 15 to 25
percent, jettison 100 to 200 Bay Area jobs, overhaul its
organization chart and fundamentally alter the way it delivers
products and services to its six regional operating organizations,
association officials said. The savings from these changes are
unknown because Visa International's finances are not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The association's board is scheduled to consider the plan at the
end of this month. Details remain to be worked out, but the
outlines of the reorganization are already set.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the current one-size-fits-all approach, Visa's
regional affiliates, including organizations covering the United
States and European Union countries, will be able to choose from a
menu of debit and credit card systems and services, giving them
more flexibility over what they, in turn, offer the association's
21,000 bank members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   While Visa International will continue to provide basic product
categories such as credit and debit cards, the regions will have
more freedom to develop and market their own specific products.
</P>
<P>
   The new system will be roughly analogous to cable television, in
which subscribers can pay just for a basic offering or get
additional channels by choosing from several levels of premium
service. ``Right now, we have all sorts of things bundled into Visa
International,'' said Malcolm Williamson, the association's British
president and chief executive. ``This will give people choices, so
they can decide what they want.``
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup at Visa International, which has roughly 2,500
employees locally, won't include the separate regional
organizations, including Visa U.S.A., also headquartered in Foster
City. The U.S. affiliate cut 50 positions earlier this year when it
combined separate sales functions.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring of Visa International comes at a time of
ferment in the credit card industry as large issuers, mainly U.S.
companies such as First USA and Citigroup, demand lower fees and
more control over the products they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Citigroup, the world's second-largest credit
card issuer, shifted most of its new business to MasterCard after
complaining that Visa rules limited its ability to promote its own
brand and forced it to pay for advertising that pushed Visa's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of restless members out there that are
becoming more concerned about their own identities,'' said James
Daley, editor of the trade magazine Credit Card Management.
</P>
<P>
   By letting regions offer members choices in products and
pricing, the reorganization responds to some of the demands of
large issuers. But Visa International also will continue to offer
complete packages to those regions that aren't prepared to do their
own product development.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup follows a history of tension between Visa
International and its stronger regional organizations, especially
Visa U.S.A. For decades, International and U.S.A. have vied for
power, often duplicating each other's functions.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to move certain operations such as product
development to the regional level, Visa International is, in
effect, negotiating a peace treaty. In exchange, the regions will
recognize its authority to market the Visa brand worldwide and
provide the systems support for products developed at the regional
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be much greater clarity about Visa International's
role, and that will reduce the possibility of friction,``
Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Visa International's plan calls for the creation of a new
subsidiary, named ``shared services,'' that will house the computer
systems that process payments for members around the world.
Regional affiliates will have choices in pricing and service plans
when using shared services.
</P>
<P>
   International will keep centralized activities such as finance
and global marketing. The regions will pay an obligatory fee for
these common functions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, such operations as research and development
for new products will shrink at Visa International and grow at the
regional organizations. The regions will be able to choose what
level of service they want in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is the brainchild of Williamson, who came to
Visa International 11 months ago after serving as chief of
Britain's Standard Chartered Bank, where he helped pioneer
smart-card technology that uses an embedded computer chip to keep
track of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson has been advocating an overhaul of Visa
International's service and fee structure since he arrived. ``He's
doing what he said he would do,'' Daley said.

them of taking part in a global conspiracy to fix vitamin prices
over the last decade, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which could come this week, would be one of the
largest antitrust payments made in a private class-action suit in
U.S. history, lawyers said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House announced Tuesday that 12 jailed
members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group had accepted President
Clinton's conditional offer of clemency. Eleven will be eligible
for release within days while the 12th had his 55-year sentence
drastically reduced and will be paroled in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Two other members of the radical group, known as FALN, the
Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National Liberation,
refused to accept the president's offer to commute their sentences.
Clinton demanded as a condition of their release that they renounce
the use of violence to achieve their aim of independence for the
Caribbean commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Another two FALN members, who have been released from jail but
still owe tens of thousands of dollars in fines, have not yet
responded to the president's offer to forgive their penalties. They
have until Friday to accept the terms of the grant, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president expects all those who accept the conditional
clemency grant to abide fully by its terms, including refraining
from the use or advocacy of the use of violence for any purpose and
obeying all the statutory conditions of parole,'' Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary, said in a written statement issued
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of the clemency offer further roiled an emotional
political debate that has pitted Hillary Rodham Clinton against her
husband and riven the Democratic party in New York. Mrs. Clinton,
who has all but announced her intention to run for the Senate from
New York, announced her opposition to the commutations on Saturday,
saying that the Puerto Ricans had shown insufficient contrition for
their acts and those of their comrades in the independence
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican nationalists are serving sentences of as long
as 90 years for offenses including sedition, possession of
unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen
vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and
interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a
crime. None of those whose sentences Clinton planned to commute was
convicted of crimes that resulted in deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has not spoken publicly on the matter, said through
a spokesman that the sentences were out of proportion to the FALN
members' offenses and that the prisoners, some of whom have already
served 18 years in prison, deserved to be released if they forswore
future acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 members of the group who accepted the clemency offer,
originally announced on Aug. 11, did so after consultation with
their lawyer, Jan Susler of Chicago, who said at a news conference
Tuesday evening she was ``elated by the prisoners' impending
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a tremendous victory and accomplishment for the
Puerto Rican people and people who love justice,'' Ms. Susler said.
</P>
<P>
   But she and another lawyer for the FALN members, Michael
Deutsch, added that they were concerned that after their release
the nationalists would be subjected to harassment by law
enforcement officials and denied the right to peaceable political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said they planned to create a network of monitors in
the United States and Puerto Rico to assure that the freed
prisoners' rights are not abridged.
</P>
<P>
   The two FALN members who rejected the president's grant of
clemency and who will remain in prison are Oscar Lopez Rivera and
Antonio Camacho-Negron.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Rivera was convicted in Chicago in August 1981 of numerous
charges, including weapons violations and conspiracy to transport
explosives with intent to destroy government property, and was
sentenced to 70 years in prison. Clinton offered to reduce his
sentence to 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho-Negron was convicted in Connecticut in June 1989 of
conspiracy to rob a bank and foreign transportation of stolen
money. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, which Clinton
offered to commute.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of the commutations further fueled the uproar
over the president's actions, which has been opposed by most law
enforcement agencies, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., numerous other lawmakers and victims of
acts of terror committed by pro-independence Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said on Saturday that the president should rescind
the clemency offer because the tardy response from the Puerto
Ricans ``speaks volumes'' about their continuing advocacy of
violence as a political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Her opposition to the president's position angered many Puerto
Rican elected officials in New York, who accused her of betraying
them in order to appear tough on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for the first lady's exploratory
committee, said that Mrs. Clinton understood the strong emotions on
the issue but she ``stands by her statement'' of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that the Puerto Ricans have never
expressed remorse for their acts or those of their comrades in the
nationalist movement, which has been involved in more than 100
bombings of political and military installations in the United
States in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ a Republican and the first lady's likely opponent in
a race to succeed Moynihan in the Senate _ said that the president
has undercut his own government's efforts to combat terrorism and
called upon the president to release files on the cases and the
recommendations from federal law enforcement officials, who
virtually unanimously opposed the grants of clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can emotionally be on one side or the other of this
issue,'' Giuliani said, ``but to say that it doesn't raise some
very serious and legitimate questions and now to see his own
political allies and close associates abandoning him like a sinking
ship, you wonder what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said the panel will hold hearings next week to review the clemency
offer, which he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends and relatives of the jailed Puerto Ricans were
grudging in their thanks to the president and highly critical of
Mrs. Clinton's opposition to the clemency grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an olive branch that the president has extended in the
process of reconciliation between the United States and Puerto
Rico, but it's a very scrawny one,'' said Gloria Quinones, one of
hundreds of activists and religious leaders who worked for the
release of the Puerto Rican nationalists. Ms. Quinones, of New
York, was a childhood friend of Dylcia Noemi Pagan, convicted of
conspiracy and firearms violations in 1981 and sentenced to 55
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinones was critical of the president's condition that none
of the prisoners meet or mingle after their release, particularly
citing the fact that two of the prisoners, Alicia Rodriguez and Ida
Luz Rodriguez, are sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way sisters should be kept away from one
another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinones called Mrs. Clinton's repudiation of her husband's
clemency grant ``a real insult'' to the nearly one million Puerto
Ricans living in New York.

   Eli Escobar, a 24-year-old disc jockey in New York and son of

AD CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON BINGE DRINKING BY COLLEGE STUDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill., Mass., Ariz., N.C.)  (nk) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with back-to-school sales on mini-refrigerators, plastic
crates and halogen desk lamps, parents will soon be seeing an
advertisement about another dorm accessory: binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, signed by 113 colleges and universities, is
scheduled to run in 17 major newspapers around the country
beginning on Friday. The National Association of State Universities
and Land-Grant Colleges, which directed the campaign, is aiming the
advertisement at parents and legislators in what it calls the first
large-scale effort to take the issue off-campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``About one-third of college students started drinking in high
school,'' said Graham Spanier, the chairman of the association's
Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant
Universities and president of Pennsylvania State University. ``We
hope that people will realize that it's not a problem created on or
by universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Binge drinking on campus has had its share of publicity in
recent years, after incidents like the death of a freshman at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and drunken riots near Penn
State last year.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, framed as a promotion for a mock brew called
Binge Beer, alludes to such accidents: ``Who says falling off a
balcony is such a bad thing? And what's an occasional riot? Or even
a little assault between friends?''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities are combating the problem of binge
drinking in a variety of ways, including banning alcohol from
fraternities and sororities. Penn State sponsors all-night
alcohol-free activities at the student union.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey from the Harvard School of Public Health reported
that almost 43 percent of college students said they had engaged in
binge drinking. For the study, binge drinking was defined as having
five or more drinks in succession at least once in the two weeks
before the survey, four or more drinks for women.
</P>
<P>
   Not all institutions agree with those statistics. Some colleges,
in fact, are making it a point to tell students that overindulging
is not as common as they may think. The University of Arizona is
spreading the word that most of its students have four or fewer
drinks when they party. The university hopes students will feel
less pressure to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Carolina released a report in August
that suggested modest levels of drinking at its Chapel Hill campus.
The Highway Safety Research Center at the university administered
Breathalyzer tests to 1,800 students as they returned to their
dorms or apartments after an evening out, and found 70 percent had
no alcohol in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Foss, the manager of alcohol studies at the center, said
more studies were needed to understand how and why students drink
before placing blame or using tactics that might not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research just hasn't really been done yet,'' Foss said.
``In the past few years, suddenly there are a lot of efforts to
study this phenomenon. Unfortunately, people are wanting to do
something now, not to wait for the knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The university promoted the accuracy of its Breathalyzer tests,
compared with survey interviews in which students can brag, by
distributing posters that read, ``It's not what they say, it's what
they blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Haines, coordinator of health enhancement services at
Northern Illinois University and a proponent of the ``social
norms'' theory of using positive peer pressure, said he did not
think the solution was scare tactics, either on campus or off.
``It's a political move to bring attention to a problem that is
being exaggerated,'' Haines said.
</P>
<P>
   In Spanier's view, politics has indeed played a role, but it has
been to keep the issue out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are some who don't want to talk about it because
they feel it would bring bad PR to the campus,'' Spanier said. ``If
they openly acknowledge there is a problem, they are afraid it
might disturb parents, that their applications might go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanier also sees little need for hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   As if to mark the beginning of the school year, a Penn State
student was hospitalized last month after taking 21 shots of
alcohol in two hours, shooting her blood-alcohol level up to more
than six times the legal limit. She was celebrating her 21st
birthday.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Sumner Redstone, the 76-year-old chairman and
chief executive of Viacom Inc., stepped from an elevator in the St.
Regis Hotel in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, the man right next to
him, Melvin Karmazin, 56, president and chief executive of CBS,
appeared to be temporarily distracted.
</P>
<P>
   But after a polite second or two watching Karmazin accept the
congratulations of onlookers, Redstone turned, his eyes plainly
beseeching his new partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right behind you, Sumner!'' Karmazin said, rushing past a
throng of photographers.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, that moment captured the complex new relationship
that now unites the two men. For while Redstone may be buying CBS
to add to Viacom's media empire and will remain as chief executive,
he is clearly depending on Karmazin to run the company for him.
</P>
<P>
   Not a man known for puppy dog-like eagerness, Karmazin, who will
serve as chief operating officer and will have all units reporting
to him, is the aggressive former radio ad salesman now widely
considered the media world's most ruthless manager and cost
slasher. Redstone, an eminence grise of the media world, is the
tireless builder who grew up in a Boston tenement during the
Depression and who transformed a handful of bedraggled movie
theaters into the country's largest privately held theater chain,
eventually buying Viacom in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The $37.3 billion deal joins not just two enormous media
companies but two oversized corporate personalities in a marriage
that was consummated after a two-year flirtation and a brief but
painstakingly intense two-week prenuptial discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seduced us,'' Redstone said of Karmazin Tuesday. ``This
began as a deal involving some television stations. Then he started
talking about cable networks. Then I could see it coming. He is a
master salesman, and he began to turn me on.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a housing development on Long Island, Karmazin is the
son of first-generation Americans. His father, now dead, drove a
taxi and his mother, with whom he is still very close, worked in a
curtain-rod factory. After high school, Karmazin worked days at a
tiny advertising agency and earned his undergraduate degree at Pace
University by night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unencumbered by convention, and even running this
company has not seduced him,'' said a Los Angeles television
executive who is a close friend to Karmazin. ``He has gone from
being an ascetic who lived in a small apartment to an ascetic who
lives in a big apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stretch at CBS Radio, Karmazin worked for John Kluge at
Metromedia Inc., managing radio stations in the 1970s. In 1981, he
founded Infinity Broadcasting, the broadcast company that now
distributes the shows of Don Imus and Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Mel the zen master,'' said Imus. ``He is a Christ-like
figure in our lives. He is the real deal. I had an opportunity when
I re-signed here a few years ago to go elsewhere for more money and
I did not even consider it. There was the loyalty factor. Mel is
enormously loyal, and so am I _ to Mel.''
</P>
<P>
   When CBS acquired Infinity in 1996, Karmazin was part of the
package. At first, he ran the combined radio operations of
Infinity, Westinghouse and CBS, along with its outdoor advertising
business. After Michael H. Jordan, then the chairman and chief
executive of CBS, appointed him to head CBS' station division,
Karmazin then became chief operating officer of the company, and in
October 1998 forced Jordan's resignation and assumed his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel has done this before,'' said a television executive close
to Karmazin. ``He went to Mike Jordan and said, `I want to buy your
radio stations.' Jordan said no. So Mel said, `Buy me.' This time,
he went to Sumner and said, `I want to buy Viacom.' Sumner said no,
and Mel said, `Well, then buy me. Or merge with me.' And when
Redstone is no longer CEO, Mel is there.''
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of CBS, Karmazin trimmed the already weakened
news division's budget by 10 percent and ushered in a new round of
company-wide layoffs. He has been known to loudly question what he
perceives to be excessive lunch tabs on expense accounts. His
self-composed entry in ``Who's Who'' is brief: just under five
lines.
</P>
<P>
   While members of Karmazin's public-relations team are eager to
quash any notion that Karmazin is simply a cost-cutter, he made
several pointed references to his tight-fisted reputation. Redstone
and Karmazin, for example, said they planned to fly to Washington
Wednesday morning to meet with officials of the Federal
Communications Commission. Karmazin remarked, ``He'll fly on his
jet, and I'll take the shuttle.'' Redstone owns a Gulfstream III
jet.
</P>
<P>
   But Karmazin is not just a penny pincher. ``I have been working
with Mel for two years,'' said Leslie Moonves, the chief executive
of CBS Television, ``and he has never denied me any of the money it
took for me to get something on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Redstone is an equally ambitious entrepreneur who is also from a
less-than-wealthy background. His father, Max Rothstein, began a
nightclub business by buying New York City's Latin Quarter
nightclub from Lou Walters, Barbara Walters' father. (Rothstein,
not Redstone, changed the family name, said Carl Folta, a Viacom
spokesman.)
</P>
<P>
   With a degree from Harvard Law School, Redstone bought and began
to turn the National Amusements movie theater chain into a thriving
business in the 1950s and 1960s, acquiring pieces from Columbia,
MGM/UA and Loews after the studios were required to divest
themselves of theaters.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually gathered enough resources to take over Viacom in
1987, which was then an ill-defined hodgepodge of cable, broadcast
and syndication divisions. When the company was struggling, rather
than cede to pressure from advisers to sell MTV and Nickelodeon,
Redstone reduced debt by selling off assets like Madison Square
Garden and several cable systems, radio stations and book
publishers. That included an educational division of Simon &AMP;
Schuster that went to the British company Pearson PLC for a price
tag that stunned the industry: more than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness and certainty with which the CBS-Viacom deal was
concluded confirms that both men had been eyeing each other for at
least two years, said several executives involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Karmazin said he first approached Redstone seriously right
after the FCC proposed in early August to relax the rules limiting
media concentration. According to executives involved in the deal,
Karmazin and CBS' chief financial officer, Fredric Reynolds, began
seeking advice the very day the FCC made its announcement.
Karmazin, a Viacom executive said, wanted to be the first to take
advantage of the new regulatory climate.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin first suggested that CBS acquire Viacom, an executive
close to the talks said. Redstone said that he was not interested,
but that he might be willing to consider an agreement that would
keep him in control. He invited Karmazin to lunch at Viacom
headquarters in Times Square during the third week of August.
</P>
<P>
   The second meeting between the two men took place only a few
days later, and this time they were joined by Thomas Dooley and
Philippe Dauman, Viacom's deputy chairmen, who both encouraged
Redstone to seriously consider the merger. Both, paradoxically,
have now resigned, effective as soon as the merger is completed in
the early part of 2000. (But they each, a Viacom executive said,
will receive buyout packages so generous that they will be able to
buy their own Gulfstream jets.)
</P>
<P>
   After three lunches and several other meetings at Karmazin's
apartment overlooking Central Park _ at least one stretched late
into the night _ Redstone and Karmazin agreed to proceed with the
merger on Tuesday, Aug. 24, two weeks before the deal was announced
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's board convened twice last week to discuss the deal _
once on Thursday, and then again on Sunday over the Labor Day
weekend, when the Viacom board approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the talks said that the most troublesome
point was from the legal perspective of who would run the company.
The agreement from the beginning was that Viacom would have more
board members than CBS, ``and that Sumner would be in control of
the company,'' said another executive close to the talks. ``What
the negotiations were about was how do you turn that into something
legally enforceable? `You've got day-to-day responsibility and I am
the CEO' sounds simple, but what does it really mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most telling about the level of trust between the two
men is that the terms of the deal were worked out between Karmazin
and Redstone to the exclusion of almost all others; the two men
handed off their plan to the teams of lawyers and financial
advisors to allow them to thrash out the final details. As a
result, the investment bankers involved in the deal are expected to
earn only about $50 million, a relatively small sum for a merger of
this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal would not have happened unless Mel were involved,''
Redstone said, adding that he insisted that Karmazin be chief
operating officer from the beginning of the negotiations. ``He is
brilliant. He is an entrepreneur and so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Redstone would not comment on how long he would stay at Viacom
but suggested that he was not planning on leaving for a long time.
``I'm feeling pretty good and I have a lot of fun working at
Viacom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say that this man has not lost his
fastball,'' Karmazin said. But his glee was clearly in evidence at
Tuesday's press conference. ``This is the deal I have wanted to
make from the time I was bar-mitzvah'ed.''

MICROSOFT TO START NET HOTEL-PRICING SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imitating a competitor's patented approach, the Microsoft Corp.
is introducing an Internet service that lets consumers name their
own prices for hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was an innovation of the heavily promoted
Priceline.com service, which last year introduced a system to let
people enter the prices they would be willing to pay for airline
tickets. It has since expanded to hotels, cars and mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
   On both Priceline and the new Price Matcher service that
Microsoft is introducing Tuesday on its Expedia travel site,
consumers specify the city, dates, room rate and hotel rating (one
to five stars) they are seeking. The service picks the individual
hotel, and automatically charges the amount of the full stay to the
buyer's credit card. No refunds or changes are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have become so enamored by the potential of this
system that Priceline, which went public last year, has a market
value of some $9.9 billion, more than any airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking for a way to hook onto Priceline's coat
tails,'' said Kenneth J. Orton, chief strategist at Cognititive, a
San Francisco consulting firm, and former chief executive of
Preview Travel, an Internet travel service. He said Microsoft's
move was meant to appeal more to investors than to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Wall Street is devoted to Priceline, consumer
reaction has been more tepid because of the restrictions that the
system imposes. If the service can find a hotel room or plane
ticket at the specified price, the consumer must buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Barton, the general manager of Expedia, said that such
restrictions are necessary to get the hotels to agree to take lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for consumers because they can get great deals,''
he said. ``And it's good for hotels because they can put people
into rooms that may go empty while protecting their published price
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton declined to say whether Microsoft would introduce a
similar system for airline tickets and car rentals, but he said
there was no reason that it would not if the hotel offering was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   One factor, however, that might impede Microsoft is that
Priceline has been granted a patent on the central mechanism of its
system: the concept of a ``conditional purchase offer'' in which a
consumer is committed to buy something if the seller can meet their
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline, said that the company had
not licensed its patent to Microsoft and that the company was still
studying the Microsoft site to see if it was an infringement on its
patent.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, of Microsoft, declined to comment on Priceline's patent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Priceline and Expedia buy blocks of hotel rooms at
wholesale rates and then sell them to those who bid higher prices.
There is a well-developed market for such bulk purchases of hotel
rooms, since hotels are willing to take less money in return for a
volume purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Meristar Hotels and Resorts, which operates 218 hotels under the
Hilton, Sheraton, Radisson and other brands, now sells 1 percent to
2 percent of its rooms through Priceline, said David McCaslin, its
president. It will also take part in the Microsoft program, but
McCaslin said he did not expect such a sales approach to dominate
the hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do your job properly, you will create your own
demand,'' he said. ``But I don't think any hotel is so good they
are selling out at full rate 365 days a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Expedia already books reservations online through more
conventional models. In the second quarter, it sold $183 million
worth of air travel, hotel rooms and car rentals. In addition to
receiving commissions on those sales _ often $5 or $10 for airline
tickets _ it sells advertising and other promotional opportunities
to travel providers.

 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viacom Inc. said Tuesday that it would acquire CBS
Inc. for $37.3 billion, a deal that is the biggest media merger yet
and would create the world's second-largest media company after
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For Viacom and its 76-year-old chairman, Sumner Redstone, who
will run the combined companies if the merger is completed, the
deal adds a major broadcast television network, 15 CBS-owned
television stations and the nation's biggest group of radio
stations to a media portfolio that includes the highly profitable
MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon cable networks, the Paramount film studio
and the Blockbuster video-rental chain.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' 56-year-old chief executive, Mel Karmazin, will become
Redstone's second-in-command and heir apparent, as president and
chief operating officer, and all units of Viacom and CBS will
report to him.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition signals another change in the ownership of the
three once-independent major broadcasting networks. NBC has been
owned by General Electric since 1985, and ABC was bought in 1995 by
Walt Disney Co. for $19 billion _ the previous record for a media
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps even more significant than Viacom's ascension to
second-largest media company _ with a stock market value of about
$72 billion, compared with Time Warner's $80.5 billion _ Viacom
could very likely emerge as the world's largest seller of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the television and radio properties, Viacom's
acquisition includes CBS' pending deal to acquire the billboard
giant Outdoor Systems Inc. Analysts estimate that a combined
Viacom-CBS would generate $11 billion a year in advertising _
nearly twice that of the current leader, Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., which sells $5.8 billion in annual advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's cable networks are popular with children, teens and
young adults, while CBS' emphasis on television news and prime-time
fare like ``Touched by an Angel'' have tended to attract older
viewers. Bringing the children's program ``Rugrats'' and the
sophisticated news magazine ``60 Minutes'' under a single corporate
nameplate is meant to offer advertisers one-stop shopping to reach
audiences of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be global leaders in virtually every facet of the
wonderful, diverse media and entertainment industry,'' predicted
Redstone, who has built Viacom into one of the world's most
successful entertainment companies since acquiring it 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CBS shareholders will get 1.085 Class B shares of Viacom stock
for each share of CBS, an offer worth about $50.93 a share at
Tuesday's closing price of Viacom stock, and including no premium
above CBS' current market value. Viacom will assume about $1.4
billion of CBS debt.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' stock prices rose on Tuesday's news. CBS gained
$1.75, to $50.6875; Viacom's class B shares rose $1.875, to
$46.9375. And analysts almost universally lauded the deal, not just
for its size and global scope, but for the complementary fit
between the young-skewing audiences of Viacom's cable networks and
the older audiences of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   As Fred Moran, an analyst at the investment firm ING Barings,
said, ``You can literally pick an advertiser's needs and market
that advertiser across all the demographic profiles, from
Nickelodeon with the youngest consumers to CBS with some of the
oldest consumers, and with the Country Music Network, the Nashville
Network, MTV and VH1 right in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies unanimously approved the deal, but
CBS shareholders must still vote on the merger. Redstone has
control of Viacom's class A stock, which are the voting shares. The
companies expect the deal to be completed early next year, assuming
the Federal Communications Commission signs off on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be called Viacom, but the CBS television
network and all its units will continue to be called CBS. And
viewers will not suddenly find music videos appearing on CBS;
indeed, both Redstone and Karmazin said Tuesday that CBS News, CBS
Entertainment and CBS Sports will continue to be run much the way
they have been, under the leadership of Leslie Moonves, who is to
continue overseeing them.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger could mean, for example, that Viacom's MTV and
VH-1 music cable channels will find new outlets for their
programming on CBS' rock radio stations around the country _ just
as CBS' own cable channels, Country Music Television and The
Nashville Network, now provide programs for some of CBS'
country-music radio stations. And each will heavily promote its
sister networks.
</P>
<P>
   And promotional spots on MTV or VH-1 could induce some younger
viewers to sample shows on CBS, helping the broadcast network
eventually attract more of the 18-to-49-year-old audience that
advertisers pay the biggest premiums to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could also mean that Nickelodeon _ the most
profitable children's network, whether broadcast or cable _ would
provide programming to help bolster CBS' little-watched
Saturday-morning children's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   On the new media front, several of Viacom's networks, notably
MTV and Nickelodeon, have well-established and very popular Web
sites. Karmazin said Tuesday that it was his goal to make
Viacom-CBS one of the leading new media companies, adding that this
goal could be given a substantial boost by the promotional
opportunities available through the company's television and radio
networks and its outdoor advertising unit, the largest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have to divest itself of some broadcast
properties, or seek waivers from federal regulations. Redstone and
Karmazin said they would visit the Federal Communications
Commission Wednesday to appeal for changes in certain rules.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, to them, is the cap on television station
ownership, which restricts any company to owning stations that
reach no more than 35 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   With Viacom's 19 television stations and CBS' 15, the combined
company would own stations in 18 of the nation's top 20 markets and
reach 41 percent of the population. If the cap is not raised,
Karmazin said, the company will probably sell some stations to
comply with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But Karmazin and Redstone spoke of their eagerness to create new
business opportunities out of their six potential duopolies _
ownership of two stations in the same market. They have six such
potential duopolies, in Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Dallas,
Miami and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom also owns half of the UPN broadcast network, with
Chris-Craft, and under FCC rules that stake must be reduced to less
than one-third (unless an FCC waiver is granted).
</P>
<P>
   Redstone took pains to point out that UPN, which has struggled
with small audiences for most of its existence, has been ``doing
much better'' with a new focus on young male audiences.
</P>
<P>
   For the CBS television network, an important Viacom asset is
Paramount, the studio that produced the film ``Titanic'' and the
television show ``Frasier'' (on NBC), and that will now undoubtedly
create more television shows for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But Moonves said Tuesday that he saw the model being more like
the Fox network's relationship with its corporate sibling,
Twentieth Television, than like ABC's dealings with Disney. Disney
recently combined management of its television studio and broadcast
network, with the goal of producing more hits for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sister studio, in contrast, produces shows for all the
networks, and Moonves said he expected Paramount to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did feel like a second-class citizen,'' he said, ``when
we saw the advantages ABC-Disney had, and Fox had, and even the WB
had, having a direct link to a studio.'' The WB network is linked
to the Warner Brothers studio, and both are owned by Time-Warner.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is now the only one of the six major broadcast networks
without a major production studio in its corporate family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and television industry executives were struck by
Redstone's solution to what had been a longstanding problem at
Viacom, the absence of a clear successor to the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Although Redstone has no plans to retire (and Karmazin said,
``Believe me, this guy still has his fastball''), the older man
said the merger was contingent upon Karmazin's consent to become
his heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   That decision forced Redstone's two longtime deputies, Philippe
Dauman and Thomas Dooley, to resign. Both men urged him to make the
deal, Redstone said, and will stay on the new Viacom's board of
directors, but not as employees.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin and Redstone said they expected no layoffs to result
from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Karmazin is admired for combining tight
financial controls with a willingness to take entrepreneurial bets.
Analysts note that he has sharply improved the financial
performance of the CBS TV stations and affiliates, while also
aggressively increasing the CBS investments in Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, and
Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Paine Webber, both predicted that
the new company would be one of the fastest-growing media companies
in the world, because of its blend of assets and its relatively low
debt, which would enable it to invest in expanding its assets,
acquiring new ones or buying back stock.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom and CBS, other analysts noted, are following the lead of
earlier deals like Disney's purchase of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and
Time Warner's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting. The merger
impulse is driven by the belief that at a time of increasing
uncertainty in the media business, there is an advantage in owning
both the programming and the distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are bet-hedging mergers in some ways,'' observed David
Nadler, chairman of Delta Consulting Group Inc., a management
consulting firm. The challenge ``is how to make these very large
companies with complex sets of relationships work in ways that pay
off,'' Nadler said. ``Just owning a bunch of different properties
doesn't mean you get the profit-making synergies that executives
talk about when they announce these mergers.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ They start three hours before game time, behind the
ivy-covered wall of Wrigley Field, under the right-field bleachers,
in the batting cage. This is where home run swings are built.
</P>
<P>
   It's just two men, Sammy Sosa and his hitting coach, alone
except for the shotgun sound of white ash on horsehide. Between
underhand tosses from eight paces, the coach, Jeff Pentland, passes
on the mantras he learned from studying Ted Williams. ``Stay
back.'' ``Give yourself time to recognize the pitch.'' ``Stay
within yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In his white pinstriped uniform pants and a blue sleeveless
T-shirt, Sosa swings intently but easily, driving the ball into the
net. It's five more swings, then two more, then end on a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was that?'' Sosa asks. Pentland answers through his
chewing tobacco, ``Ninety-nine percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A once-a-generation event is happening for the second straight
year. The sluggers who entertained baseball fans and the nation
last summer, Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Sosa of
the Chicago Cubs, are again within reach of the record for most
home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time the leader is Sammy Sosa. With less than one
month to go, Sosa leads McGwire, 58 to 54. No one-hit wonder, Sosa
is excelling on a team so dreadful that Cubs fans have changed that
old baseball lament to ``Wait till next century.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's just warming up. Sosa, who did not homer in a
doubleheader against Cincinnati on Tuesday, needs to hit a home run
every other day to reach McGwire's record of 70; that's just what
he has done over the past month. If he were to hit as many in the
Cubs' remaining 24 games as he has hit in the past 24 games, Sosa
would finish with a record 73.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-Sosa reprise provides a second chance for those who
rooted for Sosa _ because he was the underdog, or because he wasn't
pumping up his muscles with questionable substances, or just
because he was having so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago on Sept. 7, McGwire bested Babe Ruth's 1927 mark of
60 home runs. The next day, he made obsolete Roger Maris' 1961
record of 61. Then began the friendly competition with Sosa, who
finished at 66 homers while McGwire pushed on to 70.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is a perennial, but few expected Sosa to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, 43 baseball fans in Chicago, mostly office
workers in the downtown Loop, got together in a home run pool. In
picking their roster of players, they were limited to only one of
last year's leaders. Out of 43 fans, in Chicago, only six chose
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe he's done it again this year,'' said one of
the entrants, Mike Olah, 28, who works for an investment firm.
``The winds seemed to be blowing the Cubs' way last year, and I
figured that was the case for Sammy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans saw how Sosa spent his vacation: throwing out the first
pitch at the World Series, parading through New York City, helping
the victims of a hurricane in his native Dominican Republic,
lighting the national Christmas tree, touring Japan, sitting with
the first lady at the State of the Union message and joking with
Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   And fans see Slammin' Sammy's exuberance during the game. How he
starts the game sprinting to his position in right field, swapping
salutes with the Bleacher Bums. How, in the first inning, he taps
the umpire and the catcher on the back of the leg with his bat,
just to say hello. How he follows a home run pop with a hop high in
the air, and then, back in the dugout, blows kisses to the camera
for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Fans do not see Sosa's preparation for the game. Before noon,
hours before an afternoon game at Wrigley, this is usually the time
for rookies and old men. At third base, 23-year-old Cole Liniak is
taking groundballs, hoping his first week in the majors won't be
his last. At the gate on Waveland Avenue, Marty Mahinsk, 77, is
stacking up programs to sell, as he has since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   In the cage, the 30-year-old Sosa is working on his swing, as
Pentland's mantras continue. ``The hands,'' he says, ``are the
communicators to the ball.'' The batting practice on the field just
before the game is for timing. But the time in the cage is for the
swing.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the time to shed bad feelings after a strikeout or
another Cubs loss. For Sosa is in danger of breaking another
record: Never has a player hit more home runs than his team has won
games. So far, Sosa leads the Cubs by two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very emotional person, and he tends to be moody,''
Pentland said. ``When he's in a bad mood, he wants to be by
himself. But it doesn't affect his production on the field. He has
incredible inner drive. The greater the pressure, the greater his
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a most dismal year in a dismal century for his
last-place Cubs. Everyone is being nice to the manager, because
he's not expected to be back next year. The problem areas seem to
be pitching, hitting and fielding.
</P>
<P>
   During a game this summer, as fans tell the story, a Bleacher
Bum in right field called over an usher. ``These guys are bothering
me,'' he said. ``Which guys?'' the usher asked. The fan pointed to
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not all great home run hitters have played on great teams. For
every Ruth and Maris and Mickey Mantle, there is a Ralph Kiner of
the Pittsburgh Pirates of the 1940s, a Jimmie Foxx of the
Philadelphia Athletics of 1932 and a Willie Mays of the New York
Giants of 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Even playing for losers, Sosa and McGwire are drawing the
largest crowds on the road. But there is no mania, no bidding for
the home run balls, no tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
on what they might be worth. It's as if the nation has been
inoculated against outright home run fever.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is possible the home run is being devalued by its frequency,
the product of weak pitching in an expanding league. In a single
game on Friday night in Philadelphia, the Cincinnati players hit
nine home runs. In more than a century of baseball, only 29 times
has a player hit 50 or more home runs in a season; 12 of those
seasons have happened in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But home run inflation doesn't explain why Sosa and McGwire are
one-third ahead of the other players in baseball. In their National
League, Jeff Bagwell of Houston was third in home runs with 39
before Tuesday's games. In the American League, Rafael Palmeiro of
Texas and Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle had 42. No one is close to
``those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good'' is Billy Williams' short explanation. Williams,
a Hall of Fame player and Sosa's first hitting coach with the Cubs,
has a longer answer, too: ``They're strong. They're quick. And
every pitcher is told to keep the ball down, to guard against the
home run. Those guys are low-ball hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   A fan can compare their swings six more times this season.
McGwire's Cardinals and Sosa's Cubs play three games in Chicago,
Sept. 20-22, and the last three games of the season, Oct. 1-3, in
St. Louis. (That first game will be played on McGwire's 36th
birthday.) Both managers say they will pitch to the other team's
slugger, if the other team pitches to their guy.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball statisticians believe a new home run record is
attainable. The detail: Sosa has 24 games to go. Extrapolation: In
his previous 24 games, he has hit 15 home runs (result: 73).
Extrapolation: In his final 24 games last year, he hit 11 (result:
69). McGwire has 22 games to go; in his previous 22 games, he has
hit seven (result: 61); in his final 22 games last year, he hit 11
(result: 65.)
</P>
<P>
   The failure of both teams has brought criticism of Sosa and
McGwire from some fans and commentators, who suggest that their
spectacular performances have somehow hurt their teams. While Sosa
and McGwire are among the league leaders in RBIs, Sosa leads in
strikeouts, with McGwire not far down the list.
</P>
<P>
   Strikeouts are common for home run hitters _ Ruth had 1,330,
enough to fill three full seasons _ but some suggest the two
players are a little selfish, swinging for the home run when a more
cautious swing for a single might help the team more. Or perhaps
their excellence is distracting their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa doesn't follow that logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay me to do my job,'' he said. ``Just because the team
is struggling, it doesn't mean I have to be struggling. If
everybody had 57 home runs right now, we would be in first place.''

GORE PROPOSES PROVIDING INSURANCE TO ALL CHILDREN BY 2005
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore proposed Tuesday to
guarantee access to affordable health insurance for all children by
2005, expanding on a program enacted two years ago that he conceded
has had limited success so far.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that the number of Americans without coverage
had increased steadily since he and President Clinton took office.
But in a speech at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, he said,
``If you elect me president, I will insure that by the year 2005,
every single child in our country has full access to fully
affordable health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured children rose by roughly 2.5 million in
the last decade, to 11 million in 1997, the last year for which
official data are available.
 &UR;  &LR; When Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program in
1997, it gave the states billions of dollars and considerable
flexibility in how the money could be used. Gore said he would
expand eligibility for the program by increasing the limits on
family income and by allowing some parents to enroll with their
children. In addition, he would impose financial penalties on
states that fail to meet federal targets for the enrollment of
children, and bonuses for states that meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said in July that 1.3 million children had
been enrolled in the children's insurance program. Clinton said
that he would have expected at least 3 million to be enrolled by
now, and that he was therefore ``a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said his proposals, taken together, could provide
coverage for 11 million to 15 million Americans, most of them
children. The number of people without health insurance has been
climbing in the last decade and now exceeds 43 million.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of offering affordable health insurance to all
children, though ambitious, is modest by comparison with Clinton's
original plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one
fell swoop,'' Gore said in underlining the differences between his
approach and the grand schemes devised in 1993 by the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a dig at the leading candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, noting that
one-fourth of the children in that state lack insurance _ a higher
proportion than in almost any other state.
</P>
<P>
   While focusing on children, Gore offered several proposals
Tuesday to increase coverage of adults, too. He proposed a new tax
credit to offset 25 percent of the cost of health insurance
purchased by individuals who have no access to employer-sponsored
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, companies that provide coverage get a tax break,'' Gore
said. ``But not individuals who have to get coverage on their own.
That's just not fair, and we have to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans in Congress agree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's proposal to expand the Children's Health
Insurance Program, created in 1997, would extend coverage to the 7
million uninsured adults whose children are eligible for either
Medicaid or the new children's program.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the proposal is simple. Most uninsured children
come from families in which the parents are themselves uninsured.
But Gore's proposal raises a question of equity and fairness: Why
should the government provide subsidized health insurance to adults
with children while denying it to adults of working age without
children?
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not say how much his proposals would cost or how he
would pay for them. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice
president, said, ``This will be done in the context of a balanced
budget, and we'll put out a detailed budget proposal later, but we
have no price tag right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said the cost of Gore's proposals would
almost surely exceed $24 billion over five years _ the amount
appropriated by Congress to cover a maximum of 5 million youngsters
in the new health program for children.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have chided Congress and governors for
not doing more to increase health insurance coverage. But this is a
tricky issue for Gore, because the Clinton-Gore administration
shares responsibility for the failure to fulfill the promise of
programs already enacted at the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a vibrant economy, Gore said Tuesday, the number of
Americans without health insurance has been growing by about a
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``one of the few social indicators that have not
improved under the strong Clinton-Gore economy,'' says a new paper
on health policy prepared by the the Gore campaign. Even though
Congress has created and expanded several health programs,
enrollment has been ``woefully inadequate,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have known for several years that at least
4 million children have been eligible for Medicaid but not
enrolled, and there is no evidence that this number has gone down,
despite many efforts and exhortations by federal officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated administration proposals to define the rights of
patients in health maintenance organizations, to establish new
prescription drug benefits under Medicare and to provide a modest
tax credit for the cost of nursing home care. But the focus of his
speech was on uninsured children, and Gore offered these ideas to
deal with the problem:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government should impose financial penalties on
states that do not meet federal targets for enrolling youngsters in
Medicaid and in the new health program for children. At the same
time, the government would pay bonuses to states that meet their
goals. (Gore said this would make states accountable for their
performance. But critics said it would reward states that are
succeeding, at the expense of states that are struggling.)
</P>
<P>
   _ States could expand eligibility for the new Children's Health
Insurance Program, so families with incomes up to 2.5 times the
official poverty level could qualify. In most states, the ceiling
on family income is set at twice the poverty level. For a family of
four, the poverty level this year is $16,700.
</P>
<P>
   _ More affluent families should be allowed to buy insurance
coverage for youngsters through Medicaid or the new children's
health program if the parents work for companies that do not
provide health benefits. Such families would have to pay the full
premium, but this would often be a bargain compared with prices in
the private market, because large government programs have much
greater purchasing power than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said there were more than 2 million uninsured
children in families with incomes exceeding 2.5 times the official
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said Gore's proposals would clearly help
some working families, but could also take pressure off the states
to find and enroll children who are already eligible for health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would give states a bonus for enrolling children in a
program that already offers states a generous financial incentive
to do just that. In the new Children's Health Insurance Program, as
in Medicaid, the federal government and the states share the costs,
but the federal government pays a larger share of the costs in the
new program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's proposals are intended to restore health
insurance for tens of thousands of children who lost coverage when
their families were removed from the welfare rolls. In theory, most
such children were still eligible for Medicaid, but their parents
did not always realize it, and officials in some states improperly
cut off health benefits along with cash assistance.

EXCERPTS FROM GORE'S SPEECH ON HEALTH CARE
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-HEALTH, GORE-HEALTH-BOX) 
(nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from an address on health care Tuesday by
Vice President Al Gore at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles,
as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years we have been engaged in a battle to
provide the kind of health care a great nation owes its people. Now
after that long century of effort, conflict and concern, it is time
to move past theoretical and philosophical divisions beyond a
sterile debate about labels and abstractions to ask what we can do
now to take concrete, specific, realistic steps to improve health
coverage for all of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Today I'm proposing and with your help as president, I will
fight for a series of steps to do just that. We must and we can
insure a set of rights to that all Americans can have health
coverage and actually get the care they are _ all Americans who
have health coverage, will get the care they are entitled to. We
must and we can secure access to affordable quality health care for
every child in the entire country by the year 2005. Join with me
and we will do that. We must and we can move toward access to
affordable, quality health care for every American family.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamentally different approach. We have all learned
that we cannot overhaul the system in one fell swoop. Experience
has taught us that there is a way to keep what is right while
fixing what is wrong with American health care.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of my proposal is health care for working families. It
will put doctors and patients in charge, not HMO's and insurance
companies. The steps that I'm proposing here today will guarantee
access to affordable health coverage for every child in America and
will provide health-care options for millions more adults. But let
me be clear. We cannot rest until every single American has
affordable health coverage. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some will argue that greater access to health care is a luxury
we can't afford even as they covet our record surplus for the
special interests and propose to blow it on a risky tax scheme that
would drive us right back into spiraling federal deficits. For more
than two decades I have seen the struggle between working families
and special interests. The tobacco lobby, the gun lobby, those who
stood against the Family Leave Bill I co-sponsored in the Senate.
We've had to fight them all and we're not about to stop now. Others
will argue against reforming our health-care system carefully,
realistically and step by step. Some of them will tell you that the
only acceptable answer is a one-size-fits-all solution. But I
believe Americans know better. They know, you and I know, we need
visionary but practical change, change that can be enacted into
law, change that works for working families, change that meets
their cares and concerns, that respects the diversity of
health-care needs. Our cause is working families. And in this
campaign and in the years ahead, let's put their interests first,
ahead of the special interests, ahead of anything.
</P>
<P>
   This is a unique moment for our nation, for our people. Our
economy is strong, indeed we are in the midst of the longest period
of prosperity in our peacetime history. But we know that prosperity
alone will not meet the challenges that we face in American health
care. And as Harry Truman reminded us when he began this fight 50
years ago, in a time of prosperity, we can afford many things. But
ill-health which can be prevented or cured is one thing we cannot
afford.
</P>
<P>
   We must use our prosperity now to bring new change to our
health-care system, to make our families healthier and more hopeful
for the new century ahead. That's the kind of change that works for
working families. And that's why I'm running for president of the
United States.

MATADORS HOPE KEY DEFENDERS MAKE TRIP

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ In a few days, the Cal State Northridge football
team will be getting on a plane to Kansas. Whether Mel Miller or
Kaleon Green will be on that flight remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, CSUN's starting cornerback last year, and Green, a
starting linebacker in 1997 who sat out all of last season with a
broken leg, haven't been cleared to join the Matadors. Miller is
waiting to become academically eligible and Green hasn't heard from
the NCAA regarding his appeal for a sixth season of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN needs to have Miller and Green _ two of the Matadors' best
defensive players _ against the Jayhawks. Kansas features senior
quarterback Zac Wegner, who ranks seventh in school history in
passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paperwork for (Miller's) scholarship hasn't been processed
yet,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin is optimistic both players will play at Kansas; their
names are among the 58 Matadors who are on the traveling roster for
KU. Miller didn't attend practice Tuesday, but Green did.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a senior who attended Missouri for the spring 1997
semester but quit after he felt the Tigers' coaches were giving
preferential treatment to another player, has been eying the Kansas
game for his return to action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Missouri coaches) are going to be looking at that game
film,'' Green said last week. ``I'm going to be doing some extra
pushups to get ready for Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like Miller, all Green can do is sweat out the next two
days.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slight scare: Sophomore quarterback Marcus Brady hurt his
right ankle late in CSUN's season-opening win over Western Oregon
but will be ready to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brady) was limping a little Sunday, he was limping a lot
Monday,'' Kearin said. ``We're going to go easy on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady's ankle appeared to be holding up, but he said he might
not practice today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough loss: After sitting out almost two weeks of practice
after straining his right hamstring in August, sophomore safety
Hassan Abdul-Malik thought he was completely healthy for Western
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But Abdul-Malik only made it through two series before
aggravating the injury. He missed the rest of the game and isn't
expected to return for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced hard the whole week,'' Abdul-Malik said. ``I felt
good. (But) that was the first full contact I had. I have to take
it day by day now and see how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Homecoming: Terrance Johnson, CSUN's linebackers coach, is
from Kansas City and was a Jayhawks recruit in the mid-1980s before
going to Colorado. Johnson said he's hoping to have 30 or 40 family
members and friends come to Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many ``depends on how many passes I can get,'' said
Johnson, who added his father is flying in from Delaware for the
game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Visions of a very tall building are tormenting
Alberto W. Vilar, whose name is not often in the papers and who
likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of proportion, my sense of esthetics, my sense of
landscape for New York just said this is wrong!'' declared Vilar,
an investment manager who runs a $5 billion high-tech fund and a
philanthropist who recently gave more than $30 million to the
Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes up as planned, the cause of Vilar's torment will be
the tallest residential tower in the world. Rising now on First
Avenue between East 47th and 48th Streets, it is the latest
neck-wrenching, glass-skinned, marble-lobbied condominium
confection of Donald Trump, the developer who loves to get his name
in the papers and who says he takes particular pleasure in
tormenting rich people like Vilar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who the hell is Trump to go around changing the landscape of
New York?'' asked Vilar, who has put up $100,000 for a campaign
against the 72-story building, called Trump World Tower. In league
with his East Side neighbors, many of whom are also enormously
rich, Vilar vows that he has just begun to write checks.
</P>
<P>
   Another unpleasant thing about Trump World Tower: It would block
Vilar's view of the Empire State Building as seen from the living
room of his 30-room four-plex apartment. The obstructed view,
though, is ``no big deal,'' Vilar said. ``To me it is a question of
esthetic outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, upon learning of Vilar's esthetic outrage and his
troubled view, squirmed with delight. ``Rich people don't like
losing their view _ that is pure and simple what this is all
about,'' said Trump, who lives atop Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in
a triplex with commanding views of Central Park and southern
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Squabbling among people of means over private views and public
space is perhaps Manhattan's longest-playing and highest-stakes
sport. It has sculptured the skyline of a city that has more tall
buildings than any other place on earth. The very rules of the
sport _ New York City zoning law _ have been written in response to
sharp-elbowed disputes over tall buildings like the one that is
swirling around Trump World Tower.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The city's first zoning law was prompted, in large measure, by a
tall-building fight that foreshadowed the dispute over Trump's
building on First Avenue. The principal player in that pre-World
War I fight was a vainglorious developer, T. Coleman Du Pont, who,
in a prescient imitation of Trump, boasted that his buildings were
the biggest and best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When moneyed opponents of Du Pont's planned 39-story Equitable
Building on lower Broadway offered him $2.5 million to cap
construction at eight stories, he laughed. Du Pont prevailed, but
his hulking office building and his braggadocio speeded passage of
the city's first zoning law in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Trump has won approval from city agencies for his building,
although opponents contend that the city misread its own complex
zoning laws in approving such a tall building in a residential
neighborhood. So far, he has put up two floors of it.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Giuliani administration proposed a major overhaul
of zoning laws that would impose limits on the height of
skyscrapers. The law, if passed, will not affect projects already
approved, like Trump's. But if the law had been in effect when
Trump proposed his new project, it would have been ruled illegal,
said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the city Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Trump World Towers, though, has not quite yet managed to slip
past the gate. There is one last municipal obstacle, a hearing this
month before the Board of Standards and Appeals, prompted by the
building's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   If Trump prevails there, as seems likely, opponents of the tower
say they will go to court and spend whatever it takes, for as long
as it takes, to stop the building from rising to its planned 861
feet or, if need be, to lop off some of its top floors after it is
built.
</P>
<P>
   The principal strategic problem for Trump's adversaries is that
they showed up late for the fight. Trump obtained city approval of
the tower without public hearings or environmental studies. He
quietly bought air rights from nearby buildings in a way that
allowed him to increase his tower's height without public approval.
After a period of uncharacteristic quietude, Trump reverted to
form, boasting about his cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I don't know who this man is,'' Trump said in reference
to Vilar. ``But if his views are blocked bad enough and if he has
got enough money, I hope he can buy an apartment in my new
building, or perhaps it will be sold out before he gets a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The opposition did begin haltingly. Vilar and his neighbors
were, at first, stunned by the proposed size of the tower, which
would dwarf all the other buildings in the area, including the
nearby 39-story U.N. complex.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It took the opposition leaders a few months to mobilize their
neighbors. But they have since assembled the standard arsenal for
all-out real-estate war in the city: celebrities, a
public-relations firm, architectural groups, lawyers and a pot of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents have raised and spent nearly $400,000, said
Seymour Flug, president of the Beekman Hill Association, former
chairman of Diners Club and chief organizer of the stop-Trump
effort. Besides Vilar's promise of ``whatever it costs,'' Flug (who
lives next door to Vilar, but whose view would not be affected by
Trump's tower) said opponents of the tower expected money from
wealthy supporters, many of whom live in the same luxury co-op
building, U.N.Plaza on 49th Street, across First Avenue from
Trump's building.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the building include David Koch, the oil
billionaire; Victoria Newhouse, wife of the publisher S.I.
Newhouse; Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citibank, and
William H. Donaldson, the founding partner of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette Securities. All oppose Trump's tower.
</P>
<P>
   The household name in this fight is Walter Cronkite. When
Cronkite, the retired CBS News anchorman, testified as the first
witness against the tower at a city hearing in June, a lawyer for
the opposition introduced him as ``one of the most beloved men in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite, 82, lives in an apartment on the 25th floor of 870
U.N. Plaza and concedes that he ``won't like it'' when the tower
blocks his view of the Chrysler Building. But his opposition to
Trump, he said at the hearing, was based on much more than the loss
of a view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, this protest is supported by a whole lot
more less-than-wealthy folks who are sharply offended by the
unnecessary grossness of this project,'' Cronkite said at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Trump accuses Flug of ``wheeling out Cronkite and using him to a
fare-thee-well. Walter is a man of prestige and Sy Flug isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Trump has leaned on business associates to
disassociate themselves from his opponents. He called executives at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, which often does work for his
company, and complained about Donaldson's opposition. ``I was
surprised that a man in that firm would be doing it,'' Trump said.
``I never took work away from them or threatened them in any way,
shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   What angers many opponents of the Trump building is the silence
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He has refused to venture any opinion on
the issue, saying it is a ``very complicated legal question'' that
will end up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mayor who takes an outspoken position on every issue
that comes in front of him,'' Flug complained. ``But on this he has
nothing to say. The mayor's silence is a way of absolutely repaying
Trump, who is a huge contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment, the mayor's office called Flug's statement
``an unfortunate mischaracterization.''

BARRY SHIPP, 62, THE DEVELOPER OF THE JOVAN MUSK FRAGRANCE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ill., N.J.)  (nk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Shipp, a perfume salesman who discovered an aromatic oil
being sold in a drug paraphernalia shop and developed it into a
multimillion-dollar business called Jovan Musk, died Monday at his
home in Chicago. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   He died of a heart attack, said his daughter, Lara Shipp.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Shipp, then a sales representative with
Revlon, was on a business trip in Manhattan when, his daughter
said, he saw a line outside a Greenwich Village ``head shop,'' one
of the small stores that sold incense and fragrances, hashish
pipes, hookahs and other accouterments of the psychedelic set.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp learned that the crowd had been attracted by a very sweet
fragrance called musk oil, which was being touted by word of mouth
among the countercultural set as having unusual powers of sexual
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took home a vial and went to a fragrance house and
developed the musk,'' Ms. Shipp said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp left Revlon and, along with an entrepreneur, Bernard
Mitchell, founded a corporation to market an inexpensive synthetic
musk that he patented and called Jovan Musk.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Illinois Racing News last year, Shipp, who
was prominent in horse circles in the last two decades, recalled:
``We put copy on the package with a lot of inferences but nothing
really concrete. And the thing just took off.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's annual sales surged from $1 million at the
beginning of the 1970s to more than $85 million by the end of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   After selling the operation, buying it back and then selling it
again, Shipp stayed in the fragrance business, supplying scents to
Walgreen's, Wal-Mart and other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Jovan Musk is now made by Coty Inc., which is part of Joh. K.
Benckiser G.m.b.H., the European conglomerate better known for
Calgon and other laundry and household cleaning products.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Shipp was linked to thoroughbred horse
racing and breeding more than to fragrances. His love for racing
came about when he was recovering from a heart attack just after
turning 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the reading matter my wife would buy me was The Daily
Racing Form,'' Shipp said in the interview. ``I started to dope out
the races, and the next day I would get to see how I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Shipp bred and raced numerous horses, winning
hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money. ``I would say I am
behind in the game,'' he said. ``But I can't put a figure on the
enjoyment I've gotten out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipp was born May 1, 1937, in Paterson, N.J. He graduated from
the University of Illinois and joined Revlon as a sales trainee.
Eventually, he became the company's Midwest sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, Shipp is survived by his wife, Mary
Ellen, and two sons, Gregg Shipp and Drew Shipp, all of Chicago.
