<HEADLINE> EC to Send Election Observer Team to Bangladesh during Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- European Commission (EC), an
important development partner of Bangladesh, has decided to send
an election observer team comprising some 26 observers from its 15
member states during the polls, the United News of Bangladesh (UNB)
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to UNB chief correspondent, leading members of EU
parliament and bureaucrats at the EC Headquarters in Brussels
hinted that they were keeping a close eye on the situation in
South Asian nations, including Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching political situation and waiting to see the
outcome of the upcoming general elections with much interest,"
said Thomas Mann, member of the Group of the European People's
Party (Christian Democrat) in the EU Parliament.
</P>
<P>
While reshaping their trading relations with Bangladesh in a
new context, the union of European nations would "like to see
improved human-rights condition in the country", Thomas added.
</P>
<P>
Sandro Serrato, an official at the EC Headquarters who looks
after affairs with Bangladesh, said they were worried over the
confrontational politics wherein streets are used more than
parliament to show political disagreement.
</P>
<P>
" We're urging both the government and the opposition to try to
use more democratic tools to resolve their differences," he said,
adding those problems should be settled through dialogue, instead
of hartals (destructive strikes) and other violent manifestations.
</P>
<P>
On May 22 this year, Bangladesh and EC signed the cooperation
agreement in Brussels for broader interactions in political,
economic, trade, environmental, scientific and cultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The EC official pointed out that the essential elements of the
agreement envisaged democratic principles and human rights.
</P>
<P>
For proper implementation of the agreement, a joint commission
would be set up comprising senior officials from both sides,
Serrato said.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki to Attend Nigeria's 40th Anniversary of Independence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mbeki, accompanied by five cabinet ministers and a strong
business delegation, is due to fly into the most populous country
in Africa shortly before midnight on Saturday for a four-day visit,
which both countries see as an opportunity to boost their growing
relationship.
</P>
<P>
After Nigeria, the South African president will visit Senegal
and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
South African officials in Nigeria said the visit will be aimed
at generating trade and investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki stayed in Nigeria for several years in the 1970s when he
was African National Congress (ANC) representative and has
retained strong links with the country since he was inaugurated as
president of South Africa, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first events on Sunday are expected to be linked to the
Nigerian independence celebrations, marking 40 years since the end
of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The total two-way trade, standing at just 730 million rand (104
million U.S. dollars) in 1998, has jumped to 1.7 billion rand (242
million dollars) in 1999 because of increased Nigerian oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two countries started regular meetings to
discuss ways of encouraging trade that South African officials say
is growing from a low base.

<HEADLINE> S. African Local Government Election Postponed  </HEADLINE>

<P>
South African Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney
Mufamadi said in Pretoria the committee is expected to start its
tasks on Monday "as the work is very urgent".
</P>
<P>
"An announcement of the date of local government elections will
be deferred pending the completion of the work of the committee,"
said Mufamadi after meeting traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Traditional leaders are unhappy with changes to municipal
demarcation, saying it erodes their powers. Their gripe is that
their powers will be diminished when rural land is assimilated
into proposed new municipal areas.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the new boundaries, the number of municipalities in
South Africa will be reduced from 845 to around 285 and some cut
across tribal land.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of National Council of Traditional Leaders
Mpiyezintombi Mzimela said: "I was happy, together with other
traditional leaders at the outcome of the meeting."
</P>
<P>
"As long as we are engaged in these negotiations in the spirit
that was demonstrated during today's meeting, I'm hopeful that we
are going to get somewhere and find a positive solution to the
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said president Mbeki has assured traditional leaders
that the government intends to enhance their role at local
government level and not to diminish it.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the committee will determine whether the
new municipal structures will impact negatively on the role of
traditional leadership under the new boundaries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Party Plans Mass Action to Remove Mugabe from Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing about 20,000 supporters celebrating MDC's first
anniversary at Rufaro stadium in Harare, Tsvangirai said the form
and date of the mass action would be announced after a national
executive meeting next week, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to tell Mugabe today is to go peacefully. if you
don't want to go we will remove you violently," Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
Later he told reporters that by "violently" he meant the action
would be "intense this time".
</P>
<P>
When he was Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions, Tsvangirai arranged successful mass stayaways to protest
against the high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
"We can't wait for 2002 presidential elections to remove him
from power," he said."We cannot allow him to destroy what is
left now."
</P>
<P>
He accused the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf) led by Mugabe for causing the economic problems
that had befallen the country.
</P>
<P>
He added the time had come to say no to poverty, election
rigging, involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo war and
isolating Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
 He said his party's anniversary is a historic occasion and an
enduring revolution of the people. Although the party had been
subjected to violence in the past few months, it is growing from
strength to strength.
</P>
<P>
The MDC won 57 seats in the June parliamentary election, while
the ruling Zanu-pf got 62 seats.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Steps to End Bloodshed in Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Saturday called for
urgent measures to end the bloodshed in the Palestinian
territories, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt was deeply concerned with the negative developments in
the Palestinian areas, with Palestinian people continuing to fall
prey to violence," Osama El-Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's
political advisor, said after seeing off Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at Cairo airport.
</P>
<P>
"What is important now is to deal with the current situation in
a way to ensure a halt to the bloodletting" in clashes between
Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces in the
Palestinian areas, El-Baz told MENA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier in the day to brief Mubarak on the
worsening situation in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
he said, adding that "such acts as use of live ammunition by
Israeli forces were likely to lead to an uncontrollable situation."
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted Thursday in Jerusalem as the Palestinians
protested against the visit by Israeli right-wing Likud leader
Ariel Sharon to a holy site in East Jerusalem, known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary. The waves of protests later spread to the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said Mubarak is making contacts with all parties
concerned in the Mideast peace process, including the Israeli
government, in an effort to stem further deterioration of the
current situation.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader held a telephone conversation with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Saturday and deplored the tense
situation in the Palestinian areas and the negative impact on the
Mideast peace process, MENA said.

<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's First Vice President Hassan Habibi on Saturday
officially opened the 26th Tehran International Trade Fair at the
permanent international fairs ground.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 countries from around the world are putting on
display their latest technical and industrial achievements and
products, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of senior commercial and trade officials of
different countries have arrived here for the fair, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's trade deficit in the 1999/2000 fiscal year
which ended on June 30 dropped to 11.474 billion U.S. dollars, down
9.5 percent from that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to an increase of 43.7 percent in
exports, whose volume rose from 4.445 billion dollars in the
1998/1999 fiscal year to 6.388 billion dollars, said a monthly
economic release issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign
Trade. Meanwhile, the import volume reached to 17.861 billion
dollars from
17 billion dollars in the 1998/1999 fiscal year, up 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Central Bank of Lebanon has injected 250-300
million U.S. dollars from its foreign reserves to meet the growing
market demand over the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The national currency stabilized at 1,415 Lebanon pounds for one

dollar thanks to the Central Bank injections.
</P>
<P>
The bank had to interfere by offering more dollars to protect
the Lebanon pound against the dollar amid lapses over the formation

of the next cabinet, which prompted many depositors to transfer
their
money into dollars over the period.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi government has asked private companies to
raise their employment of local citizens to at least 25 percent of
their
workforce next year in an effort to cope with the rising number of
Saudi job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs has ordered private
firms to employ over 20 more local staff as of October, the
beginning of the next fiscal year in Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Syria have signed
an agreement to further promote cooperation in the information
sector, the National News Agency of Lebanon (NNA) reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed here Friday by the information ministers
of the two countries, is an outgrowth of the 1991 Lebanese-Syrian
Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination Agreement, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It provides for exchanging documentaries and news reports
between the two countries' state-run televisions, radios and news
agencies.
</P>
<P>
It also encourages the public and private media in the two
countries to conduct joint production projects and exchange
audiovisual engineering expertise.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the two countries will coordinate their media
ventures with their foreign counterparts and develop mutual efforts
for reaching out to all Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to step up efforts to end "injustice"
in each country's advertising sector, said the report, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Information Minister Anwar Khalil said that the signing
of the agreement will help the two countries to counter the
fabrications of Zionist media.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Syrian Minister of Information Adnan Omran said
the two countries had no plan to combat the cultural impacts of
normalizing ties with Israel in the event of realizing peace with
the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Condemns Israeli Attacks on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said on Saturday that the recent surge of violence between
Israeli security forces and Palestinian protestors in Jerusalem
amply testified Israel's barbarity.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the Arab character of the holy city of Jerusalem has
become a pan-Arab duty and demand, the National News Agency of
Lebanon (NNA) quoted Hoss as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people living in the Israeli-occupied areas are
ready to sacrifice anything dear to them in order to reclaim their
national rights, said the minister, whose country currently hosts
estimated 350,000 Palestinian refugees in 12 camps.
</P>
<P>
Hoss urged the international community, including the major
super powers, to move swiftly to stop renewed Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Arab nations to join forces and exercise
solidarity in facing up to Zionist threats.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli forces unleashed by
Israeli right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon's visit to a holy site
in East Jerusalem, sacred to both Jews and Muslims, entered its
third day Saturday, leaving at least 15 Palestinians dead and
hundreds injured.
</P>
<P>
The holy area, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims
as Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, is the site of Jewish
temple and home to Islamic shrines Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa
mosque that were built on the site of the Jewish temple.
</P>
<P>
The waves of protests later spread to the West Bank and Gaza,
where nine Palestinians, including two Palestinian policemen, were
killed Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leaders Try to Curb Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders contacted
Saturday parties concerned to try to stop the violent clashes
between the Palestinians and Israeli forces that have left 15
people dead and hundreds injured.
</P>
<P>
The clashes ignited by hawkish opposition leader Ariel Sharon's
visit to a hotly contested holy site in East Jerusalem entered its
third day Saturday and have spread from Jerusalem to the West Bank
and Gaza. Nine Palestinians, including two teenagers, have been
confirmed killed Saturday in the West Bank and Gaza, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The holy area, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims
as al-Haram al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, is the site of the
destroyed Jewish temple as well as Judaism's most sacred shrine and
home to Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest
shrine in Islam.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reportedly held phone talks
directly with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat after the outbreak
of the violence. He demanded Arafat take practical and effective
steps to prevent the situation from further deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Barak also spoke to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who held
talks with Arafat in Cairo on Saturday, by telephone and briefed
him on the situation, asking him to urge the Palestinian leadership
to call for restraint so as not to endanger the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's Office said the prime minister
told Mubarak that Israel has been showing "maximum restraint," but
the state is determined to preserve public order in the territories
and protect the lives and safety of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the Palestinians take unilateral actions,
Israel will surely respond accordingly. Finally, he hoped that the
peace contacts between Israel and the Palestinians will continue
and bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli acting Foreign Minister and Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami contacted Arafat, making it clear to the
Palestinian leader that any attempt for short-term political gain
cannot make up for losses, according to Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami also exchanged ideas with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and his counterparts of Turkey, Sweden, Italy,
Jordan, Britain, Germany and Spain. Speaking at a news conference
on Saturday, Albright urged both sides to refrain from taking
counter-productive measures.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Barak's security adviser, said in an interview with
Israel Radio that the Israeli leadership took these riots as "very
serious," and he urged Palestinian leaders to control and contain
its people and forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the disputes should be left to negotiations and
dialogue, not to fire exchange. But he stressed that Israel still
believes that basic intentions of Palestinian leaders are pro-
peace.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that there is still a possibility to resume the peace
negotiations once the violence has died down. "I really hope the
peace process won't be hurt, but I can't be sure," said Yatom.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces had extended the ban, which was
announced on Friday, on Israeli citizens from entrance into all
Palestinian self-rule territories until further notice.

Speaking at the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Commission
Consultative Conference in Sandton, Johannesburg, Mboweni said the
prolonged political oppression of blacks from segregation to
apartheid which aimed at taking away rights from them has led to

He also noted that the commission has not done its homework
properly because it blame the present government for the current
situation most blacks are in.
</P>
<P>
"Apartheid has left nothing against us but hatred where we do
not believe that a black person can run a company successfully. If
we can not support and trust one another, it is impossible that we
will achieve the goals that we want," he said.

Mboweni further said the Reserve Bank has to play its role by
providing the commission with the right services in order to make

<HEADLINE> U.S., EU Reach Agreement to Delay Sanctions in Trade Tax Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
European Union (EU) reached agreement Saturday to delay imposition
of economic sanctions against the United States in a trade dispute
involving tax breaks for American exports, the Clinton
administration said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached before a midnight Saturday deadline
for overhauling the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) scheme
which the World Trade Organization (WTO) earlier this year found
to be an illegal export subsidy in a case filed by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Created to offset an EU tax rebate for its exporters, the FSC
program permits U.S. companies to reduce income taxes by 15
percent through export subsidiaries set up in offshore tax havens
such as Barbados and the Virgin Islands. Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors are only a few of the 6,000 companies that get the
4.1-billion-U.S.-dollar annual tax break.
</P>
<P>
Under the procedural agreement, U.S. Congress will have until
November 1 to pass the legislation to replace the FSC scheme. The
EU agreed not to impose any penalties until a separate WTO panel
can rule on whether the new legislation complies with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and the European Union today demonstrated a
commitment to avoid escalating trans-Atlantic trade tensions and
managing this WTO trade dispute responsibly," U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Despite White House pressure and an overwhelming favorable vote
in the House on the legislation, Senate Democrats blocked attempts
this week by Republican leaders to bring the bill up for debate.
The dispute centers on Republican efforts to limit amendments and
Democrats' insistence on their rights to offer them.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott expressed frustration at the
blocking tactics after he tried to bring the tax measure to the
floor Thursday. He expressed the hope that the Senate would be
able to pass the proposal "in the next few days."

GAZA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Nine Palestinians, including two

Palestine National Council Chairman Salem Zanoun said that six

Meanwhile, 523 Palestinians, 318 in the West Bank and 205 in Gaza,
were also injured by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The deaths raised to 15 the number of Palestinians killed in
three days' of violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, clashes have spread to nearly all the Jewish
settlements. Palestinian demonstrators hurled stones at Israeli
soldiers, who responded by firing rubber-coated metal bullets as
well as live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Fire exchange between Israeli soldiers and the Palestinian
police and some armed Palestinians are going on at the Jewish
settlement of Netzarim in the center of Gaza, where the most
violent clashes took place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah, protests and
clashes are also continuing.
</P>
<P>
Israel military has closed the Erez checkpoint, barring the
Palestinians from leaving and Israeli settlers entering the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership has declared Saturday the "day of
mourning" for the five Palestinians killed Friday in clashes with
Israeli security forces at the holy site known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, or Nobel
Sanctuary, in the walled Old City of Jerusalem, and called for a
general strike.
</P>
<P>
The widespread clashes that started on Thursday were ignited by
hard-line opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon's visit to the
Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
The holy compound, the site of destroyed Jewish temples, is the
most sacred place for Jews and the Wailing Wall, where Jews pray
and mourn, is the only remaining part of the Second Jewish Temple
that was built on the ruins of the First Temple and destroyed by
Romans in 70 A.D..
</P>
<P>
The site also houses Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque, the
third holiest shrine in Islam. Sovereignty over the holy site is
the chief obstacle to a Palestinian-Israeli peace deal. For now,
the Waqf, an Islamic organization has autonomy in administering the
day-to-day affairs of the area while Israeli police remain in
charge of security.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership condemned the escalating violence at
a cabinet meeting on Friday and vowed not to give up the
sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided"
capital while the Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem, seized
and by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israeli leading newspaper the Jerusalem Post said
that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had said for the first time
that Jerusalem and al-Qods, the Arabic name for the Holy City, will
be side by side capitals of Israel and a future Palestinian state
under a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
But he did not said which parts make up the "Palestinian
capital" and the violence is widely believed to cloud the already
tough talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The blood supply of the
United States continues to be woefully low, American Red Cross
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two of the Red Cross regional offices are now on appeal,
which means they have a one-day supply or less of blood,according
to a new USA Today report.
</P>
<P>
"By all estimates the blood shortage appears to be as serious
as the Red Cross has experienced," the newspaper quoted U.S. Red
Cross president Bernadine Healy as saying,
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the national inventory of blood is 80,000 units, but
Healy said only 36,000 units are available and that is critically
low.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, the Red Cross has asked hospitals in
Atlanta, Philadelphia and Los Angeles to postpone or cancel
elective surgery that requires O-positive blood in an attempt to
save blood for patients who need lifesaving surgeries. O-positive
is the only type of blood that can be given to people of all blood
types.

<HEADLINE> HK Operates as Separate Customs Territory, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has continued to
operate effectively and efficiently as a separate customs
territory after its return to the motherland in 1997, said a
senior official.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner of Customs and Excise John Tsang Chun-wah made
the remark when delivering a speech on "Hong Kong - A Separate
Customs Territory : A Myth or Reality?" at a luncheon organized by
the New American Foundation in Washington, DC. Tsang is currently
in the United States for a 10-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the concept
of "one country, two systems", the people of Hong Kong enjoy a
high degree of autonomy and independent executive, legislative and
judicial powers, including that of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we are able to manage everything for ourselves except
for matters concerning foreign affairs and national defense which
are the responsibilities of the central government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang explained that the Hong Kong Customs had played the role
in maintaining Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory
in three areas, namely boundary enforcement, control of strategic
commodities and participation in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Hong Kong Customs had been maintaining close
cooperation with its overseas counterparts and other law
enforcement agencies, especially its counterparts on China's
mainland, to enhance the effectiveness of the control system.
</P>
<P>
The central government of China was totally supportive of Hong
Kong's special status and had stated clearly that all state organs
in Hong Kong had to abide by the Basic Law and all Hong Kong laws,
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
On the participation in international organizations, Tsang said,
"Hong Kong is a founding member of the World Trade Organization
serving under the name of Hong Kong, China, having been a member
of the GATT for some years. This position will not change even
with the entry of China into the world body."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to strive to uphold Hong Kong's trading
integrity and safeguard the faithful implementation of the 'one
country, two systems' concept," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Deplores Bloody Clashes in Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has deplored the ongoing clashes between the Palestinians and
Israeli security forces in Palestinians' protests over holy
religious site in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak received a telephone call from Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak on Saturday and exchanged views with him the bloody
clashes in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader deplored the negative impact of the
violence, which went into the third consecutive day Saturday, on
the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted in Jerusalem after Palestinian people
protested against the visit by Israeli right-wing Likud leader
Ariel Sharon to Muslims' Al-Haram Al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary)
in the holy city early Thursday. At least six Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli forces and over 200 others wounded in the
clashes, which also spread to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haram Al-Sharif, also known to the Jews as the Temple Mount,
houses al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, Islam's third
holiest site. The Israelis say it is the site of an ancient Jewish
temple, the most sacred shrine of the Judaism. The control of
sovereignty over the area lies at the core of the Palestinian-
Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Egyptian government blamed Israel for the
violence. Mubarak's office said in a statement that Egypt "deplores
the bloody violence triggered by the Israelis who are not concerned
to reach peace" with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It added that Egypt regrets that the clashes occurred at a
moment when all parties are making efforts to overcome obstacles
hindering the peace negotiations between the Palestinians and the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace process, called on Israel to
take all measures to ensure that this sort of incidents are not
repeated so that the process can move forward.

<P>
PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Gilles Panizzi of France
extended his Tour of Corsica lead by taking the first two stages
of the second leg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Panizzi, still to win a world rally championship event in his
20th attempt, moved 10.7 seconds clear of Peugeot teammate and
compatriot Francois Delecour as heavy overnight rain made
conditions treacherous.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Carlos Sainz finished the ninth stage in third place
overall, more than 30 seconds adrift of Panizzi as the leading
pair continued to dominate the 11th round of the championship.
</P>
<P>
There are three more stages before the drivers complete the
second leg.
</P>
<P>
Richard Burns of Britain failed to get enough grip on the wet
asphalt roads as he struggled to stay on the pace of the leaders
in his Subaru,beginning the second half of the event more than a
minute adrift.
</P>
<P>
Championship leader Marcus Gronholm moved up to seventh spot in
his Peugeot after fellow Finn Tommi Makinen lost three minutes
when he damaged his brake pipe on the ninth run.
</P>
<P>
The eighth had been cancelled for safety reasons because of the
large number of spectators who gathered during the stage.

SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion the United
States retained their title by beating host Australia 76-54 in the
women basketball finals at the Sydney Olympic Games here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The All-around America was a better side, leading all the way
throughout the game and turning the expected tough game into an
exhibition show.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth gold medals for the United States women's
hoopsters since women basketball was introduced into the modern
Olympics in 1976.  The silver medals was the best results in
Olympic Games for the Australians girls, who won one bronze one in
the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Saturday's afternoon, Brazil fought from behind to
edge South Korea 84-73 in overtime for the bronze medal. South
Korea finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
From the fifth to 12th placing in the Sydney women's basketball
tournament were France, Russia, Slovakia, Poland, Cuba, Canada,
New Zealand and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Lauren Jackson scored a game high 20 points for the Aussies but
could not prevent the America, led by Lisa Leslie and Natalie
Williams identical contribution of 15 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by a low first half shooting percentage of 28.9%,
Australia struggled to contain the USA's transition game
throughout the match and even 13 points effort from Jackson could
not stop the Americans from jumping to a 43-30 lead at the
interval.
</P>
<P>
The host team continued to shoot poorly in the second half and
an injury to starting point guard Kristi Harrower and foul
troubles for other key players ruined the Aussie attempts to fight
back.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team also received huge contribution from forward
Yolanda Griffith who had 13 points and 12 rebounds. The tougher U.
S. girls out-rebounded their rivals 48-27.

an agreement: Montreal will train a group of officials who will be

The move represents the two cities' first action in accordance

What cities should think about for their future is to avoid
worldwide disasters by cooperating with each other, he said.

In fact, the future of human society depends on the development

<P>
Before 1949 there was no bridge across the Yangtze River. Since
October 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was opened and the
train ferry service stopped operation at Wuhan Port and was
transferred to Wuhu.
</P>
<P>
Wuhu Train Ferry became the only of its kind in the country in
September 1968 when Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Railways said that each ceasing
of train ferry services on the Yangtze River represents a new leap
forward in China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, the train ferry operations at Wuhu Port
have each year shipped more than 300,000 carriages.
</P>
<P>
However the ferry could not meet the growing demands.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the State Council enlisted the Wuhu Yangtze River
Bridge Project into China's ninth five-year plan, which cost 4.6
billion yuan (554 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bridge, consisting of six kilometers of road bridge and 10
kilometers of railway bridge, will benefit China's road and
railroad networks to connect the north and the south and improve
the shipping capacity on the Yangtze River, said Wang Mingzhen,
vice-mayor of Wuhu.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Attacks on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi here on Saturday blasted the recent
attacks on Palestinians by Israeli security forces at a religious
holy site in Jerusalem, terming the Israeli act as "crime."
</P>
<P>
"The recent crime committed by the Zionist regime is consistent
with its aggressive and expansionist policies to gain international
recognition of its claim to sovereignty over the holy Islamic
places," Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Seven Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded on
Friday
during clashes with Israeli security forces at the holy site known
to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out following a visit to the religious shrine
by Ariel Sharon, the hawkish leader of Israel's right-wing Likud
party.
</P>
<P>
While Israel negotiates peace with the Palestinian side, it
violently assaults the Palestinians, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The recent violence demonstrated that Israel will push for the
acceptance of its expansionist policies, including the "
Judaization" of Jerusalem, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Lawmaker Killed in Road Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A pro-reform member of Iran's
Majlis (parliament) was killed early Saturday in a road accident,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Qodratollah Nazarinia, a lawmaker representing the Kangavar
constituency in the western province of Kermanshah, died on the
spot when his car turned over and fell off the highway.
</P>
<P>
He was driving back to Tehran from his hometown when the tragedy
happened, unofficial sources was quoted as saying. Traffic officers
blamed the fatal accident on the bad condition of the road, which
was slippery at the time.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a funeral service for the deceased will
take place on Sunday in front of the parliament building in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Majlis, which started work in May, is dominated by
reformers who won an overwhelming victory over the conservatives in
February's election.

<HEADLINE> Local People Own More Projects Than Foreigners in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanians have
registered more projects in the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC)
than foreigners have since the country practiced a free economy in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,537 projects registered between September 1990 and
June this year, 718 projects are owned by Tanzanians, 321 by
foreigners and the rest 498 are joint ventures. The total
investment amounted to some 6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing tops the list by a total of 725 projects,
while agriculture and livestock come second with 117 projects --
65 being new and 52 expanded or rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
However, the total value of investment in agriculture is not
substantial, ranking the seventh out of 13 sectors.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania expects the foreign investment in the next five years
to exceed 5 billion dollars, more than double the 2.5 billion
dollars recorded in the last five years, as the country is opening
more investment projects in agriculture, industry, mining, tourism
and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The country has agreed in principle to approve the
establishment of Economic Processing Zones to revitalize
industries like textile to produce quality goods for export.

<P>
MACAO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Chamber of Commerce (
MCC), the most influential business body in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, hosted a party Saturday
afternoon to mark the 51st founding anniversary of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
MCC Chairman Ma Man Kei said at the party that it is of special
significance that the National Day is the first one since Macao's
return to the motherland last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the past half century, the outlook of China
has shown tremendous changes under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China and with the hard work of people of various ethnic
groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the reform and opening-up over the past two
decades have brought about all-round prosperity and the standard
of living of the people has been raised remarkably, he said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the strong momentum of development of the motherland,
the Macao SAR was founded nine months ago. "We are pleased to see
that the SAR has a good beginning and the SAR government
administers the region in accordance with the Macao Basic Law," Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the party were also Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief
executive of the Macao SAR, and Wang Qiren, director of the
Liaison Office of the Central Government in the Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> Last Train Ferry on Yangtze River Cease Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's last train ferry on the
Yangtze River at Wuhu in east China's Anhui Province will cease
operation today with the inauguration of traffic opening on the
new Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Gazing at the last batches of trains across the Yangtze River
and a new two-tier bridge , Zhu Weimin, director of Wuhu
Administration of Train Ferry Services said, "The last train ferry
will disappear in the country."
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old director has worked at the train ferry on the
Yangtze River for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that although he will transfer to other shipping
services in railway sector, he was very proud of Wuhu Yangtze
River Bridge, which is a low-tower stayed-cable bridge for both
road and railroad traffic with a 312-meter main span, the largest
of its kind in China and in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Before 1949 there was no bridge across the Yangtze River. Since
October 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was opened and the
train ferry service stopped operation at Wuhan Port and was
transferred to Wuhu.
</P>
<P>
Wuhu Train Ferry became the only of its kind in the country in
September 1968 when Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Railways said that each ceasing
of train ferry services on the Yangtze River represents a new leap
forward in China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, the train ferry operations at Wuhu Port
have each year shipped more than 300,000 carriages.
</P>
<P>
However the ferry could not meet the growing demands.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the State Council enlisted the Wuhu Yangtze River
Bridge Project into China's Ninth Five-Year Plan and the bridge,
which cost 46 billion yuan (about 5 billion U.S. dollars) opened
to traffic today.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, consisting of 6 kilometers of road bridge and 10
kilometers of railway bridge, will benefit China's road and
railroad networks to connect the north and the south and improve
the shipping capacity on the Yangtze River, said Wang Mingzhen,
vice-mayor of Wuhu.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Denounces Sharon's Visit to Al-Aqsa Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has strongly
condemned the visit to Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israel's
right-wing opposition Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon, and the
Israeli attacks against Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) Saturday quoted a Saudi official
as terming the visit conducted by Sharon on Thursday as "
provocative and a challenge to the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The official said the visit was also a "challenge to the whole
Islamic nations' feelings and violation to the holiness of the
Islamic holy sites."
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the attacks by the Israeli security forces,
which ended in scores of Palestinian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Sharon who was accompanied by six Israeli Knesset
(Parliament) members triggered violent clashes on Friday in which
five Palestinians were killed and over 200 people injured.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said Riyadh called on the international
community to take necessary measures to protect the holy sites.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Saudi position that a comprehensive and just
peace will not be achieved without the implementation of the
international resolutions regarding the rights of the Palestinian
people including the announcement of their independent state.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Plane With Deputy PM on Board Concludes Symbolic Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Yemeni plane, which
arrived in the Iraqi capital Friday afternoon, left here Saturday
after concluding a 20-hour symbolic visit to show solidarity with
the sanction-hit country.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader
Bajammal, who led the 70-member high-level delegation, told
reporters at the airport that the visit was "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Yemen will resume flights to Iraq, Bajammal
said:"We will work with all other Arab countries to achieve this
aim."
</P>
<P>
Issues such as bilateral relations and the efforts to end the
sanctions were discussed in his talks with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who came to the Saddam International Airport to see the
Yemen delegation off, condemned the attempts by the United States
to obstruct planes flying to Iraq and called on other countries to
fly planes to Iraq in defiance of the U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, a foreign plane carrying passengers will
come to Iraq, Aziz said, without identifying the name of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Russia has announced that it will resume regular civil flights
to and from Iraq sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent the first plane to Iraq just one day after the
Saddam International Airport in the western suburb of the Iraqi
capital was reopened on August 17.
</P>
<P>
Russia, along with France, will send more planes to Iraq. While
India, Iceland, and other Arab countries including Sudan, Syria and
Lebanon are pondering the possibility of flying planes here to show
solidarity with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain maintain that all flights to or from Iraq
must get permission from the United Nations Sanctions Committee,
but Russia and France do not think the authorization is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the air embargo, triggered by its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, claiming that no U.N.resolution banning
humanitarian or civil flights to or from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Begins Talks With Mubarak Amid Violence in Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Saturday morning after he
arrived here amid spreading waves of violence in the Palestinian
self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in Mubarak's private residence, instead
of the presidential palace in northeastern Cairo, where such talks
are usually held. Reporters have no access to Mubarak's residence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Mubarak on the bloody clashes between the
Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli security forces in Jerusalem,
in which at least seven Palestinians were killed and 220 wounded in
the past two days, Palestinian representative to the Arab League
Mohammad Sobeih has said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian demonstrations were sparked by a visit to Al-
Haram Al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary), also known to the Jews as
the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem by Israeli right-wing Likud leader
Ariel Sharon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haram Al-Sharif houses al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the
Rock, Islam's third holiest site. The Israelis say it is the site
of an ancient Jewish temple, the most sacred shrine of the Judaism.
The control of sovereignty over the site lies at the core of the
stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also update Mubarak on the talks between Palestinian
and Israeli negotiators in Washington from Wednesday to Friday,
Sobeih was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been reported in the Washington talks.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Convince MILF to Hold Peace Talks Inside Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it will convince the Moro Islamic Liberation Front(
MILF) to change its mind and resume peace talks with the
government inside the country.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada, in his latest move to help accelerate
peace and development in the southern island of Mindanao, has
offered amnesty to MILF members and supporters who committed
crimes in furtherance of their political beliefs, National
Security Advisor Alexander Aquirre said in a press release issued
by the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Estrada announced the grant of amnesty on Friday, but the
amnesty,still to be approved by the congress, is not for those who
have committed crimes such as kidnapping, massacre or torture of
civilians, and rape for personal ends.
</P>
<P>
Aquirre said the president has already proven the government's
sincerity in pursuing the peace process by accepting the MILF's
compliance with his two conditions that the group should renounce
terrorism and recognize autonomy as the political solution to the
Mindanao insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Estrada had earlier set three conditions for talks with the
MILF.The third condition is that MILF rebels must lay down their
arms.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF, which has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao for more than two decades,
has suspended peace talks with the government after the military
overran its headquarters in Maguindanao, Mindanao, in early July
this year.
</P>
<P>
The secessionist group also demanded that peace talks, if to be
resumed, be held in a third country. The government has repeatedly
rejected the demand, stressing that peace in Mindanao is an
internal concern that needs to be threshed out inside Philippine
territory.
</P>
<P>
"We removed our conditions, and now they are the ones imposing
conditions. We will convince them that it is better to hold the
peace talks in the Philippines. This is an internal affair. It's
also easy and economical to hold the talks here," Aquirre said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the government sees no hindrance from the
congress in giving amnesty to MILF rebels as Senate President
Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Manuel Villar have already
expressed their approval of the measure during a meeting of the
National Security Council held last week.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Defuse Tension in Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
will take repressive actions to defuse resurgent communal tensions
in Maluku Province, Pattimura Military Region chief Brig. Gen. I
Made Yasa told reporters in Ambon, capital of Maluku, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I warn the public that we, the military, will stop pursuing
the persuasive way. This means, whoever is seen illegally carrying
weapons will be disarmed without forewarning. If the person
concerned resists, he will be arrested," Yasa was quoted by the
Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In view of the rising tensions between groups of people of
different religions, the military would now break up any
concentration of more than 10 people at one place.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Saleh Latuconsina, administrator of the Maluku Civil
Emergency, had ordered the military to shift from the persuasive
to repressive ways in line with legal procedures to reduce
tensions in Maluku and North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Maluku Civil Emergency administrator has
announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Maluku saw nearly two years of communal bloodshed involving
Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of lives from both sides were claimed and hundreds of
thousands took refuge in neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
The central government has imposed a civilian emergency in the
province since June this year in a bid to put an end to the
bloodshed which has raised international concerns.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Increases Gasoline Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Saturday
announced a gasoline price increase of 9.1 percent effective
October 1, Sunday.

The Malaysian government spends more than 1 billion ringgit (
260 million U.S. dollars) on the subsidy due to the price hike.
</P>

billion ringgit (390 million dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military: Abu Sayyaf Rebels Still in Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police and military
officials said the Abu Sayyaf remains holed up in the southern
province of Sulu despite the group's reported claims that it has
slipped out of the province.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is feeling the pressure and is venting its
frustrations on civilians, Esteban Conejos, undersecretary of the
National Defense Department, said on a program of the ABS-CBN news
channel.
</P>
<P>
"The military believes the Abu Sayyaf leaders are still in Sulu
along with their victims but they have splintered into small
groups.The situation is ongoing, the pressure is finally taking
its toll on the enemy as it keeps moving away from the military,"
Conejos said.
</P>
<P>
The military, which launched attacks on the rebels in the
island of Jolo, Sulu, on September 16 to rescue their 19 hostages,
has increased its troops in the island to 5,000 to pursue the
fleeing rebels.
</P>
<P>
Two French journalists were able to escape and were rescued by
the military as a result of the assault. The rebels still have 17
hostages in their hands, including one American and three
Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Conejos said the rebels have resorted to stealing food from
residents for sustenance as they flee the military assault in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
He added that patrol boats of the Philippine Navy continue to
surround Sulu and prevent the rebels from leaving.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the country's police chief, Panfilo Lacson, said
the farthest the rebels can go would be neighboring Basilan
Province "if they break through the cordon."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is like a cat-and-mouse game. But the time will
come when the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) catches up
with the Abu Sayyaf and rescues the hostages and destroys the
bandit group," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military, which earlier said the operations would end in a
week's time, has admitted that it underestimated the Abu Sayyaf's
capability when it first launched the assault.

KIEV, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris
Tarasyuk has lodged a protest against the U.S. and Canadian
ambassadors to Kiev and the representative of the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in Ukraine over their
alleged interference in Ukraine's internal affairs, the Interfax-
Ukraine news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk, who was reportedly sacked by President Leonid Kuchma
Friday evening, made the protest on Friday at a meeting with the U.
S. and Canadian envoys and the EBRD representative, under a
directive of Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter to Kuchma recently, the U.S. and Canadian
envoys and the EBRD representative said they "felt uneasy" over
Ukraine's planned modifications to its budget for the next year
and that created an impression of "retroversion" in the country's
reforms, according to news reports here.

SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Lisa Leslie and Natalie
Williams each scored 15 points as the United States defeated
hosts Australia 76-54 in women's basketball final at the Sydney
Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth time in the past five Games that the Americans
won the event.
</P>
<P>
Since starting their domination in 1984 at Los Angeles, the US
women have lost only three games in Olympic competition and
settled for less than gold only once, taking bronze in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It is also the best showing for the Australians at Olympics.
Their best achievement in the past Olympics was a bronze medal in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Swoopes added 14 points while Yolanda Griffith had 11
points for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Australia was paced by 20 points from 19-year-old center Lauren
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The Aussies trailed 43-30 at half-time but Kristi Harrower
sparked a run of eight consecutive points to pull the Opals to 45-
38 before injuring her left foot and leaving the game shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for third place earlier Saturday, Brazil, tied
by a desperate three-pointer in the dying seconds of regulation
play, stormed through overtime to beat South Korea 84-73 and
capture the bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> Tian Liang Wins Men's Platform Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tian Liang of China won China
the fifth diving gold after beating teammate Hu Jia in an exciting
contest at the Auqatic Center here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tian Liang totalled 724.53 points in the men's 10 meters
platform, beating Hu Jia to the second place at 713.55. Russian
Dmitri Saoutine finished third at 679.26.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth diving gold for China in these Olympic Games,
which saw the debut of the men's and women's synchronized diving
in both the platform and springboard events.
</P>
<P>
Tian Liang, who entered the final with the second highest score
of 201.45 points, jumped to the first place with a dive which gave
him 93.12 points.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't make his following two dives well and legged
behind Hu Jia, the last-minute replacement for injuried teammate
Huang Qiang.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jia scored 99.00 points in his third dive, a backword 3 1/2
somersaults at tuck position. He looked unbeatable at the time as
he led Tian Liang by more than 30 points.
</P>
<P>
But the first-time Olympian immediately dropped to the second
place when he collected only 51.84 points in his fourth dive.
Tian Liang took the chance to shrug off the pressure and dived to
the contest's highest of 101.52 points.
</P>
<P>
After the fourth round of hte final, it was clear that Chinese
divers would definitely sweep the top two places of the event as
they led Dmitri Saoutine by more than 50 and 30 points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Saoutine, the Olympic defending platform champion who only
managed a synchronized diving gold at the Sydney diving pool,
appeared tired and could not find his usual form which made him
the world's most successful diver in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Saoutine had only one 90s and three 80s from six dives. He
made mistakes in his third and fourth dives, collecting 67.32 and
77.22 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Saoutine took part in all the four men's events at the Sydney
Olympic Games. He won the men's 10m platform synchronzed diving
gold, beating Hu Jia and Tian Liang to the second place in that
event.
</P>
<P>
China pocketed five out of eight gold medals on offer at the
Olympics. Russia took two golds and the remaining one went to the
United States.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tian Liang completed China's
golden run with a gold medal from the men's 10m platform diving at
the Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tian garnered 724.53 points to win China's fifth diving gold,
beating his teammate Hu Jia by 10.98 points. Russian Dmitri
Saoutine was third with 679.26 points.
</P>
<P>
China, with little title chance tomorrow, has secured a spot in
the Top Three with 28 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before Tian Liang's victory, Chen Zhong snatched
China's first taekwondo title.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 17, overwhelmed Russian Natalia Ivanova 8-3 to win the
women's taekwondo over-67kg heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 world silver medalist steadily piled up points with
sharp kicks to beat the veteran 29-year-old Russian, who added the
Olympic silver to her collection of two silvers from the World Cup
and the world championships in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon, 0-2 down half-time and fielding a 16-year-old goal
keeper, won Africa's second straight Olympic soccer gold in a
penalty shoot-out over Spain.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria won in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States lifted their second consecutive gold in
Olympic women's basketball with a convincing 76-54 victory over
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Ahead by 43-30 at half-time, the United States allowed
Australia to fight back early in the second half to be within
seven points before the Americans regained control.
</P>
<P>
Cuba dominated in the boxing ring, winning all four of its
finals to go with a gold in volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones of the United States, who had hoped to win five
events here, was forced to settle for her second bronze in the
women's 4x100m.
</P>
<P>
By the time Jones got away on the anchor leg, even her
brilliant speed wasn't enough to make up a huge deficit, although
she was closing fast at the tape.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene, the fast man on the earth, had no such troubles
in winning his second gold of the Games as the U.S. anchor in the
men's 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
The United States also won the women's 4x400 meters.
</P>
<P>
Dutch woman Leontien Zijlaard continued her dominance of
women's cycling with her third gold, a 36-second victory in the
time trial. She earlier won the road race and 3,000 meters
individual pursuit, where she set a world record, and took silver
in the points race.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Yelena Yelesina ended a 10-year wait to claim the
Olympic high jump gold.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old mother last won a major title when she took the
European junior championship in 1989.
</P>
<P>
But the wait ended when she sailed over 2.01 meters at her
second attempt, beating South Africa's Hestrie Cloete, who also
clear 2.01 meters but had more failures at lower heights.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's Nouria Merah-Benida pulled off a stunning upset when
she won the women's 1,500 meters event.
</P>
<P>
Merah-Benida won in a slow four minutes 05.10 seconds ahead of
Violeta Szekely of Romania and her teammate Gabriela Szabo, who
added the bronze to her gold from the 5,000 meters earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Viacheslav Ekimov of Russia won the men's time trial ahead of
Jan Ullrich of Germany and Lance Armstrong of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russian 400 meters runner Svetlana Pospelova tested positive
for drugs in an out-of-competition test, International Olympic
Committee officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pospelova was found to have the banned steroid stanozolol,
according to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's
medical commission. She was not a medalist.
</P>
<P>
Pospelova had already returned to Russia when the medical
commission received the drug test result, de Merode said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC Executive Board meets on Sunday. However since the IOC
can only expel an athlete from the games and Pospelova has left
the country, the matter is expected to be turned over to the
international federation to consider the case and sanction.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia defeated Belarus on a
tie-break to win the rhythmic gymnastics team gold medal at the
Sydney Olympic Games on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia, bronze medallist in Atlanta where the team event made
its Olympic debut, finished level with Belarus on 39.500 points.
</P>
<P>
But the world champions were awarded the gold having obtained a
higher mark in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
Greece took the bronze at 39.283.
</P>
<P>
Greece, who had posted the top score in qualifying, appeared to
have their hopes of a medal disappear with a series of fumbled
catches during their club rotation.
</P>
<P>
Performing to Pink Floyd's "The Wall", the Greeks were twice
left chasing wayward clubs as they rolled around the mat,but still
managed to finish the first rotation in third place with a mark of
19.550, ahead of several other teams who had produced clean
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus finished the first rotation deadlocked at 19.
800 and then again scored identical marks of 19.700 on the second
rotation, the ribbons and hoops.
</P>
<P>
Missing from the competition were defending Olympic champions
Spain, who failed to qualify for the final.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia
regained her Olympic gold medal on Saturday when she won the
women's 10,000 meters race with an Olympic record time of 30:17.47
seconds, ahead of her teammate Gete Wami.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy. I want to congratulate the Ethiopian people
for supporting me," said Tulu, who won the gold in the 1992
Olympics in 31:06.02 in Barcelona, where she said she was 20.
</P>
<P>
Wami clocked 30:22.48 for the silver while Portugal's Fernanda
Ribeiro took the bronze in 30:22.88.
</P>
<P>
"In Barcelona I was very young, now I have a kid, but I am more
experienced. Fernanda and Tegla were not up in the competition,
the main competition was beween Ethiopians," the two-time Olympic
gold medalist said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic record setter followed the fast early pace of Paula
Radcliffe of Germany, who led the field under the Olympic record
pace from the start.  After three kilometers, the lead pack broke
away from the field and remained in order through 5km in 15:05.70.
</P>
<P>
Radcliffe continued to lead, but the pace dropped slightly with
successive kilometers of 3:05 and 3:06. The first change in order
came at 7.8km when Wami and Tulu passed Radcliffe. This however,
didn't split the group and Radcliffe rejoined them with three and
a half laps to go.
</P>
<P>
Tulu and Wami swept past Radcliffe at the bell. Tulu sprinted
clear from Wami and ran a 60.2 last lap.
</P>
<P>
Radcliffe finished fourth in 30:26.79 and Marathon world best
record holder Tegla Loroupe was fifth in 30:37.26.
</P>
<P>
"I knew five of six girls were very strong this year. I chose
the most difficult tactic. I knew it was going to be difficult, I
wanted to risk it to try and win the gold," Radcliffe said. "I am
really disappointed, but I suppose it was my personal best run and
I felt comfortable for the first half, but win six-seven laps to
go it was very difficult."
</P>
<P>
Li Ji, the only long distance runners from China, took seventh
in 31:06.94, her best personal time.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy for the result of my best record and as a seventh
place-finsher. I also never thought what kind of placing I could
get here," the 19-year-old girl said.
</P>
<P>
"I just came here to run and run, nobody gave me pressure and I
was in good shape this evening. The result gives me confidence to
gain better place in the international race in the future and I
hope there are more chances for me to compete in the big
international tournaments," said Li, from Liaoning Province of
China.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago her countrywoman Wang Junxia, who is also from
Liaoning Province and retired from running career, won the gold in
the 5,000 and the silver in the 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Wives of Foreign Mayors Take on Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua)-- "Beijing is so beautiful!"
</P>
<P>
This might be the most widely used remark used to describe the
3,000-year-old city by wives of mayors from major cities all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
Their wives were deeply immersed in sightseeing at the
Forbidden City, the Great Wall, a traditional tea art show and a
Beijing Opera performance, which made them open their eyes wide
with wonder and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
But their husbands had not the luxury of leisure. The mayors'
purpose of coming to Beijing was to discuss their cities'
development in the 21st century at the Sixth Major Cities' Summit.
</P>
<P>
Paul Mashatile from Gauteng, South Africa, gave up her plan of
going on a diet on the first day she arrived in Beijing, because
she was unable to resist the temptation of Chinese meals.
</P>
<P>
She also enjoyed the Chinese tea very much, saying that it
tastes better than the tea she drinks back home.
</P>
<P>
Her companion, Trevor Fowler, seeing a Beijing Opera for the
first time, was captivated by the very colorful makeup and
costumes worn by the actors and actresses.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the story through the performers' actions and
vivid facial expressions, though I don't know Chinese," she said.
</P>
<P>
She couldn't help imitating the humorous image of Sun Wukong, a
famous legendary monkey figure that has extraordinary magic power,
after she watched the show at the Beijing Opera School.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Opera is marvelous," she said, "We have our own
cultural traditions, but we should learn more from what China has
done to protect and promote the development of its folk arts."
</P>
<P>
Having bought lacquerwork, Beijing Opera masks made of clay,
snuff bottles with inner paintings and many other Chinese
handicrafts, Gabriela Chirita from Bucharest, Romania, still
regretted not bringing enough money with her.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to spend my lifetime appreciating Chinese culture. I
wish I could buy all the artworks here," she said.

<P>
"It seems that Paris is somewhat old, but Beijing appears clean
and more energetic," said Chirita who has visited Paris. She
always used her camera to capture Beijing's new look.
</P>
<P>
As she and the other first ladies ride on the bus to their next
destination, they look out from the windows at the clear sky and
take in the refreshing atmosphere since autumn has come. Large
squares, key roads and spectacular buildings are now decorated
with beautiful flowers and balloons on the eve of the 51st
anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"To me, bikes are a symbol of China, but now automobiles have
become a major form of transportation in Beijing," said Yael
Huldai from the city of Tel-Aviv, Israel, who came to Beijing
eight years ago. "I see high-rise buildings and prosperous
business streets everywhere, the drastic changes here is
unbelievable!"
</P>
<P>
She said she was willing to vote for Beijing to hold the 2008
Olympic Games. "I enjoy every minute here and I really desire to
come back again," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the ladies suggested that Beijing needs more overpasses
and wider roads to improve the city's traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
These honorable ladies are not strange to formal occasions. But
in a Beijing kindergarten class, they sang and danced with Chinese
children as if they had returned to their childhood.
</P>
<P>
Their hands were full of paper folding made by the children and
wore colorful paper hats, never thinking about how funny they
appeared.
</P>
<P>
"The kids are so cute! I never expected that 4 to 5 year-old
Chinese children could speak English," said Khunying Surrat from
Bangkok, Thailand. "They are very open to foreigners."
</P>
<P>
"Beijing sets a good example for other cities for it has
achieved rapid economic and urban development and also protects
their cultural traditions well," said Sharifah Ahmad from Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, born in a noble family and an expert in
education and culture.
</P>
<P>
What impressed the wives of foreign mayors most was that China
has succeeded in managing such a large population.
</P>
<P>
"Discipline plays a key role here, which shows that the Chinese
way of management has some advantages," she said.
</P>
<P>
Interpreters talked the most during the trip.
</P>
<P>
"The ladies are so interested in Beijing and they always raised
questions," said an English interpreter from Beijing Foreign
Studies University. " We are willing to help them understand more
about the city."

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Urban Medicare System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made massive
progress in urban medicare system reform during the 1996-2000
period, and the management of medical organizations has been
strengthened, said an official from the Ministry of Health (MOH)
today.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the average lifespan of Chinese people will
reach 71.8 years, up 0.9 year to that of 1995. The mortality rate
of pregnant women has also went down.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China has strengthened disease control,
health education and has succeeded in curbing the spread of
various infections.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, MOH and other seven ministries jointly issued "
regulations for urban medicare system reform," which asked local
governments to divide medical organizations as profitable and non-
profitable ones. The government will give out different tax and
price policies according to the function of medical organizations.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Marks National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The October 1 edition of
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will publish an
editorial entitled "Striving for the Great Rejuvenation of the
Chinese Nation" to mark the 51st National Day of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000, the end of the millennium, is the last year of
the China's ninth five-year plan (1996-2000), a milestone in the
development of the country's socialist modernization and the
history of the Chinese nation, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
In the five years, China has achieved sustained rapid and
healthy development of the national economy, resulting in further
enhancement of its overall national strength, a "soft-landing" of
its economy, and as success in curbing deflation, according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
In general, it says, the Chinese people have become well-off,
with poor people in the countryside having basically resolved the
problem of food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the past five years shows China's progress
in implementing its strategy of development in science, technology
and education; in further opening up to the rest of the world in
an all-around way; in achieving cultural and ethic progress and
building up democracy and rule of law; and in making historic
gains on the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the coming five to 10 years are an
important period for China's economic and social development. It
urges the people to keep cool-headed and further strengthen the
country's economic and defense powers and the cohesiveness of the
Chinese nation, so as to win a complete victory in building the

<HEADLINE> Iranian Interior Minister in Kuwait to Discuss Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari arrived here Saturday to discuss security
cooperation, and possibly demarcation of maritime borders between
the two Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Before departing from Tehran, capital of Iran, Lari said his
talks with Kuwaiti officials would include security issues such as
Iranians living in Kuwait, effective ways to combat drug-
trafficking and infiltrations in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will sign a security accord in this regard,
Lari said, without mentioning whether the deal will be inked during
his three-day stay here or not.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Iran in 1998, Kuwaiti Interior Minister
Sheikh Mohamed Khaled Al-Sabah signed with the Iranian side a
memorandum of understanding on joint cooperation in fighting
against
narcotics and infiltrations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to security issues, local media reports said
Saturday that the Kuwaiti-Iranian talks are also likely to touch
upon the chronic issue of the continental shelf and demarcation of
maritime borders between the two states.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iran, along with Saudi Arabia, have been claiming
for years sovereignty over the gas-rich field of Al-Dorra, which is
located in the continental shelf in north Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia reached a bilateral agreement in July on
solving their dispute over the offshore field.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in this regard between Kuwait and Iran have been
intensified since last May, when Tehran voiced readiness to reach
an understanding on this territorial row.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of the injured
Palestinians in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip on Saturday has reached 285, according to the Red
Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
Eighty Palestinian protestors were wounded in the Gaza Strip
where the violence has spreaded to nearly all the Jewish
settlements and even to Erez and Rafah border checkpoints which
connect Israel and Egypt respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of angry Palestinians are gathering at the the Jewish
settlement of Netzarim in the center of the Gaza Strip, which
witnessed the most violent clashes. They hurled stones at Israeli
soldiers, who responded with rubber coated as well as live bullets.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah, protests and
clashes are continuing.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership has declared Saturday the "day of
mourning" for the five Palestinians killed Friday during clashes
with Israeli security forces at the holy site known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem, and
called for a general strike.
</P>
<P>
Clashes broke out at the holy site on Thursday following a
visit by Ariel Sharon, the hawkish leader of Israel's right-wing
Likud party, to the religious shrine in Jerusalem's walled Old
City.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian policeman also shot dead an Israeli soldier in
the West Bank town of Qalqiliya on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership condemned the escalating violence at
a
cabinet meeting on Friday and vowed not to give up the sovereignty
over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel barred its citizens on Friday from entering Palestinian-
ruled areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after
the trouble flared. It closed the border crossing between
Jerusalem and the West Bank on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Lankan President Calls for Free, Fair Election Without Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga has called on all political parties to
cooperate in conducting the forthcoming election in a free and
fair manner without any violence, the official Daily News reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have embarked on an era that has left behind a period of 17
years of bitter experiences of election violence. Let us join
hands for a new political culture devoid of violence and terrorism.
Let us dedicate ourselves to holding the forthcoming general
election in a free and fair manner," President Kumaratunga said in
a nationwide address Friday night.
</P>
<P>
She assured that all possible steps would be taken to conduct a
free and fair poll devoid of violence. She said she would not
hesitate to take stringent disciplinary action against any one of
any status in her ruling People's Alliance (PA)if they have
engaged in any acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
Even if they win the election by acts of violence, they will
not be given any positions in her government, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She urged leaders of all other political parties contesting the
October 10 general election to issue an appeal to their party
members and supporters to avoid election violence and cooperate
with the PA in the task.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the dissolution of the parliament on August 18,
election-related violence has been on rapid increase in the small
island country. The Center for Monitoring Election Violence said
on Thursday that the center had recorded 850 incidents of election-
related violence by the end of September 24.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of RVF Up in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of death of Rift
Valley Fever (RVF) in Saudi Arabia rose to 43 with four new
death reported in the southern region of Jizan during the past 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry said in a statement issued on Friday night
that the deadly virus has infected 12 more people, including 10 in
Jizan and one each in Asir and the Eastern Province, a fact which
brought the total infected to 201.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 18 more planes and 119 vehicles have joined the
campaign against the RVF by spraying insecticides in the Red Sea
port city of Jeddah and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz has instructed the governor of
Jizan to spare no efforts to eradicate the RVF, which has claimed a
lot of lives since September 11 when it was first reported in
Jizan.
</P>
<P>
Arab health ministers are expected to discuss the latest
development of the RVF and the more effective measures taken to
combat the virus, when they meet in Cairo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The RVF virus, transmitted from livestock to human beings by
mosquitoes, causes high fever, diarrhea, nausea, internal bleeding
and
dysfunction of kidneys that can result in death.
</P>
<P>
The RVF, first identified in Kenya in 1930, began to hit Jizan,
near the border with Yemen, early this month.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo to Discuss With Mubarak Palestinian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Cairo on Saturday for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit came amid spreading waves of violence in the
Palestinian territories, as the Palestinians protested the killing
of seven of their compatriots in clashes with Israeli forces in
Jerusalem this week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to discuss with Mubarak the latest situation
in Jerusalem and its impact on the Mideast peace process, diplomats
in Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian demonstrations were sparked by a visit to Al-
Haram Al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary (the Temple Mount as called
by the Jews) in Jerusalem by Israeli right-wing Likud leader Ariel
Sharon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haram Al-Sharif houses al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the
Rock, Islam's third holiest site. The Israelis say it is the site
of an ancient Jewish temple, the most sacred shrine of the Judaism.
The control of the sovereignty over the site lies at the core of
the
stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has blamed Israel for the violence in
the holy city on Thursday and Friday, in which seven Palestinians
were killed and 220 were wounded by Israeli security forces.
Violence also spread to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where 217
Palestinians were reported wounded.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Friday, Mubarak's office said that
Egypt "deplores the bloody violence triggered by the Israelis who
are not concerned to reach peace," Egypt's pro-government Al
Gomhuria newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It added that Egypt regrets that the clashes occurred at a
moment when all parties are making efforts to overcome obstacles
hindering the peace negotiations between the Palestinians and the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace process, called on Israel to
take all measures to ensure that this sort of incidents are not
repeated so that the process can move forward.

<HEADLINE> American Hostage Visits Rebel Camp Before: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine police chief
said Saturday that the American hostage held by the Abu Sayyaf had
visited the rebel camp twice in the past two years to sell weapons,
bolstering speculations that the American was a willing hostage.
</P>
<P>
Director General Panfilo Lacson of the Philippine National
Police said, "Twice in the past two years, (Jeffrey) Schilling
visited the Abu Sayyaf camp in (the southern province of) Basilan,
"the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the American was asking Abu Sayyaf leaders to procure
night vision goggles and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Schilling was sighted in the Abu Sayyaf hideout
in Sulu Province, near Basilan, four weeks ago, no incident was
reported because he went there to transact business, Lacson said.
</P>
<P>
Schilling was reportedly kidnapped in the city of Zamboanga on
August 28 and later brought to the Abu Sayyaf's jungle lair on the
island of Jolo, Sulu.
</P>
<P>
There had been reports that Schilling was not kidnapped but had
met with the Abu Sayyaf leaders to follow up a business deal.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military began attacks on Abu Sayyaf camps in
Jolo on September 16 to rescue its 19 hostages, including
Schilling. Two French journalists have managed to escape from the
rebels and have been recovered by the military.
</P>
<P>
The military operations are going on to pursue the fleeing
rebels,who are holding three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos besides
the American.
</P>
<P>
The military has admitted that it underestimated the Abu Sayyaf
's capability when it launched operations against the rebels, who
have reportedly splintered into small groups to avoid being
walloped by pursuing government forces.
</P>
<P>
The military claimed that more than 110 Abu Sayyaf rebels have
been killed and some 50 others captured while the government lost
four soldiers.

<HEADLINE> New Economy Breathes Life Into Historical Cities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors to the
Forbidden City in Beijing, the Chinese capital, has increased
drastically, but most of them made the trip to this site via
cyberspace by visiting the Imperial Palace website launched one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Aided by satellite photography and remote sensing, Beijing's
archaeological workers are meticulously excavating ancient tombs
that have been threatened by the process of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
But it is not all of the impact the new economy has exerted on
this Chinese city with a history of 3,000 years. Beijing has also
decided to build a science and technology park at its northwestern
Zhongguancun, dubbed as China's silicon valley, and has started to
build a bio-engineering base.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Liu Qi said, "New economy has not weakened mankind's
respect for ancient civilization. On the contrary, it has helped
this old Chinese city move to a turning point."
</P>
<P>
At the Sixth Major Cities Summit Beijing 2000, which ended
Friday, mayors of many famous historical cities in other countries
expressed similar positive sentiments. The Internet was one of the
most frequently mentioned words at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaos Yatrakos, Vice-Mayor of Athens, Greece, said the main
success of new telecommunications and network technology has
turned the globe into an integrity that focuses on one incident or
theme.
</P>
<P>
He believes the Internet has helped Athens with its successful
Olympic bidding efforts globally and made it possible to widely
spread the ancient Hellenic culture.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Alvarez Del Manzano, mayor of Madrid, Spain, said
the Internet has enabled the city hall to keep in close contact
with other government departments for information about the rapid
changes in all sides. He said his city also hires a satellite to
take photos of the city every three months.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of the famous European city held it would be
conducive to drafting rational urban development plans, especially
to strengthening protection of famous historical architecture.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the emergence of the new economy, which is
based on telecommunications, network, biological, new material and
space technology, has not only helped improve the outlook of
cities, but also better preserve the cultural heritage of
historical cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
New technologies have helped in the creation of new
technological cities. Working from home has made progress. Virtual
banks, shops and bookstores will become popular in cities.
</P>
<P>
Cities famous for their historical associations are usually the
most densely populated places in a country. Bernhard Goerg, vice-
mayor of Vienna, noted that progress in telecommunications and
network technology would make most cities lose their power of
attraction, and not many people would like to live in big cities.
</P>
<P>
"But still, people will always be able to listen to a waltz any
time they want," he said.
</P>
<P>
Claude Roland, vice-mayor of Paris, said knowledge and
innovation have been listed as the main tools used to keep
vitality in his city.
</P>
<P>
"Children studying computers is a usual scene, and at least a
half of the grown-ups do their office work through computers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The France Internet Festival, which was launched in 1997, has
become one of the most important annual events in Paris. During
the festival, various seminars and forums with participation of
ordinary people are held in the French capital.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, which has an 800-year history, solar and wind energy
will soon replace nuclear power. Vice-Mayor Klaus Boger said
Berlin has progressed very fast in information, telecommunications,
biochemistry and environmental protection technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 50,000 people in Berlin have taken part in
environmental protection, and of those, 13,000 are engaged in
producing and marketing of high-tech environmental commodities.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Saeed, mayor of Islamabad, Pakistan, said along with
economic globalization and progress in information technology,
even people in developing countries are also able to enjoy a
higher standard of living through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The mayors expressed concern that limited by capital,
technological personnel and the level of education, the
rejuvenation pace of famous historical cities in developing
countries will be slower than that in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall prospects seem encouraging. Tan Sri Dato'
Kamaruzzaman Shariff, mayor of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said, "We
should treat a city like a beautiful woman. No matter how old she
is, she can always have her beauty preserved."

<HEADLINE> Intel Scraps Timna, Abandoning Low-Cost-Processor Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- After more than a year-
and-a-half in the making, Intel Corp. said Friday it had scrapped
plans to develop the ultra-low-cost PC microprocessor code-named "
Timna."
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the market need for a highly integrated
solution to achieve the sub-600 dollar price-point has gone away
because the other components have gone down enough in cost," Intel
spokesman Michael Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
The Timna processor was Intel's first chip that combined the
central processor unit core, the "brains" of a PC, with a memory
controller and also a graphics controller.
</P>
<P>
Some market observers said that Intel's approach to achieving
lower costs with Timna undercut its ability to compete in the
lower end, where consumers don not want to sacrifice performance
for lower prices.
</P>
<P>
"Integrating graphics with the processor compromises
performance of the graphics," said Drew Peck, semiconductor
analyst at SG Cowen. "The problem isn't that people aren't
interested in the low-end PCs selling at 600 dollars, it's that
people aren't interested in processors whose performance is
compromised because the graphics is built in."
</P>
<P>
With PC demand already weakening, Peck said the Intel's move
will accelerate an inevitable pricing plunge that was going to
come about next year anyway.
</P>
<P>
"I suspect all that will do is to exacerbate processor pricing,
and we're going to see the Pentium III quickly fall down to
compete in pricing in the 500-800 dollar space," he said. "In the
longer term, pricing gets crushed on all processors."

</P>
<P>

athletics and stamped an indelible mark in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's victories brought Kenya's medal tally to six,
including two gold, two silver and two bronze. This has seen
Kenya up to the 25th position from the earlier 54th on the medals
table.
</P>

<P>
KUNMING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chengdu-Kunming
electrified railway line, which became fully operational today,
marks the formation of an advanced and multi-function electrified
railway network in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
It lays a solid foundation for implementing the central
government's strategy of developing western China and promoting
economic growth in the vast yet economically underdeveloped region.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing
Municipality have abundant water, power, minerals, tourism and
biological resources. The region is deemed by Chinese economists
as the "golden triangle" for China's economic development into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
However, its economy grows at a slow pace as a result of poor
transportation. The State has electrified, respectively, the
Chengdu-Chongqing, Guizhou-Kunming and Chengdu-Kunming railway
lines in the past 17 years. Completion of the southern part of the
Chengdu-Kunming railway line and put the finishing touches on a
complete electrified railway network in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
It brought the total number of electrified railway lines in
China to 28 with a total length of 12,984 kilometers. By 2002, the
electrified railway mileage in China is expected to reach between
16,000 and 18,000 kilometers, becoming the fourth electrified
railway power in the world after Russia, Germany and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Market Decides Commodity, Service Prices in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The prices of the vast
majority of commodities and services in China have been set by
market forces during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000),
according to a report from the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the prices for 94.7 percent of the retail
commodities, 83.8 percent of the agricultural products and 86
percent of the means of production had been adjusted in line with
market rule.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC will soon issue a list of commodities with State-set
prices, which includes less than 20 varieties of commodities and
services. The price monopoly on electric power, oil, medicine and
railway transport has already been broken down, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
China is speeding up the process of issuing price laws and
regulations and improving the order of prices and standardizing
price behavior, said authorities from the SDPC.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that China's expected entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will bring more international market mechanisms
to the country to push forward its price reform. China promises to
lower its tariffs and further open its market after it becomes a
member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China succeeded in curbing inflation and ensuing deflation
since 1996, basically stabilizing its general price level.

</P>
<P>
The Shanghai N0. 2 Medical Science University performed the
operation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Appeals Not to Stop Land Acquiring: Zimbabwean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday said appeals by white commercial farmers to courts
and overseas powers will not prevent his government from acquiring
land to resettle the landless majority, Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The farmers had better recognize this so they can adjust their
delaying tactics," Mugabe said while addressing the 44th ordinary
session of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The commercial farmers have for a long time been resisting the
land reform program and have been to courts several times. In
their latest court action they are challenging the
constitutionality of the land resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
They have also been involved in lobbying western powers to cut
aid as a way of forcing the government to abandon the land
acquisition process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, the land question is a just struggle which
is now enjoying the support of many countries on the globe, except
the United Kingdom and its western allies.
</P>
<P>
"We seek no square inch of British soil. Zimbabwe's land
belongs to Zimbabweans and the sovereign right must prevail and
not that of the British," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Britain of sabotaging the country through indulging
in "racial hate, animosity and systematic violence as well as
organized economic war" as a strategy of its latter-day
imperialist control and domination of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 2,190 farms have been gazetted under the fast-
track land reform program and about 6,000 families have been
resettled countrywide.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a long way to go and it is envisaged that
greater acceleration of land distribution will occur in the next
few weeks," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to ensure that the people will be in their
resettlement places in time for the agricultural season," he said,
adding that "we have agreed in the government to make essential
inputs available for the viability of the whole exercise."

<TEXT>
<P>
Moi made the remarks in the capital Nairobi Friday when he held
talks with Hussein Mohammed Aideed who leads the Somali National
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Although a transitional government for Somalia has been agreed
in Djibouti, it would be prudent to include the Mogadishu leaders
if it is to be peacefully functional, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "Kenya feels strongly that an agreement of all parties
should be concluded speedily" and this is the only way to ensure a
smooth democratic process and economic development.
</P>
<P>
As a neighbor, Kenya will support the new peace initiative in
Somalia, Moi emphasized, expressing hope that after peace and
constitutional order are restored, Somalia will join the East
African Community and the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Moi also advised Somali leaders to consider, first and foremost,
the ideals of their people as the civil war in the country has
been too costly in terms of human life, infrastructure and
national image.
</P>
<P>
Peace, security and the hope of an entire nation should never
be sacrificed at the altar of political expediency and selfish
interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Somalia ought to be peaceful in order to be part and
parcel of the ongoing development plan in this region.

<HEADLINE> Intel Delays Delivery of Long-waited Pentium 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip-maker, has postponed the shipment of its long-
awaited Pentium 4 processors until the end of this year, according
to personal computer makers.
</P>
<P>
CNET Networks Friday quoted unidentified sources as saying that
Intel had originally planned to release the Pentium 4 processor on
October 30, but last week it postponed the release date until the
end of November or possibly even later.
</P>
<P>
Two PC makers said that Intel had notified them the processor
would not be ready for delivery by the end of November, CNET added.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts view the Pentium 4 as an important step
forward for Intel, as it moves beyond the lagging chip
architecture introduced with 1996's Pentium Pro processor.
</P>
<P>
With Pentium 4, which is expected to debut in 1.4-GHz and 1.5-
GHz versions, they said, Intel hopes to solve some of the problems
that have plagued the Pentium III as the company ramped up the
clock speed.
</P>
<P>
A recent glitch with the 1.13-GHz Pentium III processor forced
Intel to recall the processor.
</P>
<P>
With the latest delay, Intel has effectively made it impossible
for most PC makers to deliver Pentium 4 systems in volume for the
lucrative holiday shopping season in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> (Specially for China-Africa Cooperation Forum) Roundup: Angola Finally Turning for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Fu Xiancheng
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The last year of the passing
century seems to have boded well for Angola, a southwestern
African country, with the government gaining dominance in the
battlefield over rebels and the country's economy turning for
better.
</P>
<P>
The civil war, with virtually no break since the country
achieved independence in 1975, was finally at the tunnel's end in
the first half of 2000 when the government forces drove the rebels
out of 92 percent of the country's territory in an all-out
offensive starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels,
now having been driven to far-reaching mountainous regions, can no
longer stage a comeback, for their purse, the diamond mines, is in
the government's grips.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA, founded in 1962, is one of the three rival groups
rising up to fight against the Portuguese colonial rule. The other
two groups are the Movement for People's Liberation of Angola (
MPLA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA).
</P>
<P>
The three groups formulated a common political program in
January 1975. In the same month, they reached an agreement with
the Portuguese government, establishing the date of Angola's
independence as November 11, 1975: until then Angola would be
governed by a transitional administration comprising
representatives of the three groups and a Portuguese high
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
However, large-scale civil war broke out between the three
groups during the first half of 1975, with the MPLA winning
decisive military successes under the support of the former Soviet
Union and other Eastern bloc countries. A government was formed by
the MPLA and the Organization of African Union immediately
recognized Angola as a member state.
</P>
<P>
But the UNITA, supported by the United States, did not give up
the fighting and the country was thrown into decades of years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
As the cold war came to an end, the United States changed its
foreign policy immediately and established diplomatic ties with
its former arch enemy, the government led by the MPLA, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the United Nations, the UNITA signed a
peace deal with the MPLA government in Lusaka, Zambia in 1994. But
later Jonas Savimbi refused to disarm his followers and rekindled
war in 1998. Ever since then, Savimbi has found himself fighting a
hopeless war against the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
With the overwhelming triumph on the battleground, the
government led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos started
thinking about the next steps--national reconciliation and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos, in an effort to bring full national reconciliation,
announced in June this year that all those quitting the UNITA
would be welcomed back into the society, including "perhaps even
Savimbi himself".
</P>
<P>
Now, the country, for the first time in its history after
independence, has the opportunity to focus back on rebuilding its
economy.
</P>
<P>
The country, with a relatively small population of some 12
million, currently has a crude oil output of about 745,000 barrels
per day (bpd), a volume almost surpasses that of the middle east
oil kingdom, Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The country is also rich in diamond mines. But unfortunately,
nearly all the wealth from these natural blessings has largely
been down the drain during the age-long conflict. But for the war,
Analysts said, Angola might have long been one of the richest
nations on sub-Sahara African continent.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1999, the government launched an ambitious
economic readjustment program aimed at restraining public expenses,
increasing transparency and curbing inflation. These efforts did
paid off, although there is still a long way to go for country's
economy to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation has been stable and enjoying a good
credit, commented Barbara Kafka, the World Bank's regional
director for Angola, Mozambique and Lesotho, during his assessment
trip to Angola in May.
</P>
<P>
Regaining confidence in its economy, the World Bank fully
resumed its cooperation with Angola this year by approving a loan
worth 33 million U.S. dollars. Private investment are also pouring
in, making Angola the third largest foreign investment destination
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry, the fund-providing sector in the country's
economy has been given priority by the government and the sector's
output is expected to reach 1,000,000 bpd in 2001. The record high
oil price on the world market also seems to be providing
historical opportunity for the country's rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress in other areas have also been underway. The
government is reducing the exuberant annual inflation rate, hoping
to bring it down from over 400 percent to 120 percent at end of
this year. With the help from the international community, the
government is also making more serious efforts in poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
This year 3 million more children aged between zero and five
years old have been vaccinated during a nationwide campaign
against poliomyelitis. This is an unprecedented event in Angola's
history. On August 25, the Angolan government approved the 2000-
2002 program on fighting HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In late July, Angola successfully hosted the 17th Luanda
International Fair. Enterprises from 15 countries participated in
the event, with the volume of transactions reaching some 200
millions dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have to rejoice at the fact that this event is taking
place at a moment in which a new era looms, characterized by an
increase in the political stability and by compounded consequences
to the country's economic growth," Industry Minister Albina Assis
said while opening the fair.
</P>
<P>
Everything shows that after age-long suffering, Angola may be
finally returning right back to its track.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Makes History in Olympic Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- By defeating Russia 3-2 in the
final, the Cuban women team became the first Olympic volleyball
team, both men and women, to clinch gold for three straight
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
From two sets down, the Cuban women rallied back 25-27, 32-34,
25-19, 25-18 and 15-7, winning the gold medal in the Millennium
Olympics by beating Russia to second.
</P>
<P>
The reigning world champions won the gold at the 1996 and 1992
Olympic Games, as well as winning the last four World Cups in 1989,
1991, 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
They won their fourth World Cup Championship in November 1999
when they knocked Russia to second place by a 3-0 defeat in only
56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban women began their remarkable record in 1978, when
they gained a gold medal in the World Championship. More recently,
they took the gold in the 1994 and 1998 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Only four countries have ever won gold in the women's
volleyball at the Games since it made its debut in Tokyo in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet Union has won gold four times, but not
consecutively. Cuba has won three golds in a row, Japan has won
gold two times, and China won gold once.

<HEADLINE> More than 200 Threats Against Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney police have so far
received ore than 200 threats against the Olympic Games, but more
of them were hoaxes, the Games police leader Peter Ryan said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We received somewhere on average of about 12 different threats
a day," Ryan told a news conference. "Many of them were hoaxes."
</P>
<P>
He added that every threat had been taken seriously: "We did in
fact respond with bomb search teams to the venues and the places
where those threats were made against. There were no explosive
devices found or dealt with."
</P>
<P>
Olympic Security Commander Paul McKinnon said one case involved
a bomb threat against Stadium Australia where the man was tracked
down quickly
</P>
<P>
"He rang the local cops at Casino, they drove around and the
silly bugger was still in the phone-box," McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
"The person was taken into custody about a week ago and we were
advised by the locals that he had a long history of psychiatric
care and it would have been inappropriate to proceed with the
matter."
</P>
<P>
Ryan also said that some of the threats had been delivered via
the Internet, with one person trying hard to disguise that it was
placed in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We have received threats by the Internet which we have traced
back to source despite that fact that one of them tried very hard
to disguise its source of origin by hiding it through different
countries. We are good enough to be able to track that down," Ryan
said.

It was the cycling upset of the Sydney Games as world time

Armstrong, the double Tour de France winner from the United

"If I said that I was not surprised I would be lying," said
Armstrong.

"Slava is a time triallist, and he put it all on the line for
me in the Tour so as upset as I am in not winning gold I am

</P>
<P>
"He is a true champion. He has done more on the road and track
than a lot of us combined.
</P>
<P>
"I came to win the gold medal. I wish I could tell you that I
had a problem, a flat tire, cramp, or that I felt bad, but I just
did not go so well as the others."

<HEADLINE> Ship-breaking Industry Takes Heavy Toll in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Frequent occupational accidents
are resulting in recurrent deaths and injuries to workers of the
ship-breaking industry in the southeastern Chittagong coastal area,
The Independent newspaper quoted a recently study as saying
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 400 workers died and 6,000 were injured due to gas
explosions and fires at the ship-breaking yards in the last 21
years, said the study report of the Bangladesh Institute of Labor
Studies.
</P>
<P>
The gas explosions and fires were mainly caused by the oil
slashes of unclean ships, the report said, recommending a ban on
the import of unclean ships for scrapping at the ship-breaking
yards.
</P>
<P>
The yard owners or labor contractors do not provide any
complete medical treatment support to the victims of occupational
accidents while 95 percent of them do not get any financial
compensation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, 65 percent of the workers in the ship-
breaking industry are suffering from gastric and stomach problems,
bone and chest pains and physical weakness, while 80 percent
workers of the cutter group suffer from eye and digestion problems
caused by work with fire and smoke.
</P>
<P>
Around 500 re-rolling mills located in greater Chittagong and
Dhaka districts which annually produce 1.8 million tons of
finished rods for the construction industry completely depend on

<HEADLINE> Lankan President Calls for Free, Fair Election Without Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga has called for all political parties to
cooperate in conducting the forthcoming election in a free and
fair manner without any violence, the official Daily News reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have embarked on an era that has left behind a period of 17
years of bitter experiences of election violence. Let us join hand
for a new political culture devoid of violence and terrorism. Let
us dedicate ourselves to hold the forthcoming general election in
a free and fair manner," President Kumaratunga said in a
nationwide address Friday night.
</P>
<P>
She assured that all possible steps would be taken to conduct a
free and fair poll devoid of violence. She said she would not
hesitate to take stringent disciplinary action against any one of
any status in her ruling People's Alliance (PA) if they have
engaged in any acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
Even if they win the election by acts of violence, they will
not be given any positions in her government, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She urged leaders of all other political parties contesting the
October 10 general election to issue an appeal to their party
members and supporters to shirk the election violence and
cooperate with PA in the task.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the dissolution of the Parliament on August 18,
election-related violence is on rapid increase in the small island
country. The Center For Monitoring Election Violence said on
Thursday that the center has recorded 850 incidents of election-
related violence at the end of September 24.

<HEADLINE> Price Hike for Petroleum Products Across India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move was intended to cut the surging oil pool deficit,
which was estimated at 236 billion rupees (5.24 billion U.S.
dollars) during the current 2000-2001 fiscal year as a result of
high crude prices in the global market, said the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government also decided to cut excise and import
duties on petroleum products and crude oil to share the deficit
burden with the consumers, the newspapers noted.
</P>
<P>
After the price hike, the retail prices of diesel, petrol and
kerosene has been raised by around 3 rupees per liter each, while
the retail price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas has been raised by
around 40 rupees per cylinder.
</P>
<P>
While the hike will help cut the oil pool deficit by some 80
billion rupees (1.78 billion U.S. dollars), it is bound to "hit
the household budget hard", said the Indian Express.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import duty on crude oil has been reduced from
15 percent to 10 percent and excise duties on diesel and petrol
have been reduced from 16 and 32 percent to 12 and 16 percent
respectively, the newspapers noted.

WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials and
representatives of Afghanistan's ruling militia movement the
Taliban held talks here Friday to discuss an array of issues,
including a peace settlement, drug control and Saudi billionaire
Osama Bin Laden, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden was wanted by Washington for what it says
masterminding terrorist activities against the United States,
including the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Describing the discussions as "frank and straightforward,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said no progress was
made and more talks between the two sides were planned.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban did not raise the issue of recognition by the
United States, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side was led by Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering and Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth while
the Taliban delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abdur
Rahman Zahid.
</P>
<P>
Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
recognize the Taliban government, which controls 90 percent of
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Raducan to Get Olympic Gold Medal Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Romanian gymnast Andreea
Raducan, who lost the all-around gold medal because she took cold
pills containing a banned substance will receive a replacement
medal from local jewelers, a newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Raducan, 16, will receive the replacement Monday from the
Association of Romanian Jewelers, with Prime Minister Mugur
Isarescu and Ion Tiriac, chairman of the Romanian Olympic
Committee, watching on, according to daily newspaper Evenimentul
Zilei.
</P>
<P>
The replacement medal will be 18-carat gold and weigh 60 grams,
and will be engraved with the words "Andreea is the everlasting
Olympic champion in our hearts," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Raducan tested positive for pseudeoephedrine, a substance
contained in the cold pill she was prescribed by the team doctor.
The International Olympic Committ (IOC) has banned the doctor from
participating in the 2002 Winter Olympic Games and the 2004 summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Romanians protested, but the Court of Arbitration for Sports on
Thursday upheld the IOC decision. Raducan still holds the gold
from the team event and a silver for the vault.
</P>
<P>
Tiriac has offered to resign because he could not bring himself
to ban Raducan for life, as Romanian rules require.
</P>
<P>
Raducan will arrive home on her 17th birthday Saturday to a
champion's welcome, along with the rest of the gymnastics' team.
She will be invited to meet President Emil Constantinescu, among
other specially arranged activities. A song entitled "Song for
Andreea Raducan" already has been composed for her.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu has offered Raducan 30,000 U.S. dollars, the money she
would have won for the Olympic title.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon Win First Ever Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon claimed their first
ever Olympic gold medal when they defeated Spain to win the men's
soccer gold medal at the Sydney Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon, who went down 0-2 in the match, rallied to draw 2-2
with nine-man Spain and then beat them 5-3 in penalties shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
The decisive penalty was scored by Patrick Wome. It clinched
victory for Cameroon after Amaya, who had conceded an own goal in
the second half, hit the bar with his penalty.
</P>
<P>
In Stadium Australia, Cameroon staged a stunning recovery after
looking dead and buried at half-time when they trailed 2-0 to
goals from Xavi who scored at the second minute and substitute
Gabri, scoring at 45th.
</P>
<P>
However Spain's fifth-minute penalty miss when Angulo's weak
spot kick was easily saved by 16-year-old keeper Carlos Idriss
Kameni was to prove costly for the Spaniards, chasing their second
Olympic soccer gold in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon struck back with two goals in five minutes early in
the second half -- the first an own goal off defender Amaya at 53
rd and the second from Samuel Eto'o at 58th.

in the last few seconds of extra time when Eto'o was ruled to be

After dominating the first half everything began to go wrong
for Spain after the break. Gabri was sent off after 70 minutes for
a bad tackle on Nicolas Alnoudji and Jose Mari was red-carded in
the 90th minute for feigning an injury for the second time.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Haj Guidance Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The first international
conference on haj guidance opened here Saturday to exchange views
on how best to prepare for the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference opened by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad is aimed at expanding the knowledge and lessons
from the performance of the Haj as guidance for its continuous
improvement.
</P>
<P>
About 25 haj ministers and representatives from 52 countries
are gathered here for the conference where four working papers
prepared by Malaysia, Senegal, Turkey and Jordan are expected to
be presented.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive set of guidelines on haj preparation is
expected to emerge from the conference jointly organized by the
Saudi Arabian government and Malaysia's Tabung Haji (Pilgrims Fund
Board).
</P>
<P>
At the opening, Mahathir described the Haj pilgrimage to the
holy cities in Saudi Arabia as an event without parallel in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said there must be more lessons from the Haj for all Muslims
and there must be some significance in the rituals and in the
pilgrims' expression of total submission to Allah.
</P>
<P>
"Muslims are in dire need of guidance for many of us have lost
our way. We want to return to the right path," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir criticized Muslims for being bitterly divided and for
fighting and killing each other despite such acts being forbidden
by Islam.
</P>
<P>
He said the fighting and killing by Muslims of other Muslims
was forbidden anywhere and at any time.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Muslims seemed to have rejected a cardinal
principle of Islam that they are really one people and called on
them to practice the sense of brotherhood and kinship shown by
Muslims during their annual Haj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the Haj and despite the injunction against
fighting and killing other Muslims, the Muslims were bitterly
divided against each other and fighting each other without
compunction.
</P>
<P>
They even side with non-Muslims in order to defeat, subjugate
and oppress their Muslim enemies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also exposing other acts of hypocrisy among Muslims, Mahathir
said "the sufferings of other Muslims mean nothing to them. If
fellow Muslims are oppressed and massacred even, they will not
help because they are too preoccupied with their own quarrels,
their fights among themselves."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also spoke of how Muslims had become less tolerant
nowadays.

<HEADLINE> Bonuses Await Indonesia's Olympic Medal Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian men's doubles
shuttlers Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan top the list of cash
bonus recipients following their gold-medal triumph in the Sydney
Olympic Games, according to the Jakarta Post on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official in charge of planning and budgeting at the
National Sports Council (KONI) Togi Hutagaol said the badminton
pair would share one billion rupiah (117,000 U.S. dollars) in cash
provided by isotonic drink company Extra Joss.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles player Hendrawan and women's weightlifter Raema
Lisa Rumbewas will receive 300 million rupiah each for their
silver medals at the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
The mixed badminton doubles team of Tri Kusharjanto and Minarti
Timur will pocket 200 million rupiah each for their silver medals.
</P>
<P>
Two bronze medalists, women's weightlifters Sri Indriyani and
Winarni, will bag 150 million rupiah each. Their coach Imron
Rosadi, who owns a weightlifting training camp in Lampung, will
share 100 million rupiah with Lisa's coach Lukman.
</P>
<P>
Togi also said KONI would award the badminton coaches 300
million rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"It will be up to the Badminton Association of Indonesia to
decide how much each coach will receive," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are seven badminton coaches whose players earned medals
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the cash rewards provided by Extra Joss, KONI used
some of the funds raised from sponsors and the government to
earmark bonuses for Olympic medalists.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the bonuses is similar to those received by the
medal winners from the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles shuttlers Ricky Ahmad Subagja and Rexy Mainaky
shared one billion rupiah for winning the country's lone gold in
Atlanta, while women's singles shuttler Mia Audina Tjiptawan
bagged 250 million rupiah for a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Susi Susanti and the men's duo of Denny Kantono and Antonius
Budi earned 100 million rupiah each for their bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Togi said the cash rewards will be presented during a ceremony
on Saturday next week.
</P>
<P>
KONI Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar, who arrived from Sydney on
Thursday, said he had asked for an increase in the cash bonuses
for coaches to show appreciation for their professionalism.
</P>
<P>
"Coaches must be respected because without them there would be
no achievements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope Indonesian athletes would fare better in
future sporting events.
</P>
<P>
"We will immediately evaluate the performances of our athletes.
With one gold, three silvers and two bronzes we made a
breakthrough compared to our neighboring countries, which had to
labor for a single bronze," he added.

<HEADLINE> Construction to Start on Shipping Route Linking Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a marine
shipping route that will link Shenzhen City in south China's
Guangdong Province and neighboring Hong Kong will begin by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tonggu Waterway will start from the mouth of Shenzhen Bay
and will end at Hong Kong's Lan-Tau Island. It will primarily be a
deep-water exit to the western part of Shenzhen Harbor. In the
first phase, the waterway will be able to accommodate new types of
container ships.
</P>
<P>
The new waterway will have a total length of 20.2 km and will
be 180 meters wide and 13.5 meters deep. The total cost of the
project is estimated to reach about 680 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the waterway project will take three years.
</P>
<P>
The project was listed by the State Council as one of major
cross-border infrastructure projects between Hong Kong and the
inland areas, which was decided by the Chinese and British sides
in 1995. The two sides held several rounds of discussions on the
construction of the waterway in May 1995. The project was approved
by the then State Planning Commission, now the State Development
Planning Commission, in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Taxation Bureau
collected 10.06 billion yuan (about 1.21 billion U.S. dollars) in
taxes in the first eight months of the year, up 11.26 percent from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The State taxes collected from January to August also went up
considerably to reach 31.5 billion yuan (about 3.8 billion U.S.
dollars), local sources said.
</P>
<P>
China has been following a tax-sharing system since 1994. Local
and State taxes are levied by two separate organizations -- the
local taxation bureau and the state taxation bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, State taxes in Shenzhen now account
for about 60 percent of the city's total industrial and commercial
taxes. Shenzhen has turned in 100 billion yuan (about 12.05
billion U.S. dollars) in taxes to the State coffers since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, Shenzhen, also one of China's four
earliest special economic zones, created 177.3 billion yuan in
industrial and commercial taxes, with the annual growth rate being
44 percent. In 1979, the city only raked in 27 million yuan in
taxes, but levied 41.4 billion yuan in taxes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's tax revenue makes up about 15 percent of the city's
gross domestic product (GDP), surpassing the national average and
nearing the best tax standard set by the World Bank.

JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri said that Indonesians with any sense of
nationalism could not allow the United States government to make
threats against the country.

The U.S. recently warned Indonesia it could face international

</P>
<P>
Muslim protesters in some cities recently burned U.S. flags,
accusing it of interfering in Indonesia's domestic affairs.

<HEADLINE> E. Timorese Refugees to be Relocated, Says Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will relocate East Timorese refugees to areas nearby Timor island,
according to Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy Minister Surjadi
Soedirdja.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter will be dealt with by ministries under the
coordinating ministry for political, social and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We will speed up the process, either for those who want to
return to East Timor or those who want to stay. That problem will
be handled by the transmigration minister, manpower minister, and
housing and territorial development minister," the minister was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soedirdja admitted there are complaints from the East Timorese
refugees. They do not want to live far away from their homeland
due to emotional and cultural links.
</P>
<P>
He said there are three main problems for the government to
deal with. First, humanitarian problems, namely how to speed up
the repatriation or resettlement of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Second, the problem of disarmament as mentioned in the
resolution of the United Nations Security Council. And third,
finding work for East Timorese civil servants among the refugees.
</P>
<P>
There are about 29,000 families of East Timorese refugees --
about 130,000 people -- living in camps in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Soedirdja said some of them will be relocated to the islands of
Wetar and Sumba and other places in East Nusa Tenggara province.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pull out of Coffee Retention Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has pulled out of
the coffee retention program designed to shore up world coffee
prices after learning that two other major producers, Vietnam and
India, would not take part, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) retention
program would cost Indonesian coffee producers 30 billion rupiah (
3.4 million U.S. dollars) to finance the storage, insurance and
maintenance of about 60,000 tons of coffee which they would not be
able to export, Antara news agency Saturday quoted Minister for
Industry and Trade Luhut B. Panjatan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Friday that neither Vietnam nor India had
sent representatives to the meeting of ACPC in London to discuss
the program, reported the agency.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia may reconsider its decision if Vietnam and India
decide to join the program," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened on Friday, was held ahead of the
October 1 deadline for ACPC countries to submit details of how
they intend to prop up prices from 57 cents per kilogram at
present to 95 cents per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Having agreed to take part in the retention program when it was
first hammered out by ACPC members in May, Indonesia repeatedly
missed the deadlines to provide the details to the association,
first on June 16 and later when it was extended to July 31. The
association extended the deadline a third time to October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AEKI) said
Indonesia failed to meet its commitment because coffee producers
failed secure financial support from the government.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia exported 380,000 tons of coffee in 1999, compared
with 325,000 tons in 1998. AEKI has estimated that Indonesia would
produce 420,000 tons and export 300,000 tons this year.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Asks Brazil Not to Extradite Its Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has asked Brazil not to extradite
one of its member, a FARC spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Cadena, who has been a FARC member for 12 year and
has been investigated in Colombia, was detained last week by the
Brazilian Federal Police in Foz de Iguazu, south of Brazil, when
he went to a Foreign Ministry office to ask the extension of his
visa.
</P>
<P>
FARC spokesman Andres Paris said Cadena, who was participating
in seminars and lectures in Brazil and had been using the name
Oliverio Medina there, will face life threat if he is extradited.
</P>
<P>
He said Cadena was performing "diplomatic procedures" when he
was detained.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking the embassy to solve the issue under Brazilian
laws and prevent the deportation of Cadena, because his life would
be in dangers in Colombia," said Paris.
</P>
<P>
FARC is the biggest guerrilla group in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Hails Success of OPEC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The second summit of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that ended
Thursday in Caracas was a success for Venezuela, said Venezuelan
National Assembly Vice President Leopoldo Puchi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Puchi said all the expectations were fulfilled and that the oil
organization became stronger after this event.
</P>
<P>
"This organization becomes one of the most important factors in
international affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC has always been a very important factor of negotiation
at international level, and that now that it has become stronger,
its role is even more transcendental.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelans should be proud of having hosted the summit and of
its achievements, said the lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC, founded on September 14, 1960, has 11 member
countries: Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Kuwait, Nigeria,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.
Venezuelan Mines and Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez is the rotating
president of the cartel.
</P>
<P>
The cartel held its first summit in Algeria in 1975. Since then
OPEC gatherings have been held only at ministerial level.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica, Canada Discuss Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Trade
Minister Tomas Duenas expressed his satisfaction Friday with
Canada over the development of talks on a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Duenas discussed trade issues with Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien on the sidelines of a Central American summit in
Guatemala held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have had several rounds of very successful talks with
Canada," said the minister after his arrival at home on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canada said that it plans to start a similar process with other
Central American countries including Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras and Nicaragua, but negotiations with Costa Rica will go
ahead, Duenas said.
</P>
<P>
The talks with Canada are important for the two countries,
because it serves as an experiment prior to the more ample
negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), now in
process.
</P>
<P>
Small economies, such as the Caribbean islands or the Central
American countries, will have to coexist in the FTAA with other
big ones like the United States and Canada, so special measures of
protection must be stipulated to prevent their collapse.
</P>
<P>
An eventual agreement with Canada is seen, in the case of Costa
Rica, as a door for its entrance to the North America Free Trade
Agreement, formed by Canada, the United States and Mexico.

SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian 400-meter runner
Svetlana Pospelova tested positive for banned drugs in an out-of-
competition test, International Olympic Committee officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pospelova was found to have steroid stanozolol in her system,
according to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's
medical commission.
</P>
<P>
Pospelova, who won the European Cup at Gateshead, England, on
July 15, was not a medalist in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The IOC Executive Board meets on Sunday. However since she has
left the country and is not expected to compete again, the matter
is expected to be turned over to the international federation to
consider the case and possible sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Pospelova would be the seventh athlete to test positive at the
Games, which have been enveloped in doping cases since well before
the start two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
She had already returned to Russia when the medical commission
received the drug test result, de Merode said.
</P>

Full details will be available after the IOC executive board
meeting.

</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding with the necessary inquiries," de Merode
said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said Pospelova, who did not progress beyond the 400
meters heats and was not picked for Russia's 4x400 meters relay
team, had yet to be informed of the positive test.
</P>
<P>
"The athlete took part in one competition and had a test
afterwards, but some days afterwards, and then left because the
team estimated that she was not well enough qualified," de Merode
said.
</P>
<P>
Stanozolol is the same substance for which Canadian sprinter
Ben Johnson tested positive in the 1988 Games in Seoul where he
was stripped of the Gold he had won in the 100 meters.

<HEADLINE> Ibis Numbers Increasing Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of ibises, an
endangered species of bird, is increasing rapidly in China, thanks
to the great efforts China has made to protect the rare bird.
</P>
<P>
Yangxian County in northwest China's Shaanxi Province is said
to be the last habitat of the ibises in the world, the number of
these birds has grown to about 270 from only seven 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Along with China, Ibises used to live in the Democratic People'
s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Japan and Russia, and were listed for
key protection by international animal protection organizations in
1960.
</P>
<P>
The rare birds became extinct in Russia, DPRK and other places
after the 1970s, while the several remaining ibises in Japan
stopped breeding.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists conducted a 3-year investigation across the
country and found seven ibises in Yangxian County in 1981.
</P>
<P>
To save the rare bird, the Chinese government invested 3
million yuan in establishing an ibis breeding center in Yangxian
County, and sent six ibises to Beijing Zoo for artificial
reproduction research. China was successful in this regard in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Beijing Zoo has artificially bred more than 20 ibises,
and the Yangxian County center had bred 41 as of June 12.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has adopted a series of
measures to protect the rare bird. The measures include banning
lumbering and use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer in places
where ibises live.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers are also mobilized to keep a close eye on the
rare birds around the clock.
</P>
<P>
Li Haiping, a farmer from Liuzhuang Village, knew nothing about
ibises before 1994. However, since 1996, Li has safeguarded the
birds and has witnessed the births of 15 ibises. This year, six
more will be born under his monitoring, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Bai Xiaolong, a 12-year-old student from Liuzhuang Village,
once together with his parents, fought off a 3-meter-long snake in
defense of a newly-born ibis.
</P>
<P>
China's success in protecting the rare birds has won praises
from international bird experts.
</P>
<P>
Malcom C. Coulter, an expert with a specialist group on stocks,
ibises and spoonbills under the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, said that "China has
achieved a miracle and done the best to protect the ibises."
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Japan's Grassroots Ground Aid donated 73,830 U.
S. dollars to the ibis breeding center in Yangxian County.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build 300 square meters of breeding
rooms for the birds, and the publicity and education hall at the
center, according to the agreement.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Anti-smuggling officers
from Gongbei Customs of south China's Guangdong Province recently
tracked down and seized a total of 900,000 pirated compact disks (
CDs).
</P>
<P>
It is the largest case involving smuggling of pirated CD the
customs house has dealt with since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Customs sources said that on the early morning of September 17,
when anti-smuggling officers from Gongbei Customs were doing
routine patrol near the estuary of Pearl River, they spotted a
suspicious fishing boat heading quickly towards Huidong of
Guangdong from the sea waters of Hong Kong, so they started to
track down and chase the boat.
</P>
<P>
After getting aboard the boat, the officers found that the boat
was actually a special smuggling cargo ship made of iron sheets,
all the ship's cabins were designed as cargo holds, and the ship
was equipped with high-speed motors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to seizing 900 cartons containing 900,000 pirated
CDs, the anti-smuggling officers also confiscated other smuggled
commodities like batteries and films.
</P>
<P>
Gongbei Customs, with headquarters in Zhuhai, the nearest
mainland city to Macao, has seized 2.7 million pirated CDs in its
anti-smuggling drive on the sea since the beginning of the year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's GDP Up 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Compared with last year,
Shanghai's GDP is expected to increase 10 percent this year,
realizing a two-digit increase for eight consecutive years,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's per capita GDP is 3,700 U.S. dollars. And the rapid
economic development has been achieved alongside sustainable
environmental development.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Shanghai generated 10,000 yuan of GDP consuming 4.22
tons of coal and 3,500 KWH of electricity. However, the digits
declined to 1.27 tons and 1,242 KWH respectively last year.
Average annual energy consumption declined 6.17 percent.

According to an elderly Shanghai resident, over 10,000 chimney
stacks, were highly visible in the heart of the city a decade ago.
Now low energy-consuming and high-tech industries have replaced
traditional energy-consuming industries.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Shanghai's service trades generated 24 billion
yuan in gross output, making up 31 percent of the city's total.

The percentage has surpassed 50 percent. Low energy-consuming
industries such as finance, trade, tourism, insurance and real

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Adviser Holds Israel Responsible for Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) held Israeli government responsible for recent
provocations and urged it to stop the bloodshed in the Noble
Sanctuary, known as Temple Mount to Jews.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu-Rudeinah, adviser to Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat, said "upon Arafat's instructions we asked the Israeli
government to pull its troops immediately from the Noble Sanctuary
and to order the police to stop provocations."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel should bear the responsibility for the recent
violent clashes in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Five Palestinians have been
killed and over 200 others injured in bloody clashes with Israeli
soldiers in the religious compound in the walled Old City of East
Jerusalem Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership in its weekly meeting Friday night
declared tomorrow a day of mourning for those killed and called for
a general strike to protest Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
The PNA notified the U.S. Administration on the provocation and
aggression committed by the Israeli government and army against the
Palestinian citizens starting with the visit by right-wing Likud
leader Ariel Sharon to the holy Muslim sites Thursday, Abu-Rudeinah
added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government is held responsible for Sharon's visit which
violated the Muslim sanctities, Abu-Rudeinah pointed out. "Sharon
should be forced to observe his limits, something that Israeli
government did not do," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a great chaos and a religious war ignited by
Sharon and the extremist quarters in Israel. Israeli government
must shoulder immediately its responsibility and pull its troops
out, stop provocations and return the situation to normalcy," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is closely following up the situation, he said, noting
that there are Jewish extremists who are trying to sabotage the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are underway between the PNA and the United States on
the one hand and the PNA and Israel on the other in an effort to
find a way out of the stalemate of the peace process. There are
some Israeli quarters which try to destabilize the Palestinian
security in order to influence the peace talks, Abu-Rudeinah
claimed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to step in immediately to stop the
bloodshed as the situation is getting worse continuously.

SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- There were a total of 207
positive drugs tests among U.S. athletes but that resulted in only
10 suspensions, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
A leading Australian newspaper said on Saturday it had obtained
documents of the U.S. Olympic Commission. The documents revealed
that 29 of the positive findings were for anabolic agents, or
steroids, while the vast majority -- 158 --, were for stimulants.
</P>

The remaining 20 were placed under the category of "other",
which included diuretics and narcotics, according to local reports.

IOC medical commission member Arne Ljungvist has alleged that U.
S. athletics chiefs had failed to inform IAAF of 15 suspicious

Cameroon team in the final of the men's soccer tournament at the

SYDNEY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The world powerhouses of
rhythmic gymnastics will try to win the first medals in the
rhythmic gymnastics in the group exercises event on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Russia, Belarus, Japan, Bulgaria, Germany and Brazil
are in the team exercise contest.
</P>
<P>
The scoring in the qualification round does not count so all
the teams will go for faultless performances of the 10 clubs and
the two hoops/three ribbons routines.
</P>
<P>
Greece topped the list in qualification round, 0.044 points
ahead of world champions Russia and 0.086 ahead of 1998 world
champions Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Belorussians were not lucky in the qualification round on
Thursday as they opened the competition. They will again open the
final, performing first with two hoops and three ribbons. Russia
will perform last.
</P>
<P>
Traditional power Bulgaria seems to be on the way back after
dropping to ninth at last year's world championships. The

<HEADLINE> Egypt Renews Call for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Saturday reiterated a
call for the lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq, saying the
embargo has gone far beyond the limits.
</P>
<P>
There is a public opinion in the world community that the trade
embargo has gone far enough and should be lifted, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that the policy is irrational as it
continues in a way intended to humiliate the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the sanctions on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Many countries have urged
the lifting of the sanctions in a bid to ease the sufferings of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian group announced on Saturday that it is preparing to
send a flight with humanitarian aids to Iraq. It did not give a
date.
</P>
<P>
The group is composed of opposition parties, professional
associations, non-governmental organizations and artists.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian group's move follows similar missions by Yemen and
Jordan in recent days, the first Arab countries to take such steps.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions includes flights to and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the group said it would follow the interpretation of the U.
N. Security Council resolutions made by France and Russia, which
insist that humanitarian flights do not need U.N. approval.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Vice President Calls for Boosting Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's First Vice President
Hassan Habibi on Saturday called for boosting non-oil exports as a
way to reduce the country's dependence on oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will remove non-tariff obstacles in
the way of exports for every sector to fully utilize its capacity
in this respect, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at the inauguration ceremony of the 26th
Tehran International Trade Fair, which drew companies from more
than 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
On the facilities to be offered for boosting exports, Habibi
said the government has liberalized exports of most goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that exporters can sell foreign currencies
earned from exports in the free market, instead of being restrained
by the official exchange rate which is much lower.
</P>
<P>
Exporters are being provided with facilities for marketing and
the revenues coming from exports are duty free, he added.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the level of diplomatic relations with
foreign countries depends on the oil exports, but gradually this
would shift in harmony with the extent of non-oil exports,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that tourism industry, techno-engineering
services and medical service engineering are potential Iranian
sectors for exports.
</P>
<P>
On foreign relations, Habibi said that Iran is adjusting its
relations with foreign countries to serve the purpose of developing
healthy economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is ready to prepare the grounds for attracting foreign
investment, especially by Iranians living abroad, he said, noting
that Iran is located at the heart of a large and extensive market
which foreign investors should not ignore.
</P>
<P>
Habibi also expressed regret over the economic sanctions imposed
on Iran in 1995 by the United States, which, he said, have caused
losses on both Iran and the U.S. itself.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Values Friendship with China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania greatly values
its relationship with China and the relations between the two have
indeed overcome the tests of time, a senior government official
said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the People's Republic of China National Day
reception held at the Chinese embassy here, Bakari Mbonde,
Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, said China has
proved to be Tanzania's friend in need and therefore a friend
indeed.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for using whatever resources it has in
enhancing the cause of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We support the entry by China into the World Trade
Organization because we know China's membership will strengthen
the position of the developing countries in that organization,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Tanzania's stand over the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania supports the one China policy. The relevance and
significance of this policy have been proved by the manner in
which Hong Kong and Macao rejoined the motherland and continue to
prosper," Mbonde added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries maintain close relationship not only at the
bilateral level but also at the multilateral level, he noted,
adding that the two governments have the same outlook on almost
all international issues of significance.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Tanzania established diplomatic relations in
1964, their relations have witnessed a healthy and steady
development.
</P>
<P>
At the 26th General Assembly of the United Nations in 1971,
Tanzania was among the sponsor countries of the resolution of
supporting the restoration of China's lawful seat in U.N.
</P>
<P>
At present, the two countries are conducting extensive co-
operation in the spheres of politics, economy, military and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is China's largest aid-recipient country in Africa.
Since 1964, China has rendered various kinds of aid to Tanzania.
The mutually beneficial co-operation between the two sides, which
began in the 1960s, have been developing rapidly in recent years.

Observers here noted the offer by the Kremlin was important
given that Russia had not, as Western nations have, demanded that

The two leaders and the delegations they lead held a round of
official talks at the residence of the Cuban government in a
cordial and friendly atmosphere, in which they discussed issues of
common concern and spoke highly of the success of the Cuban
sportsmen in the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the Iranian president laid a wreath at the
foot of the Monument to National Hero Jose Marti.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami will be honored by Castro on Saturday night
with the Jose Marti Order, the highest honor the Cuban government
grants to foreign personalities.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami, who returns to Tehran on Sunday, arrived in
Havana from Caracas, where he attended the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) second summit.
</P>
<P>
Castro and Khatami met for the first time during the Non-
Aligned Countries Movement Ninth Summit held in South Africa in
1998, when the Iranian leader was invited to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban authorities announced Saturday the impending visit to
Iran of Vice President Carlos Lage, who will be in Tehran from
October 5 to 8, after visiting Japan.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Iran maintain an economic exchange of some 100 million
U.S. dollars per year, mainly in agriculture, fishing and
biotechnology. The two countries, which forged diplomatic ties in
August 1979, are expected to increase trade in the future with the
establishment of a direct maritime line.

development prospect for the economy.
</P>
<P>
And the advantages of the Web go far beyond the myth of the new
economy, the IBM executive said, with the average return on
investments in e-business, for both high-tech and traditional
activities, running around 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the future, Catania predicted that the current boom
of interest in the Internet will seem nothing when compared to
when the Web will be easily accessible not only through personal
computers but also mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
In only a few years, he added, 60 percent of Internet
transactions will be through wireless.
</P>
<P>
"The encounter between the Internet and mobile communication
will give an enormous boost to innovation," Catania said.

<HEADLINE> Rio de Janeiro, Fourth Most Violent City in L.America: IDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The IDB study noted that the most violent Latin American cities
are Cali (Colombia) with 112 homicides for every 100,000
inhabitants; San Salvador (El Salvador), with 95; Caracas (
Venezuela) with 76; Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) with 63; Lima (Peru)
with 25 and Mexico City with 19.
</P>
<P>
The median of homicides in Latin America is of 200 to 300 for
groups of one million inhabitants, which is six times more than
the world median.
</P>
<P>
The report says that almost one half million Latin Americans
die every year of violence causes.
</P>
<P>
The three most common factors that cause the high criminality
indexes in the Latin American countries are poverty, corruption,
and the difficulties to obtain or provide justice.

<HEADLINE> Urban Living Big Risk for Asthma in Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writing in the September issue of the American Journal of
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Andrew Aligne of Rochester
General Hospital and colleagues said that they examined a
nationally representative sample of 17,110 children from birth to
age 17 for parent-reported current asthma, and black children were
found to have a significantly higher prevalence of asthma than
white children.
</P>
<P>
But after examining the sample of varieties such as race,
poverty status and urban residence, researchers found that
children lived in urban environments had a higher risk of asthma,
regardless of race or family income.
</P>
<P>
Asthma appears to be a disease of modern civilization, with
early-life environmental exposure leading to increased
hypersensitivity and finally to bronchial hyperactivity and airway
inflammation, the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also noted that black population in Africa have
very low prevalence, and the asthma that does occur is associated
with environmental factors related to urbanization.

<HEADLINE> Five European Countries Ally for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alliance was the result of an initiative by Italian
minister for agricultural resources, Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, who
invited his colleagues from the four northern European countries
to the southern island of Capri, off the coast of Naples.
</P>
<P>
Among the main objectives of the initiative, Pecoraro Scanio
explained, is "the creation of an agriculture which is closer to
the consumer, the citizen and the environment, one which
privileges unique local and organic products."
</P>
<P>
Capri Team will also seek to allocate funds "for rural
development and for the quality, as opposed to the quantity of
products," the Italian minister added.
</P>
<P>
Another goal of the five-nation alliance will be agreeing on
common measures against the high cost of fuels needed in farming
and for sustainable and alternative energies in order to create,
Pecoraro Scanio said, "a European agricultural model based on
variety, quality and security".
</P>
<P>
Attending Saturday's meeting were farm ministers Nick Brown of
Britain, Margareta Wimberg of Sweden, Denmark's Ritt Bjerregard,
and Laurens Janbrinkhorst of the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> New Anti-flu Drug Developed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have
developed a new antiviral drug which appears to be effective
against both major types of flu affecting humans, as well as all
strains of avian flu.
</P>
<P>
A news release reaching here Friday said the drug, known as
RWJ-270201 inhibited the growth of flu virus in adult volunteers
when given once a day for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Virginia and the University
of Rochester in New York, said the drug was as effective as a
similar oral anti-flu medication on the market, but it was not
associated with stomach upset or other side effects.
</P>
<P>
In a separate study, at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis, the drug prevented the death of animals which were
given the same deadly strains of virus that had passed from birds
to at least 18 people, killing six, in Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
If the new drug is approved by federal regulators, it will be
the third in a class called neuraminidase inhibitors. Anti-flu
medications Tamiflu and Relenza were available during last year's
flu season, and all three are effective against avian flu.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Putin on Yugoslavia's Escalating Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Saturday called Russian President Vladimir Putin and discussed
with him over what the United States said was a political crisis
in Yugoslavia following its presidential election.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton and Putin spoke
for about 35 minutes and both agreed to continue consulting
closely about the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said Clinton urged Putin to help mediate in Yugoslavia'
s escalating tension over its disputed presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that Russia, because of its historical ties to
the Serbian people, was in a position to play a role as an
intermediary, Crowley said. But Putin told Clinton that Moscow's
proposal to send Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to Belgrade
had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
In the first vote last Sunday, both Yugoslavia's President
Slobodan Milosevic and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica failed
to win over half of the votes and Milosevic insisted that the
country must go through a second vote.
</P>
<P>
But supporters of Kostunica claimed that the opposition leader
won the first vote and that Milosevic should step down.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Milosevic said at an army ceremony that he
would not accept any outside pressure to leave his post. He said
Yugoslavia would resist just as it had done when NATO bombed the
country.

<HEADLINE> Italian Governing Coalition Calls for European Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coalition's proposals, many of which will be presented at
December's Nice Conference discussing key changes in European
Union institutions ahead of expansion, emphasized the need for "a
strong political union and a renewed and strengthened social model.
"
</P>
<P>
A European Constitution, according to the Italian center-left,
is "essential" to "guarantee and apply basic rights," also setting
examples and parameters for would-be member states.
</P>
<P>
However, the document stressed that closer judicial cooperation
was vital to "guarantee these rights at a European level "further
requiring" the integration of European and national jurisdictional
resources."
</P>
<P>
The European monetary union also needs to be reconsidered,
noted the center-left, which distinguished between "currency
management" and "economy management".
</P>
<P>
The center-left's proposals also underlined the need for
greater security cooperation on an international level, including
a "stronger Europol" and the "realization of a common policy on
immigration and refugees."

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rain Causes Flooding in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 homes in the southern tip of Italy have so far been
evacuated and transport has ground to a near halt following the
closure of main roads, a stretch of the Calabria-Taranto railway
line and local Reggio Calabria Airport, after already swollen
rivers were aggravated by driving rain.
</P>
<P>
In northern regions of Piedmont and Val D'Aosta where it has
been raining solidly for 30 hours now, landslides, flooding and
falling trees have caused numerous accidents and local schools
were closed this morning, although no one has been seriously hurt
so far and authorities said the situation was "under control."
</P>
<P>
However, in southern region of Calabria, fears continue to grow
that local rivers may burst their banks repeating similar
disasters of 1952 and 1971.
</P>
<P>
The situation, which police forces on emergency standby
described as "alarming," has left smaller villages around Locride
isolated and many were without electricity.
</P>
<P>
Civil Protection Agency Head Franco Barberi, traveling to the
southern region of Reggio Calabria to discuss the situation with
local authorities has been delayed following the closure of the
airport, and may now arrive at Lamezia Terme instead.
</P>
<P>
Rain is still pelting in southern Italy, although conditions in
the north are expected to improve later in the day.

<TEXT>
<P>
The mission will begin the "heart" of station construction in
orbit, attaching two major components. Discovery will deliver an
exterior framework called the Z1 Truss and a third mating adapter.
</P>
<P>
The new truss houses four gyroscope devices that will become
the station's primary "sense of balance," and Ku-band
communications equipment. The truss contains parts of both systems,
but the full systems will not become active until another flight.
</P>
<P>
The International Space Station is a joint effort by the United
States, Russia, Europe, Japan, Canada and Brazil, and its
construction is expected to be completed in 2004.
