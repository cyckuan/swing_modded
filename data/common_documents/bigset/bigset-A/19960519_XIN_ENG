LUSAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Security measures have been
tightened around the state house wall fence following a bomb
explosion on the brick wall in Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
One policeman is deployed almost every 30 meters of the state
house wall fence while plainclothes men are wandering about the

This secret group has reportedly demanded the government
withdraw the draft constitution from parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A plant disease caused by a
fungus discriminately attacking orange fruit and leaves has been
rampant in western Ethiopia, the Ethiopian News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted expert of fruits and vegetables Getahun
Belete as saying that the plant disease, commonly known as spot
disease and affecting orange plantation, leaves and twigs, was
widely spreading in orange growing areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 170 hectares of farm land has been hard hit
by the epidemic, adding that the disease widely known by local
farmers as orange cholera was first detected in the area at the
end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fast spreading epidemic, he said, the supply to
market of orange fruit has been minimized and its qualities
decreased by far.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, farmers are using fertilizers
and fungicides hoeing their farm lands in order to control the
spread of the disease. The spraying of the pesticide will be
carried out in early June in all the areas affected by the
epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Survives Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
survived an assassination attempt on his life today in Turkey's
industrial city of Izmit, about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The local Anatolia news agency reported that a gunman wormed
his way into Demirel's bodyguards when the president stepped down
from a platform after delivering a speech to inaugurate a shopping
center in Izmit.
</P>
<P>
Sukru Cukurlu, the chief of the president's bodyguards,
immediately grasped the gunman's hand when he was trying to aim
his handgun at Demirel and overpowered him with the help of the
special police team.
</P>
<P>
The assailant's gun went off as he was being subdued by the
guards and the bullet wounded a local journalist in the
leg. Cukurlu was also lightly injured in his arm.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other bodyguards surrounded Demirel, who was
escorted to the airport by car at once.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the president was astonished by the assassination
attempt, but he kept relatively calm during the incident. His
wife, Nazmiye Demirel, was reportedly seen very nervous.
</P>
<P>
The president left for Ankara at 18:00 local time (15:00 GMT),
said Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, who was later identified as Ibrahim Gumrukcuoglu,
aged 48, is an owner of a local drugstore.
</P>
<P>
According to initial investigation, Gumrukcuoglu was found with
some psychological problems, the Anatolia news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants to Improve Relations with Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Iraq's National
Assembly (Parliament) Saadoun Hammadi has stressed that Iraq is
ready to make efforts to develop relations with neighboring Jordan
at any time.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with Jordanian ambassador in
Baghdad Basam Gagis Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who had been recalled by the Jordanian
government following the murder of five Jordanians in Iraq, just
returned to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Gagis said that the development of bilateral relations with
Iraq is a matter concerning the fate of his country and the ties
will be maintained in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi stressed the need to strengthen cooperation with Jordan
and increase the exchange of visits between officials from the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will do everything that is conducive to the development of
bilateral ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the defection to Jordan of Iraq's former minister of
industry and minerals Hussein Kamel Hassan, President Saddam
Hussein's son-in-law, relations between Iraq and Jordan have
turned sour. But both sides are apparently aware of the importance
of maintaining their relations.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. approval, Iraq exports a limited quantity of oil
to Jordan in exchange for badly needed food and other humanitarian
supplies while Jordan sees Iraq as a market for its export.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Kamel Hassan and his brother Saddam, also the
Iraqi president's son-in-law, defected to Jordan together with
their wives.
</P>
<P>
The two brothers were murdered in Baghdad last February after
their surprise return to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Speaker Meets with Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament Speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik held talks today with international High
Representative Carl Bildt over the appointment of a new premier.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik told reporters in the Serb stronghold of Pale that he
had informed Bildt on the election of Gojko Klickovic to replace
Rajko Kasagic who was sacked by Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Klickovic, an economist and also a hardliner, was elected to
the premiers' office by the Serb parliament at a special session
held early today in Pale in the suburb of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament had "backed and confirmed the decision of
Serb President Radovan Karadzic to replace Kasagic" and now
"points had been cleared up and good solutions had been found in
talks with Bildt," the Tanjug news agency quoted the speaker as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been enraged to the dismissal
of Kasagic, a moderate Serb leader who was willing to cooperate
with the Muslim-Croat federation, the other entity in Bosnia.
Western countries fear that the sacking of Kasagic would deal a
heavy blow to the fragile peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik also said he had presented to Bildt a list of names
of the 46 deputies who had voted to approve the dismissal of
Kasagic as prime minister. Kasagic said Thursday he would stay in
office until parliament confirms the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the cabinet would not undergo any reshuffle and
the new prime minister was obliged to implement the government's
and parliament's platform for the enforcement of the Dayton peace
accords for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The talks held with Bildt were attended by new Prime Minister
Klickovic and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, emerging from the talks with Serb leaders in Pale,
Bildt told reporters that he would not be able to comment on the
latest developments in the Serb leadership until he gets full
information later in the day or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he still supported the dismissed Prime Minister
Kasagic, Bildt said his task was not to support anyone, but to
ensure the full implementation of the Dayton agreement. "This is
not a personal question but a political one," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Two recently discovered
asteroids, one about 530 meters and the other 1,200 meters in
diameter, will narrowly pass Earth on Sunday and next week,
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The first object, called 1996 JA-1, the largest ever observed
asteroid passing so close, will miss Earth by about 446,000
kilometers at about 12:48 p.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There is no chance of an actual collision, scientists said. It
will come closer to Earth but will not come as close as the moon,
which is 384,000 kilometers from Earth.
</P>
<P>
Carl Hergenrother of the University of Arizona and Timothy
Spahr of the University of Florida made the latest discovery
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They were using a 16-inch diameter telescope on Mount Lemmon,
just outside Tucson, Arizona, and detected it on photographs each
of the two previous nights.
</P>
<P>
Another recently discovered asteroid, perhaps 1,200 kilometers
in diameter, is expected to pass within 3 million kilometers of
Earth a week later.

</P>
<P>
After Namibia's independence, he said, the friendly relations
between two countries have been enhanced. Nujoma added that
Namibia is "grateful to China" for its assistance in various
fields after Namibia's independence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described Nujoma, who had visited China many times, as
"an old friend of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president echoed Nujoma by saying that
Sino-Namibian relations have been growing very well since
Namibia's independence.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma is to host a state banquet this evening in honor of the
Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Nujoma are scheduled to hold formal talks tomorrow
morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 19th session of the Arab
Satellite (Arabsat) Organization General Assembly opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Communications ministers and representatives from 15 Arab
states are attending the assembly. They would discuss the finance
of Arabsat and the preparations being made for the launching of
the organization's second generation of satellites.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening meeting of the assembly, Egyptian
Minister of Transport, Communications and Civil Aviation Soleiman
Metwally said that the profits secured by Arabsat have enabled it
to finance part of the cost of the second generation of Arab
satellites, the first of which is scheduled to be launched on July
5 this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that all channels of the satellite have been rented by
Arab agencies and companies. Arabsat is scheduled to launch a
second satellite in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Metwally pointed out that a most up-to-date third satellite of
the second generation would be purchased and launched not later
than the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He expected the Arabsat Organization to earn revenues totaling
2 billion U.S. dollars during the period from this year to the
year 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The remains of 800 Iranians killed
in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war have been found in the former
battlefields along the borders, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted Brig. General Mirfeisal Baqerzadeh as saying that
the remains had been discovered over the last seven months.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the remains had been identified, he said,
adding that families will be informed soon.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Iran established a commission to locate men listed as
missing in actions (MIAs) during the war. The commission has
discovered the remains of more than 25,000 MIAs in the former
battlegrounds since then, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some 1 million people on both Iraqi and Iranian
sides were killed during the eight-year war.

AMMAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan here today

<P>
He telephoned Demirel to congratulate him on his escape from

Demirel's bodyguards intervened and subdued the gunmen after he
was trying to aim his handgun at Demirel.

bodyguards and the bullet wounded a local journalist in the
leg. The president was unhurt.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlord Shuns UN, US Peacekeeping Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The proposals of deploying the
United Nations or United States peacekeeping forces in wartorn
Liberia to replace Afrian peacekeepers were today rejected by the
country's largest warlord.
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, whose troops have been clashing with Krahn
rebels since early last month in the latest round of violence in
Libeia's six-year-old war, said ''the role of the UN in Monrovia
should remain as an observers' mission.''
</P>
<P>
A radio report monitored here today quoted Taylor as also
having rejected local civilians' request for US marines currently
guarding the US Embassy in monrovia to intervene in the factional
fighting.
</P>
<P>
''The role of the US marines should be limited to protecting
the embassy and installations," said Taylor, adding any external
intervention would be seen as "an attempt to marginalise the role
of the African peacekeepers,'' known as the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
James Jonah, one of the UN special envoys to Liberia, had
earlier suggested that the UN should take charge in Liberia to
end the factional clashes and boost the prospect of peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African-American congressmen had also proposed to
increase the role of the U.S. marines to peacekeepers in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping role of Ecomog, which had been deployed in
Monrovia since August, 1990, has been under attack as the west
African soldiers failed to stop the latest round of armed clashes
among warring factions and to enforce the Abuja peace accord
installed in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The fighting caused the exdos of refugees and led to the death
of hundreds of soldiers and civilians in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on Friday, Taylor told CNN he had forbidden any more
ships from leaving monrovia.
</P>
<P>
''I have ordered that no other ships are to be permitted to
leave the harbor with our people,'' he said. ''Some people are
trying to use the situation of these ships to show there is
anarchy in Liberia and this is not the case."
</P>
<P>
Taylor said safe havens would be set up to encourage refugees
to return home, adding that the U.N. agencies would provide food
and medicine to the refugees who are to be protected by the
ecomog soldiers.
</P>
<P>
''I suggest that Liberians buckle up their belts, come
together and try to resolve this thing where we can have election
in August,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Chairman of Liberia's interim
government Wilton Sankawolo said today that his government would
enforce the agreement reached by west African foreign ministers
earlier in Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a local radio today, Sankawolo said the
''government troops'' which is actually formed by factional
soldiers of Charles Taylor and another Liberian warlord, Alhaji
Kromah, would not retreat from the capital until the ecomog is in
full control of the city.
</P>
<P>
He also said krahan factional leader Roosevelt Johnson, the
rival of Taylor and Kromah, should lead his supporting troops out
of the streets of Monrovia to enable a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
''Now the government troops would only fight in
self-defense,'' said Sankawolo, who was installed as chairman of
the ruling council of state according to the Abuja peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also appealed to all the council members,
including Taylor and Kromah, to come back to the negotiating
table to make a ceasefire strike.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Endeavour Blasts Off For A 10-day Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Space shuttle Endeavour
blasted into orbit Sunday morning right on time as schedule with
six astronauts for a 10-day mission.
</P>
<P>
The 77th shuttle flight and the fourth of eight missions
planned for this year -- features an experiment to inflate a
reflective dish-type antenna in orbit. Once released from the
shuttle, the antennas will be inflated with nitrogen gas to expand
to 46 feet in diameter and will be mounted on three struts 92 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
NASA hope the lightweight antennas could drastically reduce
launch costs of a variety of space systems, including deep space
probes and Earth radar mappers in the future.
</P>
<P>
The six crew will also release two satellites, and retrieve one
of them minus the antenna it contains during the 10-day mission.
</P>
<P>
The experiments also include semiconductor crystals growing,
plant-growth study, tests of a drug to boost immune system and
test of Coca-Cola's new soda dispenser and sample Coke.
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Endeavour is due back at Kennedy Space Center on May
29.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Pakistan to Improve Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan needs to further improve
its investment environment, focusing mainly on institutional
reforms, perfecting laws and simplifying investment approval
procedures.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here today by Syed Mohib Ullah Shah,
Secretary and founder of Pakistan's Board of Investment (BOI) in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The BOI general executive official, who acquired his Master's
degree in business administration from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the United States and has wide-ranging experience in
local administration and economic management, talked about the
investment environment in Pakistan, the problems the country is
facing and its investment prospect.
</P>
<P>
The BOI secretary said that Pakistan needs institutional
reforms for more efficiency. He believes that "single body
dealing with investment will become easy in creating reality in
one step".
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign investment, Pakistan will also have to
reform and perfect certain out-dated laws, further simplify
investment approval procedures, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Mohib Ullah Shah also stressed the need for reforms in training
and culture, especially those of government functionaries, to
raise the management standard.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan started its major campaign to attract foreign
investment in 1989, during which the Board of Investment was
established. In some way, Pakistan was a late starter. However,
over the past seven years, the country has made remarkable
achievements in attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures issued by the Federal Bureau of Statistics
showed that a total of 640 million US dollars of direct foreign
investment has flowed into Pakistan in the first nine months of
the current fiscal year (July 1995-June 1996).
</P>
<P>
The BOI is even eyeing one billion dollars direct foreign
investment by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Pakistan has attracted direct private
foreign investment of more than 2.1 billion dollars that equals
the amount of private foreign investment in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the Pakistani government has taken a number of bold
economic initiatives to attract foreign investment. As a result,
foreign exchange control has now been released and restrictions on
repatriation of profits have also been lifted.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate investment, no permission is now required either
from the government or from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) by
companies for obtaining foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, no prior permission for the SBP is needed for issue
and transfer of shares certificates to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also lifted restrictions on foreign equity holding
in local enterprises. In fact, Pakistan is the only country in
the South Asian region to allow 100 percent foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the rapid increase of foreign investment, the impact
of these incentives is evident from the increase in the number of
listed foreign companies which have risen from 492 in 1990 to 776.
</P>
<P>
Major foreign investors in Pakistan include the United States,
Britain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The BOI secretary said it is really encouraging that due to the
successful marketing of Pakistan's investment policies and
products, those non-traditional investors like Japan, the UAE and
Hong Kong have also started their investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mohib Ullah Shah said major foreign investments in Pakistan are
now mainly in energy, power and transportation sectors. These, he
believes, are expected to make great contributions to the
development of Pakistan's economy as well as to boosting exports.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan will have to widen its export base,
develop export-oriented industries, especially in agro-food and
its related industry, engineering goods industry, software and
electronics as well as autos and tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The BOI official expressed his optimism that Pakistan has the
great potential in attracting more foreign investment along with
its efforts to improve infrastructure and skilled manpower
training.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Wanda Forced to Second Draw in China Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda was held to its second
draw while the Chinese Army team was beaten for the first time
this season at the sixth round of the Chinese soccer league on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian team, which had a flying start this season with four
consecutive away wins, was held 1-1 by Guangdong Hongyuan in
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
You Shaodong put Guangdong Hongyuan 1-0 at the 30th minute but
only 5 minutes later Wang Tao converted a penalty shot to level
the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Dalian Wanda was held to a 0-0 draw at home by
Guangzhou Songri, another team from Guangdong Province in the
Chinese soccer league.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by last week's draw with Dalian Wanda, Guangzhou
Songri played a high-spirited game at home Sunday, beating the
Chinese Army team 2-1 for their first win in the league.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Songri led 1-0 with a goal from Vladan Radosavhevic
of Yugoslavia at the 17th minute and Wu Weiquan made it 2-0 eight
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Army team, which had a clean sheet in the first
five rounds this season, narrowed the gap to 2-1 through Sun
Xinming just before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Shanghai Shenhua, recovering from last week's
shock defeat to Guangzhou Apollo, handed Yanbian Hyundai its third
loss this season.
</P>
<P>
Qi Hong was the hero of the match as he scored a rare hat-trick
in Chinese soccer league to give the defending champion a perfect
away victory.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an edged Guangzhou Apollo 1-0 with a controversial
penalty shot. The victory promoted the Beijing squad to the
fourth place on the list while Guangzhou Apollo dropped to the
third place after Dalian Wanda and Shanghai Shenhua.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Quanxin entertained a crowd of 40,000 home fans with a
2-1 victory over Shenzhen. Brazilian forward Marcelo Marmelo Da
Silva opened the scoring with an unbelievable shot which left the
Shenzhen goal-keeper puzzled.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan team's captain Wei Qun, also a member of the
Chinese national team, proved that he is one of the best attacking
defenders in China with a spectacular goal, his third goal in
three matches.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen team also had their reasons to celebrate for. The
team, promoted to the top-flight league this season, finally
scored their first goal in the league through Ji Jie.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches on Sunday, Jinan Taishan was forced to a
1-1 draw with Tianjin Samsung and the latter had to stay at the
bottom of the standings for another week.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tree Planting Makes Hong Kong Greener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- With the help of her father,
four-year-old Katherine Wright planted a tallow tree sapling as
tall as herself. She and her father Tom were among the 2,000
participants in today's "Greening of Hong Kong" event.
</P>
<P>
The father, working in Hong Kong's leading airline Cathay
Pacific, said: "It's a great day. I bring my daughter here and
I'll let her know we plant for the next generation."
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Cathay Pacific staffers and their family
members took part in Hong Kong's biggest tree-planting event today
to mark the birth of a new country park and the 50th anniversary
of the airline.
</P>
<P>
Two local environmental groups -- the Conservancy Association
and Friends of the Earth -- organized community members to join in
the greening action.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, they planted 35,000 tree saplings of 17 species in
Wan Tsai Peninsula in the northwestern part of the New
Territories. The peninsula and three small offshore islands will
soon become the new extension of Sai Kung West Country Park. The
extended area totals 123 hectares, equivalent to the size of 242
soccer fields.
</P>
<P>
Bowen Leung, secretary of Planning, Environment and Lands,
kicked off the event by planting a tallow tree sapling. He said
that Hong Kong people are taking actions to show their
determination to create a better environment.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of elderly people in their 70s planted trees on a plot
of land near the shore though they wished they could have climbed
the hill to add a color of green there, as large groups of young
people did. They were all members of the Conservancy Association,
which has been devoted to natural conservation since its founding
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ng Cho Nam, chairman of the Association, said: "We expect
to organize people of different age groups to take part in the
various conservation projects to protect our natural environment."
</P>
<P>
The greening activity was jointly organized by Cathay Pacific,
the Conservancy Association and Friends of the Earth. The
Agriculture and Fisheries Department gave full support.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Army General Djukic Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Army General Djordje
Djukic, released by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague late
April because of ill health, died of cancer here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Djukic, the deputy chief of staff in charge of logistics in the
Serb army during the Bosnian war, died at the Belgrade military
academy hospital after undergoing a surgery for pancreatic cancer
a few months ago, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Djukic was arrested along with another Serb officer Col. Aleksa
Krsmanovic on January 30 by Muslim police near Sarajevo on charges
of committing war crimes. On February 8, they were extradited to
The Hague for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
During an investigation in March, Djukic pleaded not guilty for
war crimes during the three-and-half-year-long Bosnian war. He was
released on "humanitarian ground" on April 26 and flew to Belgrade
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The ailing Krsmanovic, 62, was released earlier as there was no
evidence against him as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
The general was born in 1934 in Glamoc, southwestern Bosnia,
then graduated from a military academy. He was believed to have
close relations with Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic, one of the
most prominent indicted suspects by The Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal is the first international body for the
prosecution of war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo judgement
in the 1940s.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Evade 16 Billion Yuan in Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A national investigation has
disclosed that about half of the 410,000 checked state-owned
enterprises were found to have evaded taxes.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 national check on financial affairs and taxation,
which was conducted by the Ministry of Finance, showed that about
half of the 410,000 checked state-owned enterprises were found to
have defaulted on a total of 12.8 billion yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Out of 1.683 million enterprises and institutions, 771,300 were
found to have evaded 16.577 billion yuan in taxes last year, a
five-percent rise over the previous year, according to the check.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion is still serious among the country's enterprises
and institutions, though the same kind of inspections have been
made annually over the past decade, said officials with the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the losses to loopholes in tax supervision
work, weak enforcement of laws on taxation and lack of awareness
among the enterprises of the importance of paying taxes.

<HEADLINE> Ten Die Of Lassa Fever In S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- About 10 people have died of the
dreaded disease of Lassa fever in the Kenema Government Hospital
in eastern Sierra Leone, according to a local medical officer.
</P>
<P>
Dr Joseph Musa told local journalists Saturday that the deaths
cover the month of April and early May.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in Freetown said urgent relief and drugs have
been sent to the eastern towns of Segbwema and Tongo Field to
"aid" an unspecified number of patients now admitted at the
methodist-run Nixon Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
A World Health Organization (WHO) official described Lassa
fever as "highly contagious" and spread by rodents through direct
or indirect contacts with food or water contaminated by their
urine.
</P>
<P>
"The symptoms are general malaise, pains in the limbs, swollen
face, bleeding and the passing of black stools,'' the official
explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Alusine Conteh of the Nongowa Clinic in
Kenema, "suspected cases are currently under surveillance," but
he did not say how many were involved.
</P>
<P>
Dr Conteh attributed the current outbreak to the "withdrawal
of project clinics" in Panguma, Segbwema and Kenema, closed down
during the escalation of the rebel war in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, no adequate information campaign is being
conducted for the general public on the virus and its
transmission and ways to avoid infection," he added.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in Tongo Field said the "growing threat of
Lassa fever is due to overcrowding, poor sanitation, and exposure
of food."

PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Eric Cantona was omitted from the
French squad for the 96 European Soccer Championships in England.
</P>
<P>
Michael Madar of Monaco has been preferred to Cantona, former
captain of the French national team.
</P>
<P>
David Ginola and Jean-Pierre Papin were other famous absentees
as coach Aime Jacquet kept faith with the players who has
registered a 20-match unbeaten run for the French team.
</P>
<P>
Cantona, who is perhaps in his career's best form, has not
played for his national team since January last year.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he played a major role in helping
Manchester United to a league and F.A. Cup doubles this season.
He even scored the winner in last week's Cup final against
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
He was voted English footballer of the year for his brilliant

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Explore New Tourism Market in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali tourism sales delegation
left here today for South Africa aiming at seeking a new market
for the country's hungry tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of 23 government officials and industry
representatives led by Tourism Minister Chakra Prasad Bastola is
scheduled to visit major South African cities, including
Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban, where they would
meet with the local press and those from South African tourism
business circles.
</P>
<P>
According to the tourism minister, Nepal is launching its
tourism promotion campaign in South Africa by following the
examples of other Asian countries like India, Singapore and
Indonesia that have been successful in attracting tourists from
that country.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is one of Nepal's major sources of hard
currency, attracting more than 300,000 foreign visitors every year
and contributing about 80 million US dollars in foreign exchange
to the country economy.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's traditional tourism markets are North America, West
Europe, Japan, Australia and India.
</P>
<P>
The sudden propensity to travel and the adventurous spirit
among South Africans are among the main reasons why Nepal, which
has gained its popularity as an adventure travel destination in
recent years with its rugged terrain and snow-capped mountains,
has chosen South Africa as its new prospect of tourism market,
industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Plans are being considered to organize similar promotion
missions to Scandinavia and other markets, they added.

MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will draw
safety nets in case "a compromise solution" is adopted for the
excise tax reform.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential task force on tax and tariff
reforms, the details of the compromise proposal should be studied
carefully.
</P>
<P>
The task force sources said it is better to use floor tax for
lower-priced beer and cigarettes and a compound rate, specific tax
plus ad valorem rate, for higher priced beer and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
They noted that these safety nets would introduce equity into
the measure by enabling the government to generate more revenues
from higher-priced products.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Faster Elimination of Poverty in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
urged local officials in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region to put poverty relief top of the agenda, so as to achieve
the national goal of eliminating poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the appeal during
his inspection tour of some poor areas of Ningxia over the past
week.
</P>
<P>
He praised local governments for helping local residents to get
rid of poverty with the support of the central government, while
pointing out that there are still many poor people living in
secluded areas with bad conditions.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how big the difficulty is, all the poor people must
be relieved of poverty by the end of the century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"That is the pressing requirement of poor farmers, as well as
the responsibility of various Communist Party and government
departments," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Along with the rapid growth of China's national economy, it is
entirely possible that all impoverished people will have enough
food and clothes "if we are determined to strengthen measures," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier pointed out that the biggest problem for poor
areas in Ningxia is the lack of water. Therefore, he called on
local people to construct more water conservancy projects in an
effort to improve rural production conditions.
</P>
<P>
While raising grain production, local people should also engage
in township enterprises featuring agricultural product processing,
so as to leave poverty behind as quickly as possible, he said.

MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress will pass
the law exempting official development assistance (ODA) loans from
the foreign debt ceiling before the close of its 10th session this
June.
</P>
<P>
This was the assurance of Representative Renato Diaz of the
House Committee on Ways and Means, who also authored the twin
bills on foreign borrowing limits.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said over the weekend that Congress hopes to enact soon
the first of his two bills which seeks "to facilitate the
absorption and optimize the utilization of highly concessional ODA
resources and for other purposes."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has warned the Philippines that it
would not release another yen loan package unless the Philippine
Congress amends the 10 billion US dollars foreign debt ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank has also expressed concern about the
impact of the debt ceiling on new loans for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, President Fidel Ramos urged Congress to
expedite the passage of the bills that would lift the ceiling to
enable the country to tap loans which are necessary to fund the
country's development programs.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: Iran Wants to Improve Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran has decided to improve
relations with Egypt in various fields, President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jumhuri Islami today carried the full text of
Rafsanjani's interview with European Television, the Cable News
Network, last week.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said, "Our ties with Egypt is not good enough
at present. We are planning to improve our ties economically,
culturally and politically."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that this is the second time for President
 Rafsanjani to extend the olive branch to his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak within two months.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rafsanjani said at a press conference that he had
been working hard for the resumption of full diplomatic ties
between Tehran and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the recent statement by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in rejecting the allegations raised by
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on Iran's nuclear capability
was welcomed in Tehran and received as a sign of Cairo's interest
in having better ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said Iran and Egypt are now jointly involved in the
construction of a sugarcane processing complex on a large plot of
agro-industrial land in Ahwaz, southwestern province of Khuzestan
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry has tried on many occasions to
improve ties with Egypt, but the attempts have been aborted by
hostile speeches by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and
extremist print media.
</P>
<P>
But well-informed sources said that although official
diplomatic ties do not exist between the two countries at
present, the Iranian and Egyptian leaders consult each other
about key regional issues through private channels and the
foreign ministers of the two countries have regularly contacts
with each other.

<HEADLINE> Draft for Large Oil Project in Kuwait to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 19 (Xinhua)--The final draft for a world-
scale oil processing project in Kuwait will be finalized soon
though the competition for the large deal supposed to be
constructed with a foreign partner is still open, a Kuwaiti
company official said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Kuwaiti News Agency (Kuna)
Saturday, Chairman of the Board and Managing Director of the
Petrochemical Industries Company Khaled Bou Hamara said the final
draft of the proposed aromatic complex, so far the largest of its
kind in Kuwait, would be finalized this summer.
</P>
<P>
A study on the project's framework is expected to be completed
by the end of this month, he said, adding that the complex final
cost and feasibility were also under study and its technical
aspects, units and production capacity are in the preparatory stage.
</P>
<P>
Bou Hamara said the aromatic complex would considerably boost
the Kuwaiti industry and economy, especially if supportive
industries are taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
It would be designed to produce some 600,000 tonnes a year of
aromatic products such as benzene, toluene and mixed xylenes,
which are used in the manufacture of synthetic textiles such as
acrylic fiber, according to the board chairman.
</P>
<P>
Bou Hamara said the complex which would provide some 600 new
jobs for Kuwaitis is estimated to cost 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In this project, the foreign partner is required to possess the
technology and experience to run and operate modern units,
provide experts and competitive marketing potentials. The complex
is expected to come into operation in three years.
</P>
<P>
So far bid for the project is still open to foreign
competitors with the U.S. Amoco Company as the most possible winner
in the bid contest.
</P>
<P>
Bou Hamara said earlier last week that his company was
negotiating a letter of intent with the potential U.S. partner.
</P>
<P>
"If we decide to go ahead, we are almost ready to sign the
letter of interest, " he said. "But at this stage, we have not
closed the doors on talking to others," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Secret Documents Decisive on U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has said that Iran possesses secret documents which
would produce decisive impact on U.S. politics if they are
made public, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the statement in an interview with European
Television Cable News Network last week, which was carried on the
front page of the Persian daily Jomhuri Islami today.
</P>
<P>
The President said in the interview that the publication of the
secret documents would have decisive impact on the American public
opinion toward their government and the upcoming U.S. presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
His remarks remind the people of Iran the Contra crisis,
in which the Reagan Administration sold arms to Iran and used
the fund to finance the Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries in
their struggle against the Sandinista government.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president answered a wide range of questions
on terrorism, postwar development, U.S. sanctions against Iran
and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said his government is presently in possession of
documents and information regarding either of the two American
political parties, the Republicans and Democrats, which could be
released on the eve of the U.S. presidential elections and
disrupt their results because of the influence upon the public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani said, "We would not engage in that kind
game, and would let the (American) people elect whoever they
want."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. foreign policy toward Iran does
not shift with which party assumes power in the United States
and which party the man in the White House belongs to.
</P>
<P>
He termed the U.S. political and economic scheme against Iran
as "unfair" and unsuccessful in many ways. The American sanction
on Iran has had "no effect", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president referred to the recent inauguration of
the trans-Asian railway as another demonstration of success by
Iran and a failure in Washington's attempt to isolate Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington's pressure on members of European
Union amounts to blackmail, adding that Americans are not able to
"convince" their European allies regarding their policies toward
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Boost Joint-Stock Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has decided
to convert a number of state-owned enterprises into joint-stock
companies, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
This measure, which was promulgated in a government decree
released early this month, aimed to mobilize more capital from
the enterprises and other domestic and foreign organizations to
develop the country's economy, the VNA said.
</P>
<P>
To date, eight state-run enterprises in Vietnam have been
experimentally turned into joint-stock companies in accordance
with company laws.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, those which will not be turned into
joint-stock companies include enterprises engaging in electricity
production, water supply, petrol, oil and gas exploitation and
refining, non-ferrous metals, precious and rare minerals,
explosives, toxic chemicals, specific pharmaceutical products,
telecommunication, military equipment and weapons production.
</P>
<P>
Key sectors with high revenues such as steel, cement, beer and
tobacco industries are also exempted from conversion.
</P>
<P>
In newly-established stock enterprises, employees will be given
first priority to purchase up to 40 percent of company shares
while the government holds 51 percent. The remainder will be sold
to the public including foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Before 1992, the country had some 12,000 state-run businesses
which turned out 30 percent of the gross domestic product each
year.
</P>
<P>
However, few of these enterprises are profitable, though they
accounted for 56 percent of the total industrial output value and
60 percent of the state budget revenues, the VNA said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992-94 period, the number of state-run enterprises fell
by 50 percent, with 30 percent merged with other businesses and 20
percent dissolved.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 6,000 state-run businesses in Vietnam
and they will be reorganized in 1996-97, the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Vows to Avenge Arrest of Top Activist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance Movement,
Hamas, has vowed to revenge for the arrest of its top activist
Hassan Salameh, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Salameh, the No. 2 fugitive on Israeli security forces' wanted
list, was seriously wounded and arrested by Israeli soldiers on
Friday night at a roadblock in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassam, the military wing of the Hamas, in a leaflet
issued Saturday, threatened to avenge the capture of Salameh,
deputy for Mohammed Dief, head of the military wing.
</P>
<P>
"The Kassam brigades will not hesitate to carry out the
strongest revenge against the coward Zionists for this ugly
crime," the military group said in the leaflet.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassam also stressed that the capture of Salameh will
not affect the ability of the the military group.
</P>
<P>
Salameh, suspected of planning three suicide bombing attacks
in Jerusalem and Ashkelon in February and March, which killed at
least 40 people, now is treated in a Jerusalem hospital.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Dayan from the Israeli army Central Command said that
Salameh was planning new terrorist attacks against Israeli targets
before his capture.
</P>
<P>
But Dayan stressed that Salameh's capture would not put an end
to "immediate terrorist attacks," adding that "fighting terrorism
is a long process and you cannot win by one step."
</P>
<P>
He also praised Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian
Preventive Security Service in the West Bank, and the Palestinian
police for assisting in the capture of Salameh.
</P>
<P>
"What important is not the relation, but the determination of
Jibril Rajoub to fight terrorism even among his distant
relatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Razak Rajoub, who was driving the van with Salameh before his
capture, is a relative of Jibril Rajoub. He immediately
surrendered when the Israeli army stopped the van.
</P>
<P>
Following his capture, the Israeli army began rounding up
suspects, and so far eight Palestinians have been arrested for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli army tightened the strict closure on
the West Bank Saturday night, in an effort to prevent possible
violent attacks to avenge Salameh's capture.
</P>
<P>
Only VIPs and diplomats will be allowed into Israel and
permits will only be given to medical workers coming from the
West Bank to Jerusalem hospitals on an individual basis, the army
said.

<HEADLINE> IRA Expected to Restore Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA),
which firmly fights for reunification of the whole island of
Ireland, is expected to renew its truce on May 22, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The was revealed by Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political
wing Sinn Fein, who gave the message in a telephone call to Irish
Prime Minister John Bruton last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The message was also relayed from Bruton to John Major, his
British counterpart.
</P>
<P>
One leading member of the IRA was quoted as saying: "The
ceasefire is just a rubber stamp job now."
</P>
<P>
The revelation is seen as a response from the IRA and Sinn Fein
to John Major's promise that the planned all-party talks process
on the future of Northern Ireland scheduled for June 10 would be
"genuine and serious."
</P>
<P>
In an article written for the Irish Times newspaper last
Thursday, Major said that the row over arms decommissioning by
rival paramilitary groups would not be allowed to impede all-party
talks of Ulster's future.
</P>
<P>
He promised that disarmament would be tackled at the start of
the talks without blocking the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister naturally repeated his government's position
that Sinn Fein as the political wing of the IRA could not be
admitted to the talks until the IRA renewed its truce, which has
been shattered with a huge blast in east London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Bruton immediately expressed his welcome to Major's promise and
urged Sinn Fein and the IRA to "restore your ceasefire now."
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mirror weekly quoted an IRA army council member as
saying: "John Major has finally given us the guarantees we
demanded."
</P>
<P>
"We have been given to understand that conditions will be right
for Sinn Fein to enter the all-party talks," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Leadership Discuss Latest Development in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's supreme ruling body, the
Revolution Command Council, and the Arab Baath Party regional
command held here Saturday a joint meeting discussing the latest
development in the ongoing Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food talks.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi state-run TV reported Saturday night that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein who appeared in high spirit on the screen
chaired the joint meeting. The TV report did not give any detail
of what was discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the meeting was definitely devoted
to the discussion of the latest development in the current fourth
round of Iraqi-U.N. oil talks since it was held at a critical time
when negotiators of both Iraq and the U.N. will report
respectively to the Iraqi government and the U.N. Security Council
about what have been achieved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations clamped comprehensive sanctions on Iraq as a
punishment for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The oil-for-food plan
will enable Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil every six
months to buy food for its people.
</P>
<P>
Following the TV report, Iraqis, who have been suffering
severely from more than five years of the sanctions, are more
optimistic than ever about an imminent signing of an agreement
between Iraq and the Unite Nations. A success of the talks would
allow Iraq a partial oil sale in exchange for badly needed food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods.

ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay left here this morning for a one-day working visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure at the Ankara Esenboga Airport, Gonensay
told reporters that he would explain to U.S. government officials
the Turkey-proposed methods on how to solve the problems between
Turkey and Greece, including the Aegean islet dispute.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would also discuss with the U.S. government
officials the extension of the Provide Comfort, a U.S.-led
multinational force based in Turkey to protect Iraqi Kurds.
</P>

The Turkish foreign minister will also hold talks on the
cooperation and bilateral relations between the two countries as
well as the protection of peace and stability in the Middle East.

counterpart Warren Christopher, Secretary of Defense William Perry
and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, both Greece and Turkey organized foreign
journalists to tour the waters around the Turco-Greek disputed
islet of Kardak, or Imia. The islet is known as Imia by the Greeks
and Kardak by the Turks.
</P>
<P>
Both the two NATO members had planned to carry journalists by
military vessels to the disputed area but later gave up apparently
in an bid to prevent any military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries nearly came to war in January
following the claims over the small Kardak (Imia) islet by both
countries.

ATLANTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Americans Michael Johnson, Gwen
Torrence and Carl Lewis shocked the world with their blistering
speed in the Atlanta Grand Prix athletics meet here Saturday at
the Olympic Games Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Two months before opening ceremonies, Olympic Stadium was
dedicated today with the eye-popped meet, an event that brought
together an especially strong field from the world and gave the
athletes a taste of the 90-degree (32 degs. Celsius) temperatures
they can expect in July.
</P>
<P>
Johnson blazed around the same track where he hopes to make
Olympic history this summer, winning his 19th straight race at 200
meters with the fastest time in the world this year, 19.83
seconds. He needed every bit of speed to beat 1992 Olympic
champion Michael Marsh, who was second at 19.88.
</P>
<P>
``Marsh put a little pressure on me,'' said Johnson, who
overtook his closest rival with 50 yards (yards) to go and barely
held on. ``I was just trying to bide my time. I felt like I still
had another gear left. I was trying to gradually catch him and
pass him.''
</P>
<P>
Torrence thrilled her hometown crowd when the world champion
won the 100 with the fastest time in the world this year, 10.85,
then took a fist-pumping, hand-waving victory lap around the new
track before a standing ovation from the crowd of 43,328.
</P>
<P>
``This helps as far as getting the jitters out of the way,''
Torrence said of the event, which included a dedication ceremony
attended by Vice President Al Gore, IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch and Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne.
</P>
<P>
Torrence was slow out of the blocks but took command midway
down the track and won by several feet over Carlette Guidry. Gail
Devers, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, was a disappointing sixth
at 11.20.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, an eight-time gold medalist trying to make his fourth
Olympics at age 35, proved he isn't over the hill yet. The
American hero got off to his usual slow start from the blocks in
the 100 but finished second at 9.94. In his best showing of the
year, he lost to Dennis Mitchell (9.93) in a photo finish.
</P>
<P>
``I'm all the way back. This is the first time since 1991 that
I've broke 10 (seconds),'' said Lewis, who had a dismal indoor
season and admits that he would have been retired if the Olympics
had not been in his home country. ``I've had to rebuild my own
confidence. I feel like myself again.''
</P>
<P>
So does Mitchell, who ranked first in the world in 1994 but
dropped to ninth last year.
</P>
<P>
``I want everything to be mine,'' he said. ``I invite the
pressure and I've dedicated myself.''
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who hopes to become the first man to win Olympic gold
in the 200 and 400, will have plenty of competition in the latter
if Saturday's meet was any indication.
</P>
<P>
World record holders Sergey Bubka of Ukraine, Javier Sotomayer
of Cuba, Jonathan Edwards of Great Britain and Noureddine Morceli
of Algeria all won their events.
</P>
<P>
Bubka cleared 6.03 meters in the pole vault and attempted to
break his 2-year-old outdoor record of 6.14 meters, but he failed
in three attempts.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayer won the high jump with a 2.33-meter jump, Morceli ran
the fastest outdoor mile in U.S. history with a time of 3:50.86
and Edwards captured the triple jump.
</P>
<P>
Workers put the final touches on the new stadium Friday, and
the meet was held under a blistering sun. That's just a taste of
the heat the competitors will feel when they return to Atlanta for
the Games, which begin July 19.
</P>
<P>
``The biggest problem was the heat, of course,'' Bubka
said. ``I can't imagine it being worse for the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Crowds, Cheers Greet Olympic Torch, in Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic torch - its flame
fanned by gusty winds - entered Oklahoma Saturday to the applause
and cheers of thousands of Oklahomans who lined the torch relay
route, according to press reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
``We've got an excellent crowd. It's wonderful. It just gives
you chills,'' said Elana Mears, a spokeswoman for the Olympic
Torch Relay who rode with a caravan of vehicles that is escort the
torch on its way to the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Oklahomans waving American flags stood at the
Oklahoma state line along U.S. Highway 77 as a bicyclist from USA
Cycling carried the 1.6-kilogram torch from Kansas at 12:14 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The relay was slightly behind schedule as it butted against
southeasterly winds that gusted to more than 25 mph (40 kph).
</P>
<P>
``It's a pretty steady crowd, especially for it being this
rural,'' Mears said. ``People from all walks of life. People
waving, holding American flags.''
</P>
<P>
The torch was cycled past grasslands and farmlands on the way
to its first stop in a 517-kilometer, two-day trip through
Oklahoma - the city of Newkirk in Kay County. Hundreds of people
armed with cameras and camcorders lined the roadway as the torch
passed beneath dozens of banners that welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
``They had quite a lot of people out there. They were lined up
everywhere,'' said assistant fire chief Dennis Bradley.
</P>
<P>
Residents held signs that said ``Go USA'' and ``We love the
Olympic Torch Committee,'' Mears said. A young boy held a sign
saying ``Take Me With You.''
</P>
<P>
At one point the cyclist stopped, got off his bicycle and stood
in Newkirk's main street holding the torch skyward.
</P>
<P>
``They all started clapping and yelling,'' Bradley said. ``He
stopped in front of the courthouse and they all gathered around in
a big circle.''
</P>
<P>
The torch moved on to Ponca City, where the cyclist was
relieved by a torch bearer. Crowds of people cheered as the torch
was passed off from one runner to another.
</P>
<P>
The torch will pass through 14 Oklahoma cities and towns.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Opposes Privatization of Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
categorically opposed a higher education privatization program
tabled by the Rafsanjani government, an official report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The privatization of higher education is neither practical nor
permissible," Khamenei was quoted by Iran's official news agency
IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest statement by the Iranian
leader on higher education has exposed his differences with
moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who tries to
alleviate tremendous financial pressure by privatization.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani has adopted an economic liberalization policy,
hoping to do the same in the education sector because the
government could not provide enough education facilities to meet
the ever growing demand in the society.
</P>
<P>
Iran has now only 114 higher education institutions with
13,700 teaching staff members, which is far from sufficient in
meeting the demand of a country with a total population of 64
million.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's statement could be interpreted as a fear of the
Iranian authorities that privatization of the higher education
would be tantamount to westernization of the education sector.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the ruling clergymen want to crash down the
anti-clergy trend looming in the society, collages and
universities.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that
the Islamic regime would lose the indoctrination mechanism if the
higher education would be privatized.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a massive dose of religious indoctrination to
students at all levels, but private school would prefer modern
science and knowledge rather than religion.
</P>
<P>
That is why the Iranian leader worries a lot, fearing that the
colleges and universities would turn into a dangerous spot which
poses threat to the Islamic regime, he said.
</P>
<P>
A university professor who asked not to be identified said the
teaching staff are regarded as the most dangerous elements who
"might join the external groups in the struggle against the
Islamic regime" with the support of the U.S. government's 20
million U.S. dollars for covert operation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian universities underwent a complete change after the
Islamic Revolution of 1979. Many Marxist and Westernized
professors were purged during the Cultural Revolution after the
Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Despite the purge, many Western-educated professors at Iran's
universities are in favor of separation of religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the gathering of high-ranking officials in
charge of education Saturday, Khamenei pointed out that it was the
time for action, and proper steps should be taken for making the
universities Islamic.
</P>
<P>
"The proper way is to make progress toward Islamization of
universities with regard to the identity of universities as seats
of learning," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The leader said the education ministry should replace those
elements who fight against the values of the Islamic system by
faithful persons who respect the values and ideals of the Iranian
Moslem nation.

<HEADLINE> Panel Cautions Olympic Finances Still Precarious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of the Summer Olympics,
celebrating the opening of their main stadium Saturday, got a
final pre-games admonition from an oversight panel to be careful
with their money, according to a press report here.
</P>
<P>
``There is still some risk'' of the organizing committee
failing to break even financially, said Robbie Pound, an
accountant for the Metropolitan Atlanta Olympic Games Authority.
</P>
<P>
MAOGA, a panel of government and business leaders that has a
limited watchdog role over the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games, has mandated that ACOG maintain a dlrs 13 million
contingency in its dlrs 1.7 billion privately-financed budget.
</P>
<P>
Pound said that ACOG remains in compliance, but with only two
months remaining before the Olympics, the agency has no further
room to maneuver if expenses run too high or revenues come in too
low. ACOG still has about dlrs 160 million more to raise, and
expects to make it largely on remaining ticket and souvenir sales
through the games.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee is no longer soliciting corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
``There's still a lot of revenue to be raised,'' Pound told the
MAOGA board, which met in a luxury suite at the new stadium while
the Atlanta Grand Prix track meet was under way outside its window.
</P>
<P>
The contingency money, Pound said, ``should be used more so as
a hedge against revenues coming in under budget, versus a hedge
against unbudgeted expenses.''
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what would happen if ACOG ended up in the red
after the Olympics, though organizers have vowed they will not
seek a government bailout by taxpayers. Officials have said they
would cut costs before failing to meet the budget.
</P>
<P>
A.D. Frazier, ACOG's chief operating officer, said after the
meeting he remained confident that the organizers will meet their
goal of at least breaking even.
</P>
<P>
``We feel good about where we are,'' Frazier said. ``I think he
and we agree that there is sufficient money to pay for what's got
to be done, and that we've got to continue to be watchful.''
</P>
<P>
The meeting Saturday was the last for the MAOGA board before
the games begin. The panel will meet after the Olympics to review
ACOG's financial performance.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit Historic: Namibian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister Hage
Geingob said here today that the current visit of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Namibia is a historic one.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Jiang this morning, Geingob said Namibia
attaches importance to South-South cooperation. He added that a
focus of Namibia's economic constructions is to strengthen
cooperation with Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Namibia particularly wants to develop
economic cooperation and trade ties with China in various
spheres.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that China has rich experiences
in fighting drought which Namibia can learn and benefit from.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who met Geingob in Beijing in 1991, said he was happy
to meet Geingob here again. He said he is looking forward to an
in-depth exchange of views with President Sam Nujoma on issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the hospitality he receives in this country
embodies the friendly and brotherly ties between the peoples of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader praised the Namibian government for having
made big efforts and achievements in safeguarding the country's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, realizing reconciliation
and unity among different ethnic groups, as well as in developing
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefed Geingob on the irrigational projects in China
and he welcomes Namibia's technicians to have on-the-spot
inspections on China's irrigation works.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here on Saturday for a state visit. He is
scheduled to hold talks with President Nujoma later this morning.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Beats Grenada 1-0 in World Cup Soccer Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Haiti edged Grenada 1-0 on
Saturday to ensure a place in the third round of the Caribbean
Zone World Cup soccer qualifying series in St. George's, Grenada.
</P>
<P>
Haitian forward Golman Pierre booted a ball into the back of
Grenada's net after it rebounded off the keeper, Kellon Baptiste,
in the 50th minute.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 2,500 turned up at Queen's Park to watch the
game.
</P>
<P>
Grenada would have had to win by five clear goals to eliminate
Haiti, after Haiti beat Grenada 6-1 two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
The highly skilled Haitians made their defensive intentions
known from the outset, using a crowded defense once the ball
reached their half of the field.
</P>
<P>
Grenada had its chances but was unable to capitalize on them,
in part because of magnificent goal keeping by Haiti's Leces Petit.
</P>
<P>
Grenadian forward Jason Francois failed to concert from the
penalty spot, pushing the ball into Petit's hands. Another two
kicks hit the goal posts.
</P>
<P>
Haiti next plays Cuba.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 teams are vying for the three spots reserved for
the North and Central American and Caribbean Soccer Confederation
in the 1998 World Cup field in France.

<HEADLINE> Camels Terrorize Northwestern Nigerian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Camels, the famed long-distance
beasts of burden, have invaded six local government areas in the
northwestern Nigerian state of Sokoto from neighboring Niger and
devastated forest belts, farmlands and government woodlands.
</P>
<P>
''The Sunday Champion'' newspaper said today that the ravenous
camels were reported to have crossed over from Niger in their
hundreds, moving southwards and devouring all vegetation in their
path.
</P>
<P>
In the affected areas in Sokotoa state, camels had eroded the
already sparse forests, destroyed government planted woodlots and
wrecked shelter belts or food, the report said.
</P>
<P>
''The camels have eat off most of the young trees and reduced
the strength of the bigger ones so much that deforestation is
worsened and the plantations cannot adequately check the speed of
desertification,'' said Alhaji Umar D. Ibrahim, the State Director
of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
He said the state government was finding it increasingly
difficult to sustain any of its plantations and to check
desertification in the wake of the camel invasion.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 353 of the 577
patients tested for HIV in Hong Kong hospitals which used faulty
test kits have been declared virus-free, according to Hong Kong
hospital authorities.
</P>
<P>
No negative results had been changed to "positive" so far,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The need for new tests arose in early April after a US company,
Abbott Laboratories, was forced to admit that its IMX HIV1-HIV2
3rd generation plus test had incorrectly diagnosed some carriers
of the disease as negative.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sparked worldwide panic and forced the retest
of about 70,000 British and Dutch people.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, only 146 were required to return to hospital for
the retest. Hospitals had kept blood samples from the remainder,
allowing them to run new tests without requiring the patients to
turn up themselves.

<HEADLINE> HK to Lift Age Limit for One-way Permit Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The age restriction for mainland
children coming to Hong Kong under the one-way permit system will
be lifted from July 1, according to a Hong Kong Government
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said the daily quota for the one-way permit
system will remain at 150 at present.
</P>
<P>
The quota for Chinese nationals to come and settle in Hong Kong
was increased from 105 to 150 from July 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the 45 additional places, 30 are given to
mainland children who will have the right of abode in Hong Kong
after 1997, and the rest to persons separated from their spouses
for 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Hong Kong government stipulated that for the first
year of increase, the additional quota for eligible children would
only be given to those outside the school-age range, including
those of newly-born to five years old and those between 16 and 20
years old.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the new decision to lift the age restriction
for mainland children to Hong Kong was adopted to match the entry
of school-age children with the decline in Hong Kong's secondary
school population, due to begin in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
He added that the age restriction in the first year would
ensure that school-age children would only come at a time when
there were vacancies in secondary schools, and would thus reduce
the impact on education services.

<HEADLINE> Shoplifting Rampant among Youngsters in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Hong Kong youngsters
are going on shoplifting now, costing retailers tens of thousands
of dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
The Hongkong Standard newspaper reported today that more than
40 percent of those arrested and prosecuted for shoplifting last
year were under the age of 20.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,644 cases of shoplift in New Territories South
last year, of which 730 involved were aged between seven and 15
and 215 were aged 16 to 20.
</P>
<P>
In New Territories North, 765 of 1,433 cases last year involved
children and In Kowloon West, 463 out of 1,670 cases involved
children as young as seven.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong Island there were 1,532 shoplifting cases last
year, 576 of which involved children.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said they suspected many cases went
unreported and the problem was probably more widespread, adding
that those caught by shopkeepers are simply thrown out of shops or
turned over to parents because they are too young to be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Japanese department store Seibu said that
about 75 percent of their shoplifting cases involved children and
most were aged between 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
Law Koon-lun, assistant executive officer in the security
department at the Junk Bay Yaohan store, said that at least seven
out of 10 child shoplifters caught were still in school uniform,
having stolen mainly stationery items.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We act as social workers when we come across young
shoplifters, giving them advice and warning them about the
problems that stealing can bring."
</P>
<P>
According to Law, there was a major difference in parents'
attitude toward the young shoplifters.  Some of the parents were
ashamed to learn about their kids' misdemeanor, but others simply
told the kids not to worry because they would pay for the goods.

HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police have arrested
more than 30 Vietnamese migrants (VMs) in the High Island

just a week after riots and fires at the Whitehead Detention

<HEADLINE> Discrimination Against AIDS Victims to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government has planned
to punish by law those who discriminate against HIV-AIDS victims,
Kenya's Attorney-General Amos Wako said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Amos Wako said discrimination against HIV-AIDS victims
manifested itself on different ways and at various levels despite
legislation in the Constitution against it.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney-General said the discrimination existed among
employers, the insurance industry, health-care institutions,
religious circles and even in the family.
</P>
<P>
He said to make those who discriminate against HIV-AIDS
victims punishable by law, the government would soon publish a
Sessional Paper.
</P>
<P>
Amos Wako said this when he was addressing participants of the
13th International AIDS Candlelight Memorial and Mobilization
Ceremony in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Discrimination is a great evil that must not be
tolerated within society."

BEIRUT -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah
announced that they ambushed an Israeli patrol inside the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon early today,
causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, said that one group of
its fighters carried out the attack at 7:00 a.m. (04:00 GMT) near
the hilltop ancient Roman castle of Shqif in Nabatiyeh. In a
statement, the Islamic Resistance added that several Israeli
soldiers were killed and wounded in the fighting in which the
guerrillas used machine-guns and anti-tank rockets.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Israeli occupation forces resumed
bombardment around 8:15 a.m. (05:15 GMT) at Iglim Al-Toffah, a
ridge often used by Hezbollah guerrillas to launch attacks at the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the Israeli forces, at
their position at Shqif, fired sporadic shells at Mazraa Hamra and
Himma Arnon.
</P>
<P>
BELGRADE -- Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic said
Saturday that the crisis in the Serb executive authorities had
been surmounted in the "best possible way," with a triumph of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, Karadzic said the destabilization
in Serb politics, which was triggered by the dismissal of the Serb
premier, had been resolutely prevented by the resolution passed
earlier Saturday in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic sacked his prime minister Rajko Kasagic Wednesday for
the latter's close contact with the international community. The
sacking has indicated an open rift among the Serb leadership and
has enraged the international community which supports the
moderate Kasagic.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament voted to back Karadzic's move and elected
Gojko Klickovic as a replacement, thus ending the three-day crisis
in the Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
WINDHOEK -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin held brief talks with
Namibian President Sam Nujoma on bilateral relations shortly after
his arrival here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes his current visit will help promote
relations between China and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said China is an "all-weather friend" of Namibia. The
Chinese government and people had helped Namibia to realize
liberation, he added.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel survived an
assassination attempt on his life Saturday in Turkey's industrial
city of Izmit, about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The local Anatolia news agency reported that a gunman wormed
his way into Demirel's bodyguards when the president stepped down
from a platform after delivering a speech to inaugurate a shopping
center in Izmit.
</P>
<P>
Sukru Cukurlu, the chief of the president's bodyguards,
immediately grasped the gunman's hand when he was trying to aim
his handgun at Demirel and overpowered him with the help of the
special police team.
</P>
<P>
The assailant's gun went off as he was being subdued by the
guards and the bullet wounded a local journalist in the
leg. Cukurlu was also lightly injured in his arm.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, who was later identified as Ibrahim Gumrukcuoglu,
aged 48, is an owner of a local drugstore. According to initial
investigation, Gumrukcuoglu was found with some psychological
problems, the Anatolia news agency reported.

round of meeting in Washington today to iron out remaining
differences on the formation of a proposed cease-fire monitoring
committee in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Ambush Israeli Patrol in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-
Iranian Hezbollah announced today that they ambushed an Israeli
patrol inside the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon this morning, causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, said that one group of
its fighters carried out the attack at 7:00 a.m. (04:00 GMT) near
the hilltop ancient Roman castle of Shqif in Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance added that several
Israeli soldiers were killed and wounded in the fighting in which
the guerrillas used machine-guns and anti-tank rockets.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Israeli occupation forces resumed
bombardment around 8:15 a.m. (05:15 GMT) at Iglim Al-Toffah, a
ridge often used by Hezbollah guerrillas to launch attacks at the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the Israeli forces, at
their position at Shqif, fired sporadic shells at Mazraa Hamra and
Himma Arnon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas carried out several operations in the
15-Kilometer wide border strip last week, wounding six israeli
soldiers. The Israeli forces responded these attacks rapidly by
bombarding and launching air raids at suspected guerrilla bases in
Iglim Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire understanding mediated by the United States
between Lebanon and Israel banned Hezbollah guerrillas from firing
Katyusha rockets at northern Israel, but it did not deprived the
militant group of the right to attack the Israeli occupation
forces in south Lebanon on condition that the attacks are not
launched from civilian areas.

<HEADLINE> Fiorentina Beats Atalant to Win Italian Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Fiorentina won its first Italian Cup
title in 21 years and a berth in the next European Cup Winners Cup
when it beat Atalanta of Bergamo 2-0 in their second-leg final in
Bergamo Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta scored Fiorentina's second
goal - his eighth in the tournament - to become the leading
Italian Cup scorer this season while his team completed the
eight-game series unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
The victory on the road at the ``Azzurri'' stadium of Bergamo
added to a 1-0 first-leg victory for a 3-0 aggregate score.
</P>
<P>
Defender Lorenzo Amoruso scored the opening goal in the 48th
minute, with a drive from 8 meters on a corner kick by Portuguese
Rui Costa.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta, who scored the game winner in the first leg in
Florence, made it two in the 71st minute.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine striker, who tallied 19 goals in league games,
kicked in on a rebound, following a shot by Rui Costa.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta drew applause of rival fans with a spectacular back
kick in the second half which was barely stopped by Atalanta's
goalie Fabrizio Ferron.
</P>
<P>
As usual Batistuta was one of the best players on Fiorentina
lineup. Uruguayan Paulo Montero did well on the defense of
Atalanta, despite defeat.
</P>
<P>
``I am happy for the fans, because they had at last something
to cheer,'' said Batistuta, who will lead Argentina offense in
World Cup qualifying.
</P>
<P>
``I hope this is the beginning of a winning streak,'' the
Argentine player said.
</P>
<P>
Fiiorentina finished third in this year's first division
campaign, dominated by AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's title was Fiorentina's fifth in the Italian Cup, but
its first since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina's qualification for the Cup Winners meant UEFA Cup
berths for both AS Roma and Parma without a playoff for Italy's
fourth spot.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 26,000 fans watched the match in the stadium at Bergamo
and about 20,000 followed it on a huge screen at the Artemio
Franchi arena in Florence.
</P>
<P>
Florentine fans fired firecrackers, played horns and rallied
downtown streets waving flags to celebrate the victory.
</P>
<P>
Four players - two on each side - were cautioned by referee
Pierluigi Pairetto in a hard-fought match, which was preceded by
fans' violence.
</P>
<P>
Riot policemen used tear-gas and batons to disperse groups of
fans who became violent prior to the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
About 30 fans and at least two policemen were injured in the
incidents.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Prepared for Flood Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province, which
has the longest stretch of dykes along the Yangtze River, is losing
no time preparing for the forthcoming flood season.
</P>
<P>
Located on the middle reaches of Yangtze, Hubei Province, with
a number of rivers and lakes in it, faces the most serious threat
of flood in the Yangtze river reaches.
</P>
<P>
Every year, water from Yangtze and Hanjiang rivers and Dongting
Lake pour 630 billion cu m of water into the province.
</P>
<P>
Officials have been drawing up anti-flood measures since the
beginning of this year to prepare for the mid-summer flood season.
</P>
<P>
By placing rocks and boulders into rivers, Shishou City has
strengthened a four-km-long river embankment, while Ezhou City has
consolidated two dangerous embankments, one a kilometer in length
and the other 1.6 km long.
</P>
<P>
A number of reservoirs, culverts and water gates have been
given extra flood prevention measures.
</P>
<P>
One difficult problem for the flood control work is the
clearance of waterway obstructions, such as large fishing
nets. The province ordered people who placed barriers or
obstructions to remove them. Qianjiang City has removed 75 fishing
nets at a stroke.
</P>
<P>
So far the province has cleared away over 3,000 obstructions,
which will help ease the flood problems.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Wuhan, Jingmen and Xiantao have worked out flood
control plans, Huangshi city has made a survey of 26 embankments
and has taken measures to strengthen them.
</P>
<P>
The province has prepared 480,000 water-proof sandbags. Cities
and prefectures along the river have reserved rock and sand
totalling 1.77 million cubic meters. The province has also taken
measures to improve telecommunications facilities.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Continue Subsidizing Fabrics Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government Saturday
decided to continue cash subsidies for export of local fabrics at
the current rate of 25 percent, rejecting the Central Bank plea to
curtail the incentive measure.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, had recently proposed to the
government to drastically cut the incentive, arguing that the
facility was of little use.
</P>
<P>
However, a meeting of the task force on export here decided
that the subsidy should be retained considering the recent
positive impact of the measure on the export-oriented handloom
sector.
</P>
<P>
The task force, an inter-ministerial body, also resolved to
extend the benefit to some other non-traditional handicraft items
manufactured with local fabrics.
</P>
<P>
The new items to be given subsidies included pillow covers,
cushion covers, table cloth, bags made of cloth, household
embroidery items, scarves and cloths for making slippers.
</P>
<P>
The incentive to local fabrics was introduced three years ago
in the garment industry which was overwhelmingly dependent on
imported fabrics.

<HEADLINE> Special Losses of Listed Japanese Firms Remain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Special losses posted by Japanese
companies listed on stock exchanges are expected to top 3 trillion
yen (28.2 billion U.S. dollars) for the third straight year in
fiscal 1995 that ended on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The Kyodo News Service quoted the Nihon Keizai Shimbun as
saying in a report today that the special losses are mostly seen
among construction companies, realtors, trading houses and other
nonmanufacturing companies and involve real estate and financial
assets which have turned nonperforming.
</P>
<P>
Such losses are also remarkably seen in connection with
personnel cuts, withdrawal from loss-making businesses and other
restructuring efforts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Special losses for all listed companies, except banks,
brokerages houses, insurers and housing loan companies, totaled
3.36 trillion yen (31.6 billion U.S. dollars) in fiscal 1993 and
soared to 3.85 trillion yen (36.2 billion U.S. dollars) in fiscal
1994 due to damage from the Great Hanshin Earthquake, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate Co. tops the list of special losses by
posting 150.6 billion yen (1.42 billion U.S. dollars) in stock
appraisal loss at a subsidiary in connection with the transfer of

will appropriate special losses of more than 100 billion yen (940
billion U.S. dollars) for failures in real estate investment, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Sponsors Insurance Seminar in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) is to organize a high-level seminar in
Beijing next week to study how to improve insurance services in
China to support its rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, slated for May 20 to 24, is organized by the
UNCTAD secretariat in cooperation with China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the seminar include chief executive officials
from major insurance companies from all regions, the UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on policies and practices followed by other countries,
the participants will seek to improve the terms and conditions of
insurance and reinsurance practices in China through comparative
exchange of information on practices in overseas markets, the
UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will also seek to increase the volume and quality
of insurance services in China by exploring alternative methods of
diversifying and enlarging the premium and capital base.
</P>
<P>
A final objective of the seminar is to increase the
competitiveness of domestic insurance transactions, and strengthen
insurance companies in China so as to enable them to operate
effectively in an international business environment.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNCTAD press release, the premium income of
China's insurance sector has expanded from 4.5 billion yuan (about
540 million U.S. dollars) in 1985 to 52 billion yuan (about 6.4
billion dollars) by the end of 1993, a compound of annual growth
rate of 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
Insurance penetration - the ratio of nominal premiums to
nominal gross national product - varies widely between China'
different provinces.
</P>
<P>
For the country as a whole, it has been increasing rapidly and
has moved up from 1.8 percent in 1992 to 3.3 percent in 1993.

NANCHANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Two telecommunications networks
with the latest design have gone into operation in east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Using 120 million yuan in investment, the two include a public

With switching centers in 11 cities, prefectures, and 80
counties, Chinapac connects the province with 95 percent of the
country's townships through a node in Nanchang, provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The network is linked with 44 public packet exchange networks
in 23 countries.
</P>
<P>
The DDN connects the province with other parts of the country,
as well as 500 cities abroad. It will lay a solid foundation for
the construction of an information superhighway, bringing

<HEADLINE> Japanese Machine-Tool Makers to Cut Export Prices: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's major machine-tool
manufacturers Hitachi Seiki Co. and Amada Co. will cut export
prices of their products by about 10 percent as a result of a
strong yen, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The price cut is intended to maintain the international
competitiveness of Japanese companies against low-priced machine
tools produced by Taiwanese and South Korean makers, it said,
attributing the source to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As there is not much difference in performance between the
products of Japanese and other Asian makers, prices are therefore
a major factor in competitiveness, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Seiki has decided to lower the foreign
currency-denominated export prices to the level before the yen's
sharp rise in early last year and will cut yen-denominated prices
to that level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Amada will also cut the export prices on an estimated average
foreign exchange rate of about 105 yen against the dollar for
fiscal 1996, compared with about 95 yen for fiscal 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese machine-tool makers are expected to follow suit,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Shores up Commerce Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Thailand has
prepared nearly 10 billion baht (400 million U.S. dollars) in
anticipation of heavy withdrawals from the Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be the first business day since the BBC was taken
over by the Finance Ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Depositors began heavy panicky withdrawals from the BBC, in
particular at the bank's provincial branches, when the opposition
claimed during the May 8-10 censure debate that the bank had
extended substantial loans to a group of politicians, on
overvalued collateral, driving the bank further into the red.
</P>
<P>
At the start of this year, the bank was over six billion baht
(240 million dollars) in the red, and now it has bad and doubtful
debts to the tune of 78 billion baht (3.12 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Part of this is loans to the politicians, including Deputy
Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen, who belongs to Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The land which Suchart put up as collateral allegedly fell
short of the value of the loans, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
During last week, the Central Bank had already injected more
than 10 billion baht (400 million dollars) to shore up the BBC in
coping with the run on the bank.
</P>
<P>
BBC President Krirkkiat Jalichandra has been made responsible
for recalling the 78 billion baht bad and doubtful debts. Half of
the total is said to have been extended to the politicians, and
the other half to companies belonging to himself.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Banharn has blamed the opposition for
driving the BBC to the verge of collapse following heavy
withdrawals by depositors, and said efforts should be made to
retain the image of the country so investors would not be scared
away.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Good Rains Promise Good Harvests In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Good harvests are now in sight
here amd there in Zimbabwe, one of the "bread baskets in southern
Africa".
</P>
<P>
Unbounded maize fields are seen flourishing, golden tobacco
leaves swaying in the breeze, and cotton bolls in blossom shining
glisteringly under the sun, while herds of sheep and cattle are
feeding in vast pastures.
</P>
<P>
Beaming with smiles when asked about his crop at a village
house, a small-scale farmer or peasant told Xinhua that good
rains mean fine harvests this year.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the country have enjoyed ample rainfall since
last November, according to the meteorological department. As of
mid-April this year, the rainfall has reached a record high in
the past dozen years, with the water in 70 percent of the dams
full to the brim.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has also taken measures to promote
agriculture, such as providing farmers with quality seeds,
low-interest loans and fertilizer, which have brought into play
their production initiative, and areas sown to seeds have greatly
increased.
</P>
<P>
A cheerful official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Xinhua
that Zimbabwe's agricultural sector will reap bumper instead of
ordinary harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, the vast rural areas in Zimbabwe began to present a
prospect of good harvests with farmers busy with reaping early
crops and the late crops seemed to be doing well.
</P>
<P>
The official said Zimbabwe will harvest about 2.6 million tons
of maize this year as against last year's 840,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated maize harvest will not only enable the entire
population to attain self-sufficiency in food in Zimbabwe but
also have surpluses for export. The government plans to store
400,000 tons to prepare for potential drought in future
strategically, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this country, the weather determines agriculture's future.
Therefore, good rains promises good harvests this year.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, Zimbabwe's agricultural sector can
produce enough food to feed the nation, but last year's serious
drought, only two years after the 1992 catastrophe, brought a
disaster to people's life and the national economy.
</P>
<P>
It also dealt a heavy blow to the just recovered agriculture
in Zimbabwe, and the food output reduced sharply. Lack of water
resources also posed a threat to the daily life of urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
The government had to import grains to supply 72 percent of
its population with drought relief food. Water shortage had also
forced city authorities to take measures to restrict the use of
water.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at festivities to mark Zimbabwe's 16th independence
anniversary on April 18 this year, President Robert Mugabe
predicted that Zimbabwe's GDP will grow at about seven percent
this year, as against less than one percent in 1995, mainly due
to a promising farming sector.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, world-famous for its tobacco quality and having a
third biggest tobacco auction market in the world, will produce
nearly the same amount of about 0.2 billion kilograms of tobacco
this year, but this year's earnings of tobacco will be doubled.
</P>
<P>
Cotton is another major cash crop in Zimbabwe. Its output will
be doubled this year from last year's 102,000 tons to an
estimated 226,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party May Joint Third Front Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party strongman
and former chief minister of Maharashstra Sharad Pawar has said
that if the Third Front (National Front-Left Front) alliance comes
to power, his party may take a part in the government.
</P>
<P>
"As of now we (Congress) will support the Third Front from
outside, but if they invite us ... who knows about tomorrow?" he
said at a press conference in Mumbai (Bombay) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out a mid-term poll, Pawar said the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) leadership had put a "good person like A.B.
Vajpayee in difficulty by making him accept the prime
ministership" despite not having a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The BJP under no circumstances would cross the 200 mark in the
545- seat lower house of parliament and the Third Front alliance
with the Congress would have strength of nearly 316 seats, Pawar
said.
</P>
<P>
Lashing out at the reported statement by BJP senior leader
Venkaih Naidu that the country could face another mid-term poll,
Pawar said the BJP did not have the right to suggest a mid-term
poll until they could prove its majority in parliament.

DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,572 candidates will
finally contest Bangladesh's June 12 parliamentary elections for
300 seats after 408 withdrew their nomination papers Saturday, the
last date for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the Election Commission (EC), 3,093
candidates had filed nomination papers to contest the poll. But
113 of them have been rejected during scrutiny by the returning
officers for various irregularities and bank loan default.
</P>
<P>
The EC has also allocated symbols to some 115 parties and
groups contesting the coming poll, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
With just 23 days to go before polling day, the real election
campaigns began today as the code of conduct bans such campaigns

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Promises to "Cut Bad Fingers" to Save Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has given his personal assurance that the pending
cabinet reshuffle will definitely involve "cutting bad fingers to
save the entire body."
</P>
<P>
Banharn was apparently referring to the possible removal of two
deputy ministers with questionable conduct.
</P>
<P>
The two deputy ministers facing calls for removal include
embattled Deputy Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen and Deputy
Finance Minister Newin Chidchob.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said all six other coalition parties would
remain with the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party-led government
after the reshuffle, which would take place later this month.
</P>
<P>
In the censure debate on May 8-10, Suchart and Newin failed to
provide clear explanations about the acquisition of loans from the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce, which was taken over last Friday by the
Finance Ministry to prevent a possible collapse.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alleged that the two, among others, had obtained
loans from the bank on overvalued collateral, pushing the bank
further towards the verge of collapse.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Degradation Threatens Vietnam's Bio-diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Many rare species of plants and
animals in Vietnam are in danger of extinction as a result of the
continuing environmental degradation, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the timber varieties in danger of extinction are
sindorasiamensis, afzelia, and other medical plants like
coptischinesis and morinda officinalis.
</P>
<P>
Several rare animal species, such as pseudoryx nghetinhensis,
big roe deer and a new kind of wild cow (pseudonovibos spiralis),
which have been discovered in Vietnam in the past two years, are
also under threat, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that environmental degradation is caused by
the destruction of the 30 year-long war and unplanned-development
of the country's plants.
</P>
<P>
Increasing illegal animal and plant trade also contributes to
environment destruction, it added.
</P>
<P>
In Indochina, Vietnam has the greatest number of endangered
species.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Gets Indian Aid For Dairy Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 19 (Xinhua)-- The Indian Dairy Development Board
(IDDB) has provided an aid package of 500 million US dollars to
Sri Lanka to revitalize the country's milk industry, Trade
Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the aid package has been signed recently by the
IDDB and Sri Lanka's Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the aid is to inject the dairy industry
with the necessary expertise and equipment to help Sri Lanka
achieve self-sufficiency in milk, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Indian scientist Dr Kourian has volunteered his
services and expertise and will reside in Sri Lanka for five
years.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, two milk food factories and a dried cattle
feed factory will be set up in Sri Lanka with the Indian aid.
</P>
<P>
High breed cows from India will be supplied to local farmers,
the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka imports 111 million US dollars worth of milk food
annually. The country once had the capacity to produce 70 percent
of its needs in the 1970s but can produce only a mere 20 percent
now.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Wants More Cooperations with Overseas Insurance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's cooperation with overseas
insurance and financial companies will promote its economic growth
and other undertakings, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan has said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor made the remark when meeting Peter Spalti, chairman
of the Switzerland-based Winterthur Insurance Company, here
Saturday. He welcomes Swiss insurance companies to develop
business in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was optimistic about future cooperation between the
two sides and expressed the belief that more foreign insurance
firms will enter Chinese market with useful experience for
their Chinese counterparts in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Spalti said that his company enjoys frequent business exchanges
with People's Bank of China and People's Insurance Company of
China, hoping that his company will have long-term ties with them.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1875, Winterthur Insurance Company, the largest
insurance group in Switzerland, has expanded its business to
Europe, northern America, and Asia-Pacific Region, with 65
billion US dollars in total assets.
</P>
<P>
It has opened representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai
and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> BJP Chooses Not To Have Showdown Over Post of Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Knowing its weak position in the
parliament, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reportedly
opted not to make the speaker's election a prestige issue.
</P>
<P>
If the Congress party and the Third Front are firm on putting
up their own joint candidate, there is every possibility of the
BJP falling in line instead of forcing a contest, informed sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We really are not in a position to dictate terms. This being
so, there is little point in queering the pitch for the survival
of our government even before the vote of confidence is taken up
by the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament)," said a senior BJP
leader on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is against this background that Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee
reportedly proposed a consensus candidate for speakership during
his meeting with former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao on May
17.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the speaker's post in the House is held by the
ruling party whereas the deputy speaker's post goes to the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling party loses the speakership race, there will be
an immediate outcry for the government's resignation right away
without going through the motions of a vote of confidence before
the May 31 deadline set by the president, the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay to Fight Crime Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay
agreed today to create a three-way operative command to combat
crimes and guarantee security in their border zone.
</P>
<P>
Interior ministers Carlos Corach of Argentina, Juan Manuel
Morales of Paraguay and Brazilian Justice Minister Nelson Acevedo
Yobim signed the agreement in the Argentine city of Puerto Iguazu.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, the command will start acting no later than
June 1 to combat organized crime and terrorism in the triple
border.
</P>
<P>
The agreement shows the irrevocable will of the three countries
to fight terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, arms
mongering and trans-national crime, Argentina's Corach said after
signing the document.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Yobim said the agreement signals the birth of a
regional policy of combating crime and that all of it is within
the framework of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
In Paraguay's Morales's words, the creation of the command will
make real the fight against crime in the zone, which has spilled
over geographical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers toured the three border cities -- Puerto Iguazu
of Argentina, Foz do Iguazu of Brazil and Ciudad del Este of
Paraguay -- at the end of their meeting, and observed a routine
control procedure in the Friendship Bridge between Brazil and
Paraguay.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Industrial Output up 0.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian industrial
production grew 0.5 percent during the first two months of the
year over the same period of 1995, the National Statistics
Administrative Department (DANE) said today.
</P>
<P>
This the lowest growth in the last five years, according to a
report published today by the DANE.
</P>
<P>
DANE attributed the drop mainly to a slower automobile
manufacturing sector, although it registered a slight recovery in
February in comparison with January.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying better performance during the first two months were
the food industries, non-basic chemicals, oil byproducts,
textiles, plastics, and apparel, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Residents Keen on "Help-the-Poor" Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25,000 poor urban and
rural residents in the port city of Dalian, northeast China's
Liaoning province, have received more than 13 million yuan in
relief funds since a "help-the-poor" project was launched a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Per capita relief for these people stands at 520 yuan a month,
more than three times the average monthly basic living expenses
announced by the Dalian city government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dalian civil affairs department, 230,000 local
residents have participated in the "help-the-poor" project.
</P>
<P>
These people include government officials, entrepreneurs and
ordinary citizens, offering fund and services to those poor people.
</P>
<P>
A private businesswoman, Huang Shuqin, has financially
supported 10 orphans and six widows or widowers. She has also
donated 500,000 yuan to the local poverty relief fund.
</P>
<P>
Moved by Huang's action, her four children each donated 100,000
yuan to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
Several districts in Dalian have set up poverty relief funds,
with the total amount standing at nine million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bo Xilai said that poverty in the city is expected
to be eliminated within 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Power Law Gives Sector a Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's new Electricity Law will be
a strong stimulus to the power industry of Guangdong Province, the
country's largest electricity generator.
</P>
<P>
"The law provides a legal promise to protect the interests of
investors." today's China Daily Business Weekly quoted Guangdong
Electricity Bureau Director Wu Xirong as saying.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Guangdong had attracted 9.23 billion
yuan (1.11 billion US dollars) in foreign investment to the
industry, accounting for 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
But more is needed to support future development, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Besides investors, operators and individual users of
electricity will also benefit from the law, which became effective
early last month.
</P>
<P>
Another significant principle of the law is to encourage the
industry to look beyond current demand.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, about 134.6 billion yuan (16.2 billion US
dollars) will be used to install another 11.42 million kilowatts
during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the province's installed capacity is expected
to hit a record 34.06 million kilowatts, growing 8.5 percent
annually. About 134 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be
generated, rising ten percent annually on average, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noted that the law is also a sharp legal weapon
against the destruction of electric facilities. Between 1990 to
1995, over 3,000 cases were filed involving the destruction and
burglary of basic facilities like cable, wire and other equipment.

<HEADLINE> Western Hemisphere Finance Ministers Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The two-day meeting
of finance ministers from the Western Hemisphere ended here today
after discussions over financial market development,
liberalization and integration.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting fulfilled our objectives," U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 34 participating ministers discussed
macroeconomic policies, financial market development and fighting
financial crimes at the first such meeting since the Miami Summit
of the Americas in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
"We focused on the long-term, and we have developed a shared
vision to bring home along with a shared commitment to bringing
these ideas to fruition," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique, issued at the end of the meeting, said that
the ministers "have a common vision of the policies needed to
achieve macroeconomic strength, recognizing that their
implementation is a prerequisite to prosperity, to addressing
poverty, and to strong, integrated markets in the Americas."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the ministers are committed to "developing and
maintaining fiscal and monetary policies that bring inflation down
to low levels...maintain sustainable fiscal and external balances,
increase domestic savings, promote financial stability and foster
increased real economic growth."
</P>
<P>
On the financial markets, the ministers expressed their
commitment to the development and reinforcement of laws,
supervisory institutions, and enforcement mechanisms that ensure
financial soundness and investor protection while preserving
incentives for innovation, the communique pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the Inter-American Development Bank, the 34
governments have begun to develop a listing of national financial
market regulations, mandated by the 1994 Miami Summit and intended
to increase transparency as a first step toward liberalization and
integration, it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment
"to intensified action to combat the laundering of proceeds,
properties and other instrumentalities of drug trafficking and
other illegal activities," recognizing the threat it presents to
the integrity of financial markets, and to the economic and
political systems.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Hemisphere Financial Issues, established at
the 1994 Miami Summit, met four times during the past 17 months at
the deputies level to discuss recent development in hemispheric
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting requested the committee to continue its
current mandate to "pursue strong, open financial and capital
markets and to review the problems of heavily indebted countries
in the hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> Exports Up Slightly in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics from the
Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission show
local international traders exported 1.003 billion US
dollars-worth of goods in April, representing a 1.75 percent
increase over the figure from April last year.
</P>
<P>
Local overseas-funded enterprises saw a 36.32 percent increase
in exports, which helped to bring Shanghai's export total back
from negative growth, according to today's China Daily Business
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
But specialized foreign trade companies, the city's foreign
trade backbone, lost 14.7 percent of their export volume compared
with last year, finishing at 359 million US dollars, the paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Two other categories of exporters, local industrial and
commercial companies and manufacturing enterprises with foreign
trade autonomy, also saw their trade volumes drop, by 4.82 percent
and 6.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment continued to pour into Shanghai in April
with 136 new projects approved in April.

<HEADLINE> A French Rooster Chosen as World Cup '98 Mascot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The blue-white-red rooster of
France's national emblem was chosen as the 1998 World Cup mascot
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cartoon portrayal of the rooster with a big yellow beak and
a wide grin ``is a veritable animated personality that reunites in
one image France, soccer and joie de vivre,'' the France 98 World
Cup organizing committee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The bird, which was created by Fabrice Pialot, a 39-year-old
French designer, still doesn't have a name. The organizing
committee will conduct a survey this fall to select one that's
popular among the French and at the same time easy to pronounce
for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, the most lucrative and most watched single
sporting event in the world, is held every four years. Brazil won
the last World Cup, staged in the United States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
``The role of the mascot is to personify in the eyes of the
entire world the 1998 World Cup and its values,'' the organizing
committee said.
</P>
<P>
It's role also is to make money for France 98 and the 16th
World Cup in the form of toys, T-shirts and stuffed rooster dolls.
</P>
<P>
The 16th World Cup finals will be held from June 10 to July 12
of 1998 in nine French cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Marine Department
will soon start a program to exchange search and rescue
controllers with the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination (MRCC) Center
in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
According to Ian Dale, director of the Marine Department, an
agreement was reached to exchange search and rescue controllers
between the Guangdong and Hong Kong MRCCs.
</P>
<P>
Dale said an exchange program between the two neighboring

</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong MRCC is responsible for the search and rescue
operation both in Hong Kong waters and the areas of South China
Seas north of latitude 10 degrees north and west of longitude 120
degrees east, excluding the immediate coastal waters of
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Through regular training courses run by the Marine Department,
Hong Kong maintains the necessary reserve of well qualified search
and rescue controllers.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong MRCC has the full communications capability to
undertake search and rescue missions for ships in difficulties
within about 1,300 kilometers of Hong Kong and in handling of
vessels emergencies within Hong Kong waters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, an industrial
center and a prominent grain supplier in northeast China,
has made a headway in using foreign investment, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 44 import contracts on foreign technology and
equipment were signed worth a combined 28 million US dollars,
primarily to modernize the province's petrochemicals, automaking
and paper industries, said Governor Wang Yunkun.
</P>
<P>
The province exported 10 million US dollars-worth of its
state-of-the-art geology, laser and applied chemistry technologies
to the United States, the Republic of Korea and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The governor said more overseas funds have been introduced to
state-owned firms by adopting preferential treatments.
</P>
<P>
The actual amount of foreign funds used in 1995 reached a
record 902 million US dollars, 11 percent more than the previous
year's figure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, direct capital inflow from abroad, valued at 60
million US dollars, was accumulated through compensation trade,

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Optimizes On-Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(Eximbank) will pay more attention to the quality of its credit
assets when on-lending loans from foreign governments, today's
"China Daily" quoted a bank official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1994, the bank was authorized last April to handle
the policy-oriented on-lending business.
</P>
<P>
"The loans' policy-oriented nature lies in the government's
choice of industries and the preferential interest rate," said
Zhang Guanhan, general manager of Eximbank's foreign loan
relending department.

<P>
"However, as a bank, we should manage the loans the same way as
we do other business."
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to play a bigger role in the evaluation stage of
proposed on-lending projects, scrutinizing the sources of matching
funds and repayment and the guarantee measures from local
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank is calling for closer co-operation from local
government to ensure better managerment of the loans and punctual
repayment.
</P>
<P>
The bank took over some 13 billion US dollars worth of
outstanding foreign government loans from the China Trust and
Investment Corporation for Foreign Relations and Trade last year.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank signed 72 new relending projects with contracted value
of two billion US dollars during the business's first year, the
official said. Outstanding foreign government loans stood at 14.38
billion US dollars at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The bank is now handling government loans from Japan, Kuwait,
Australia, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Nordic Investment
Bank. Loans from Japan account for about 70 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that more than 60 percent of the foreign government
loans were spent on infrastructure construction, including road
and railways, power plants, telecommunications, water supply and
sewage systems.

<HEADLINE> Poland Has 40,000 Drug Addicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 18 (Xinhua) -- There are about 40,000 drug addicts
in Poland and the number is still increasing, according to the
latest statistics released by the Warsaw Institute of Neurology
and Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the spread of drug addiction since the
early 1990s to rising employment, crimes, polarization of the
society and the exposure to Western culture.
</P>
<P>
Especially worrisome is the rising trend of drug-taking among
primary and middle school students. According to a recent poll,
over 10 percent of the students surveyed tried drugs once in the
past year and 1 percent took drugs regularly.
</P>
<P>
The Poles view drug addiction one of the most urgent social
evils, calling for harsher punishment for owning, selling and
taking drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States beat China 1-0
Saturday to win the U.S. Women's Cup soccer tournament, a major
tuneup before the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Akers hit a 23-meter rocket that tucked neatly inside
the left post for her 91st career goal in international play.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished unbeaten in the four-team
tournament, ahead of China, Japan and Canada. The victory should
give the Americans a psychological boost when it meets China again
in the first round of the Olympic tournament July 25 at the Orange
Bowl in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which won the 1991 Women's World Cup, will
be the co-favorite for the gold medal at the Summer Games. China
is also expected to be a medal contender.
</P>
<P>
In today's final, the United States put on the pressure from
the opening minute, when Tisha Venturini nearly missed with a
header. Tiffeny Mibrett tested Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong with a
18-meter blast in the 12th minute, and Akers' sliding shot from
inside the box was just wide right in the 23rd.
</P>
<P>
Mia Hamm had a chance to make it 2-0 in the 68th, but she
hooked a quick left-footer from 9 meters out. The U.S. goalkeeper
Briana Scurry was forced to make only one save in the entire match.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Japan took third place in the tournament by winning a
4-3 shootout over Canada after a scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
Both teams went through the entire tournament without scoring a
goal. Both were shutout by the United States and China earlier in
the week.

<HEADLINE> New Mutiny in Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Around 200 soldiers of the Central
African Republic have taken over the central streets of the
country's capital Bangui Saturday, protesting President Ange-Felix
Petasse's order to withdraw their arms, the French military press
office confirmed reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a month restive soldiers in the
country occupying streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers detained the mining minister, the general staff of
the armed forces and two government spokesmen, who had come to
negotiate with them.
</P>
<P>
French soldiers based at the Bangui airport, who intervened in
the first mutiny, have already moved towards the city center, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry said that "necessary
measures" have been taken to protect French nationals in Bangui.
</P>
<P>
It added the French embassy is in permanent contact with the
authorities of the republic and that no French nationals has been
hurt.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 200 soldiers mutinied successfully for their
wage raise, but nine people were killed and some 40 injured in the
action.
</P>
<P>
As a result, President Petasse decided to withdraw their
weapons and hand over control of Bangui's central armory to the
elite presidential forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, troops of the presidential force arrived at
Kasai Camp on the eastern side of the city, to impose the
presidential order, which apparently led to the show of force.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 French troops are stationed in this country, mainly
in the capital Bangui and Bouar, to the northwest, the French
military press office said.

<HEADLINE> US Deficit in Sino-US Trade Exaggerated: Trade Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu
Yi today disputed figures which the US claim demonstrate a huge
trade deficit between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu described US claims of a huge deficit in its trade with
China as not true, saying it is totally groundless to predict that
the US will suffer the largest trade deficit with China among all
its partners.
</P>
<P>
It is utterly unjustifiable for the US to make unwarranted
charges against China on the issue of trade balance, the minister
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 when China and the United States established
diplomatic ties, bilateral trade has developed with an annual
growth rate of 20 percent, from 2.5 billion US dollars in 1979 to
40.8 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The US has become China's third biggest trading partner and
China has also been viewed by the US as the most important new
market with the greatest potential.
</P>
<P>
But since the start of the 1990s bilateral trade has hit many
problems and frictions, Wu said, and the trade balance is just one
of those differences and difficulties in the way of bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Chinese statistics show that its surplus in trade with US
was 6.27 billion US dollars in 1993, 7.49 billion US dollars in
1994 and 8.59 billion US dollars last year, while the US figure
for the three years was 22.77 billion US dollars, 29.49 billion US
dollars and 33.81 billion respectively.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed there are two reasons for such
statistical differences: one is the entrepot trade via Hong Kong
and Singapore, and the other is difficulties in evaluation and the
confirmation of the original producing country.
</P>
<P>
According to her, 60 percent of China's exports to US are
conducted via Hong Kong and the average value of China's exports
to the US via Hong Kong have been added by 40 percent, the price
of toys and garments, two major US imports from China, have been
even doubled in such way.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she said, US statistics have greatly exaggerated the
country's trade deficit with China, and the so-called huge deficit
the US claimed in its trade with China is not true.

<HEADLINE> US Deficit in Trade with China Exaggerated: Trade Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Hong Kong, Taiwan Province, Singapore and the Republic of
Korea have transferred their labour-intensive industries to the
Chinese Mainland as a result of their readjustments of industrial
patterns, their trade surplus with the United States have also
been moved to China's surplus in trade with the US, she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Wu said, China's favourable balance in trade with US
is just a result of regional readjustments of industrial
structures, and it is by no means a key element with an adverse
impact on the US trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has not enjoyed any practical benefits from
the added value of the entrepot export of commodities processed by
overseas firms in the mainland via Hong Kong to the United States,
she said. Instead business groups in Hong Kong and Taiwan regions
and foreign countries involved in such activities have been the
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China's trade surplus against the US demonstrates
the continuity and the steady progress of the long-term economic
relations between the regional economy involving various parties
and the US.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China and the US are in different economic
development stages and are of different economic structure
characteristics, saying their trade relations represent mutual
benefits, complementary and non-competition of their economies.
</P>
<P>
If the US disregards this because of non-economic reasons and
intends to obstruct bilateral trade and economic ties under the
excuse of striking a trade balance, it will bring harm not only to
the economy of China and the Asian region, but also to that of the
US itself, the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some man-made factors have even deteriorated
the export environment of US high-tech products to China. The
administrative measures taken by the US over its exports to China
have caused US businesses to miss the chance of introducing their
high-tech products to China and the competition in Chinese market,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Wu continued that the annual examination and approval of the
MFN trade status has greatly lowered the confidence of the
industrial and commercial circles of the two countries on
establishing long-term co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Results stemming from those factors have offered the US
high-tech products a smaller share in China's market, she noted,
saying the US government should be responsible for creating a
better and favourable environment for closer cooperation and trade
ties between the industrial and commercial circles from the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Minister pointed out that China has all along adopted the a
positive and open trade policy, following the principle of
maintaining a trade balance between imports and exports, and
holding that such a balance should be sought through the
development.
</P>
<P>
She said that the prospects for bilateral trade and economic
co-operation between China and the US are promising due to their
strong mutually-complementary economies, and the two governments
should take active and constructive steps to promote the healthy
and stable development of bilateral trade and economic
relations.

<HEADLINE> PICC Farm Insurance Business Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture insurance business
of the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) increased in the
first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
PICC collected 47 million yuan (5.66 million US dollars) in
premium income in the period, compared with 31 million yuan (3.73
million US dollars) in the same period of last year, today's
"China Daily" quoted an official with PICC's agriculture insurance
department as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the high-risk and non-profit business has been a loss-maker
for the company. PICC has used profits from other business to
balance losses in the agricultural insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest that PICC received 3,277.78 million yuan
(394.91 million US dollars) in premium income from agriculture
insurance and paid out 3,531.76 million yuan (425.51 million US
dollars) in compensation during 1982-1994. PICC's accumulated
subsidies to the business reached 710 million yuan (86.54 million
US dollars) during this period.
</P>
<P>
People's Bank of China has decided to separate policy-oriented
agriculture insurance operations from PICC by setting up a
national agriculture insurance company.
</P>
<P>
That means such business will get more support from the
government, which is a common practice in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The central bank and Ministry of Finance are currently
discussing the issue, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Once the plan is released, PICC will embrace the reform, which
will promote not only the development of China's agriculture
insurance but also PICC's commercialization.

LISBON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Sporting of Lisbon fan died
Saturday after a firecracker hit him in the stomach during the
Portugal Cup final between Lisbon rivals Sporting and Benfica,

came from.

The victim was a 40-year-old man who was reported dead on
arrival at Lisbon's Sao Francisco Xavier Hospital, police said.

<P>
He belonged to the fan group Juventude Leonina, whose members
left the stadium after the accident while shouting ``murderers''
to the Benfica fans.

Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, on hand to watch the game at
the Estadio Nacional, met at halftime with the soccer federation
president and government officials to discuss the accident. At

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Welfare Reform Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged Congress to adopt a plan similar to a Wisconsin
program requiring able-bodied recipients to work for their checks.
</P>
<P>
"There are bipartisan welfare reform plans sitting in the House
and the Senate right now that do what the American people agree
welfare reform must do: They require welfare recipients to work;
they limit the time people can stay on welfare; they toughen child
support enforcement and they protect our children," Clinton said
in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
"So I say to Congress: Send me a bill that honors these
fundamental principles; I'll sign it right away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has vetoed welfare reform legislation from Congress,
calling it too hard on children and not tough enough on forcing
recipients to join the workforce, but his administration has also
urged states to take the initiative to update their own programs.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services has granted
"waivers" to states that propose reforms that improve welfare
programs by mandating that recipients become gainfully employed,
even if that means subsidizing their paychecks in order to help
them enter the workforce. So far, 38 states have been granted
waivers, with Minnesota last week becoming the latest, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
In the radio address, Clinton said Wisconsin and Maryland are
the most recent states to apply for innovative waivers from the
Clinton administration that allow states to reform welfare
programs and get recipients off the dole and into the workplace.
Those waivers will likely be granted in July, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Wisconsin plan, people on welfare who can work must
work immediately. The state will see to it that the work is there
-- in private sector jobs that can be subsidized if necessary, or
in community service jobs if there are no private jobs available,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The state says it will also see to it that families
have health care and child care, so that parents can go to work
without worrying about what will happen to their children. But
then they must go to work, or they won't get paid. If they do
work, of course, they'll have the dignity of earning a paycheck,
not a welfare check."
</P>
<P>
The president estimated that the new state-initiated reforms
are affecting 75 percent of the welfare recipients in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The states can keep on sending him strong welfare reform
proposals, and he would keep on signing them, he said.

Lincoln's handwritten final paragraph of a speech that predicted
the end of slavery was sold Friday at auction for 497,500 U.S.
dollars at Christie's.
</P>

is a higher aim than that of mere office... the higher object of
this contest may not be completely attained within the term of my
natural life." The object was the abolition of slavery.

Lincoln made the speech during a debate in a race for a U.S.
Senate seat from Illinois.

<HEADLINE> China, Namibia Vow to Promote Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin thanked here today Namibia for its support for China's
economic development, nation-building and national reunification.
</P>
<P>
In a banquet given by Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Jiang
said the Chinese government deeply values the traditional
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government stands ready to join the Namibian
government in making unremitting efforts to bring Sino-Namibian
relations and cooperation to a new high, said Jiang, who arrived
here earlier today for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said Namibia is ready to further consolidate the
friendship with China on the basis of mutual interests, to expand
areas of trade and technical cooperation, and to enhance
consultations on bilateral, regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the Namibian-Chinese friendship remains strong and
growing in new directions.
</P>
<P>
The continued Chinese technical assistance to Namibia
symbolizes China's commitment to the existing bonds of
friendship, solidarity and cooperation between the two countries,
Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Namibia will "always steadfastly adhere to
the 'one China' policy and looks forward to the return of Hong
Kong next year and Macao in 1999 under the sovereignty and
control of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"It is our firm belief that Taiwan too, will, sooner rather
than later, be re-unified in a peaceful and satisfactory matter,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang commented that Namibia has played a positive role in
facilitating a political settlement of the issues in southern
Africa and promoting regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Through negotiations, he said, Namibia has successfully
recovered the Walvis Bay and its offshore islands and achieved
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China notes with delight the fundamental
changes in southern Africa, adding that China will continue to
support Africa's just propositions and reasonable demands in
international affairs and further strengthen its consultations
and cooperation with the African nations so as to contribute its
share to peace, stability and development on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said Namibia attaches great importance to South-South
cooperation. He thanked China for its support to Namibia in the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Africa and China enjoy a "special partnership" and there was
never a conflict of any kind between Africa and China, he said,
adding that China is a "trusted friend of long standing."
</P>
<P>
The Africa-China relationship is characterized by cooperation,
mutual respect and solidarity, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic: Power Crisis in Republika Srpska Surmounted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic said today the crisis in the Serb executive authorities
had been surmounted in the "best possible way," with a triumph of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, Karadzic said the destabilization
in Serb politics, which was triggered by the dismissal of the Serb
premier, had been resolutely prevented by the resolution passed
today in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic sacked his prime minister Rajko Kasagic Wednesday for
the latter's close contact with the international community. The
sacking has indicated an open rift among the Serb leadership and
has enraged the international community which supports the
moderate Kasagic.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament voted this morning to back Karadzic's move
and elected Gojko Klickovic as a replacement, thus ending the
three-day crisis in the Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said that the government's priorities in
the coming period were to work to settle the status of refugees,
find jobs for demobilized soldiers, revive the economy and rebuild
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs must also prepare new laws that should lay the
foundations for a free society and a market economy, the
presidential statement added.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic also said that as he needed to concentrate on some of
the priorities, he was appointing Vice President Biljana Plavsic
to act for him in future contacts with the world community and
other duties in line with the Serb constitution.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, the international community has refused
to deal with Karadzic directly as he is an indicted war criminal
suspect of the international war crimes tribunal. Kasagic,
instead, has made most contacts with the outside world as the Serb
representative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ousted Kasagic arrived in Belgrade today. He
told reporters in the Yugoslav capital that he accepted the
decision made earlier today by parliament.
