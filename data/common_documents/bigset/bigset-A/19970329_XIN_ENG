<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Ross Confer on Israeli-Palestinian Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel stood firm today on
demanding the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fight against
terrorism after the talks between U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ross, arrived here Thursday night from Morocco where he held
talks with PNA President Yasser Arafat, held the first meeting
with Netanyahu immediately upon his arrival, and met with
Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials this afternoon for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk also
attended the meeting. The talks began with both delegations, but
later Ross and Netanyahu sat privately to hold further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Netanyahu said the issue of resuming
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks did not even come up during
the discussions which instead focused only on the PNA's
commitment to launching a long-term fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Despite Ross had told Netanyahu that Arafat had pledged to
fight terrorism, Netanyahu remained unconvinced on Arafat's
commitment in a long term. He said what Israel wanted from
Arafat was more than his verbal pledges or short-term fight
against terror.
</P>
<P>
"We want clear and concrete actions on the part of the
Palestinian National Authority to curb terrorism, to rein in the
assailants, to jail the terrorist leaders, to act against their
infrastructure and to instruct the Palestinian security forces to
cooperate with Israeli security forces to stamp out terrorism," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Israel would not be asked to make
concessions in exchange for the PNA's renewed commitment to
fight terror. "Until security can be secured, the diplomatic
contacts will not be renewed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, diplomatic adviser to Netanyahu, said that the
peace process could not continue if terrorist attacks were
launched every time when it got into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"While the government is interested in addressing needs of
both Israelis and Palestinians, and the government has made great
sacrifices to move forward (the peace process), we simply must
reestablish the rule of game that we don't allow violence to hover
over the negotiating table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross wrapped up his two-day shuttle aimed at defusing the
Israeli-Palestinian tension and returned home late today to
report his visit to President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He called on both sides to refrain from violence and to
restore calm immediately. "One thing is clear as I leave
here that it's essential to reestablish calm. If there is
going to be a way to find the means and best method of
moving forward, we have to have the environment of calm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ross also held talks here with leading
Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Abu Mazen. The
Palestinian side was equally firm on its stand that Israel
must first stop settlement activities before resuming peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed the only way out for ending the current
wave of violence was for Israel to stop Har Homa
construction in East Jerusalem. He blamed Israel for escalating
the situation by refusing to make concessions on the issue
of settlement expansion.

<HEADLINE> China, US See Improved Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
referred to present Sino-US relations as "sunshine after the
rain," expressing a hope that the US will strictly observe the
three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
The United States should no longer let the Taiwan issue
obstruct the improvement and development of Sino-US relations,
Jiang told Newt Gingrich, speaker of the US House of
Representatives this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin welcomed the first visit to China by Gingrich who
leads a delegation of congressmen.
</P>
<P>
This year, members of the US Congress visited China
successively, which has helped the two sides deepen mutual
understanding, reduce differences, and develop reciprocal
cooperation, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"China has been attaching importance to Sino-US relations, and
that a stable growth of Sino-US relations conforms with the
fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples, and is
conducive to the peace, stability and prosperity of the world and
Asia-Pacific region," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that Sino-US ties have gradually resumed
stability following a period of ups and downs," he said,
describing the relations as "sunshine again after the rain."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that US Vice-President Al Gore had left Beijing to
visit other Chinese places, and there was the delegation led by
the Speaker of the House. These visits would be of positive
significance to developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries have different conditions, so
it's natural that there exist some differences. What is important
is that the two sides should make efforts not to let these
differences affect the development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the Taiwan question has been the most
important and sensitive kernel matter in Sino-US relations, and
the proper handling of the issue is key to the stable growth of
Sino-US ties.

<HEADLINE> IRA Claims Responsibility for Railway Bomb Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerillas have claimed responsibility for the two bomb attacks on
railway lines in northwestern England, according to BBC television
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The claim for Wednesday's bomb attacks in Wilmslow town in
Chester county, which severely disrupted railway services but
caused no injuries, was made in a telephone call to the Irish
Republic's semi-state broadcasting network RTE this morning.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded early Wednesday morning in the Wilmslow town
center after an anonymous caller warned in a recognized codeword
that bombs had been planted.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland, has
carried out a series of bomb attacks on mainland England since
February 1996 when it ended a 17-month cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Technology Stressed In Increasing Cotton Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China should turn to technology
to increase cotton output, said State Councilor Chen Junsheng at a
working meeting on cotton production, which ended today.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also director of the National Supply and Marketing
Cooperative, noticed that the cotton planting areas should no
longer be decreased, and great efforts should be made to increase
cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the price of cotton has been hiked over the past
years, he said, it was impossible to use pricing to give scope to
the initiative of farmers for planting more cotton.
</P>
<P>
"Technologies, especially key technologies in breeding,
planting, management, the control of cotton diseases, and
elimination of pests, can significantly increase the per-unit
yield and thus should be the very thing we should depend upon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The price of cotton will remain stable this year, and all
cotton will be purchased by the National Supply and Marketing
Cooperative, Chen said. The involvement of any units or
individuals is not permitted.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Grows at 3.8 Percent Rate at End of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, slightly
slower than previously estimated, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The final revision for fourth quarter growth in the U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP) -- the nation's total output of goods and
services -- was down by a tiny 0.1 percentage point from the
second estimate released a month ago.
</P>
<P>
But at 3.8 percent, the U.S. economy still grew at a much more
rapid pace than the 2.1 percent gain in the third quarter of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The final revision for GDP growth in the fourth quarter
followed previous estimates of increase of 4.7 percent and 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that personal consumer spending, about
two-thirds of U.S. economic activities, increased by 3.4 percent
compared with 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
A big factor in the fourth quarter growth was an improvement of
39 billion dollars in the U.S. trade performance as imports slowed
and exports shot ahead.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1996, the GDP increased by 2.4 percent, unchanged
from last month's estimate. This compared to GDP growth of 2
percent in 1995 and 3.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While fears of inflation have been rising because of the rapid
growth, a key inflation gauge tied to the GDP did not detect any
price pressures. In fact, the report said that a GDP index showed
prices rising just 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the best
showing for prices in more than four years.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. analysts now believe that the U.S. economy is
expanding quickly than they have expected before and the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) will further raise the short-term interest
rate this year. Some said that the growth rate in the current
quarter should be between 3.5 percent and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed increased the federal fund rate, the rate banks
charge each other for overnight loans, from 5.25 percent to 5.5
percent on March 25.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Bomb Explosion in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Four persons were killed and 27
others wounded in an explosion of a booby-trapped bomb that took
place in a restaurant in Boumerdas Province, north Algeria,
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Local radio today quoted Algerian security bodies here as
saying that the explosion broke out in Bourge Al-Bahari,
Boumerdas, some 50 kilometers east of Algiers, capital of the
country.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the blast so far.
</P>
<P>
It coincided with measures taken by the Algerian government to
beef up security nationwide prior to the parliamentary election
slated for June 4.
</P>
<P>
Algerian officials voiced concern over the escalating violence
of the extremist organization to foil the elections.
</P>
<P>
Security forces have increased their offensive in recent months
against Islamic militants who want to topple the government to
install an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people have been killed since the start of
the insurgency, triggered by the army's decision to cancel
1992 legislative elections that Muslim fundamentalist parties
were poised to win.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front has called for
opposition parties and voters to boycott the elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless people in
France dropped slightly by 0.2 percent in February this year to
stand at 3,092,300, said the French Ministry of Labor today
quoting statistics adjusted to seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
However, the tendency of France's labor market remains
ill-oriented, according to a stricter calculation method of the
International Labor Bureau and a former official barometer for
measuring unemployment.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics method of the International Labor
Bureau, the number of jobless people in France increased by 0.3
percent in February and the unemployment rate of the country has
attained 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a former statistics method which had been used by
the French government but was abandoned in August 1995, the number
of jobless people in France increased by 0.2 percent in February
and has now attained 3,454,400 people.
</P>
<P>
The old method regarded all those who worked fewer than 78
hours a month as unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics and economics study bureau
INSEE, the French economy has regained some vigor and is expected
to create 30,000 jobs in the first half of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Berisha Calls for EU Aid to Restore Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President Sali Berisha said today
he hoped other European countries would give or lease police
equipment to help restore order in Albania which has been swept up
in a wave of violence over last month.
</P>
<P>
Berisha told Jan de Marchant et d'Ansembourg, a Dutch diplomat
leading a mission of European relief and security experts to
Albania, foreign forces were needed to protect humanitarian aid
shipments to the Balkan country, the presidential press service
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said European support was vitally important to the
government for national reconciliation's program to restore
stability in the country and find a political settlement to the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Berisha said he was grateful to the European Union (EU) and EU
member countries for their concern and support in restoring
stability and realizing democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the self-styled "salvation committee" set up by
rebels in the southern town of Vlore, calling it "anti-Albanian."
</P>
<P>
D'Ansembourg said that the EU, which did not recognize the
rebels' committee, supported the program for national
reconciliation and the government.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to send urgent humanitarian, financial and economic
aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted in southern Albania in January over the
collapse of high-risk investment schemes, in which thousands of
Albanian families lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened earlier this month after violence
escalated into armed conflicts and spread to most parts of the
Balkan country. More than 100 people have been killed so far in
the violence.

<HEADLINE> Sales of New Homes in US Down in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the U.S.
fell by 0.7 percent in February, the first decline in four months,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of new single-family homes
totaled 811,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate last month,
compared with a revised 817,000 homes in January.
</P>
<P>
But sales in January still had been the highest monthly total
in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The home sales decline in February was the first since they
dropped by 8 percent last October.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department report showed that demand for new
homes dropped in all parts of the country except the West in
February.
</P>
<P>
The decline in sales was led by an 11.6 percent drop in the
Northeast. Sales fell by 3.4 percent both in the South and the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The only region of the country to show an increase was the West
where sales rose 11.7 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
The small decline in February compared to a 3.5 percent
increase in January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) raised interest rates on March
25 for the first time in two years in an effort to dampen demand
in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the U.S. Fed is to slow overall economic growth
enough to keep inflation from rising.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Arrests Hanbo Chairman For Embezzling Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 28 (Xinhua) - South Korean prosecutors today
arrested the chairman of the scandal-stricken Hanbo group, Chung
Bo-Keun on charges of embezzling company funds.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Chung Bo-Keun, in collusion with his
father Chung Tae-Soo, took 370 won (41 million U.S. dollars) from
the group and used it to buy securities for himself and pay his
personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-Soo,the group's founder, is already in jail, charged
with bribing government officials and politicians to obtain the
bank loan.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will set up a separate team to track down the
Chung family's hidden wealth, which will be seized if evidence
shows the family has evaded tax.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Steel Industry Co., the nation's second-largest steel
maker, collapsed in January under 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in
debts, mostly in questionable bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The failure triggered charges of high-level corruption, leading
to the arrests of 10 high-ranking figures accused of giving or
taking bribes in exchange for arranging the loans.

<HEADLINE> KTMT Boss Decries Media Control by Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Times Media Trust (KTMT)
boss has said that Kenya would risk being seriously undermined if
the local media is controlled by foreigners, Kenya Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted KTMT Executive Chairman Wilson Kibeett as
saying that the ideas of local people would be obliterated overnight
if the local media is dominated by foreign-owned newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Before the Kenya Times came into being, local newspapers were
all controlled by foreigners, said the boss, adding that ideas
bred in foreign capitals were be pumped into the Kenyan
population in the name of democratization.
</P>
<P>
He stated that KTMT had supported changes but changes must be
for the good of the local people, and the ideas advocated in the
local media must be beneficial to Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the past few years the local media had
seen dramatic changes with new private companies and individuals
entering the media scene.
</P>
<P>
The media boss hoped that these mushrooming media houses would
strive to reflect the true feelings and aspirations of the people
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In times of crisis like that in Zaire, Kibeett noted, "we
would like to hear the voice of Africa by Africans and not that
of foreigners paid to sing weird foreign tunes about Africa."
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times and the Kenya Television Network (KTN) are
truly indigenous media with the objective to have the people of
Kenya look forward into the future with confidence by reporting
in such a way that the nation is held together, the media boss
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> HK TDC Holds Seminar for Economic Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A seminar that aims to boost the
cooperation between Hong Kong and the Chinese inland areas in the
service industry was held today in Beijing by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
More than 350 people, including Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and other officials in the
inland areas as well as people in the economic circles from the
inland areas and Hong Kong, attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
With the title of "Hong Kong: A Key Partner for Economic
Development", the purpose of the seminar is to further acquaint
the Chinese inland areas with Hong Kong's economic achievements
and potentials, especially its position as the center of the
service industry in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cooperations between Hong Kong and the inland areas in the
sectors of infrastructure construction, transportation, market
promotion, finance, and other topics were also discussed at the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the seminar, Sun said each piece of
preparatory work to greet Hong Kong's return is being carried out
in an orderly way and has been proven as effective, adding that to
maintain and develop Hong Kong's stability and prosperity after
1997 is the common aspiration of the people.
</P>
<P>
The seminar held by the Hong Kong TDC is a useful and
far-sighted exploration, he said, and he hopes the seminar will
further boost the two sides to explore potentials for cooperation
in new fields, especially in the service industry.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes that Hong Kong will keep its status as
an international economic and trade center after its return to the
motherland, under the guideline of "one country, two systems,"
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong," with a high-degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region will surely play its role as a window for
the inland areas to know about the world, a link to the world
economy, as well as a bridge to introduce capital, technology, and
management experience, he added.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sze, executive director of the Hong Kong TDC, presided
over today's seminar, and said Beijing and Hong Kong maintain a
sound cooperative basis in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a solid industrial basis and is regarded as a major
center of the electronic and computer industries, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Combined with Hong Kong's fast and efficient market
information, rich management experience, excellent ability to
design and expand foreign trade, as well as its information
network worldwide, Beijing can link the products made in the
inland areas with Hong Kong's network and jointly explore the
world market with Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The further opening of the inland areas, especially the
permission for foreign business people to gradually participate in
the tertiary industry, will provide plenty of opportunities for
cooperation in the service industry between Beijing and Hong Kong,
Sze said.

<HEADLINE> CIS Leaders Ends One-Day Summit in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded summit of
leaders of the 12-nation Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
gave a ""powerful political impulse to integration," Russian
President Boris Yeltsin said today.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit showed "our resolute intention to bring
equal and mutually beneficial cooperation to a new level," the
Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying at a post-summit
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who was re-elected chairman of the CIS council of
heads of state, said that there was a very open debate about the
future of the CIS during the summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "unanimously concluded that the CIS is necessary,
but five years is not long enough for it to take definitive
shape," Yeltsin admitted.
</P>
<P>
He added the CIS leaders called for further integration "in a
modern form, using existing international models."
</P>
<P>
The CIS, set up in December 1991, groups all ex-Soviet
republics except for the three Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
Economic integration among the CIS member states was also a
major topic at the summit, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that leaders agreed a plan to upgrade economic links
among member states, including eventual creation of free trade
zone, payment union and joint efforts to expand transportation
infrastructure and promote mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
The summit was originally set for January, but was postponed
due to Yeltsin's health problem. The next summit is expected to be
held in June this year.

MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today was again elected chairman of the CIS Heads of State Council
at the CIS summit, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth time that the Russian president was elected

The meeting "was very important, and has demonstrated our
determination to bring the equal, mutually-beneficial cooperation
to a new level," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CIS leaders stand firmly for building up
modern forms of integration, and "the integration has received a
powerful political impulse" at the meeting.
</P>
<P>

drawbacks and failings in the implementation of decisions of the
CIS leaders, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Reach 8-Year Landmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain rose by
nearly 10 percent in the year to March, making the month the best
for prices since they peaked eight years ago, according to the
Nationwide Building Society's (NBS) monthly index.
</P>
<P>
The NBS said house prices had risen by 1.6 percent in March,
the biggest monthly rise since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the year to March prices rose by 9.7 percent, the largest
yearly increase recorded by the NBS since the autumn of 1989.
</P>
<P>
The average house price was 56,616 pounds (90,586 US dollars),
the biggest yearly increase recorded by the NBS since the autumn
of 1990. This is nearly 5,000 pounds (8,000 US dollars) more than
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The NBS said prices were being driven up by a shortage of
property on the market, particularly in London and the South East.
</P>
<P>
The number of people with negative equity -- loans that are
larger than the value of their property -- is still about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest figure since the second quarter of 1990, but
will continue to hinder recovery, the NBS said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Sanderson, head of research of the NBS, said, "Surveyers
carrying out Nationwide valuations continue to report a reluctance
among homeowners to place their current property on the market,
preferring to wait until they have a new home."
</P>
<P>
Some potential sellers were prepared to wait until after the
election to put their houses on the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
The NBS claimed that the market was not performing in the same
way as it did in the late eighties, when annual house price
inflation reached more 100 percent in some parts of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Fair Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two senior Chinese officials in
charge of Hong Kong affairs and Tung Chee Hwa, first chief
executive of the HK Special Administrative Region, said here today
that the Hong Kong Fair being held in Beijing is of great
significance to boosting understanding between Hong Kong and
China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under
the State Council, said Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a
big event, about which the people in the inland areas show great
concern.
</P>
<P>
The fair exhibits Hong Kong's development, helping people learn
about the details of the central government's policies toward Hong
Kong, such as "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", with a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
told reporters that the fair shows Hong Kong's history and
development, and a lot of experience from which can be useful for
people in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fair also indicates that Hong Kong benefits
from the reform and opening-up in the inland areas, and the two
sides have reciprocal and indispensable relations.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the fair, Tung Chee Hwa said that the fair had
been well-prepared and worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that through contacts with leaders of the central
government, he has full confidence in Hong Kong's future
development.

<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk Urges to Work Out Rules of King Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 28 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia has urged the National Assembly to work out rules to
elect a new king in case of his abdication, according to a royal
palace bulletin released today.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to talk about this very complex and thorny issue,
the most urgent problem is to elect a new king with a majority
vote or unanimous vote by the throne council in case of abdication
or death of Norodom Sihanouk," said the king.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent for the National Assembly and the Royal
Government to work out the rules of electing a new king," he said.
</P>
<P>
The King said the succession of throne in Thailand, Japan and
Belgium is a model of "hereditary."
</P>
<P>
"But in Cambodia the case is different. There is no hereditary
but elective system in Cambodia," the King said, adding "princes
are allowed to engage in politics and enjoy equal rights with the
people according to the 1947 constitution."
</P>
<P>
The king suggested that as the Khmer nation is concerned, the
special problem of throne succession should be solved.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Oil, Gas Revenues Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's oil and gas revenues
fell by more than 10 percent last month because of a combination
of falling prices and a decline in production, according to
figures released here today.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices declined sharply by 2.81 US dollars per barrel in
February to 20.91 US dollars per barrel -- the lowest level since
last August -- a fall of 11.8 percent on the January price, the
Royal Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index said.
</P>
<P>
Oil output also fell by 1.7 percent in February, a fall that
has now been sustained for three months, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, production, at 2.64 million barrels per day, remains
2.7 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Gas production also began its seasonal decline -- brought
forward by the mild winter -- with production falling 9.3 percent
in the month. On an annual basis, production was down 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Boyle, Royal Bank's head of business economics, said
that it was likely that lower oil prices are here to stay.
</P>
<P>
Boyle said, "The fall in prices was expected following the mild
winter, higher OPEC production and the return of Iraqi
production."
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence that producers are hedging sales for up to
12 months, which, in a falling market, suggests they are not
confident that the heady prices of 1996 will return," he added.

<HEADLINE> Regulation on Anti-Dumping, Anti-Subsidy Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Signed by Premier Li Peng, a
regulation on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy has gone into effect
today.
</P>
<P>
Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures will be taken under the
conditions when by dumping or subsidizing, some imported products
into the Chinese market pose threat to relevant Chinese national
industries, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
If the export price of an imported product is lower than the
product's normal value, such an action is taken as dumping. And
the regulation gives explicit definitions of the terms such as
export price and normal value.
</P>
<P>
When a Chinese enterprise suspects that a foreign manufacturer
sells the same or similar products on the Chinese market by way of
dumping, it should submit a written application to the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) for investigation.
</P>
<P>
As soon as a dumping case is put on record, the MOFTEC, the
State Economic and Trade Commission, the General Administration of
Customs, and departments of the State Council will conduct
thorough investigations.
</P>
<P>
When a foreign manufacturer is found to be dumping products in
China, it will be levied taxes, or required to provide guarantee
deposits or other forms of guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments or public institutions, which offer
financial aid or other benefits to export-oriented industries or
enterprises in their countries, will be covered by the
regulation's anti-subsidy articles.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem, West Bank Relatively Quiet Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- It has been relatively
quiet today in Jerusalem and the West Bank despite skirmishes,
after a week of tense confrontations between Israeli troops and
Palestinian protesters in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Jewish worshipers were
evacuated from the area for a brief period, after Palestinian
youths began throwing stones at the Israeli security forces on
the Temple Mount, during which a number of policemen were lightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
Today's Friday prayers at the Al Aqsa Mosque, on the Temple
Mount, attended by an estimated 25,000 Palestinian Muslim
worshipers, passed peacefully.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports of stone-throwings in the Palestinian
neighborhood of Shuafat in East Jerusalem earlier this morning,
before the Israeli police rushed to the scene and restored
order. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Jewish woman from the Kiryat Arba Settlement
outside Hebron, was wounded near the Palestinian village of Bet
Omar after stones ripped through her car's windshield.
</P>
<P>
Inside the disputed town of Hebron, Palestinian protesters
this morning threw firebombs and stones at Israeli Border Police
troops, injuring one policeman. Some 10 firebombs thrown in the
incident caused damage to vehicles in the area.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said more than 30 Palestinians were taken
to hospital in Hebron, who got injuries when Israeli troops fired
rubber bullets and tear gas at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Israel has beefed up its security around the country, as well
as in the West Bank, with tanks and snipers deployed outside
Palestinian towns and villages to prevent possible unrest.
</P>
<P>
For the third weekend in a row, Jerusalem police were out in
full force at the Temple Mount and at Har Homa, where a
controversial Jewish neighborhood is being built.
</P>
<P>
Although some restrictions have been lifted, the closure
imposed on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is still in effect,
which bars tens of thousands of Palestinians from entering
Israel.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Israeli army has also blocked
Palestinians from the border industrial zones and has instructed
settlement security officers to prevent the entry of Palestinian
workers.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 suspected Hamas activists have been arrested in the
West Bank since last Friday's suicide bombing attack in a Tel
Aviv cafe, which left three women dead and over 40 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the village of Tsurif, home of the cafe attacker
Moussa Ranimat, is still under curfew.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Staff Reach Job Protection Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3,000 airline employees
have accepted a two-year pay freeze and a 15 percent wage cut for
new recruits in return for a job protection agreement, according
to the Daily Telegraph today.
</P>
<P>
British Airways baggage staff and drivers voted by almost two
to one for the deal, which safeguards their jobs from being
"outsourced" to independent operators for three years, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The airline, which is aiming to make efficiencies worth 1
billion pounds (1.6 billion US dollars) by the end of the decade,
has warned that redundancy was inevitable if the terms were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
Others among the airline's 55,000 workforce, such as cabin
crew, check-in and catering staff, are expected to be offered
similar deals.
</P>
<P>
The airline said the reduced starting-rate for new entrants
would be in line with equivalent pay offered by alternative
suppliers at Healthrow, which generally operate with lower staff
ratios.
</P>
<P>
Robert Ayling, chief executive of the airline, said, "This
agreement demonstrates that while we are looking for efficiencies,
we are working with staff -- not against them."

<HEADLINE> China Fights IPR Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China has been quite successful
in combating violations of intellectual property rights (IPR) and
pirated production during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"Such successes help build a good image of China in IPR
protection," said Yu Youxian, director of China's State Copyright
Administration, at a five-day national meeting in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that China has seized 29 underground production lines
making illegal CDs last year, and over 14 million pirated items.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts made to crack down on IPR violations have
punctured the arrogance of law breakers and safeguarded legal
rights and interests of Chinese and foreign IPR owners.
</P>
<P>
"A sound environment is being formed for healthy growth of
China's copyright trade as well as cooperation with the rest of
the world in the fields of economy, culture, science, and
technology.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the work of copyright protection, the central
government last year increased the staff member quota for the
State Copyright Administration.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that laws on copyright protection must be perfected and
law enforcement intensified. He urged directors of local copyright
bureaus to curb violations against IPR to the absolute minimum.
</P>
<P>
A new regulation went into effect February 1, 1997, to
reinforce the punishment of copyright violators.
</P>
<P>
The Implementation Regulations On The Administrative Punishment
of Copyright Violators define the power and functions of
government departments in fighting piracy, as well as relevant
procedures.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot House of Representatives
and the Russian Duma today signed a cooperation protocol to boost
ties between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The three-year protocol was signed here by House President
Spyros Kyprianou and his Russian counterpart Gennadi Seleznev, who
arrived here today on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Kyprianou said the
cooperation protocol aims at safeguarding close cooperation
between Cyprus and all parties represented in the Russian Duma.
</P>
<P>
He also described the signing of the protocol as the beginning
of a new era to the benefit of both countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Seleznev described the document as "very
important," and said the protocol is one of ten such protocols the
Russian Federation has signed with other countries.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed support to a multi-million dollar missile
deal Cyprus signed with Russia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, the two sides will set up a joint
parliamentary committee, aiming at enhancing existing ties through
consultations and exchange of information on matters of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev also had a meeting today with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, who thanked him for a resolution on Cyprus the
Duma unanimously adopted in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for the demilitarization of the island,
and backs the establishment of a multi-national force, as
proposed by Clerides to the U.N. in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma also stressed the need to safeguard the
territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and demanded
the restoration of fundamental freedoms and individual rights.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed

during her African trip and said her visit to Africa has
dispeled some pessimism by some thinkers that Africa is about to
be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, Mrs. Clinton said one of the
reaons why she decided to come to Africa was to carry out a
personal fact-finding mission about positive achievements being
registered on the continent and bring them to attention of
Americans.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Way Found for Making Semiconductors in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- American Scientists working at
Cornell University have found a new way for making new
semiconductor materials for computer chips and other uses that are
almost impossible to make now, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A paper on the new technique is to appear Monday in the journal
Applied Physics Letters.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductors are tiny crystals that conduct electrocity.
These substances, commonly composed of silicon, germanium or
compounds of gallium, are at the heart of integrated circuits that
control computers, cellular phones, communication devices and
thousands of other electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
Many of the semiconductors now in use are single-crystal types
grown as thin films that can be stacked to produce electronic
devices. To make this thin film, it must be grown on a bulkier
base, or substrate, of the same or similar materials.
</P>
<P>
But scientists said that many semiconductor materials with
great potential could not be grown in quantity with necessary
purity because there was no good substrate on which to produce
them. That has been considered a significant obstacle to making
new semiconductor materials.
</P>
<P>
To overcome this, the Cornell team developed a way to use a
common substrate to make a new semiconductor by putting in an
intermediate, thin layer of gallium arsenide on top of the base
and growing the new crystal on top of the stack.
</P>
<P>
By using this technique, the scientists said, it should be
possible to make substrates of gallium compounds or silicon,
topped with a "sacrificial layer" on which to grow all kinds of
new semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
With this technique breaking a fundamental limit in materials
science, the Cornell University scientists said that they, for the
first time, demonstrated that a universal substrate on which a
crystal of any materials can be grown is possible.

PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the results of
the summit on the crisis of Zaire in the Togolese capital Lome
this week, during which the two warring sides of Zaire agreed to

Biya as well as the Zairean government delegation, which he said
"had the courage to sit by the same table" with the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks A Test for Turkish Cypriots, Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot government spokesman
said today that the ball of the proximity talks on the Cyprus
issue is now on the Turkish Cypriots' court, testing if their
leader will show some changes in stance.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily press briefing here that
he did not wish to comment on where the proximity talks are headed
for, but noted that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has asked
for some more time to speak for his turn during the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks with the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Abiding by an agreement on not to publish the content of
the proximity talks, Cassoulides refrained from clarifying on
topics of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will show whether Denktash has the willingness
to discuss and change his well-known positions on basic aspects
of the Cyprus issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks have been conducted since March 10, between
Clerides and Denktash, through mediator and U.N. Resident
Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel, to pave the way for the
U.N. proposed direct negotiations between the two community
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Feissel has shuttled between the two sides and conveyed the
messages from one side to the other twice a week. So far nothing
has been revealed since the talks began.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also read out a written statement by Clerides that
he will do his duty with only the national interests as his guide,
and if his views clash with those of his top advisory body, the
National Council, he will act according to his own judgement.
</P>
<P>
The statement came amid press reports that his coalition
partner, Democratic Party leader Spyros Kyprianou, who is also
House President, has warned him against engaging in a direct talks
on the Cyprus problem without common ground found between the
views of the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that the National Council has decided
to assess the results of the ongoing proximity talks, and then
decide if any common ground was reached to allow fruitful direct
talks to take place.
</P>
<P>
The National Council, comprised of five political party
leaders, is the top advisory body to the president on handling
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Tunisian President Meets Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine
Bin Ali conferred here today with his Palestinian counterpart
Yasser Arafat on the faltering Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here this morning on a short visit that was not
previously announced.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed the Tunisian president on the latest
developments of the peace process particularly on the stalled
Palestinian-Israeli track, due to the hardline policies of Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, according to the Palestinian
News Agency (WAFA).
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the dangers facing Jerusalem
because of the Israeli settlement policy that runs counter to the
internationally-sponsored accords.
</P>
<P>
"There are malicious attempts by the Israeli government to
Judaize Jerusalem, which is not only a Palestinians city but
also an Arab, Islamic and Christian one," Arafat told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the Israeli moves to seize the Palestinian
territories around the city and construct Jewish settlements
inside it are aimed at separating the city and the rest of the
Palestinian territories and replacing Bethlehem with the Har Homa
settlement in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Arafat voiced regret over the two vetos by the U.S. in over
one week against the U.N. draft resolutions, one by the Security
Council and another one by the General Assembly, both aimed at
blocking Netanyahu's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
All the above-mentioned developments, particularly in the
light of the resolutions adopted by the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference in Islamabad, Pakistan,
and the session of the Jerusalem committee in Rabat, Morocco,
urge the Arab and Muslim nations to act quickly to face up to the
Israeli policy, Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
He deemed the Israeli policy as "dangerous to the besieged
Palestinian people who suffer great losses daily."
</P>
<P>
Arafat underlined that the Palestinian people can never turn
a deaf ear to havoc done to its sanctities, land, children and
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Bin Ali for the stance of the Tunisian government
and people on backing the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader left here this afternoon. He arrived
here this morning from Rabat, where he attended the 16th session
of the Jerusalem Committee which was wrapped up Thursday.

BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Economic and
Technological Development Zone, now in a fund shortage, will
receive 500 million yuan in loans from the Beijing Urban
Cooperative Bank in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The loan, to be mortaged by the use right of 110,000 square
meters of land in the zone, will be used to develop 1.87 sq km of
land in the central part of the zone.
</P>
<P>
The zone, the only state-level development zone in the Chinese
capital city, has made progress over the past five years since its
construction began.
</P>
<P>
The initial-stage project of 3.87 sq km of land has been
developed and 108 firms with a total investment of 860 million US
dollars have entered.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, 30 firms in the zone have gone into
operation, completing an industrial output of 1.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the local government acknowledged that the zone
lagged behind in the country's 32 state-level zones as a result of
lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Urban Cooperative Bank, after an in-depth and
meticulous survey in the zone, said the zone has great potential
for further growth and is likely to become a new driving force for
the city's future economic development.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest "Ice Cap" Discovered in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese glaciologists have
discovered the ice cap on the Kunlun Mountains in western China's
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Chinese experts named the world highest ice
cap "Guliya".
</P>
<P>
Most ice caps are located on mountaintops or high altitude
sections. The shape of the ice structure resembles a huge cap on
the high mountain, hence the term.
</P>
<P>
Guliya Ice Cap, taking a space of 376.1 square kilometers, is
located in western part of the Kunlun Mountains at an altitude of
6,700 meters.
</P>
<P>
Its top is as large as 131.2 sq km and its lower part takes a
much larger space. And the annual average temperature there is
17.8 degrees of centigrade below zero.
</P>
<P>
The crystal ice cap, hemmed in by a total of 4.306 glaciers, is
dazzling with the sunlight and the glaciers look like huge ribbons
hanging on the cap in the huge mountain chains.
</P>
<P>
Yao Tandong, a research fellow at the Lanzhou Institute of
Glaciology and Cryopedology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said the ice cap and glacier are resultant from long time sediment
of ice crystal.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the deep layer of the Guliya ice cap was
formed some 700,000 years ago and its upper layer was shaped about
150,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery could help research into the climate tens of
millions years ago and extrapolate future climactic conditions,
Yao added.

<P>
TIRANA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic Party
today officially called for an investigation into former defense
minister Safet Zhulali, who fled the country amid the anarchy now
gripping the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Zhulali fled to Italy with his family on March 14. In a
statement, the party accused the former minister of doing nothing
to stop the widespread looting of weapons a month ago which
sparked the armed uprising in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The party, headed by beleagured President Sali Berisha,
condemned the irresponsibility and the shameful flight of Zhulali
at a critical time for the country.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent a month ago as rebels looted weapons
from army depots and started fighting the military. Several cities
in southern Albania are in the hands of rebels who are demanding
the resignation of President Berisha, whom they blame for the
collapsed investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Berisha agreed to set up a government for national
reconciliation with the opposition Socialist Party two weeks ago
in a bid to end the crisis and to prepare for early general
elections in June.
</P>

Zhulali was replaced as defense minister by Socialist Shaquir
Vukaj in the new government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China has preliminarily set up a
legal system for the management of state-owned assets, with three
administrative regulations and 160 rules promulgated.
</P>
<P>
An authority with the National Administrative Bureau of
State-owned Assets (NABSA) said that the legal system, with the
"State-owned Assets Law" at the core, still being drafted,
includes a number of administrative regulations drawn up by the
State Council, the country's highest governing body, and many
rules drafted by the NABSA and some departments.
</P>
<P>
The three regulations covers property assessment, property
management supervision, and property right registration, the
authority noted, adding that another two regulations which will
cover the loss of state-owned assets and property transfer are now
being drafted and will soon be promulgated, and so are another 25
rules.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NABSA has increased efforts at law enforcement,
setting up a law enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the state-owned administrative
departments directly investigated 25 cases in 1996, avoiding the
loss of assets worth 1.7 billion yuan (about 213 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The departments have settled 49 cases over the past few years,

official documents to curb such buildings.
</P>
<P>
New construction exceeding 30 million yuan (3.6 million US
dollars) and technical renovation schemes over five million yuan
should go through stricter examination procedures before being
approved, according to a circular issued by the provincial
economic and trade commission and planning commission.
</P>
<P>
Buildings of lesser investment value should also be strictly
curbed, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
Banks and financial institutions should not offer credit to
those unauthorized projects, the circular notes.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities also demanded that localities in
Shandong should shift from expanding the construction scale to
more attention paid to the improvement of the internal management
and raising of efficiency.

<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

1950's and 1960's.
</P>
<P>
-- After fielding more than 1,500 telephone calls from
anguished relatives across the country in the last 24 hours,
investigators said that they had identified 30 of the 39 members

half-dozen of the 18 male members of the cult who died had
previously been surgically castrated.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tried to break the Mideast impasse in

</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic National Committe's current 14 million
dollars debt was foreshadowed in late 1995 when internal campaign
documents projected a debt of up to seven million dollars that
year unless President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice
President Gore made phone calls to solicit funds for an aggressive
early media campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- The growing number of Americans with disabilities has
automakers scrambling to make more-accessible vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Credit Coops Play Important Role In Chinese Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's rural credit cooperatives
have been playing an important role in the country's agricultural
production and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China said that the bank surplus in credit
coops topped 879.4 billion yuan last year, while loans 629 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of loans that farmers asked for and 70 percent
of loans for township enterprises are provided by rural credit
coops, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
China started the credit coop business in its counties and
villages in 1950s, aiming to boost the agriculture and rural
economy, and the sector has developed rapidly because of its
responsive services.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reported that by the end of last year, a total of
more than 52,400 credit cooperatives have been set up nationwide,
with 600,000 staff members, and the total assets of the sector has
reached 1.4 trillion yuan.

<HEADLINE> PNA Calls for Decisive Arab Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian minister today urged
Arab foreign ministers to send a strong message to Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the upcoming Arab League Council
meeting as the recent U.S. mediation has turned out to be no avail.
</P>
<P>
"An clear-cut agreement should be reached on a mechanism to
stand up to Israel's attempts to flout the peace process," said
Minister of Local Administration at the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Saeb Erekat in an interview with Voice of Arab
radio in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
At a routine meeting Sunday, 22 foreign ministers of the Arab
League are expected to formulate a joint response to the Israeli
ground-breaking last week on a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said his talks with U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis
Ross Friday did not make any progress as he was informed by Ross
that there is no new American initiative to get out of the current
impasse.
</P>
<P>
Ross wrapped up his two-day shuttle mission between the
Palestinians and Israelis and returned home late Friday to report
to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy was expected to devise a formula by which Arafat
would recommit himself to fighting violence and Netanyahu would
promise not to take any more unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
But after talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
Netanyahu and Erekat, also the Palestinian chief negotiator, Ross
appeared to come up short of available means to save the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has reached a deadlock especially in
the light of Israeli settlement and Judaization policies, Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that the Palestinians were awaiting the results
of the U.S. mediation despite the fact that Washington had used
its veto power twice at the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians, who are beginning to lose patience, will never
accept what is happening to their sanctities, land and people," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Arafat of orchestrating the rioting and
giving the go-ahead for terrorist attacks while Palestinians blame
Israel for provoking violence by launching a Jewish neighborhood
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinians and Israelis trade accusations over the
peace crisis, clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank have entered the ninth day,
culminating in last Friday's suicide bombing attack in a Tel
Aviv cafe, killing four people and wounding dozens of others.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Price Control Goals for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A circular issued by the State
Council says that this year the increase rate of China's retail
price index will be brought to under six percent, and the consumer
price index under eight percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the level of economic development in different
areas, specific local price regulation objectives have also been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the increase rates of the retail price index
and consumer price index had been set below around 10 percent and
12 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's retail price index rose 6.1 percent in 1996 and the
consumer price index 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on government departments at various levels
to continue implementing the relatively stringent fiscal and
monetary policies to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should also take effective measures to
guarantee the supply of food grain and vegetables, and other farm
produce, the circular says.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Provides Fine Seed Strains for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui province, a
major grain producer, has prepared 75 million kilograms of fine
seed strains to provide for spring sowing this year.
</P>
<P>
The rate of fine seed strains of this year's sowing is expected
to reach more than 90 percent, three percentage points higher than
last year.
</P>
<P>
The province launched a "Seed Project" in early 1996 to help
improve seed quality. So far, more than 70 seed corporations and a
fine seeds center to introduce new seed varieties have been set up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anhui province strengthened the building of fine
seed bases. Last year, 700,000 ha of seed breeding bases were
built and 250 million kilograms of fine seed strains produced. At
present, 90 percent of seeds used have been processed.
</P>
<P>
The local government also plans to invest approximately 100
million yuan to establish two large seed processing centers, a
center to process vegetable seeds and a reserve store of seeds.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province is expected to plant 1.14 million ha of
spring crops, in which, over 95 percent will be planted with
cereals, cotton, and oil-bearing crops.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Israeli Condition for Resuming Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today rejected Israel's precondition for the
resumption of peace negotiations between the two sides, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for PNA President Yasser Arafat,
told reporters in Gaza that Israel's demand for a crack-down on
"terror" as a precondition for resuming peace talks was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations and implementations of the signed
agreements, namely the Interim Agreement calling for further
Israeli pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank, must be
resumed without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, following a meeting with U.S. special Middle East
Coordinator Dennis Ross, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
said that negotiations would not be resumed unless the PA acts
against "terror."
</P>
<P>
Ross, who met Arafat in Rabat of Morocco Thursday,
reportedly brought Netanyahu a promise from the Palestinian
leader that he will act to prevent extremist attacks and
violence against Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu told Ross that there is no evidence that
Arafat is keeping that promise, and asked the U.S. envoy to
assist in organizing a direct meeting between himself and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is due to convene a PNA cabinet meeting this
evening when he will brief the cabinet members on his talks
with Ross and his visits to South Asia and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after his meeting with Ross Friday,
Netanyahu said that Israel has not been requested to do anything
to counter-balance Arafat's promise to fight against terror.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier added that the PNA actions against terror
"will not be a one-time act, but an on-going activity,"
including the arrest of activists of militant groups, and the
destruction of their infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Ross, concluding his mission in the Middle East aimed at
resolving the current crisis between Israel and the Palestinians,
is on his way back to the U.S. to report to President Bill
Clinton on his trip of the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, confrontations between Israeli troops and Palestinian
protesters continued in the West Bank town of Bethlehem today,
as dozens of Palestinian youths threw stones at Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers responded by firing rubber bullets and tear
gas at the demonstrators, slightly injuring several Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The latest unrest came after the Israeli government decided to
go ahead with the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in
East Jerusalem, despite strong condemnations by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians view the construction as another Israeli attempt
to Judaize East Jerusalem, a city which the Palestinians see as
the capital for their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Israel's insistence on building on Jabal Abu
Ghneim (Har Homa) "violates the signed accords, and contradicts
the Middle East peace process."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Pilgrims Vow to Stage Demonstrations in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hajji pilgrims today
vowed to stage demonstrations in Mecca despite a Saudi ban.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, head of Iranian hajji pilgrims,
called the Saudi government for "cooperation" in their performance
of the "religious duty".
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a time when Tehran was trying to improve
ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. It is believed
that the pilgrimage in Mecca would be a test of the latest
goodwill gestures from the Iranian regime and the Saudi
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that some 9,600 Iranian
hajji pilgrims have left from 15 Iranian airports today to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that a total of 72,500 Iranian pilgrims will be
allowed to perform their Islamic religious duty in Saudi Arabia by
April 11.
</P>
<P>
The first group of pilgrims will be transferred back to Iran on
April 22 and the last group on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Nouri, Iranian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said
Friday that Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani is expected
to make his first official visit to Saudi Arabia in April to
perform the hajji pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
"President Rafsanjani's visit will give a strong push forward
to bring the hearts and policies (of the two sides) closer," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On March 15, Rafsanjani urged Saudi Arabia to lift the ban on
anti-U.S. and anti-Israel rally during pilgrimage in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The president said "Saudi officials in charge of the pilgrims'
affairs would understand the stands of the Islamic Republic of
Iran toward the Muslim world and would prepare the ground for
Hajji rituals to be held as recommended by the Holy Koran."
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia will serve to
revive the great power of Islam and put it at the disposal of
Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the 64-year-old Iranian president was seen as
an official response to the customary warning issued by the Saudi
authorities that political activities will not be tolerated during
the Hajji in April.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the world of Islam is suffering from division
among Muslim nations, Hajji serves as a means to help bring about
unity among them," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Such demonstrations have previously led to tension between the
two countries and even bloodshed. In 1987, more than 400 people
were killed in clashes between Iranian demonstrators and Saudi
forces. The two countries broke off diplomatic relations in 1988
and resumed the ties three years later.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities kept a close watch on Iranian pilgrims in
the past years, trying to prevent them from holding any rallies in
public.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province plans to beef up its efforts to control pesticide
residue in export vegetables this year.
</P>
<P>
The local government noted that last year witnessed cases
of pesticide residue in export vegetables over state standards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, the provincial bureau for
inspection on import and export commodities checked 59,000 batches
of export vegetables, totalling 310,000 tons, of which, 0.05
percent showed excessive pesticide residue, higher than previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Improved and more effective measures adopted afterwards have
prevented the occurrence of vegetables with excessive pesticide
residue, and particularly since early this year, the provincial
inspection bureau has stepped up checks and inspections on the
safety of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it is expected to work in close cooperation with a
research institute from the State Bureau of Commodities Inspection
and the South China Agriculture University to set up a system for
enhancing inspections and researches in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Official Pledges Bigger Role of Interest Rate Leverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China needs to further wield the
market-based financial leverage of interest rates in an effort to
deepen its financial reform, said a banking official with the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He also advised the central bank to continue keeping the rate
at a low level, and improve the role of a floating interest rate.
</P>
<P>
"The current market rates, the inter-bank interest rate, and
the bonds yield in particular, stay still higher than reasonable
and have to be cut further," the official said, adding that a
further rate cut this year will do good in keeping the level of
inflation lower than the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The central bank official said that a stable interest rate is
the top priority of financial authorities this year, but some
modifications are still required to be done to carry out the
in-depth market-oriented financial reform.
</P>
<P>

NANJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Development zones in east China's
Jiangsu Province have taken the lead in opening up to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, a total of 10.86 billion yuan (about
1.3 billion US dollars) had poured into the 11 state-level
development zones in the province, according to latest official

billion US dollars of promised investment by overseas businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Various development zones in Jiangsu, especially those at

hi-tech zones, holiday resorts and bonded zones, have become hot
spots for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the development zones in the province actually used a

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Jerusalem Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foregin Minister Amr
Moussa said the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) played an important and successful role in making
a common response to Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is impossible to keep quiet over Israeli policy
vis-a-vis Jerusalem and there is a unanimous agreement in facing
up to a crisis in Jerusalem," he said, in statements published
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee meeting held in Rabat, Morocco,Thursday
has issued an "important resolution" calling on Islamic states to
adopt "specific measures" in the face of Israel's settlement
practices in Jerusalem, but he did not specify what these steps
are.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Committee, led by Morocco's King Hassan II and
made up of 14 nations plus the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), met Thursday to map out a joint response to the
ground-breaking for a new Jewish settlement project in Arab East
Jerusalem, where Palestinians claim as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued at the end of the 16th session of the
Jerusalem Committee Thursday evening "urged Arab and Muslim
states to reconsider relations with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Moussa noted that the meetings of Arab foreign ministers in the
Cairo-based Arab League Sunday will discuss the same issue and
adopt the same decision to complement resolutions passed by the
OIC Islamabad summit and the Jerusalem Committee meeting in Rabat.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have urged all Arab countries
to suspend moves towards normalizing relations with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of meetings in the past week all centered around
Israel's controversial settlement project in disputed east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa denied that there is an Egyptian-Syrian
proposal to hold an emergency Arab summit in Damascus in April and
said the circumstances for such a summit are not yet adequate.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions adopted at the June Cairo summit last year and
Islamabad OIC summit earlier this month that threatened to freeze
diplomatic ties some Arab and Muslim countries have with Israel
are suffice for now, according to the top Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"There are Arab efforts and coordination but a summit will be
held when needed and in specific circumstances," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. role, the Egyptian Foreign Minister said
it is hard to make a primary assessment of U.S. Mideast Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross' shuttle mission, but he stressed the
importance of the American role and its continued mediation
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian talks have run into crisis since Israel
launched a new Jewish settlement project in Arab East Jerusalem,
sparking Palestinian violence including nine days of West Bank
clashes and a Palestinian militant suicide bomb attack in a Tel
Aviv cafe last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The pace of privatizing the
state-owned copper conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) will not be slackened bacuase the value of the mines could
slump if the process was slowed down.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza in an
interview with local press here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
''It is like selling a second hand car with a knock engine and you
delay so much that in the end all the buyers realize that your car is
finished,'' ''Times of Zambia'' quoted Penza as saying.
</P>
<P>
Refferring to the ZCCM, Penza said, ''we have 39 bidders for the
ZCCM. This is very encouraging. We shall handle the sale of the zccm
diligently and efficiently because delaying may mean having nothing
to sell in the end.''
</P>
<P>
Penza added that it is not a question of how much the ZCCM will be
sold for but what the benefits of privatizing the conglomerate will
be to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM is the major support of the country's economy by earning
about 80 percent of the country's foreign exchange. In July last
year, the government publicized the program for its privatization.
The Zambia privatization agency opened bids for the sale of a number
of mines and assets on February 28 this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. African Non-Mineral Exports Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has experienced a
massive surge in non-mineral export volumes matched only by the
Southeast Asian countries, a local trade expert said recently.
</P>
<P>
The latest Portnet figures show a 33 percent increase in the volume
of exports that left the port of Durban last year, local weekly Mail &AMP;
Guardian quoted economist Mike Schussler as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Durban Port handles a wide range of goods while Richards
Bay, the largest port in South Africa, handles mainly coal.
</P>
<P>
There was a similarly healthy pattern at Johannesburg International
Airport, where increases in export volumes of between 38 percent and
53 percent were registered in the four months to February this year.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year increases in export volumes from the airport never
dropped below 20 percent in the six months to December 1996, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Schussler said that as both the airport and the port deal with a
wide variety of manufactured good -- and do not concentrate on
mineral exports -- the growth shows that South Africa's exports have
become much less dominated by minerals.
</P>
<P>
The value of South Africa's exports has increased substantially
during the past year because of the declining value of the national
currency of Rand. But an increase in the actural volume of exports
is a more important sign that the economy is ticking, Schussler
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Reserve Bank Quarterly Bulletin, export
volumes for 1996 were up 12 percent on the previous year, while the
value of exports increase 21 percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
"By January 1997 exports were up 52 percent on January 1996 in
value terms. This is the type of export growth that only Southeast
Asian countries see," Schussler said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Troubled Oil City in Nigeria under Curfew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A dust-to-dawn curfew has been imposed
on the oil city of Warri and its environs in Delta State, south
Nigeria, to curb the week-long crisis from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The curfew, announced by State Military Administrator Colonel John
Dungs on Friday, would last from 7:00 pm to 6:00 am with effect from
the date of announcement, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by the relocation of the headquarters of
the newly-created Warri South Local Government.
</P>
<P>
The local Ijaw community has embarked on a series of demontrations
since last week to show their displeasure of the removal.
</P>
<P>
They also held 127 oil workers hostage as a means to draw
government attention. Only 32 of the oil workers, employed by oil
giant Shell, have been confirmed freed so far due to the their poor
state of health.
</P>
<P>
The oil city was thrown into turmoil earlier this week as rioters
burnt down public and private property, including a major market and a
house of a former minister.
</P>
<P>
At least four persons, including two rioters, were reportedly
killed during the riot.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance also disrupted oil production. Shell has to close
down a number of production facilities, including one of the its
drilling sub-stations producing 90,000 barrels of crude a day.
</P>
<P>
Chevron, another global oil giant operating in Nigeria, has been
forced to shut down three of its stations with a combined capacity of
45,000 barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Dungs, the curfew, which became a necessity under such
circumstance, will remain in force till further notice and anybody who
disobey the order will be ruthlessly dealt with.
</P>
<P>
A judicial commission of enquiry is to be set up by the state
government to investigate the immediate and remote causes of the
bloody riot, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Kenyan security
forces and the Shangilla bandits of Ethiopia intensified in
Marsabit District of northern Kenya, leaving 21 more people dead,
according to an East African Standard report today.
</P>
<P>
The death toll increased to about 100 since
the outbreak of the armed raids last Sunday by bandits believed
to be the Shangila and Amarkhoke tribesmen from Ethiopia, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Operations at Kenya's Police Headquarters,
G.M. Mwathe, confirmed that raiders numbered more than 2,000 and
instead of 200 as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Most of the raiders have now crossed the border into Ethiopia
with the stolen 4,000 head of cattle, goats and sheep, the Kenyan
police officer pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has declared Marsabit District a
security operation zone to enable the security forces to
battle the raiders.
</P>
<P>
According to Marsabit district Commissioner Muli Malombe, nine
police lorries and seven army helicopters have been mobilized to
help open up safety corridors for the injured and to retrieve the
dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
A security unit comprising General Service Unit, Kenyan Army,
Administration and regular police are combing the area along the
Kenya/Ethiopia border to apprehend the bandits, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Ethiopian Embassy in Nairobi said that the
Ethiopian government had not yet been officially informed of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders here have condemned the killing of Kenyan
people by Ethiopian armed bandits, demanding a government
statement.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that an urgent security meeting be
convened, involving the east African countries of Kenya, Uganda,
Tanzania, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- When the foreign
secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan entered their
second day here today, both sides have some differences over
setting the agenda for the talks, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan delegation led by Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad
insisted that "some progress" should be made on Kashmir before
other outstanding issues could be tackled.
</P>
<P>
A senior Pakistani official said that even if India agreed that
"it (Kashmir) is a dispute, that itself will show that some
progress has been achieved."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, would under no circumstances agree to any
proposal to keep the Kashmir issue outside the agenda of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian officials told the Pakistan side that it would
not compromise its territorial sovereignty. The Indian delegation
led by Foreign Secretary Salman Haider made it clear that New
Delhi was not prepared to consider anything that would disturb the
country's secular unity and jeopardize its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the two sides were getting bogged down on setting
the agenda on the second day of the talks. The agenda for the
talks "is still being worked out," officials from the two sides
said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides maintained that the talks were being held in a
"very cordial" atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether any significant breakthrough was
anticipated, the Pakistan official said, "We are still hopeful."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Pakistan foreign secretary called on Indian
Prime Minister Deve Gowda and exchange views on the entire gamut
of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Over Half of Pudong Residents Satisfied With Their Life Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- About sixty percent of residents
in the Pudong New Area, an economic powerhouse in China's leading
industrial city of Shanghai, expressed satisfaction with their
quality of life, according to the latest survey of 1,000 Pudong
residents.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that over half of the residents of Pudong on
the eastern side of the Huangpu River -- an underdeveloped area
before 1990 -- are now reluctant to move to the other side of the
river which has been prosperous for scores of years.
</P>
<P>
An often-heard saying in Shanghai that urban residents "would
rather have a bedspace in the western part of the Huangpu River
region than have a room in Pudong" is now just a joke.
</P>
<P>
The annual sample survey, conducted by Fudan University, asked
questions in 12 categories, including housing, income, cultural
life, social status, mood, health and marriage.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 57.9 percent of Pudong people believe
that their life quality has experienced some improvement, eight
percent of the people say their quality of life has greatly
improved, and 11.4 percent people felt it has declined.
</P>
<P>
Concerning income, the number of people who are satisfied with
their income is three times higher than that of 1995. However, the
number of people who feel some resentment toward their
circumstances increased at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
The degrees of satisfaction ranged among the respondents,
including self-employeed workers, heads of party or state organs,
technicians, staff members, workers, rural people, employees in
commercial departments and laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 35.7 people are satisfied with their cultural
life; the number was 3.2 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 52 percent of the Pudong residents
would not move to downtown Shanghai even if given the
opportunity. The survey attributed their reluctance to move out of
Pudong to the promising prospects of Pudong, together with their
present satisfaction with housing conditions and municipal
installations.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Pudong residents pay most attention to the
administration of the floating population, re-employment of
workers, control of price hikes, building of a clean government
and the gap between the rich and the poor.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Turns Brown Coal to Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A new technology to turn brown
coal to gas has been made a success in northeast China's Jilin
province.
</P>
<P>
The technology will help reduce environmental pollution by
burning brown coal more efficiently, raising the energy's
utilization rate by approximately 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province has planed to spread the use of the technology.
</P>
<P>
Brown coal, with its high ash and water content, and high
volatility, has internationally been considered low-quality coal,
difficult to produce gas by normal means.
</P>
<P>
Brown coal makes up 70 percent of Jilin's 2.8 billion-ton
proven coal reserve or one tenth of China's total coal reserves.

Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1996.
</P>
<P>
An official with Guangxi said that 161 cooperative projects
between Guangxi and Hong Kong were launched in 1996, with 350
million US dollars invested, covering half of the overseas

<P>
Guangxi imported 300 million US dollars of commodities from
Hong Kong in 1996, covering 33.4 percent of the region's total
import volume.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Interview: Australia Wants Productive Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- "We can have a productive
partnership with China, that is the attitude I will take, and that
is the view I will put to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng when I see them in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
These were remarks by Australian Prime Minister John Howard in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of his first
official visit to China since he assumed office in March last
year.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to my visit to China," Howard said while
expounding his government's China policy and the purposes and
expectations of his visit.
</P>
<P>
"I had a valuable meeting with President Jiang Zemin in Manila
last year, and I will personally tell both the president and the
premier that Australia's relationship with China is of high
importance to me and to my government."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the current relationship between Australia and
China, he said, "I think the relationship is fundamentally very
good. We have very strong economic links. We believe China's
continued economic growth is a very good thing for Australia."
</P>
<P>
Australia, he said, "respects China's role in the world, and I
 expect China to respect Australia's role in the world. And if the
relationship is built on mutual respect, then it would be very
successful."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the so-called "China threat", Howard said "I don't
believe China is a threat to regional security or peace. No, I
don't. And neither does my government. And I don't feel
threatened. I Believe that China wants to be a good neighbor in
the region."
</P>
<P>
With regard to economic issues, Howard said, Australia is a
very reliable supplier of raw materials. There is an eight billion
Australian dollar (about 6.2 billion US dollar) economic link per
year between the two countries. Australian companies are very keen
to invest in China, "This is why about 20 of the most senior
businessmen in the country are coming with me."
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Howard reiterated that his government will
continue to pursue a one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Howard said: "We are different societies, we
each have our own way of dealing with things," adding that "we
don't see ourselves a moral policeman, as adopting a hectoring
approach."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the interview, Howard said he expected his visit
to China would be a success, saying "as we have some goals in
common, we can have a productive partnership in the future."

<HEADLINE> Top Forest Production Base Keeps Steady Growth of Forest Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, China's biggest forest production base, has maintained
the steady growth of its forest resources by planting more trees
and limiting the number of those cut down.
</P>
<P>
Lastest statistics show that the forest coverage rate in the
province has gone up from 38.9 percent in 1991 to the current
41.03 percent, an average annual increase of 0.39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has 18.3 million ha of forest area, and 1.57
billion cubic meters of trees still growing, accounting for 12.6
percent and 14.64 percent, respectively, of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the excessive felling and reduction in tree
planting have resulted in the downswing in growth of the
province's forest resources. To change the situation, the Chinese
government and the province have adopted a series of measures to
curb the over-felling and speed up the afforestation effort.
</P>
<P>
The province also set up a special fund for afforestation which
has collected 1.5 billion yuan (187 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To encourage the farmers to plant more trees, Heilongjiang
allows farmers to lease forest land and sign long-term contracts
for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has applied new technology and scientific
findings to aid in the control of tree disease, fire prevention,
and improving the quality of saplings.
</P>
<P>
The survival rate of trees in the province has reached 90
percent and the number of those damaged by fire has dropped from
1.2 percent in 1991 to the current 0.006 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Heilongjiang has planted two million hectares of
trees -- a move which has also benefitted the agro-ecological
environment in the province.

<HEADLINE> Easter Holidays See Booming Tourism in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A large number of local residents
traveled abroad during the Easter holidays, while restaurants and
hotels are doing a booming business in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The number of Macao residents traveling abroad is estimated to
be 50 percent up from that of last year. About half of them
destined for Thailand, and the rest went for Taiwan and China's
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Hong Kong travel groups also went to Thailand and
Taiwan via Macao, because of a shortage of air tickets in Hong
Kong, Macao Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
AS a result, many air companies using the Macao airport
increased their flights. Air Macao, for instance, added two
additional flights to Thailand and four additional flights to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong residents flocked to Macao to spend the
four-day holidays. Nearly all star-level hotel rooms are being
occupied during the holidays. Some travelers even booked their
rooms a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that Macao's tourism is expected to see a
further five percent growth this year following an
over-five-percent increase in the number of incoming travelers in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Tourism remains a leading sector for the economy of the
21-sq-km Macao, contributing to about one-fourth of the
government's revenue.

<HEADLINE> Investigations on Killing of Israeli Schoolgirls End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 29 (Xinhua) - A three-member military committee
entrusted by the Jordanian government with investigating the killing
of seven Israeli schoolgirls by a Jordanian soldier has finalized
its mission and plans to refer the case to the military court.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's news agency Petra reported today that the charge sheet
contained the confession of the Jordanian soldier, Ahmad Dakamseh,
that he committed the shooting out of a sense of national duty and
to protect his military honor and national dignity.
</P>
<P>
The driver soldier alleged that the Israeli girls had provoked
him by their loud laughter at seeing him perform his prayers and
by one of the girls' attempt to take his picture while he was
praying.
</P>
<P>
He opened fire on the girls on March 13 in the Naharayim area
near the Israeli-Jordanian border, killing seven Israeli
schoolgirls and wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
Dakamseh told investigators that he had not planned the attack
and there was no accomplice in his action.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Najdawi, a lawyer who has been appointed by the general
attorney to defend Dakamseh at the military court, told the press
that "my client told me the Israeli girls stood close to him,
ridiculing him and taking pictures of him while he was bowing for
submission for Muslim noon prayers."
</P>
<P>
"He said he felt it was an inhuman action on behalf of the
girls, that he was personally insulted and his faith was
offended," the lawyer added.
</P>
<P>
Dakamseh was overpowered by fellow soldiers after he grabbed
another soldier's assault rifle and opened fire on the group of
about 40 students.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that he found Dakamseh "was influenced by the
events in the occupied Arab territories and Israel's arrogance,"
adding that he could not see that Dakamseh was "mentally deranged
as his behavior was quite normal."
</P>
<P>
"I can not say that he is a national hero, but he is a patriot
who was motivated to open fire by his feeling that he wants to
defend his country," said Najdawi after meeting Dakamseh.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials have said that Dakamseh had no record of
criminal or political activity.
</P>
<P>
The soldier's family said he was mentally unstable, but his
lawyer said he looked "sane and spoke with me rationally."
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said Dakamseh would be tried in a military court
next month.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Employs 300,000 Immigrant Labourers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, a rising
economic star in Shanghai, has attracted 300,000 laborers from
across China since it formed seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
These workers, which make up one fifth of the total work force
in Pudong, came from Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shandong,
Henan and Jiangxi Provinces.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the workforce are people under age
30. Some 45.5 percent work for the building industry, and 27
percent in industrial enterprises or institutions.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 35 percent came to earn more money, 28 percent
for learning technical skills and 25 percent for enriching their
experience.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 1,000 outsiders have been promoted to the
shift or group leaders, or workshop and factory directors.
</P>
<P>
As the majority of the laborers are inadequately educated, the
Pudong New Area has opened training courses for 80,000-strong
workforce.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Neil Hamilton, the Conservative MP at the center of the
cash-for-questions affairs, was put under renewed pressure to
resign Friday night when Labor announced that its candidate would
stand down in a bid to flush him out. Jon Kelly, the Labor
candidate will formally step down and urge his Liberal Democratic
candidate to do the same. The move would make way for a sole,
independent "anti-corruption" candidate if Hamilton refuses to bow
out.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Liberal Democrats are preparing to redirect their
election attacks from the Conservatives to Labor in face of
opinion polls showing that the public expects Labor leader Tony
Blair to win by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's opposition Labor leader Tony Blair was accused of
"chickening out" of a live television debate with Prime Minister
John Major on Friday as broadcasters struggled to keep alive the
prospect of clash between the party leader.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Winds permitting, the 143rd Boat Race contest, with two of
the best crews in the history of the event lining up, Cambridge
has established a winning pattern after breaking the Dark Blue
mould in 1993, and they remain favorites despite a considerable
change of style and personnel at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's benefit system should be privatized according to
proposals put forward today by the Adam Smith Institute, which
argues that the state benefit system should be replaced by private
insurance packages to provide cover for unemployment, incapacity,
and long term care.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes France's Decision on UN Motion Against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman said here today that China welcomes and appreciates
France's decision that it will not participate this year in a
United Nations human rights conference motion which will be
directed against China's human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
France announced its decision Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman said that the Chinese government has always
maintained that every country should handle the human rights issue
through dialogue but not confrontation.
</P>
<P>
China supports the efforts made by the UN to safeguard and
promote human rights and is also willing to conduct dialogue on
the basis of mutual respect and equality, but opposes to
politicalize the human rights issue or make it a tool for exerting
political pressure, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's position has won extensive praise and
support from the international community, adding that certain
Western countries go against reason by making anti-China motions,
thus becoming increasingly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
Their purpose of making anti-China motions is not a "real
concern" about human rights, but is to exert pressure on China and
interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of the
human rights issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
We hope the other western countries will reconsider their
stance and refrain from making confrontation on the human rights
issue, the spokesman said.

<P>
SEOUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice-President Al Gore met
with South Korean President Kim Young-Sam here today to discuss
the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the perspectives of the
four-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Kim stressed that it is very
important for the South and the North of Korea to hold dialogues
between them and the improvement of the U.S.-DPRK relations should
keep pace with that of the Pyongyang-Seoul ties, a South Korean
senior official told reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kim also asked the United States to maintain close cooperation
with South Korea on the Korea issue, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Both Gore and Kim reconfirmed the importance of Pyongyang's
participation in the four-party talks and the importance of
building light water reactors for Pyongyang in maintaining
regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to make further efforts for the
realization of the four-party talks, but decided not to accept any
preconditions for the talks. The talks were proposed by Washington
and Seoul last April to discuss the Korean Peninsula issue among
South Korea, the DPRK, the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the U.S. did not have any plan to provide food
for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK for the first time sent representatives to a meeting
called by the U.S. and South Korea at the beginning of this month
for the four-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived in Seoul Friday on his last leg of the
three-Asian nation tour after visiting Japan and China, is
expected to leave South Korea this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Yang Yang Wins Lucky Gold in Short Track Speedskating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Yang Yang was ushered in as
a lucky winner after all her three rivals tumbled in the last bend
at the World Short Track Speedskating Championships in Nagano on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yang, from Heilongjiang, lifted her arms with big smiles upon
her face as she clocked an unchallenged winning time of 45.94
seconds in the women's 500 meters finals.
</P>
<P>
However, her compatriot Wang Chunlu, pace setter in the finals,
became the scapegoat in the mishap and was disqualified for cross
tracking.
</P>
<P>
From televion replays, Isabelle Charest of Canada, world record
holder who beat the previous mark in the heat, was caught of
clawing upon Wang with her right hand, an impetus for the falls,
which the umpires failed to catch a glimpse as their views were
blocked by the skaters.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian was then awarded the silver medal in 52.05, and
Italian Marinella Canclini took home a bronze medal in 54.37.
</P>
<P>
In the qualifying round, Charest clocked 44.86 to beat the
previous world record of 45.18 set by Yang in Beijing last
November.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 500 meters final, the lead was changed every lap
before Derrick Campbell of Canada emerged as a winner in 43.42,
beating Kim Dong-Sung of South Korea by 0.13 seconds with Japan's
Olympic hopeful Satoru Terao third in a further 0.27 seconds away.
</P>
<P>
Another Canadian Marc Gagnon, defending world overall champion,
finished last in the finals.
</P>
<P>
After the 1,500 meter and 500 meter races, Gagnon leads the
overall standings with six points, followed by Campbell with five
and Kim and Italian Orazio Fagone on three points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Yang and defending champion Chun Lee-Kyung of South
Korea lead the women's field overall with five points each, ahead
of Charest and Won Hye-Kyung of South Korea on three points.

<HEADLINE> Muster Reaches Final against Bruguera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- World number two Thomas Muster
of Austria beat hometown hero Jim Courier 6-3, 6-4 Friday to reach
the final of the ATP Lipton Championships.
</P>
<P>
Muster will face unseeded Spaniard Sergi Bruguera in Sunday's
best-of-five final. Bruguera, ranked 35th, upset world number one
Pete Sampras 5-7, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in the other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Muster, the 1995 French Open champion, has an eight-match
winning streak over the two-time Roland Carros king Bruguera. The
Spaniard has lost 11 of 14 career meetings with Muster, the most
recent in the third round of last year's US Open. Bruguera has not
beaten Muster since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Both reputable claycourt specialists, Bruguera has managed only
one hardcourt title in nine professional seasons while Muster
claimed his yet second hardcourt crown in a 12-year career last
month in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's semifinal against the home favourite, Muster won 10
of the first 11 points and Courier squandered four break point
chances in the first set. Muster broke Courier to open the second
set and saved two more break points for the victory.
</P>
<P>
It's the Austrian's third win in a row over Courier since he
snapped a seven-game losing streak to the American in this year's
Australian Open fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Muster had not reached a US final since he did so here in 1989,
only to be hit by a drunken driver's car at nightspot bayside
which almost killed off his professional career.
</P>
<P>
The current world number two said that being in the finals
eight years later is the biggest justice he could have.

<HEADLINE> China Starts To Build Third Yangtze River Bridge at Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China has started the construction
of the third bridge spanning the Yangtze River at Wuhan, capital
of Hubei Province, in an effort to ease the traffic pressure for
this booming city in Central China.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua sent a telegram of congratulations
Friday for this occasion.
</P>
<P>
The new highway bridge, located 8.6 kilometers west of the
first Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, will cost approximately 1.417
billion yuan (170 million US dollars) and take 39 months to
complete.
</P>
<P>
It will be 3,586.38 meters long and 26.5 meters wide, or with
six driving lanes, allowing 50,000 motor vehicles to cross it a
day at a designed speed of 80 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Its height of 178.5 meters above the concrete base will
minimize its effect on navigation through the "golden waterway" at
any time of drought or flood.
</P>
<P>
The first Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1957, and the
second in 1995. A third one is necessary today because the urban
area of the city has been rapidly expanding.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the third bridge, long-distance cargo
and passenger vehicles will bypass Wuhan's crowded downtown
areas. The bridge will also benefit two development areas located
on both banks of the river by linking them together.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Township Discovered in Northern India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sankisa, an oldest township in
northern India, dating back to 1000 B.C., has been discovered in
Farukkhabad district of Uttar Pradesh state by the Archaeological
Survey of India.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists and historians have so far believed that towns
in India emerged between 600 and 300 B.C., but the discovery of
the town has given another dimension to the study of the growth of
urban town-planning in the country.
</P>
<P>
Situated on ancient India's main trade route from Mathura to
eastern India, archaeologists believe that the town of Sankisa
flourished from 1000 B.C. to the end of the post Gupta period.
</P>
<P>
The Sankisa site is spread over an area of five kilometers and
archaeologists have found the remains of a mud fort structure
around the site. So far, archaeologists have dug up three trenches
in the area and the artifacts recovered from them have revealed
that the site has been inhabited since the Shung period in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The town finds reference in Buddhist literature as Sankassa.
The Pali text refers to the town as the place from where Buddha
went to heaven to preach Buddhism to his mother and later
descended in this town.

<HEADLINE> Italian GDP Growth Drops in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in Italy slumped to 0.7 percent last year after a
nearly three percent growth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The national statistics agency, Istat, today attributed the
fall-off to a 0.4 percent drop in the growth of industrial output
value, and a 0.3 percent fall in exports, which in 1995 rose 11.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite diminishing exports, the trade balance still showed a
record surplus of 77 trillion lire (about 48.1 billion
U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production rose by 2.4 percent, Istat said.
</P>
<P>
Public expenses in 1996 increased 6.3 percent, and consumer
spending was 0.7 percent up after falling 1.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Figures for employment and investment were encouraging. Job
holders last year reached 22.273 million, a 0.2 percent increase
over 1995, the first in four years.
</P>
<P>
Investments continued to rise, by 1.2 percent, compared with
the 6.9 percent jump in 1995 which was spurred by the Tremonti law
tax breaks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Authorizes Multinational Force in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council this evening authorized a multinational force to
protect relief operations and help Albania restore order.
</P>
<P>
The council voted 14-0, with China abstaining, to approve a
resolution that gives a three-month mandate to the protection
force to be led by Italy, which requested the authorization.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the present crisis in Albania constituted a threat
to regional peace, the resolution condemned all acts of violence
in the Balkan nation and called for their immediate end.
</P>
<P>
It called for member states to conduct the operation in a
neutral and impartial way to achieve the objectives, and to ensure
personal safety and freedom of movement of the multinational force.
</P>
<P>
In explaining China's position before voting, Chinese
Ambassador Qin Huasun said the current Albanian issue was internal
affairs of Albania.
</P>
<P>
It did not conform to provisions of the U.N. Charter for the
Security Council to authorize actions on strife caused by
internal affairs in a country, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, Qin said he did not "stand in the way" because of the
request of Albanian government and its desire to restore stability.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the offer by certain member states to help
facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian
assistance, and create a secure environment for the missions of
international organizations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Italy, those expressing willingness to join the
"temporary and limited multinational protection force" include
France, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Romania and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed an offer by Italy, which requested for the
authorization of the force in repeated letters Thursday and this
afternoon, to take the lead in organizing and commanding the force.
</P>
<P>
Costs of the force is to be financed by participating
countries, the council said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has asked for foreign military
assistance since massive protests prompted by collapsed savings
schemes were turned into armed unrest early this month.

<P>
DHAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) --- Repatriation of the Bangladeshi
tribal refugees from India formally began on Friday with a group
of four Buddhist monks arriving through the Ramgarh transit point,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The monks were the first group of the 278 refugees of 64
families, who were received by Chief Whip Abul Hasnat Abdullah,
head of the National Committee on Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).
</P>
<P>
Repatriation of the first batch of 6,700 tribal refugees from
Tripura state of India is scheduled to be completed by April 7,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Cheering crowds from the two neighboring countries thronged the
banks of Feni river on both sides of the border to witness the
repatriation, which began effect under a joint declaration made by
the Bangladeshi government and the refugee leaders last month.
</P>
<P>
The provisions of the agreement include security to returnees,
allocation of cash, agri and food grants, providing them with
house construction materials and giving back their own lands.
</P>
<P>
The tribal refugee problem, which was the result of a
two-decade bush war for self-rule in the CHT area, has been
handled politically since 1992. Some 5,000 refugees out of about
50,000 were repatriated in 1994.

He also stressed the need to maintain macro-economic stability
and reduce the fiscal deficit to ensure the reform process
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial issue of the Value Added Tax (VAT), which
the former government decided to implement from the coming fiscal
year starting in mid-July, Sharma said the new government will put
it in force as earlier scheduled.
</P>
<P>
It was the first official announcement on the VAT issue since
the coalition government led by Lokendra Bahadur Chand took office
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen have been pressing the new government to
abolish the VAT plan by citing that the country's tax authorities
and business circles lack of adequate preparations for the new
tax.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Refugee Boat Sinks After Collision off Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A boat carrying dozens of Albanian
refugees sunk Friday in the rough waters of the Adriatic Sea after
colliding with an Italian navy ship, killing at least four, the
Italian Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry statement said four bodies, including those
of two children, have been recovered and 34 people have been
rescued so far since the boat went down some 56 kilometers away
from Italian southern port Brindisi.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the small Albanian coastal patrol boat sank at
about 7 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) Friday after colliding with the
Italian corvette Sibilla, which was trying at the time to prevent
the vessel from entering Italian waters.
</P>
<P>
First observed at 5:15 p.m. local time (1615 GMT) off the
Albanian southern port Vlore, the sinking boat was approached by
the Italian navy ship Zeffiro.
</P>
<P>
"The (Albanian) ship ignored calls from Zeffiro to stop,
carrying out various evasive maneuvers and continuing to head for
Italy," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The corvette Sibilla then took over surveillance and slowly
approached to try to stop the boat. However, the Albanian boat
took an abrupt turn, intersecting the path of the Sibilla.
</P>
<P>
The Italian ship stopped its engines and threw in reverse, but
could not avoid the collision which caused the capsizing of the
Albanian vessel, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Italian port and police authorities said darkness and rough
seas hindered rescue efforts, while those rescued among the
estimated 45-70 people aboard the boat were sent to hospitals in
Brindisi.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 refugees have reached Italian shores on rusty
boats during the past two weeks after an armed unrest rocked the
south of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Italy has repatriated some of the refugees, on the ground that
they were illegal immigrants taking the opportunity of the tiny
Balkan nation's anarchy to flee.
</P>
<P>
With the Albanian government's agreement, Italy has also sent
warships to patrol Albanian waters in an effort to prevent refugee
boats reach its shore.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NATO/Russia: Hard Bargaining Still to Come </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Even though United States
President Bill Clinton called his 11th meeting with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin a week ago "a success," he failed in
Helsinki to convince his counterpart that NATO's eastward
expansion is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin did adopt a rather conciliatory tone at the
two-day summit, but he still insisted that the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's plan to embrace the former Warsaw Pact
members was a serious mistake."
</P>
<P>
Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels are relieved, at
least, about two things. One is that Russia has in fact dropped
its demand that the document, now under negotiation to define the
special relationship between NATO and Russia, should be a legally
binding agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the agreement would be "at the
highest political" level and signed by all 16 heads of state of
the NATO members.
</P>
<P>
This means that it will not, as Russia previously demanded,
have to be ratified by the parliaments of the 16 member states of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The second is that the two presidents agreed to have the
NATO-Russia document completed before July, when the alliance
plans to unveil its new members - almost certainly the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland - at a summit in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who is mandated with
negotiating the pact, praised these as "a major step forward in
developing a more secure and peaceful Europe."
</P>
<P>
However, the NATO chief is still aware of the fact that much
hard bargaining remains to be done when he meets Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov in mid-April for the fourth round of
negotiations to draw up the document.
</P>
<P>
As part of the bargain, Russia still wants assurance that the
accession of countries from Central and Eastern Europe will not
involve a threatening deployment.
</P>
<P>
During the three previous rounds of negotiations, the military
aspects of NATO enlargement remained unresolved. The two sides
were at odds particularly over the amount of "infrastructure,"
such as military communications, air defense and fuel pipelines
that NATO would establish in its new member's territory.
</P>
<P>
While NATO has reaffirmed several times that it has "no plan,
no intention nor need" to base nuclear weapons there, it refuses
to exclude the deployment in principle.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Build Good Ecological Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will enhance its efforts
to build an international city of good ecological environment, the
Beijing based People's Daily (overseas edition) reported today.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the Chinese capital's forest coverage will
reach 40 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, trees or grasses were planted on 671 hectares of
land in Beijing's built-up areas, while this year 520 hectares
more will be greened.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, this year Beijing plans to increase the
number of its "garden-like units" from 1477 to 1677, and the
greening plan during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000)
of the city is now well underway.

<P>
NATO also declared that it does not intend to base major
foreign fighting forces in any new member countries "in the
current and foreseeable security environment." Again there is no
renunciation of this possibility forever, as the Russians wish.
</P>
<P>
One of NATO's arguments is that it needs to ensure that the new
members are not "second-class citizens."
</P>
<P>
Making his first visit to NATO headquarters early this month,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen restated that countries
wishing to join the alliance had to make many changes and
upgradings in their military systems and equipment in order to
qualify for membership.
</P>
<P>
Russia had estimated that NATO's incorporations of Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic would increase the number of
alliance divisions from 48 to 62 and its air power by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another core element is Russia's demand, both explicit and
implicit, that NATO limits itself to a one-time enlargement and
that the former Soviet republics, especially the Baltic states not
be included.
</P>
<P>
But until now, NATO remains firm on this point: NATO will keep
its door open and the first new members will not be the last, a
stand also reaffirmed by President Clinton in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
"We could not come to an agreement on several questions, such
as the former Soviet nations not joining NATO," Yeltsin conceded
after his meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Russia wants to use the new consultation mechanism
which will be provided by the NATO-Russia agreement as a lever of
real power. The West sees it as a way of involving Moscow in
European security without giving it effective veto power over
alliance decisions.
</P>
<P>
A senior British official recently said: "It is not likely we
will want to accept any formal co-decision in matters of real
substance ... NATO will not take any steps which undermine its
ability to carry out its key obligation."
</P>
<P>
Little time remains before the Madrid Summit. Given the
differences which are so difficult to bridge, both Solana and
Primakov are facing, in the coming months, maybe the toughest task
in their diplomatic careers.

<HEADLINE> Assault Weapon Ban May Work to Reduce Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The ban on assault weapons may
be a factor in the drop in violent crimes in the United States,
says a federally funded study.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of 19 different
types of semi-automatic assault type weapons and on ammunition
magazines that hold more than 10 rounds took effect on September
13, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since then, states which had no prior prohibition on such
weapons reported 10.3 percent fewer homicides, while states that
had previously banned assault weapons saw homicides decline by
only 0.1 percent, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also found that the number of times law enforcement
agencies around the nation asked the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to trace the origins of weapons they had
seized dropped by 20 percent for assault weapons, compared to 11
percent for all guns.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted by the Urban Institute for the
Justice Department's National Institute of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The report said that not enough time had passed since the law
went into effect to conclusively judge its effect on street
violence, even though violent crime has been declining since the
law took effect.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Socialist Leader Against Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Fatos Nano, chairman of the
Albanian Socialist Party, has expressed his opposition against a
proposed military intervention from the international community in
the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
What Albania needs is political help and personnel support as
well as messages of reconciliation, rather than weapons and
troops, including even the "blue helmets" peace-keeping forces of
the United Nations, Nano said.
</P>
<P>
"Any international assistance which will help strengthen our
work, to restore the country's stabilization and to build a new
future of Albania are welcome," Nano added.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Albanian Socialist party, which has long been a
major opposition force against President Sali Berisha's
government, was amnestied from prison on March 16. Nano was
sentenced for 12 years of imprisonment in 1993 on alleged
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
An editorial in the newspaper Voice of the People, the
mouthpiece of the Socialist Party, has also pointed out that the
Albanian people have the ability to overcome the crisis by
themselves and foreign forces, either of the United Nations or of
Europe, are not needed.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the United Nations Security Council agreed to
send a multinational protection force to Albania for at least
three months to protect aid deliveries.

<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's police had detained
31 people till Friday in the central Java coastal town of
Pekalongan after recent mass riots, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The situation has returned to normal in the town after mass
riots on Monday and Wednesday, which were sparked by a music
concert organized by the ruling Golkar group, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Sugeng Suryanto, spokesman for the Diponegoro Regional
Military Command which oversees Central Java, said 60 shops were
torched or vandalized and two cars, a number of motorcycles and a
stage for a religious sermon were set on fire.
</P>
<P>
The riots erupted Monday after the organizers of the planned
Golkar gathering had taken down the flags of the United
Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Sugeng said eight rioters were hospitalized after clashing with
security officers.
</P>
<P>
Three policemen were also injured. There was no death in the
incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions among the supporters of the three political parties
which are preparing for the May 29 general election, are predicted
to heat up, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are vying for 425 seats of the House of
Representatives in the election during which more than 120 million
people are eligible to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Pekalongan was the only central Java city which Golkar lost to
the United Development Party (PPP) in the 1992 elections.

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Make Reliable Earthquake Predictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese seismologists are trying
to make more reliable earthquake predictions in order that
emergency measures can be taken to limit damage, the China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The state has defined 21 key surveillance locations across the
country to develop earthquake prediction research, the daily
quoted an official of the State Seismological Bureau (SSB) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The locations are scattered in quake-prone regions, said Zhang
Guomin, deputy director and researcher in the SSB's Earthquake
Research and Prediction Center.
</P>
<P>
They include Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan circle; the central
and south stretches of Shanxi Province; the border of Hebei, Henan
and Shandong provinces; Hohhot and Baotou in Inner Mongolia;
Jiaodong and Liaodong peninsulas; Changchun to Harbin range in
Northeast China; the eastern coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui,
Zhejiang and Fujian; Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and
Guangdong Province; the border of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
and Inner Mongolia; southeastern Gansu Province in Northwest
China; Western Sichuan Province and eastern, northwestern and
southwestern Yunnan Province in Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
These surveillance locations take up 10 percent of the
country's land area. It is estimated that 60 percent of the
earthquakes in China are likely to occur in the above regions over
the next 10 years, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 50 networks for earthquake prediction will be
stationed in these regions starting this year.
</P>
<P>
"Earthquake predictions, especially precise ones, are very
difficult, but not completely impossible," said SSB Vice-Director
He Yongnian.
</P>
<P>
He said his bureau will stick to research on long-term
predictions as well as short-term ones -- precise as to date,
place and size.
</P>
<P>
The country has gathered more than 100 earthquake-related
documents over the past 30 years. These documents provided
important references for earthquake predictions over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
SSB predicted early last year that 11 regions in China were
likely to struck by earthquakes within the year.
</P>
<P>
The prediction indicated three areas, including northwestern
Yunnan, central and western Sichuan, and southwestern Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, would have earthquakes measuring 6 to 7
on the Richter scale.

TIRANA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Ten Albanian political parties,

fully supporting the Albanian government over ethnic
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
In the five-point statement, following a two-day round-table

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Calls for Higher Quality Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese government official
has recently called on firms to adopt effective measures to
improve their products' quality and make them more competitive on
market.
</P>
<P>
Guo Xuruo, director in charge of quality under the State Trade
and Economic Commission, admitted that the problem of poor quality
still undermined China's overall economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's economy developed at a high growth rate
since the country adopted the reform and opening up policy and the
current industrial and service products can basically meet the
market needs in respect of quantity and variety.
</P>
<P>
"But the problem of quality still exists," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a State Statistics Bureau survey on 770 varieties
of major industrial products, only 78 percent of the products
reached the state-set standards, of which only 19.8 percent met
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 37 percent of the products from the township and
privately-owned firms are of substandard quality.
</P>
<P>
To change this, the state issued a plan to improve product
quality, which set a ambitious target to help 75 percent of the
major industrial products reach the international advanced
standards by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the coming few years, the country will list the quality
improvement of raw materials, basic components and parts, key
equipment, and consumer commodities as a priority.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that China's economy has entered the stage of
relying on quality in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Since the plan went into effect, more than ten industrial
sectors have set their own detailed quality standards.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Refugee Boat Capsizes in Adriatic Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A boat carrying dozens of Albanian
refugees sunk today in the rough waters of the Adriatic Sea after
colliding with an Italian navy ship.
</P>
<P>
At least four people, including two children, were killed while
30 others were rescued, the Albanian Telegraphic Agency quoted
reports by Italy's ANSA news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The vessel reportedly went down in waters near the Italian
southern port of Brindisi at about 7 p.m. local time (1800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
There was little hope that those missing in the accident would
survive as night came, said Italian police authorities, who
estimated that there were 45-70 people aboard the boat.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 refugees have reached Italian shores during
the weeks of chaos in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Italy has repatriated some of the refugees, on the ground that
they were illegal immigrants taking the opportunity of the tiny
Balkan nation's anarchy to flee.
</P>
<P>
With the Albanian government's agreement, Italy has also sent
warships to patrol Albanian waters in an effort to prevent refugee
boats reach its shore.

<HEADLINE> 16,000 Land Deeds to be Issued to Venezuelan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan's agricultural
authorities announced today that 16,000 land property deeds will
be delivered this year to rural families.
</P>
<P>
Between 70 and 80 percent of the families who live on the land
affected by the agrarian reform will obtain their property titles
at the end of President Rafael Caldera's mandate in 1999, said
today the president of the National Agrarian Institute (IAN),
Ramon Ramirez Lopez.
</P>
<P>
Currently only 25 percent of the farmers have a definitive
title or some document accrediting them as owners of the land they
work or live on, according to the Presidential Agrarian Reform
Evaluation and Follow-Up Commission created two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the property titles this year will benefit
24,000 rural families.
</P>
<P>
The IAN president noted that the agrarian institution wants to
solve an unjust situation that disrupts the nation's agrarian life.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said farmers will be able to obtain credit with their
titles of property.

<HEADLINE> China To Redouble Efforts at Farmland Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in charge of
land administration has said that the use of land should be
planned, and a strict protection system of farmland should be
established.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference here Friday, Director of the
State Bureau of Land Administration Zhou Yuchuan said that the
Communist Party of China and the State Council attach great
importance to land administration, especially the protection of
the cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be given to the country's long-term benefits,
and all construction work should be undertaken on the basis of
cultivated land protection, Zhou noted, adding that the serious
population and land problems of China demand the country take the
strictest land administration measures in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhou stressed that the state's function in land administration
should be enhanced, and land administration should be centralized.
</P>
<P>
He added that the overall control and planning of land use
should be strengthened, and the land use for urban construction
should not exceed the overall plan.
</P>
<P>
China has great potentiality in land use, Zhou noted, and that
the country will redouble efforts at the reform in land use and
administration, tapping the latent potentialities of the land use
for urban construction, and pushing the development of reserve
land resources onto a new level.
</P>
<P>
Reform must be deepened in land use system, Zhou said, adding
that the use of land for non-agricultural reasons will gradually
be charged and the use period be limited.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the country will continue to check the use of
land this year, noting that the occupation of farmland for
non-agricultural use without the approval from the State Council
or provincial government should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that illegal trade of land must be severely
punished, and his bureau will act with the supervision departments
to increase efforts in combating major cases.

<HEADLINE> Leverkusen Calls off Sergio Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bayer Leverkusen on Friday cancelled
the proposed transfer of Brazilian striker Sergio to AS Roma
following a new FIFA ruling allowing all EU-based players to
become free agents once out of contract.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Wednesday's FIFA decision, only EU nationals could
become free agents to join a club in another country for no fee
under the Jean-Marc Bosman ruling of December 1995. But the new
legislation means non-Europeans can now similarly negotiate a free
transfer within Europe.
</P>
<P>
Faced with having to let Sergio, valued at some four million
dollars, go for nothing, Leverkusen decided to activate a clause
in his contract to keep the 27-year-old for another season.
</P>
<P>
Bayer, challenging for the Bundesliga title, will now offer its
13-goal striker an improved and extended deal to keep him at the
club.

<HEADLINE> Bruguera Shocks Sampras in Lipton Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two-time French Open champion
Sergi Bruguera of Spain rallied from a one-set deficit to shock
world number one Pete Sampras 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 on Friday in the
semifinals of the Lipton Championships.
</P>
<P>
In a brutal two-hour eight-minute hardcourt match, the
35th-ranked Spaniard battled valiently in hot, humid conditions to
beat the American number one seed.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Bruguera will attempt to become the first Spaniard
to win the Lipton title in the 13-year history of the
tournament. He meets the winner of Friday night's semifinal
between second seed Thomas Muster of Austria and American Jim
Courier.
</P>
<P>
If Bruguera wins on Sunday, it will mark the first time in his
career that he has won a tournament before April, and his first
outside Europe. All 14 of his career titles came in the last nine
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera's victory, which handed Sampras his second loss of the
year in 22 matches and improved the Spaniard's career record
against the American to 3-2, marks his second final of 1997.
Earlier this month. he lost to Goran Ivanisevic on carpet at Milan
Indoor Open final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras offered Bruguera four break points in the match and the
Spaniard accepted the challenge all four times -- in the fourth
game of the first set, the second game of the second set, and the
third and seventh games of the third set.
</P>
<P>
At 1-1 in the second set tiebreaker, Bruguera won six of the
last seven points.
</P>
<P>
With Bruguera ahead 3-1 in the final set, Sampras broke even in
the sixth game with a unreturnable drop volley, but the Spaniard
immediately broke serve again in the seventh game at 30-40 with an
exquisite backhand pass.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, a two-time French Open champion in 1993 and 1994, is
known for his ability to navigate clay courts. Once ranked No. 3
in the world, Bruguera has struggled with a serious knee injury,
and more recently, torn ligaments in his right ankle in December
1995.
</P>
<P>
He ended 1996 the 81st-ranked player, but his voyage into the
Lipton final will move him back into the top 25.

MEXICO CITY, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Supermarket sales in Chile dropped 1.7 percent in
February over the same month of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Williams Drivers Top Practice Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two drivers from Williams
clocked the fastest times in practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix
in Sao Paulo on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Heinz-Harald Frentzen circled the 4.325-km track in one minute
17.506 seconds, beating teammate Jacques Villeneuve to second by a
slim margin of 0.323 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old German was a newcomer to Williams, and his win
in the practice is a justification that Williams is not to step
down from the dominance of the race.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve also enjoyed a .17 seconds lead over Jean Alesi of
Benetton in a field of 22 racing cars.
</P>
<P>
Frentzen, who replaced Damon Hill at Williams, complained of
the bumpy conditions of the track but said "the Williams is a very
good car over bumps."
</P>
<P>
Hill improved his practice performance from Australia, turning
the ninth fastest lap of 1:18.978 in his Arrows Yamaha.

SARAJEVO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A mosque in a village near the
Croat-controlled town of Livno in southwestern Bosnia was damaged
Friday morning by a rifle grenade, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Bosnian Federation official as saying that
an investigation was underway but the attack seemed to be carried
out by professionals.
</P>
<P>
This is the lastest of a number of tit-for-tat incidents of
vandalization against religious facilities in the Muslim-Croat
federation over the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Izetbegovic Calls for Implementation of Dayton Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of
the Bosnian Presidency, has warned that a new war will break out
in Bosnia if the civilian terms of the Dayton peace accords are
not implemented.
</P>
<P>
Back from a trip to Washington, Izetbegovic told the Sarajevo
press on Thursday that "I warned U.S. officials that they should
not find comfort in the fact that the Dayton agreement's military
part is fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
"It will fall part if the civilian part is not applied and they
have to bear that in mind," the Bosnian president said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the U.S. administration has affirmed its
position on the arrest of persons accused of war crimes in Bosnia,
Izetbegovic said "no one would reveal their plans today and say
what they are about to do."
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslim leaders have long complained that because of
passivity on the part of the United States, the civilian
provisions in Dayton accords, such as arresting war crime suspects
and return of refugees could not be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic also said that U.S. president Bill Clinton has
assured him that Washington will support Bosnia in its admission
to Nato's Partnership for Peace program.

<HEADLINE> US Negotiates Security Treaty with Baltics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
it is discussing a security pact with Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia to advance their integration into the trans-Atlantic
community.
</P>
<P>
"We've had...ongoing discussions with the Baltic nations on
security," said Michael McCurry, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a number of initiatives that we are pursuing with
them -- bilateral, regional," he added. "We have discussed with
them some type of joint document that would outline some of the
shared commitments that we have to sovereignty, independence and
security within the Baltics."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a U.S. security agreement with the Baltics
"would not be any substitution or compensation for the eventual
question of whether these Baltic states want to become members of
NATO."
</P>
<P>
"Membership is open to them because membership in NATO is
non-exclusionary, as we said repeatedly, " he noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed the expansion of NATO, particularly
if the expansion spreads into the former Soviet Union republics.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
failed to bridge their differences over the alliance's
enlargement.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force in Albania Considered by UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Members of the UN Security
Council exchanged views this afternoon on establishment of a
multinational protection force to facilitate delivery of
humanitarian aid goods in Albania, Council President Zbigniew
Wlosowicz said here today.
</P>
<P>
Such a force would also help create a security environment,
said Wlosowicz, permanent representative of Poland and council
president for this month.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council might adopt a draft resolution authorizing
establishment of the multinational force tonight when it is
scheduled to hold a formal meeting this evening, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Council held meetings late yesterday and this afternoon,
considering the request of Italian Ambassador Paolo Fulci.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the UN Secretary General on Thursday, Fulci
asked for Security Council's authorization of establishing a
multinational force in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation in Albania continued to deteriorate.
Stocks of food, medicine and medical supplies had been badly
depleted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, "humanitarian action cannot effectively take place
without the existence of adequate security conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
On establishing the multinational force, he said, "the
objective of the force will be to help create a safe and secure
environment for the action of the international organizations to
provide support in the areas of international assistance.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been plagued by violence when a string of popular
savings schemes collapsed in January. Rebels seized the south in
March in an armed insurrection.

<HEADLINE> US Researchers Isolating Control Gene Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. independent teams of
researchers have isolated a cellular control gene whose restraints
are flung off by rampant cancer cells in advanced forms of several
common tumors.
</P>
<P>
One team comes from the Columbia College of Physicians and
Surgeons, and the other from the M.D Anderson of Cancer Center in
Houston, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that the gene had gone awry in
brain, breast and prostate cancers and may turn up in other tumors
as well.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one researcher as describing the discovery as
"rare" that"can apply to hundreds of thousands of cases a year."
</P>
<P>
The finding is also of particular interest to biologists trying
to fit together the puzzle of cancer cell genetics.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of work, the report said, biologists have now
attained a sophisticated though still incomplete understanding of
what goes awry in cancer cells. Some cancer genes are agents whose
natural role is to convey messages from the cell's outside
environment, telling it to divide and multiply. When these genes
get damaged by mutations, they become like switches stuck in the
on position, and the cell starts to divide uncontrollably, the
hallmark of cancer. In molecular terms, the on position amounts to
adding chemicals known as phosphate groups to other entities in
the cell, the report explained.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered gene, located on human chromosome 10, is
one that removes phosphate groups, and so is a an obvious
candidate for being a cellular off-switch. And none of the 16
tumor-suppressor genes found so far have such a phosphate-removing
role, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the new gene's natural role may soon be
established, making it more interesting to biologists and
physicians.
