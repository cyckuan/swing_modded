<HEADLINE> Roundup: French FM Sees Necessity for Lebanon to Negotiate on Its Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette has stressed that Lebanon should negotiate on its own
in the peace negotiations with Israel, expressing his optimism on
a prospect of peace in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference jointly held here today with Lebanese
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz at the end of his two-day visit
here, the French minister said he saw a necessity to end conflicts
and reach a real and strong peace (in Lebanon).
</P>
<P>
He called on the Lebanese to prepare themselves with self-
confidence in facing the challenge of peace.
</P>
<P>
Political observers noted that de Charette took the opportunity
of his visit here to define the sketch of his country's attitude
and policy toward Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed during his talks with Lebanese officials and
religious leaders that Lebanon must be able to negotiate on its
own, "for no one else can decide their fate on their behalf."
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts interpreted this as an allusion to
Lebanese opposition charges that Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, was negotiating peace with Israel on Beirut's behalf.
</P>
<P>
He added that any peace settlement must restore full
sovereignty to Lebanon on all levels and over all Lebanese
territories, "which means an end to the Israeli occupation of
south Lebanon and the withdrawal of all foreign troops in
accordance with the Taif Accord," the 1989 agreement which ended
Lebanon's 15 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister also suggested that the general
elections in Lebanon later this year "must be held in complete
freedom and away from pressures and interference so that the new
parliament will be representative of all the Lebanese."
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, de Charette called on all Lebanese to
participate actively in the elections.
</P>
<P>
After expressing his optimism about the achievement of a
comprehenisve peace in the Middle East, the French minister said
his country was ready to participate in the effort to ensure
security arrangements on the Lebanese-Israeli border, "if this is
necessary and if the parties concerned asked for it."
</P>
<P>
In interpreting these remarks, a well-known columnist for
popular daily "An-Nahar" saw "a strong and ambitious drive by
France to play the role of the third co-sponsor" of the Middle
East peace process along with the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the columnist said, France "appeared to be seeking to
play the role of a principal sponsor on the Lebanese-Israeli track
as indicated by de Charette's offer to send French troops to
south Lebanon as part of the security arrangements."
</P>
<P>
De Charette announced at the press conference that French
President Jacques Chirac will visit Lebanon in April, adding that
the date of the visit has not been fixed yet.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Boueiz, on his part, noted that de
Charette has offered to participate in security arrangements in
south Lebanon in case a peace is reached between Lebanon and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined an important role played by France in Lebanon
and in the world.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Lebanon, de Charette held talks with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Boueiz, Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri,
the Mufti of Lebanon Sheikh Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, and Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallh Butros Sfeir, head of the Christian Maronite
Church on Tuesday, and met with House Speaker Nabih Berri,
President Elias Hrawi and Chairman of the Shiite Higher Council
Sheikh Mohammed Shamseddin today.
</P>
<P>
De Charette left Beirut for Damascus this afternoon to conclude
his tour in the region, which already took him to Amman, Tel Aviv
and the Palestinian self-ruled area of the Gaza strip.

<HEADLINE> Japan Extends Assistance To Zambia's Health Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan today granted some 7.7
million US dollars to Zambia to set up a new paediatricians wing
and other facilities at the Zambia University Teaching Hospital
in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed by Zambian Deputy
Minister at the National Commission for Development Planning
Danny Pule and Japanese Ambassador to Zambia Tadashi Masui.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Pule said Zambia welcomes
the timely assistance from Japan for construction of an
out-patients ward, an isolation ward and related facilities at
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, being the national referral centre, will greatly
benefit from the equipment that will be provided under the
agreement because most of the current equipment at the hospital
is in bad conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also ensure that accountability is
maintained in the implementation of the project, he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Zamiba's major donor, donated some 17 million dollars
to the southern African country in the past four months.

<HEADLINE> French FM Urges Lebanon to Negotiate on Its Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette, before leaving here earlier today, urged Lebanon to
negotiate on its own, expressing optimism on the peace in Lebanon
and stressing the necessity to end conflicts in this country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held jointly with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz, the French foreign minister called on
the Lebanese to restore their confidence in facing the challenges
of peace, underlining his country's support for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon is now the only active battlefront of
Arab-Israeli conflict. Israel established a 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer to shield its
northern Jewish settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that France is willing to "escort" the Middle
East peace process in the present stage, believing that this is a
chance for France to express its desire to participate in the
economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
He announced that French President Jacques Chirac is to visit
Lebanon and some other countries in the region in April.
</P>
<P>
Since Chirac took office as president in May 1995, France has
been determined to follow a "very active policy" in the Middle
East, the French foreign minister said, describing it as a "new
policy."
</P>
<P>
He noted that France put forward first the proposal to the
European Community to hold a Euro-Mediterranean conference in
Bacelona, Spain, and it became an initiative of the European
Community.
</P>
<P>
De Charette emphasized that there will be no lasting peace in
the region without a real peace based on the full sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"I say here that the Lebanese should create for themselves the
peace and should negotiate on their own without abandoning their
role in this field," he said,
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on U.S reaction to France's activities in
Lebanon, the French official said that France is able to fulfill
an "active participation" in the present stage and in the next
stage of the peace process "through our friendship with our Syrian
friends, and through the relations with our Lebanese friends and I
don't think any one looks at that with resentment."
</P>
<P>
"France has decided to take an active policy in the Near East
and the Middle East and the Mediterranean region, and this is a
new policy and will be stronger than that in the past years."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz stressed
an important role of France in Lebanon and in the region, saying,
"France knows Lebanon and the region more than others, and it can
play a prominent role in the peace process in the region and we
are totally confident of the role which France plays."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that France offered to send its troops to south
Lebanon to deploy on the Lebanese-Israeli border as part of the
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Lebanese side responded by saying that they
are waiting for "the approaching stages" of the peace process to
discuss the issues like this, a reference to the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks which were resumed in Maryland near Washington at the
end of last year and will be escalated to a level of military
experts next week.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that French participation in the security
arrangements could not be decided only by Lebanon and the Arabs,
Boueiz said "of course not Lebanon and not the Arabs are the only
partners of the (peace) process and I believe that France, after
obtaining a confidence and a demand from the Arabs and Lebanon,
may hold contacts with other partners in this process in order to
reach an agreement on this issue."
</P>
<P>
After holding intensified meetings with Lebanese leaders, the
French foreign minister left Beirut this afternoon for Damascus to
conclude his tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in the Lebanese capital Tuesday afternoon, de
Charette had visited Amman, Tel Aviv and the Palestinian self-rule
area the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour stay, the French official met with Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri, House Speaker Nabih Berri,
President Elias Hrawi, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and several
Christian and Moslem religious leaders.

<HEADLINE> Three Indian Ministers Resign Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Three Indian cabinet
ministers, who are facing prosecutions for their alleged
involvement in a multi-crore rupee scandal, have resigned tonight,

Affairs Minister V.C. Shukla, Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar

five-year-old Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, Shukla said
that having been associated with you since June 1991 as a member
of the cabinet I believe it would not be appropriate for me to
continue as a member of the government in the light of such
developments (CBI seeking sanction for launching proceedings
against him.

FREETOWN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- New Head of State Brigadier
Julius Maada Bio was sworn in today by Chief Justice Beecles
Davies, pledging to "do his uttermost to serve Sierra Leone" and
calling for the "support of all facets of the society".
</P>

Brigadier Bio ousted and replaced Valentine Strasser in a
bloodless coup on Tuesday. He was Strasser's deputy and armed

Bio said: "Corporal Sankoh, the message from my government is
that we are prepared to meet you anywhere, at any time and
without preconditions."

"We renew our amnesty to all RUF members and combatants and
assure you of safe conduct to facilitate participation in the
peace talks," Bio said.

He stressed that "the democratization process begun in June
1995 continues unabated and is still on track towards the holding
of presidential and general elections on February 26," which had
been announced by the deposed leader Strasser.
</P>
<P>
He said he would announce his cabinet "shortly".
</P>
<P>
Referring to members of the armed forces, the new head of
state said the army is "expected to play a role only as soldiers
concerned with the security of the state".
</P>
<P>
He also met with the diplomatic community "to reassure" the
group that the democratic process "has not been derailed".

<HEADLINE> Dutch FM Visits Orient House despite Israeli Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite protests from the
Israeli government, Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo this
afternoon visited the Orient House, known as the PLO headquarters
in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the Orient House, Mierlo held a meeting with a Palestinian
delegation headed by Faisal Husseini on bilateral issues and
developments of the Mideast peace process especially on the
Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Before he left for the meeting, Mierlo told Israel Radio that
his visit to the Orient House is a continuation of European Union
policy.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say here and repeat again that it is the standing
policy of the European Union for a long long time for a
politician to go to the Orient House," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that such visit does not mean recognition of the
Palestinian claim of sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Just after he arrived in Israel along with Dutch Prime
Minister Wim Kok on a state visit to Israel Monday, Israel
informed Mierlo that a visit to the Orient House would be a
violation of the delicate status quo of the city.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mierlo said he would go ahead with the visit
regardless of Israel's protests.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Internal Security Minister Moshe Shahal
said today that he will ask for a special debate on the issue in
the Knesset (Israel's parliament) plenum.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Encouraged To Diversify Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
announced today the government has introduced a sustainable
agricultural package to encourage all small farmers to diversify
their crops.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture Minister Mathias Mphande told reporters at
a State House press briefing that over dependence on maize crop
has made everyone believed that agriculture is synonymous with
maize despite the different climatic conditions experienced in
various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the new package, he said, the government is providing
small farmers with seeds of cotton, maize and sorghum to help
them diversify crops in line with different conditions of soil
and climate in their areas.
</P>
<P>
On the distribution of fertilizers to small farmers, he said
that by October last year, 562,000 bags of fertilizers had been
delivered to the northern part of the country while southern
Zambia had received 701,000 bags.
</P>
<P>
He predicted if rain fall is normal this season, the nation
will have a good harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is taking various measures to resuscitate its farming
sector ravaged by a successive drought in the past years.

<HEADLINE> UK Banks Call for Clear Policy on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- British banks are finding it
impossible to plan for the arrival of the new "Euro", the single
European currency, because of political indecision, according to a
senior banker.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Hawkins, chairman of a joint British Bankers'
Association and Association for Payment Clearing Services steering
committee on economic and monetary union, told a House of Lords
committee that banks were "operating in a policy vacuum".
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said that bank boards were having to take decisions on
spending without knowing what sort of preparations for a single
currency they needed to make.
</P>
<P>
He called on political and Bank of England leadership to
confront the problem, instead of leaving it to the banks.
</P>
<P>
Under the current timetable, full monetary union is due to be
achieved in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"In order to prepare ourselves for 2002, we are having to make
quite large investment decision in a scenario where it is quite
unclear whether we are going to be in or out," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that in order to make sure that London is not
disadvantaged, the banks need decisions and support from the
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Bildt, NATO Pledges Close Cooperation in Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Carl Bildt, the man charged
with rebuilding the society in war-torn Bosnia, today said he
would work closely with NATO, which is in charge of the military
side of the Paris peace accord
</P>
<P>
Bildt said there has been an "excellent atmosphere" for
cooperation between his organization, NATO authorities in Brussels
and the commanders of the peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
Javier Solana said Bildt could "count on the support, the
understanding and the cooperation" of the alliance, after Bildt,
the High Representative, met the policy-making North Atlantic
Council.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and European Union peace
envoy, denied allegations that he has been criticised by the
United States for making a slow start in Bosnia, saying he had got
"full support" from the U.S. administration and that there will be
"significant financial support" shortly from the U.S. for his work.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the High Representative of the peace
mission had complained about the U.S. blocking his access to
former United Nations facilities and Washington's reluctance to
fund his work.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the NATO officials on recent developments in his work
in Bosnia, he said "Reconciliation is the key to success in
Bosnia," and that the three warring parties have been brought
together for the first time "for limited talks."
</P>
<P>
"We are gradually moving forward," Bildt said, acknowledging
that the mammoth task facing the civilian peace process needs
willing cooperation from the Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
He also said that IFOR's success in carrying out its military
tasks to ensure a true and lasting cease-fire was the
"precondition" for carrying out the civilian aspects of the peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Leading US Index Slides to Lowest in Nearly 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, an important gauge of future economic activity in U.S.
fell 0.3 percent in November to its lowest level in almost two
years.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that it is a sign that the nation's economy may
weaken by summer.
</P>
<P>
In November the index fell to a preliminary level of 100.4, its
lowest since hitting 100.3 in December 1993. It was unchanged in
September, according to revised figures. The index has fallen in
seven of the first 11 months of 1995 and has declined 0.7 percent
since May.
</P>
<P>
The index was released today for the first time by the
Conference Board, a New York-based private research group, rather
than the Commerce Department. It followed a 0.5 percent drop in
October.
</P>
<P>
Index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months in advance.
</P>
<P>
The November reading, therefore, suggests economic weakness in
the spring and early summer.
</P>
<P>
The November report was delayed this time due to some problems
in transition and postponed release of the government's data.
</P>
<P>
The November index was based on just eight of the normal 11
components, according to the report of the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight components reported in November, four made
negative contributions to the index. Those hurting most were
prices for sensitive materials, the performance of retailers and
weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
Components helping most were stock prices, building permits and
money supply.
</P>
<P>
Those components unavailable for the November report were
manufacturers' new orders; manufacturers' unfilled orders; and
contracts and orders for facilities and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said the missing components may make
substantial revisions necessary in future reports.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have doubted the accuracy of the leading
indicator and criticized it as a poor indicator of turns in the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Splits, New Leadership Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Somali Congress
(USC) supporting faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed split and some
USC members declared their own leadership today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the newly formed USC is Hilowle Imam Omar.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman of newly formed organization, the
formation was prompted by the defection of Mohamed Qanyare Afrah,
the former USC chairman, from the organization by joining General
Aideed, another faction leader controlling southern Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"We may join the Somali National Alliance of General Aideed
or...the Somali Salvation Alliance of Ali Mahdi (Mohamed)," he
said. "They are all equal for us."
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the announcement, Ali Mahdi's faction
dismissed the newly founded organization as a non-existent
splinter group which may jeopardize the security and stability of
north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The split is the first of its kind in north Mogadishu since
the Somali civil war began in early 1991. It surfaced only one
week before factions supporting Ali Mahdi were to hold a
preparatory meeting for what they called a national
reconciliation conference.

MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a single
economic bloc made up of the former Soviet Union will be the
focus of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit to be
held here Friday, a CIS senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya said that payments

<P>
He described as "impressive" the results of the tripartite
customs union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"Many hundreds of kilometers of borders and border posts became
redundant," Korotchenya said. "Each state has saved hundreds of
millions of roubles as a result of this union."
</P>
<P>
The union will remain open and other CIS states may join it, he
added.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, CIS leaders will hold talks on military and
peacekeeping issues, including the extension of Russia's
peacekeeping mandate in Tajikistan, and discuss the situation in
Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Talks will also be held on a joint anti-terrorist operations
connected with the recent events in Chechnya and Daghestan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
further narrowed to 8.04 billion U.S. dollars in October, the
lowest level in almost a year, despite the worsened imbalance with
Japan and some other major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued today by The Commerce Department,
the overall trade deficit dropped by 2.5 percent from 8.25 billion
dollars in September as both exports and imports decreased on a
seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
The total deficit of 8.04 billion dollars marked the fourth
straight monthly improvement after hitting an all-time high of
11.4 billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The report showed the deficit with Japan jumped by 11.1 percent
to 4.79 billion dollars, its first increase in seven straight
months. The deficit with Western Europe increased more than
eightfold to 1.15 billion dollars as against an imbalance of only
125 million dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials explained that the overall
deficit figure is adjusted for normal seasonal variations while
the country-by-country figures are not. Today's report, like some
other government economic data, was delayed because of the partial
government shut-down over the budget dispute for 21 days.
</P>
<P>
The deficit worsened with both Canada and Mexico, America's
other two major trade partners. The imbalance with Canada rose to
1.91 billion dollars while the imbalance with Mexico climbed to
1.39 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Mexico worsened as imports from that country
surged to a record of 5.7 billion dollars, swamping a big gain in
U.S. exports to Mexico, which climbed to 4.3 billion dollars, the
highest level since last November right before the peso crisis
disrupted Mexico's economies severely.
</P>
<P>
The trade report showed that exports of advanced technology
products such as computers rose to a record 12.2 billion dollars
in October while exports of all capital goods, products used by
industry to expand production, climbed to a record 20.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was noticeable that U.S. exports of autos and auto parts
fell by 831 million dollars to 4.77 billion dollars while imports
of autos and parts were down an even larger 914 million dollars to
9.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. petroleum import dipped to 4.25 billion dollars in
October, down 11.1 percent from a September total of 4.78 billion
dollars, due to crude oil price fall averaging to 15.24 dollars,
the lowest level since January.
</P>
<P>
For October, the total exports of goods and services fell by
1.1 percent to 66.75 billion dollars while imports were down 1.2
percent to 74.79 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even with the October improvement in the trade deficit, the gap
in goods so far for 1995 is running at an annual rate of 165
billion dollars, placing the United States on track for its worst
trading performance in history, surpassing the record figure of a
152.1 billion dollars set in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Tries to Free Hostages From Ferry Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia has joined up with Turkey
in a bid to release 165 people held hostage on a ferry boat seized
by Chechen militants in the Black Sea, according to the Russian
foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said today: "We are in
constant contact with the Turkish side in tackling this problem
through diplomatic channels and secret services."
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service has briefed the
Turkish side about the training and weapons of the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chechen militants, headed by Muhammed Tokcan, Tuesday seized
the Avrasia ferry boat with 120 passengers and 45 crew on board
at the Turkish port of Trabzon and threatened to kill the
Russians aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign ministry sources said that the ferry boat
also carries passengers from Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after Russian government troops stormed
Pervomaiskoye, a Daghestani village bordering Chechnya, where
Chechen separatists were holding more than 100 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen militants threatened to blow up the ferry boat if
the Russian commandos continue to storm their comrades.

<HEADLINE> Communist Poised to Win Post of House Speaker in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The communists may well assume
the leadership of the lower house of the Russian parliament as
Gennady Seleznyov is poised win the election as house speaker.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, a former editor of the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda and deputy speaker in the previous State Duma, fell just
seven votes short of winning the late-night runoff Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He got 216 and 219 votes from the first two rounds of secret
ballot. He needs to secure 226 votes from the 450-seat house to
win.
</P>
<P>
Former house speaker Ivan Ryvkin, nominated by the
pro-government "Our Home is Russia" (NDR) bloc and a large number
of independent deputies, also survived the first two rounds of the
vote, but was way behind in the race, gaining 166 and 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
With 157 Duma seats held by the communists, Seleznyov stands a
good chance of getting elected in today's third round of polling,
but his victory could well rest with how members of the Yabloko
party, with 45 seats, decide to vote.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky said before the second round
that his faction would not switch backing to vote for Seleznyov
and would instead vote against both candidates. The results
showed Yavlinsky was true to his words.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin's position was weakened as the Liberal Democratic Party
(LDPR) and the "Our Home Is Russia" (NDR) bloc boycotted the
second round of voting Tuesday. Both had voted for Rybkin in the
lead-off round.
</P>
<P>
The LDPR and NDR accused the communists and the Yabloko bloc of
making a secret deal to share the Duma leadership.
</P>
<P>
LDPR Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovsky said that all the 51
deputies of his party and NDR's 55 deputies had to leave the
election hall late last night. He said, "You cannot do anything
at night."
</P>
<P>
NDR chief Sergei Belayev said that the communists were too
intent on pushing their candidate.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov refuted his claim,
describing the LDPR and NDR stayaway as an example of "an alliance
between those who ignored the logic of common sense".

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Expects Shanghai to Be International Shipping Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- International shipping in
Shanghai will help the development of the Pudong New Area and the
Yangtze River economic belt, and help turn Shanghai into an
international economic, financial, and trade center, Chinese
Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li made these remarks during an inspection tour from January
11-17 of Shanghai, and Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces, where
he explained that idea of developing and opening-up Pudong was put
forth by Deng Xiaoping and was an important decision made by the
Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core.
</P>
<P>
"Practices of the past several years indicate that the decision
is entirely correct," Li said while calling on local officials to
make an effort to turn Shanghai into an international shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
This should be done in accordance with market demands and
should be aimed at increasing economic returns using existing
facilities and technology, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Existing facilities should be made good use of, technological
improvements in port construction should be strengthened,
potential should be fullly tapped, and the economic growth pattern
should be changed, so that the greatest return can be gotten at
the smallest cost to promote China's foreign trade," the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an international shipping center in
Shanghai requires the support of all the economic, financial and
trade advantages Shanghai has, and good use of the Beilun
deep-water harbor in Ningbo City of Zhejiang, as well as the
large-scale container transportation network of Shanghai and
Jiangsu, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, the premier showed great concern over
agricultural development in these economically booming areas,
stressing the fact that agriculture's priority in the national
economy is of overall importance and should be adhered to for a
long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Economically booming areas should put emphasis on agriculture,
rural areas, and work of farmers, and on reducing the occupation
of farm lands, as well as increasing investment in agrotechnique,
increasing yields per unit, and advocating scientific farming, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, large-scale agricultural operations can be
carried out by farmers at their will so as to raise the overall
efficiency, and in some areas with good township enterprises,
agriculture can be promoted with industrial advantages.
</P>
<P>
After making an inspection tour of a steam engine factory in
Hangzhou City, Li pointed out that this year's reforms will
continue the pilot work of forming a modern enterprise system
based on breakthroughs made in enterprise reforms last year. In
doing so, the working class must be relied upon, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The premier also pointed out that China succeeded in keeping
the price index growth at about 15 percent in 1995. This year,
the primary task in macro-economic control will remain curbing
inflation. For this purpose, he urged local officials to improve
agriculture and further lower prices.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, the premier reminded local officials time and
again of building up socialist ethics, cracking down on various
types of crime, and stamping out social ills.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Toughens Stance Against Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
toughened its stance against kidnappers belonging to the Free
Papua Organization (OPM) who are still holding 14 people including
six foreigners in a village about 160 km away from the Jayawijaya
regency.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces today turned down an OPM's request for a plane
or a helicopter in return for the release of all the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 24 people on January 8 in Irian Jaya. Irian
Jaya Governor Jacob Pattipi earlier told the national news agency,
Antara, that the government will not succumb to OPM's ransom
demands.
</P>
<P>
The military and the Irian Jaya provincial administration
stressed on separate occasions Tuesday that the hostages must be
released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
However, armed forces spokesman Suwarno Adiwijoyo said today
that the military has already met some of the kidnappers' request
for food, medicines and blankets.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the OPM temporarily released a German who conveyed
OPM's demand to the Indonesian authorities. The release was agreed
on a condition that the German must return to the OPM again.
However, he did not return to the abductors' hideout "due to bad
weather."
</P>
<P>
The 14 hostages still held by the OPM were all members of a
flora and fauna expedition team.

<HEADLINE> People Worrying Less about Inflation in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll that has been
publicized today shows that inflation was no longer the hottest
topic among Chinese city dwellers last year, even though 66.1
percent of them consider inflation still a relatively serious
problem.
</P>
<P>
The percentage was 82.5 in 1994, say poll organizers from the
State Statistics Bureau and the Horizon Market Survey Company in
Beijing, who have conducted a series of similar polls since 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to 1993 and 1994's polls, inflation was at the top of
the list of major topics, but last year the social security
situation attracted much more attention.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say this was mainly because the growth rate of retail
price index dropped by 7.9 percentage points in 35 major cities
last year.
</P>
<P>
Although 70 percent of those polled held that prices will
continue to rise this year, they believe that the price hike will
not cause panic buying, which drove worried Chinese people in the
1980s to rush to buy everything they thought would become more
expensive overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese have become more patient with inflation nowadays since
about 70 percent of them confide in China's economy," said the
analysts.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of the people deem that curbing inflation is
the government's business, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll was made among 1,300 families in six major
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, three large
metropolises, central China's Wuhan, Nantong in east China, and
Baoding in the north.

KATHMANDU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
made arrangements to provide allowances for elderly people,
helpless widows and the mentally and physically disabled.
</P>

According to the Ministry for Local Development, the full
allowances for the current fiscal year would be issued by

The previous government last year decided to provide a monthly
allowance of 100 rupees (about 2 US dollars) for every Nepalese
citizen.
</P>
<P>
Directives had also been issued to local governments to call
for applications on a compulsory basis within a month with the
view to distribute similar allowances to the handicapped, helpless
widows and mentally retarded people, a spokesman of the ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also called for applications from those who are
old enough and qualified to receive pension in the current fiscal
year beginning last July.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs Less Financial Aid from Donor Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
ask the Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI) to provide 20.1
billion US dollar financial aid for 651 development projects in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The figure is less than the 22.5 billion dollar aid for the 686
projects proposed in 1995, according to a release from the
National Development Planning Board received here today.
</P>
<P>
The assistance from the CGI donor members are listed in the
government's Blue Book. Beginning this year, the Blue Book on
project proposals will be issued in January, six months before
CGI's annual meeting in Paris in July.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia wants to give CGI members more time to study the
project proposals which they will support.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank-chaired CGI committee was set up in 1992 to
replace the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia, a donor group
coordinated by the Dutch government.
</P>
<P>
This year's Blue Book describes the priorities of Indonesia's
development projects. The first priority this year is the
transportation, meteorology and geophysics sector, the second
priority is the mining and energy sector, while the third priority
is the housing sector.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Propose Ban on Tobacco Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong intends to
introduce legislative proposals to ban all direct tobacco
advertising in the printed media.
</P>
<P>
Clement Cheung, Principal Assistant Secretary for Health and
Welfare, said here today that display advertisements and indirect
advertising through the use of non-tobacco products and services
are also within the proposed prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
A recent local research indicates a strong connection between
smoking and perceived attractiveness of tobacco advertisements,
especially among the young people.
</P>
<P>
It was the government's obligation to guard against the
negative effect in the interests of the public health, said the
official, who at the same time stressed that, the proposals will
strike a balance between the need to safeguard public health and
freedom of commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 30 countries have already put into place
restrictive controls on tobacco advertising, including Norway,
Finland, New Zealand, Australia and France.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region has
called for a tobacco-advertising free region by the year of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Fights Against International Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus, in cooperation with
foreign countries, has made headway in the battle against
international drug traffickers, said a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
Sotiris Charalambous, head of the Cyprus police anti-drugs
squad, was quoted today by the local press as saying that Cyprus
police had, with the help of foreign experts, managed to curb "an
alarming upsurge" in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"Drug trafficking through Cyprus is decreasing steadily," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Charalambous was speaking at a two-day conference on the
contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) to the security of small states, which ended
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officer said Cyprus' geographical position, its
telecommunications and transport links, as well as its quality of
life had attracted many foreign criminals, especially drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
"It is from here that they made their sales, their shipments
and their payments," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that to fight back, the police established close
co-operation with several foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen countries of Europe, the former Soviet Union,
Australia and the U.S. have sent liaison officers here to join
the fight against drugs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that daily contacts, weekly meetings and joint
decisions have brought very encouraging results.
</P>
<P>
The officer referred to drug trafficking through the
Turkish-occupied northern areas of Cyprus, saying that large
quantities of drugs are being filtered through these areas to the
government-controlled part of Cyprus as well as to overseas
destinations.
</P>
<P>
He urged those European countries who do not have a liaison
officer to appoint one as soon as possible to join the team on
the island in a bid to achieve better results.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Overpopulation Is Main Obstacle to Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said here today that overpopulation is the main obstacle to the
implementation of Egypt's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Overpopulation is also one of the main reasons for the
country's unemployment problem, Mubarak said during his meeting
with members of the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee of
the ruling National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been one of the major social problems of
Egypt, which has a population of nearly 60 million. According to
recent official statistics, the unemployment rate is 7
percent. But Western economists put it at 17-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif
quoted Mubarak as saying that the government had taken slow paces
in the economic reform, which was launched in 1991 with the
backing of the World Bank, for fear that it might worsen the
social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mubarak named Kamal el-Ganzouri as the
prime minister to form a new cabinet, which promised to work
toward increasing production and creating more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reiterated today that the main aim of the government is
to raise the people's living standards by improving economy,
el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was quoted by the information minister as saying that
Egypt is prepared to offer all facilities to foreign investments,
which would create jobs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has pledged to remove bureaucracy and red tape, which
have discouraged investments.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Calls for Pluralism in Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today called for pluralism in future parliament,
inviting all groups with different persuasions to take part in
March 8th parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that people would have different tastes. We
must not be worried that different ways of thinking would be
represented in the parliament," said Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told a high-ranking group of officials from the
Interior Ministry that even the apathetic people would take part
in the elections if they saw the government observed fairness and
respected freedom in the elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of government to ensure fairness and
freedom in the elections in order to encourage even those who are
sitting on the sidelines," Rafsanjani was quoted by the state-run
Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
"The elections are an acid test for different groups, helping
them find out the extent of their popular support," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate president recently criticized Interior
Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati for appointing new officials in
his ministry who were said to have had close ties with the
influential right-wing Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC).
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry runs the elections in Iran. SCC has a
majority in the present parliament and is said to be planning to
have the same majority in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the ministry officials today, Rafsanjani
warned that anyone found of violating elections rules would have
to face punishment, regardless of his rank.
</P>
<P>
"Elections are a socio-political principle of the system. There
has to be severe punishments for the violators in whatever rank or
position they might be," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had
already stated the same points.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that Rafsanjani favors the participation of
certain opposition groups such as Iran's Freedom Movement in the
elections.

<HEADLINE> Aideed's Forces Capture Strategic Town In Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Forces of factional leader
General Mohamed Farah Aideed last night invaded and captured the
strategic town of Huddur in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
At least 18 people were killed and more than 47 others wounded
during the attack. More than 30 "technicals" were involved in the
occupation, said sources close to General Aideed.
</P>
<P>
Huddur, about 150 kilometers west of Baidoa, has been the
stronghold of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) since the
invasion of Baidoa by General Aideed last September.
</P>
<P>
The defeated RRA are reported to have fled to the neighboring
Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the RRA in north Mogadishu characterized the
invasion as a terrorist act to which General Aideed has become
habituated during the last years.
</P>
<P>
General Aideed's men sustained heavy lossed during the night
long battle, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Huddur, with an estimated population of more than 100,000, is
said to be accommodating less than 30 percent of its inhabitants
after the fighting. Hundreds of families ran out of their houses
to surrounding forests with no food or water.
</P>
<P>
Politicians in Mogadishu have attributed recent fightings in
southern Somalia to the expansionism of Aideed's
self-claimed government. They viewed Aideed's government as a
hindrance to a lasting solution to the Somali civil strife.
</P>
<P>
Aideed controls southern Mogadishu while another factional
leader, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, rules over the northern part of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a national government since late
President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown by rebels in early
1991. The rebels soon turned the guns on each other in their
fighting for spheres of influence which laid waste to Somalia.

Experts say it is rare for a human vegetable to recover from a
200-day coma and regain normal human functions, and such cases of
brain injury result in death, 95 percent of the time, according to
the local Liberation Daily.
</P>
<P>
The patient, whose surname was Zhou, received a head injury in
a serious traffic accident in May. First aid treatment saved his
life, but left him comatose for 200 days. Afterwards, he was
declared by doctors to be a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
The man's relatives sent him to a hospital affiliated with the
Baoshan Iron and Steel Company in Shanghai, where doctors
performed a comprehensive series of treatments that included
physiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
In July, the patient's condition became stable and he recovered
from the coma. By mid-September, he showed some feeling in his
limbs.
</P>
<P>
On November 16, he amazingly started to talk to his wife. At
present, Zhou can say simple words, read characters in newspapers,
and recognize his relatives and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
In early July, a 29-year-old man regained consciousness after a
four-and-a-half year coma in Zhanjiang City in south China's
Guangdong Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, east China, held
its first Huangmei Opera competition for amateur performers
recently, in an attempt to revitalize the art form and attract
larger audiences both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Anhui is the home of Huangmei Opera, but, except for full-time
performers, there have been few people putting much effort into
studying the form. The situation has been changing over the past
two years, however, and many amateur performers are emerging and
spending their spare time singing.
</P>
<P>
Most are retirees or people who work in enterprises. They often
gather at teahouses, and learn from each other or exchange views
and have become an active part of activities held in Anhui.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuan, an amateur performer of the opera, has collected
photos, tapes, and video tapes of Huangmei Opera, and often holds
competitions in his home.
</P>
<P>
A group of retired amateur performers are active in training
child performers and say they hope the children will carry the
traditional art form on.
</P>
<P>
Huangmei Opera is one of the five most popular local operas in
China. The four others are Beijing Opera, Shaoxing Opera,
Guangdong Opera, and Pingju (a local form of north and northeast
China).

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Output Up 16.2 Pc in  November 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output grew by 16.2 percent in November 1995, boosted by a strong
36.7 percent growth in the electronics industry, the Economic
Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the figures, the EDB said that the cumulative
growth for the first 11 months of 1995 was 10.5 percent higher
than the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the electronics sector, output of major
electronic products continued to increase, especially personal
computers, disk drives and other computer peripherals,
semiconductors, and printed circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
Output of fabricated metal products increased in tandem with
the strong growth in the electronics industry, the EDB said,
adding that both the year-on-year and year-to-date growth achieved
were about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, both the machinery and plastics industry recorded
the same growth rate of 9 percent compared with that a year ago.
In the machinery industry, output of oil rigs, automation
equipment and semiconductor equipment increased further, producing
a cumulative growth of 11.8 percent, while the cumulative growth
for the plastics industry was 10 percent, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry increased its output by 1.2 percent in
November. However, the industry's cumulative output in the first
11 months contracted by 2 percent due to maintenance shutdowns in
some months, it said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Urges Iraqis Be Patient with U.N. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today urged his people to be patient with the more than five-year
embargo clamped on Iraq by the United Nations following its 1990
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 5th anniversary of the Gulf war which drove Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait after a seven-month occupation, President
Saddam said in a nationwide address that the stringent U.N. trade
sanctions did not change the loyalty of the Iraqi people to their
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The difficult years for the 20 million Iraqis suffering under
the sanctions "will be over sooner or later," he said in a speech
aired on state tv and broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
He said that last October's presidential referendum showed that
those groups hostile to Iraq were only hallucinating and they
have met failure in their bids.
</P>
<P>
The president also criticized some Arab countries which he did
not specify for their stance against Iraq, saying they are still
maintaining the same stances they had taken in the early days of the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
He accused these Arab leaders of only following the orders of
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Marking this occasion, church bells tolled for five minutes
early today as tens of thousands of Iraqis, holding placards and
portraits of Saddam, took to the main streets in the capital to
denounce the attack which led to Kuwait's liberation six weeks
later.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Plastics Industry Faces Challenges (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai plastics industry will
face a fierce competition this year due to a government tariff cut
schedule. Thai manufacturers have to act quickly to meet looming
challenges from other Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Under a commitment to the World Trade Organization and regional
trade liberalization, the Thai government slashed its tariffs on
imports of plastic products from 60 percent to 45 percent on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
The government also has pledged to further lower the tariffs to
30 percent in 1997, to 20 percent in 1998, and a mere 0.5 percent
in 2003 under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
The measures would plunge Thai manufacturers into a situation
to cope with the expected influx of foreign products, particularly
from other ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries.
</P>
<P>
Some ASEAN nations, like Indonesia and Malaysia, enjoy cheaper
locally-available raw materials and they might be potential
rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Thai plastics industry, which emerged about 50 years ago,
now has grown into a leading export-oriented industry in the
country with some 3,000 factories in operation.
</P>
<P>
But, nearly 90 percent of the factories are small ones,
including some 1,600 mainly producing finished goods like plastic
bags, sacks and containers.
</P>
<P>
Since Thailand began to export its plastic products 25 years
ago, the business grew rapidly, reaching about 35 billion baht
(1.4 billion US dollars) in 1995. But it suffered a 29.2 percent
drop in 1994 owing to rising prices of plastic pellets, the
industry's principal raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Besides the raw materials, Thailand's plastics industry is also
short of qualified personnel and research and development
facilities to improve production technologies, especially those
for disposing and recycling plastic wastes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's plastics industry highly depends on
imported machinery and equipment, particularly dies and molds.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weaknesses, local analysts are optimistic about the
prospects of the Thai plastics industry.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Bangkok Bank say Thailand's plastics
industry, with sophisticated equipment and skilled workers, is
more developed than those of other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Thai plastic products have been successful in expanding
traditional markets, including Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, the
United States and Britain, they note.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's leading items for exports, such as plastic sheets,
film, foils, tapes and bands, and plastic bags and sacks, are
penetrating into new markets in Eastern Europe and Indochina, they
say.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that the prospect for the Thai plastics industry
will remain bright as the country is enjoying a fast economic
growth and an increasing purchase power of the public.

<HEADLINE> Singapore External Trade Grows 13 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade increased 13.2 percent in 1995 from a year earlier to a new
record high of 344 billion Singapore dollars (about 242.25 billion
US dollars at current exchange rate), the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that the 1995 figure was 40 billion Singapore
dollars (about 28.17 billion US dollars) more than the 304 billion
Singapore dollars attained in 1994, with the growth led by non-oil
trade.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports registered a 14 percent increase last
year, with the expansion arising from buoyant global demand for
electronics components, computers and related products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, non-oil re-exports rose 17 percent, reflecting the
accelerated economic development of regional economies, it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the United States, the European Union, Malaysia,
Japan and Hong Kong remained as Singapore's top five major trading
partners. In terms of non-oil domestic exports, Japan, the United
States, and the EU are among the strongest growth markets while
Hong Kong and Malaysia registered slower growth rates, the TDB
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the outlook for Singapore's trade in 1996 remains
positive, while growth in total trade is expected to moderate to 9
to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is consistent with the International Monetary Fund's
(IMF) and the OECD's (Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development) assessment of world trade for 1996, which is expected
to grow at a slower rate of 7.1 percent, compared to 8.6 percent
in 1995," the TDB said.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Calls for Parliament Support on Chechen Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) - Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Wednesday called on the State Duma to support the
government's policy on rebel Chechnya for a quick end to the
conflict there.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's
parliament, Chernomyrdin stressed the importance of a unified
policy by federal power bodies against the Chechen separatist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister appealed to the new Duma, whose members are
due to discuss the Chechen issue today, for closer cooperation
with the government.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary "to continue disarming illegal armed
units" in Chechnya to seek a solution to the crisis within the
republic.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing on the government's efforts to solve the conflict
between the rebels and the Russian government, he said the
government was concentrating on restoring legislative bodies and
administrative institutions in the republic, normalizing civil
life, rebuilding the economy, and seeking negotiations with all
major political forces for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the letter Chernomyrdin strongly condemned the "terrorist
activities" of the armed forces led by Chechen separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev in Kizlyar and Pervomaiskoye.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Chechen gunmen stormed the southern town of
Kizlyar in the Daghstan Republic and seized about 3,000 hostages
on January 9, triggering the second hostage crisis in seven months
by Chechen rebels. They were stopped the following day at
Pervomaiskoye, close to the border, in their way back home to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The situation intensified as Russian security forces entered
the third day of battle with the terrorists to rescue the
remaining 100 or so hostages. The Russian government has vowed to
punish the "bandits" but promised not to risk the lives of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
But the conflict appears to be spreading as Chechen rebels
seized a Russia-bound ship with some 200 people on board in
Turkey's Black Sea port of Trabzon.

<HEADLINE> Albania Appeals For More Wheat to Tide Over Bread Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania is appealing to Europe
and the United States for wheat to head off a "bread crisis" in
the country after a 42 percent shortfall in supply last year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 150,000 tons have been promised by foreign countries
at "protected prices", but the Albanians are still negotiating for
another 150,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The country produced 400,000 tons of wheat last year, falling
300,000 tons short of its annual consumption.
</P>
<P>
The shortage caused some bakers to close down and triggered
panic buying in some parts of the country, especially in Tirana,
Shkoder and Gjirokaster.
</P>
<P>
To try and restore order to the market, the Albanian government
has started building up national reserves of wheat, according to
Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, and appealed to major wheat
producers for supplies to tide it over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to cut the prices for
bread-baking water, electricity and fuel, exempt wheat imports
from customs duties and set fixed market prices for plain bread.

Tunisia between March 9 and 17.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Tanzania Amateur Boxing Association

TABA needs 6.3 million to send four boxers and one coach to

</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a month for Tanzania to pull out of
a major continental boxing Tourney.
</P>
<P>
TABA opted not to send a team to the Hosni Mubarak Tournament
held last December in Egypt because most of the boxers selected
to make the trip were not released from duty by their respective
employers. The tournament has been regarded as a

compensates tourists who have problems because of bad service, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the municipality has gotten a great deal of
experience in hotel management from countries such as Japan,
France and Singapore, that has helped bring the level of its
management to a new high, the official explained.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Stresses Engagement with Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia's engagement with
Asia is not just commercial and must go beyond that, Prime
Minister Paul Keating said here today, warning that if Australia
does not succeed in Asia, it will not succeed anywhere.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at this year's Singapore Lecture on "Australia, Asia
and the New Regionalism," Keating said that Australia is committed
to regional groupings and fora such as ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations), APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation), the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the Five Power Defense
Arrangements.
</P>
<P>
These regional approaches to cooperation and resolving problems
would become increasingly important, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the less dominant role of the great powers in
shaping the international system, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said regional institutions have their advantages and APEC
offers a new model for that kind of arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The Australian prime minister, who arrived here this morning
from Malaysia on a one-day visit, also cautioned that the region
must not become complacent with success as there are challenges
ahead such as environmental protection and shortage of skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
Keating met with his Singaporean counterpart Goh Chok Tong
earlier today. The two prime ministers issued a joint declaration
on "A New Partnership" between the two countries. Keating left
here for home this evening.

ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today denied the
reports that "Pakistani mercenaries" were helping Chechen rebels
who held hostages in the Russian Republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani Foreign Office Spokesman said, "there is no

"Our Embassy in Moscow has contradicted all such speculations,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan wishes a peaceful and political
settlement to the Chechen crisis.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Calls for Parliament Support on Chechen Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) - Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Wednesday called on the State Duma to support the
government's policy on rebel Chechnya for a quick end to the
conflict there.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's
parliament, Chernomyrdin stressed the importance of a unified
policy by federal power bodies against the Chechen separatist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister appealed to the new Duma, whose members are
due to discuss the Chechen issue today, for closer cooperation
with the government.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary "to continue disarming illegal armed
units" in Chechnya to seek a solution to the crisis within the
republic.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing on the government's efforts to solve the conflict
between the rebels and the Russian government, he said the
government was concentrating on restoring legislative bodies and
administrative institutions in the republic, normalizing civil
life, rebuilding the economy, and seeking negotiations with all
major political forces for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the letter Chernomyrdin strongly condemned the "terrorist
activities" of the armed forces led by Chechen separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev in Kizlyar and Pervomaiskoye.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Chechen gunmen stormed the southern town of
Kizlyar in the Daghstan Republic and seized about 3,000 hostages
on January 9, triggering the second hostage crisis in seven months
by Chechen rebels. They were stopped the following day at
Pervomaiskoye, close to the border, in their way back home to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The situation intensified as Russian security forces entered
the third day of battle with the terrorists to rescue the
remaining 100 or so hostages. The Russian government has vowed to
punish the "bandits" but promised not to risk the lives of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
But the conflict appears to be spreading as Chechen rebels
seized a Russia-bound ship with some 200 people on board in
Turkey's Black Sea port of Trabzon.

<HEADLINE> Childless Aged Villagers in in Henan living Secured Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Some childless old villagers
of Xin'an County, in central China's Henan Province, are now
living happily thanks to the care of a kind, well-to-do villager
at his senior citizens' home.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhixiang, 50, the head of Miaotou Village, in charge of
family planning work, has spent a total of 80,000 yuan (about
9,638 US dollars) in supporting 10 old childless folks since he
opened a home specially for them in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"I'm regretful to see these childless villagers left untended,"
Han said. "And I want to set a good example for some younger
villagers who are unwilling to support their own aged parents."
</P>
<P>
Deng Tianmu, a 61-year-old bachelor and demobilized soldier
with one eye losing sight in the War to Resist US Aggression and
Aid Korea in the early 1950s, substituted on a government
allowance about 50 yuan per month.
</P>
<P>
Deng was the first to moved into and live in Han's home for the
old folks.
</P>
<P>
"I would have lived a miserable life had I not moved to Han's
home," said the old man who shares one large clean room with four
others.
</P>
<P>
Han provides them meals with eggs daily and treats them to
fruits all year round, apart from paying their medical expenses,
and "he treats us like a son to his own father," said one of the
old folks he looked after.
</P>
<P>
Last year when an old man contracted cerebral embolism, Han
paid several thousand yuan for his treatment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Han have paid for funeral services for four senior
citizens he took care of over recent years.
</P>
<P>
"All this could not be done without the support of my family,"
said Han, whose wife often gets up at 6 a.m. to prepare their
breakfasts every day.
</P>
<P>
At the time when he set up the old folks' home four years ago,
his newly-wed daughter-in-law donated six quilts from her dowry.
</P>
<P>
As for his future plan, Han plans to extend his brick kilns and
build a larger old folks' home with some entertainment facilities
so that all the childless aged at his home can enjoy their life
all the more.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Speeds into Third Round at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- World No.2 and second-seeded
Andre Agassi of the United States shrugged off the shadow of his
first-round trouble to beat his fellow American Vincent Spadea
6-4, 6-2, 6-3 at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi used one hour and 50 minutes to roll over Spadea, who is
regarded as one of the most promising young players in the world.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, still having painful expressions on his face sometimes
during the match, has regained much of his speed on the court
after hurting his right knee last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The swelling knee put him into a three-and-half-hour struggle
with 132-ranked Argentine Gaston Etlis in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Agassi forced many errors on Spadea tonight. He broke Spadea's
service in the fourth game of the third set and held his own in
the following game. He wrapped up the match with a deep backhand
groundstroke that went to the open court on Spadea's side.
</P>
<P>
His next rival will be South African qualifier David Nainkin.
</P>
<P>
In the third day of the Grand Slam event, third-seeded Thomas
Muster of Austria also made the way to the third round in a
four-set clash with Javier Frana of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Michael Chang, 8th seed Jim Courier and 11th seed
Richard Krajicek entered the third round with ease.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no major upset for top seeds in the
tournament. The only exceptions today are 9th seed South African
Wayne Ferreira and 14th seed Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev, who were
toppled by Karol Kucera of Slovakia and Patrick Fredriksson of
Sweden respectively.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Social Sciences to CPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party official has
said that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has always attached
great importance to the social sciences in building
socialism.
</P>
<P>
Academic achievements in the social sciences and the quality of
research have a direct impact on the prosperity of the Chinese
nation, Li Tieying, member of the Poliburo of the CPC Central
Committee, said in explaining the importance of the social
sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li addressed the annual meeting of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, saying that researchers' work will provide both a
theoretical support and an ideological backing for the physical
and ethical development of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Ideas and viewpoints put forward by researchers influence
people in their thoughts and morals, just as they do reforms and
the opening up process, and economic development and social
stability, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that over the past dozen years the Party has not only
upheld Marxism but also greatly enriched and developed it. The
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as set
forth by Deng Xiaoping is the latest development of Marxism, which
raised some questions that have not previously been discussed by
people.
</P>
<P>
"In this process, social science researchers have made
historical contributions," Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The academy's annual meeting, from January 15 to 17, drew up a
five-year development plan for this major social sciences center,
according to which the academy will be built into a center of
Marxism and be both assistant and advisor to the Party Central
Committee and the State Council.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
planning to slash overseas aid by a further 130 million pounds
(about 200 million U.S. dollars) and restrict the number of
beneficiaries to the world's 20 poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
Britain intends to pull out of Latin America, the Caribbean,
the Pacific and southeast Asia in the biggest overseas aid cut
since the Second World War, it is reported today.
</P>
<P>
It will focus its diminishing funds on sub-Saharan Africa and
the Indian sub-continent in the financial year 1996-1997.
Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa is also being cut by 18
percent this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A government report stressed that Britain could no longer
afford to spread its foreign aid so thinly around the globe and
would instead seek distribution through international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain is preparing to phase out its 25 million
pounds (38 million U.S. dollars) overseas scholarship program.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi Meets with Albanian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said that the
NPC attaches importance to ties with the Albanian parliament and
will continue making efforts to further exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came during a meeting with visiting Albanian
President Sali Berisha at the Great Hall of the People here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Qiao described Berisha's visit to China as a "historic event",
because it has been the first by an Albanian head of state in over
30 years, and added that he believes it will promote the healthy
development of Sino-Albanian relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the last few years have seen the development of
friendly and cooperative relations in various fields and growing
exchanges between China and Albania.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that, "China values its ties with Albania, and is
willing to expand friendly exchanges and cooperation in political,
economic, cultural and other important fields, on the basis of
mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefits."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that parliamentary exchanges are a major part of
bilateral ties. "Such exchanges between China and Albania have
also developed in recent year," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the visit by Chairman of the Presidency of Albania's
People's Assembly Pjeter Arbnori to China and that by Vice
Chairman of China's NPC Standing Committee Buhe to Albania were
completely successful, Qiao said, adding that such visits deepen
understanding and enhance friendship.
</P>
<P>
President Berisha said that he was happy to meet with Qiao and
expressed thanks for the hospitality given him by the Chinese
government. "I am sure my visit will further promote our
relations," he said , adding that China has made great
achievements in its reforms and opening up and that Albania can
draw on the experience from China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people used to give
great support and assistance to Albania, and went on to say, "Now
we still have a lot to do in developing bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
China's progress is clear proof that it will develop better and
faster, and will make contributions to regional and international
stability, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Qiao briefed Berisha on China's economic construction, and said
that he is happy about Albania's stable situation and its
improving economy, and wished it every success in its efforts to
develop the economy and raise people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for its endeavors at maintaining
peace, stability, and development in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
President Berisha is scheduled to leave here today for Shanghai
to continue his four-day China tour.

<HEADLINE> Business Performance in North England Poorer Than 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence among
companies in the northeast of England plunged last year as sales,
orders, investment and profits fell.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the northeast and Cumbria failed to match their
1994 performance on almost every main indicator, a quarterly
business survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Training expenditure was the only main indicator that showed a
rise in 1995, with more companies reporting an increase in
spending than those reporting a decrease.
</P>
<P>
Business confidence suffered the biggest drop, with the number
of businesses reporting an increase in confidence down from its
1994 average of plus 27 to plus 10 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year balance in export sales was down from plus 38
to plus 28.
</P>
<P>
The four quarterly reports by Business Survey North showed that
the 1995's average quarterly balances for sales and orders, plant
and buildings investment, profits, employment and forecast
turnover were all below 1994 levels.
</P>
<P>
The surveys are conducted by the Economic Research Services, in
association with the North East Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The latest fourth quarter survey was based on responses from
681 companies.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle Astronauts Take Second Spacewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Two astronauts ventured into
the freezing cold of outer space, 73 degrees Celsius below zero,
to test the protective quality of new spacesuits in icy
temperature.
</P>
<P>
The spacewalk from the U.S. space shuttle Endeavor in the
small hours of today took place in temperature nearly 14 degrees
lower than two days ago when another spacewalk was carried out,
according to the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Starting in late 1997, astronauts will take hundreds of hours
of spacewalks each year to construct an international space
station. They will need thermal gear to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Leroy Chiao, second time outside Endeavor on the sixth day of
the nine-day mission, and Winston Scott were testing modified
spacesuits including heated gloves and boots to help determine how
well the modified suits will protect astronauts in deep cold.
</P>
<P>
Chiao teamed up with Daniel Barry in performing Monday's
spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
While the spacecraft was flying 320 kilometers above the earth
at 28,000 kilometers an hour, one of the astronauts stayed, for a
while, in the shadow of the 100-ton shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Chiao and Scott were also scheduled to test new tools and
equipment designed for use during the five-year construction of the
space station.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, the six-member crew on Endeavor has
retrieved a 10-month-old Japanese research satellite, and released
and then retrieved 48 hours later an American satellite.
</P>
<P>
Endeavor was scheduled to land back at the Kennedy Space
Center in Cape Canaveral on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the malfunction of a critical cooling system of the shuttle
due to ice buildup may cut short the mission by a day.

<HEADLINE> Suifenhe, Town Without Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Travellers to Suifenhe, a town
bordering Russia in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, could
be surprised to find that there are few bicycle-riders in the
streets nor are bicycles sold at local department stores.
</P>
<P>
This is quite rare in a country known as a "bicycle Kingdom".
</P>
<P>
Located on undulating hills, the town has hardly any smooth
roads, which makes walking or riding bicycles rather difficult.
</P>
<P>
A five-minute walk else where often takes about half an hour
here.
</P>
<P>
Instead, local residents tend to take a bus or a taxi, a
green-colored Beijing jeep that can be found in every corner of
the local streets.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the flourishing cross-border trade has brought
more and more Russian business people to this small city along
with tens of thousands of Chinese from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The profitable taxi industry has brought the total number of
taxis to over 1,000, according to the local tourist department.
</P>
<P>
A local driver who bought a second-hand Beijing Jeep three
years ago has earned some 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visitors to the town can also find that road signs
and information billboards in local hotels are all bilingual and
that local business people bargain with their Russian counterparts
in Russian fluently.
</P>
<P>
Bicycles are the major means of transport for residents of the
world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
However, in some hilly cities such as Qingdao in east China's
Shandong Province and Chongqing in the southwest province of
Sichuan, local residents are discouraged at riding bicycles and
they would choose buses or taxies instead.

<HEADLINE> New Channel Opened On Mouth of Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A new channel has been opened
on the southern part of the mouth of the Yangtze River, China's
longest river, and ships have since last month taken different
courses according to their different sizes and draughts.
</P>
<P>
The channel serves as the passage to the sea for the Shanghai
port and the Yangtze River valley. With close to 1,000 ships
going through it each day, the channel is a "golden course" for
China's water transport related economy.
</P>
<P>
However, since medium-sized and small ships, which account for
80 percent of the ships going through the channel, run on the
deep-water lanes, in addition to the frequent changes of water
depth in the area, navigation safety has been imperiled and
economic development in Shanghai and the whole Yangtze River valley
hindered.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration has
harnessed the channel by clearing it of sunken ships, adjusting
course trends and re-establishing navigation signs.
</P>
<P>
After the new channel opened to traffic on December 27, it has
been divided into three lanes accommodating ships with draughts
above 8.5 m, below 8.5 m and above four m, and below four m
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the move will greatly improve traffic
safety at the mouth of the Yangtze River, help produce remarkable
economic and social benefits, thus contributing to economic
development in Shanghai and surrounding areas.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic law in general
allows up to four wives for any man, but an Iranian man has 12
wives, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iran, an official newspaper, said that Mohammad Reza Nikdel,
50, also has 20 children with their mothers living in 12 rooms of
his large house in the northeastern city of Bojnourd.
</P>
<P>
Nikdel married his first wife 20 years ago and the 12th wife
this year. He claims that there have never been any fights among
his 12 women.
</P>
<P>
However, he has financial headaches.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that I have 12 women and 20 children, my overhead
is very high. For example, I have to buy 120 loaves of bread
everyday," Nikdel said.
</P>
<P>
Nikdel, who owns a clothing shop and earns between 17 to 27
dollars a day and says the financial burden is breaking his
neck.
</P>
<P>
The Islam law observed in Iran allows men to have unlimited
temporary wives on condition that he is financially capable of
supporting them.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian kings in the past were said to have as
many as 250 temporary wives in their harems.

GUANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Life has become increasingly
colorful for rural residents in the economically booming Pearl
River Delta in south China's Guangdong Province, as a result of
its flourishing recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
Modern cinemas, theaters, dance halls, swimming pools and
gymnasiums, which used to be entertainment places for urban
dwellers, have sprang up across the region, with a large portion
built up by local township-run enterprises and communities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are some 10,000 such cultural
establishments in the whole region, entertaining millions of the
local residents.
</P>
<P>
Rongqi, a town in Shunde City with a total area of 7.7 sq m,

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: Credibility Perfect for Forthcoming Elections (by Feng Zheru) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has said that preparations
for the long-projected Palestinian elections are well underway and
the credibility of the elections is perfect.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Shetaih, Secretary General of the Palestinian Central
Election Committee, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua
and representatives of other Chinese mass media here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming Palestinian election is the most important
even in the history of the Palestinian people," Shetaih said. "It
is the main guarantee for the survival of any people, and the
first step in the long journey which the Palestinian people want
to take."
</P>
<P>
"The electorate in the Palestinian self-rule areas totals
1,053,000, distributed over 16 constituencies, including five in
Gaza Strip and 11 in the West Bank," he explained.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 675 candidates running for the
Palestinian Legislative Assembly, including 25 women, he said.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are vying for 88 seats in the Palestinian
National Council, a self-rule body that will have both legislative
and executive powers.
</P>
<P>
In a separate race for the presidency of the council, PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to defeat his only challenger
Samiha Khalil, a female social activist.
</P>
<P>
Shetaih pointed out that about 20 parties and organizations
will participate in the forthcoming elections, apart from 11
independents from the Islamic Resistance Movement or Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Shetaih said that there would be a big problem concerning the
elections in Jerusalem where voting is required through post
office boxes, whose capacity would enable only 5,000 voters to
cast their votes, but there are 50,000 eligible voters there.
</P>
<P>
Shetaih expressed the hope that international observers would
watch Israeli actions on the election day, which falls on January
20. He called on Israel not to create obstacles to the
Palestinian election campaign.

LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Following attacks by armed
bandits, over 100 civilians around Robertsport in northwest
Liberia have been evacuated by the naval ships of the west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The violence in Robertsport started three days ago and is
getting worse, the Liberian state radio said, quoted by a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate indication that ECOMOG units are
involved in any fighting in Robertsport, about 10 kilometers from
Tubmanburg, where there were armed clashes earlier between an
armed faction, ULIMO-J, and ECOMOG seriously threatening the
latest peace accord signed in Abuja last August by all Liberian
parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, a six-member Council of State, the
collective presidency, has been established and general elections
are due in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the most important and difficult part of the peace
plan is to disarm about 60,000 fighters of the country's all
armed factions, which just recorded a little progress so far.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Over one million residents in
this largest metropolis of China have been involved in stamps
collection, according to an official of a local philately
association.
</P>
<P>
The 230,000-member Shanghai Philately Association, which was
founded in 1981, is the first of its kind in China, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, it has conducted co-operation and
exchanges with its counterparts in many countries and regions in
the world, such as Japan, the United States, the Czech Republic as
well as Hong Kong and Taiwan, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Many of its members have won prizes on international and
national exhibitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stamp-colleting in Shanghai can be traced back to the 1920s
when China's first philately body was set up there.
</P>
<P>
Collection of articles has increasingly become a popular
pastime in China, with a larger number of people collecting an
ever widening range of articles. in Beijing alone, there are an
estimated 500,000 amateur and professional collectors.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Condemns France For Visa Denial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria yesterday condemned
France for its refusal to grant visas to the Nigerian delegation
billed to attend the funeral of late French Preident Francois
Mitterrand last week.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Nigerian Foreign Ministry in Abuja
said the government believed the action was calculated not only
to humiliate the Nigerian government and people, but also the
Head of State Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the French government had sent an
official invitation to the Nigerian government, communicated in
protocol 67 of January 8, 1996 of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Head of State, it went on to say, acted within
his prerogative on the basis of this protocol when he nominated
his foreign minister to represent him at the funeral ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government viewed the French refusal to grant
visas to the Nigerian delegation as an unfriendly act which could
have serious implications for the warm and cordial relations.

<HEADLINE> School Teacher Becomes "King of Newspaper Collection" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Yu Haiquan, a 66-year-old
retired teacher, has never imagined he could become the "King of
Newspaper Collection" in north China, though he has collected
newspapers all his life and felt he really enjoys it.
</P>
<P>
As a retired middle school teacher in Changchun, capital of
Jilin Province in northeast China, Yu is regarded as the "King of
Newspaper Collection" in north China for his huge collection of
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, he has collected over 15,000 kinds of
newspapers, including 1,500 trial issues and first issues, ranking
the sixth among thousands of newspaper collectors in China.
</P>
<P>
In his collections, there are some rare items, including 700
issues of the Liberation Daily published in Yan'an in late 1930s
and the 46 issues of the People's Daily published before it became
the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yu began to collect newspaper clips and stamps when he was
quite young. But he had to give it up during the Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976) when his collections were burnt down.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he re-started from scratch and devoted most of his
time and money to the hobby.
</P>
<P>
In spite of his small salary, he managed to subscribe dozens of
local newspapers so that he could exchange with newspaper
collectors in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Many local newspapers sent their first issues to Yu and mailed
him the following issues regularly free of charge. His collection
of newspapers has increased rapidly due to the support from his
family and the society.
</P>
<P>
Yu enjoys helping other collectors, especially middle school
students. "Newspaper collecting is a cultural pastime," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Many articles he wrote about collection has been published on
major national newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
He keeps regular contacts with more than 300 fans nationwide,
many of whom have become his friends, though he has never met
them before.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 when Yu suffered from a back injury, he received
greetings by phone calls, telegrams and even money from his
friends all over China.
</P>
<P>
"I have learned a lot from the hobby, but most important of
all, I've experienced the true love in the world," Yu said in his
room which is filled with newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Market Policies Boost Mineral Exports In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Trade liberalization in
Tanzania has boosted exports of gold and gemstones, with
artisanal and small scale miners exporting between four and five
tons annually over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gray Mwakalukwa, acting Assistant Commissioner of Minerals
in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, said here on Tuesday that
mineral exports during the post-Arusha Declaration period fell
drastically due to inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
He told more than 50 geologists participating in a two-day
workshop at the University of Dar es Salaam that as a result of
nationalization after the Arusha Declaration in 1967, following
which the State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) was running most
mines, the sector's contribution fell below 10 percent of
national income.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of trade liberalization marked a change in
the sector. About four to five tonnes of gold and gemstones are
being exported annually since 1990," he said, not mentioning
average amounts of mineral exports during the post-Arusha
Declaration period.
</P>
<P>
Before the Declaration, the contribution of the mining sector
to the national economy reached 10 percent of national income,
while the recent increase was due to encouragement given to
private sector participation in the sector, Mwakalukwa said.
</P>
<P>
The government had shifted from being an investor and operator
of the mines to a regulator and promoter, he observed, noting
that the role of the private sector diminished after the
Declaration, while liberalization had stimulated investors back
into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and local mining companies were now encouraged to
invest in the industry, companies such as Gaphtan, Samax, Pangea,
to mention a few, were now in various stages of exploration, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with the World Bank, the government was
implementing policy to promote the activities of small scale
miners, he added.
</P>
<P>
The acting assistant commissioner said the new policy should
be streamlined in order to boost exports further. Mineral
production was still being carried out under capacity, he said,
asserting that the peak in mineral production realized during the
pre-Arusha Declaration period "has not yet been attained".

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Remains Quiet After Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- All remain quiet in the west
African state of Sierra Leone where a palace coup toppled former
Head of State Captain Valentine Strasser on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A state radio announcement promised a nationwide address by
the new leader Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, former deputy to
Strasser. This, however, did not take place and no reason has so
far been given.
</P>
<P>
The radio also said that a cabinet reshuffle would take place
but there has been no word on this so far.
</P>
<P>
Former Head of State Strasser was given ''safe conduct'' out
of the country by noon yesterday and diplomatic reports said he
is in neighboring Guinea. It is not known whether he will later
proceed to another country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Strasser now joins former President Joseph Momoh who he
toppled in a bloodless coup in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Banks and markets are functioning normally but many business
houses remain closed.
</P>
<P>
There were also sporadic firing during the night and military
officials mounted heavily armed patrol to effect the 7:00 pm to
6:00 am curfew which is now in force.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Lt. Colonel Karefa Kargbo in a radio
broadcast accused Strasser of ''blatant attempt to force the
(military) government to make certain changes that would have
ushered him as president after the February 26 elections.'' he
did not say what these were but gave an undertaking that ''the
February 26 elections will not be derailed.''
</P>
<P>
He also said the new government ''will seek dialogue with the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF)'' which has been fighting a
rebel war since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers have been warned to keep off the streets ''except
that they are specially assigned or they will be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
Civilians have also been warned not to violate the curfew
hours. The rest of the country remains relatively quiet and so
far there has not been any report of unrest.
</P>
<P>
In Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city, troops were put on
alert and Nigerian troops stationed at the internal airport
mounted air artilleries.
</P>
<P>
The drama of the coup began unfolding about mid-day yesterday
after Strasser's returning from a military commissioning ceremony
of new lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
State House sources said the background of the coup erupted
from ''an attempt by Strasser to sign a new decree which would
have lowered the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40
years to 32.'' Strasser is 32.
</P>
<P>
The coup itself took the entire residents of the capital by
surprise and one western diplomat described it as ''spontaneous
as we had no prior knowledge.''

<HEADLINE> South Korean Airline to Buy 150 Planes by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Korean Air (KAL), one of the two
airlines in South Korea, will spend 13.9 billion U.S. dollars
purchasing 150 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft by 2005, a
KAL spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KAL will retire 54 of its used aircraft over the
next decade, as part of a plan to maintain a fleet size of 200 by
2005. Such a plan will double the number of KAL's aircraft from
the 1996 fleet size of 105.
</P>
<P>
During this year, KAL plans to use 974.7 million U.S. dollars
for the purchase of eight aircraft, including four B747-400s and
three MD-83s.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that by the time KAL completes its purchase
and retirement plan over the next decade, the average age of its
aircraft will go down to six years, which will be half the world's
projected average of 12 years. KAL's fleet is aged 8.5 years on
the average at present.

Shen said: "The illegal entry by Bradley David Gerdes and Kenji
Maetani into Chinese restricted military zones on two occasions in
quick succession and their illegally obtaining of Chinese military
intelligence are clear in facts." He added that "the irrefutable
evidence shows that their actions were deliberate and
premeditated."
</P>
<P>

Republic of China on the Control of Entry and Exit of Aliens, as
well as the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations pertaining to diplomatic privileges and immunities,
namely, that all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities
should respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have seriously encroached upon China's sovereignty and
compromised the national security of China," Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that on January 13, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of China "summoned the officers in charge of the U.S. Embassy and
the Japanese Embassy respectively and expressed strong displeasure
and lodged protests with the U.S. government and the Japanese
government, demanding that Bradley David Gerdes and Kenji Maetani
be called back by their governments before January 19."

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Urged to Call back Diplomat Entering China's Restricted Military Zone (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China has demanded that the
U.S. and Japanese governments call back the diplomat who
illegally entering China's restricted military zones and illegally
obtaining intelligence, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Shen Guofang, made statement when he was asked
to confirm a report which said that the Chinese government had
made representations with the governments of the United States and
Japan on the incident involving Assistant Air Attache Bradley
David Gerdes of the U.S. Embassy and Defence Attache Kenji Maetani
of the Japanese Embassy who had illegally obtained China's
military intelligence and demanded that they call the two persons
back.
</P>
<P>
Bradley David Gerdes and Kenji Maetani "were stopped by the
relevant authorities of China on the afternoon of January 8, 1996
when found entering into restricted military zones in China's
Hainan Province, photographing and videotaping there. They
accepted the confiscation of their films and video tapes by the
Chinese side and signed a written confession about their
activities," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"However," the spokesman went on, "the two men, Bradley David
Gerdes and Kenji Maetani, showing no repentance, again sneaked
into a military airport near Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province on
the morning of January 11 to once again gather military
intelligence and were caught on the spot and interrogated by the
competent Chinese authorities. Bradley David Gerdes and Kenji
Maetani confessed their guilt in illegally entering into the
Chinese restricted military zones, admitted in writing their
wrongdoings and pledged not to repeat such activities in the
future."

<HEADLINE> China Has World's Third-Largest Telephone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China has a total telephone
exchange capacity of 85.1 million lines for local and rural
subscribers and its office telephone exchange lines have reached
71 million.
</P>
<P>
This has made the country's telephone network the world's
third-largest, after the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, minister of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT),
said here today that nearly 60 million office exchange lines have
been added in the past five years, 22.9 million of them being
added in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the last five years have witnessed the fastest-growing
period in the country's posts and telecommunications, with an
annual increase rate of 48 percent in business turnover. Toll
circuits and office telephone exchanges -- the most important
indicators of a country's telecommunications capacity -- have
jumped by 50.4 percent and 42.7 percent, respectively, in the last
five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the same period China invested 241.4 billion yuan in fixed
assets in this sector, which helped build 22 optic-fiber lines,
covering all the provincial and regional capitals, except Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago China had less than 1,000 km of optic-fiber
lines, but now 100,000 km of large-capacity and high-quality
trunks have been built.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, China's analog mobile telephone
network covers the majority of cities above county level, and the
country realized nationwide roaming last week. China plans to
build another 23 optic-fiber trunk lines within the next five
years, pushing the total length of such lines to 200,000 km.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 China's total telephone capacity is expected
to hit 170 million lines, among which office telephone exchange
lines will rise to 150 million. China's telephone penetration rate
is expected to go up to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 China plans to realize a total business turnover in
this sector of 130 billion yuan, a growth of 34 percent. The MPT
plans to pour in 90 billion yuan in fixed assets investment. Some
40,000 km of long-distance trunk lines will be built and 17
million office telephone exchange lines will be added, with the
telephone penetration rate hitting 5.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Police Detain Suspect for Organizing Terrorist Training in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese police, in a recent
campaign against terrorism targeting the national security, has
detained a suspect for organizing a terrorist training program in
Sudan, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abdu Al-Hkani Al-Kajk was arrested Monday morning and
an interrogation is to be conducted today by a Beirut judicial
prosecutor, local daily As-Safir said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kajk was arrested after several Lebanese detainees confessed
that they had obtained from Al-Kajk financial aid to go to Sudan
for military training in a desert camp.
</P>
<P>
The paper listed that the beneficiaries of Al-Kajk's
assistance as Ibrahim Shatila, Ibrahim Mahyou, Ali Al-Arab,
Khalid Saab, Abdu Al-Qadir Al-Taiyar and Jamal Mahyou, who
admitted that they had been trained in military combat skills and
intelligence by some Sudanese in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
They had also traveled to Khartoum to receiving training by
the Sudanese in a desert area on how to use various weapons, the
detainees confessed.
</P>
<P>
They said they had been residing in Sudan in a villa possessed
by Mohammed Al-Kajk who ensured their travel there.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that a security meeting was held recently in the
Beirut Presidential Palace, in which Judicial Prosecutor Abdallah
Al-Bitar was decided to be responsible for clarifing Sudan's ties
with the terrorist training in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Al-Bitar was demanded to hand in a report to the
Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Sudan had denied earlier a link with a series of terrorist
activities against religious figures, entertainment centers and
shops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It also lodged a complaint with the Foreign Ministry,
protesting against what it called a "press campaign" launched by
some Lebanese newspapers following the assassination of pro-Syrian
Sunni cleric Nizar Halabi, but the protest was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Halabi was shot dead by several masked men in front of his
residence in a Sunni neighborhood in Central Beirut last August.

<P>
The Australian dollar surprisingly went down against the US
dollar, despite that the greenback reached a 22-month high against
the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The local currency slid to 74.34 US cents from 74.48 US cents
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local investors were surprised by the downward movement of the
Australian dollar. They had expected it to be stronger against the
US dollar which is climbing up against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Investors were waiting for the imports figure for December last
year to come out tomorrow. There is speculation that the imports
may grow further after a four percent rise in November.
</P>
<P>
Any significant growth in imports will frighten the market and
cause the Australian dollar to fall, local dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 78.97 yen against the Japanese
yen from 78.72 yen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was also higher against the German mark, ending at 1.0908

<HEADLINE> China Handles 8,600 Unfair Competition Cases in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China handled more than 8,600
cases involving unfair competition and 5,100 concerning
infringement of consumers' rights and interests last year,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The cases included counterfeit trademarks, packaging and
decoration of famous products, intentional acts to curb
competition by public utility enterprises, theft of commercial
secrets and unhealthy pyramid selling.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium held here today Gan Guoping, deputy director of
the National Administration for Industry and Commerce, attributed
the success to the implementation of the Anti-Unfair Competition
Law and the Law on the Protection of Consumers' Rights and
Interests two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gan said that, besides the two laws, his administration
simultaneously worked out four special regulations to strengthen
market management, and a series of local rules had been issued to
help carry out the laws.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Gan said, nearly one million industrial and
commercial supervisors were mobilized last year for checks on
markets. They also checked supplies of agricultural-use products,
the beverage market in the summer, and trademarks and
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The checks, covering 2.38 million enterprises, discovered fake
and shoddy products valued at a total of 6.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industrial and commercial administrations at
different levels handled more than 50,000 relevant cases last
year.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
that Sino-Canadian relations are developing smoothly, with
frequent exchange of high-level visit and closer political
consultation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a meeting with Andre Desmarais, president
of Power Corporation of Canada, here yesterday. The Premier also
voiced his admiration to the long-term effort made by the
Desmarais family to promoting Sino-Canadian friendly ties of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled his visit to Canada last October, saying that the
visit had enhanced the mutual understanding and trust as well as
an all-round relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada have their own advantages and characteristics
and the two economies are strongly complimentary, though the two
countries do not belong to the same development level, Li noted,
adding that the Chinese government is willing to support and
promote the collaboration between the enterprises of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Desmarais conveyed Li greetings from Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien. He said that his firm had witnessed the great
changes in China and felt that China's policies are correct.
</P>
<P>
Canadian enterprises are sincere and enthusiastic in the
cooperation with their Chinese counterparts, Desmarais told Li,

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Production To Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee production is
to increase by at least 11 percent in the coffee year ending
october, 1996, the local newspaper "the Monitor" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Managing Director of the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority Tress Bucyanayandi was quoted by the paper as saying
that last year the country had produced 2.7 million 60-kg bags
(162,000 tons) of coffee, but this year the industry was
projecting for three million bags (180,000 tons).
</P>
<P>
He added, "Considering that coffee is a perennial crop, I
think an increase of 300,000 bags is a remarkable improvement."
</P>
<P>
He said that the prices for farmers were better than they had
ever been in Uganda's history.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this situation mainly to the liberalization
policy, saying that "everybody who has coffee now is selling it
because of the competition".
</P>
<P>
The policy removes coffee export monopoly from the coffee
marketing board Ltd. and today over 82 companies in the country
have licensed to export coffee.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is Africa's second largest coffee producer only after
Cote d'Ivoire. Coffee remains the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner, bringing in more than 60 percent of the total
income from exports while the figure is 95 percent in 1988 when
the current government started to diversify the economy as part
of abroad economic reform package.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's total coffee yield declined from 174,00 tons in 1989
to 168,000 tons in 1990 and 92,340 tons in 1992 due to the price
fall caused by the breakdown of the quota system on coffee in
July 1989 when Brazil, the world major coffee producer, clashed
with central American countries on the quota.

<HEADLINE> Indian Politicians Charged with Taking Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) Tuesday filed charges against seven
politicians and sought the president's permission to prosecute
three sitting ministers in a multi-crore rupee scandal, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The politicians named in the unprecedented action by the CBI
included President of the largest opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party L.K. Advani, All Indian Indira Congress Working President
Arjun Singh, and former deputy prime minister Devi Lal.
</P>
<P>
The three cabinet ministers mentioned are Parliamentary Affairs
Minister V.C. Shukla, Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar and Human
Resource Development Minister Madhavrao Scindia.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor-General Dipankar Gupta, who is representing the CBI
before the supreme court, made this disclosure Tuesday evening
during a hearing by a three-judge bench on the five-year-old
Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Advani later announced his resignation from the Lok Sabha
(lower house of parliament), saying that he will not contest the
forthcoming general elections till the supreme court clears him.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the other politicians or ministers involved have
denied the charges, describing them as groundless.
</P>
<P>
The latest development is being viewed as significant, as it
comes at a time when the general elections are round the corner
and major opposition parties are preparing to make corruption a
big election issue.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the 65-crore rupee Hawala scandal revealed
in 1991 that some politicians allegedly received kickbacks for
awarding lucrative contracts in the power sector to foreign
companies from a Hawala trader, S.K. Jain.
</P>
<P>
Hawala trade is a system of bypassing the official foreign
exchange channel in India. Dollars can be purchased at a lower
rate than the official one through Hawala.

WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
today urged India not to deploy its new medium-range missile,
warning that such a move would create new tensions in one of the
most dangerous areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We think that deployment of this medium range missile would go
in the wrong direction and create new tensions, rather than to
reduce tensions in what is arguably one of the most dangerous,
least-stable areas of the world right now," Department spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said at a news briefing.

<HEADLINE> IWS Praises 66 Chinese Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-six big stores in 18
Chinese cities have been awarded plaques bearing the inscription
"Goods bearing the Woolmark in this store are genuine" by the
International Wool Secretariat (IWS), the issuer of the
internationally acclaimed Woolmark.
</P>
<P>
The move shows that products bearing fake Woolmarks have been
effectively eliminated in China.
</P>
<P>
Created in 1964, the Woolmark entered the Chinese market in the
mid-1980s. But, like in the case of other famous-brand goods,
fakes soon appeared.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect consumers' rights and interests, the IWS
launched a series of campaigns to crack down on fake Woolmarks, an
endeavor which was firmly supported by the State Bureau of
Technological Supervision and the State Administration of Industry
and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The IWS made inspections of stores in large cities and
commercial areas such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, and
sponsored lectures on the Woolmark in 12 cities across China,
informing the public that the Woolmark is a trademark protected by
the Trademark Law, and only new and pure wool products meeting
certain quality standards can be granted the mark.
</P>
<P>
The 66 stores awarded the plaques are business leaders in their
respective cities.

HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's export trade
promotion organization, Zimtrade, has become one of the few
international trade bodies to be granted the International
Standards Organization 9001 (ISO 9001) standardization status.
</P>
<P>
Zimtrade Chief Executive Morrison Sifelani yesterday said the
organization has already received the ISO certificate.
</P>
<P>
The ISO 9000 series, which is structured as three basic
standards -- ISO 9001, 9002 and 9003 -- are the internationally
accepted series of standards of quality assurance and management.
</P>
<P>
The standards are necessary for trade, specially export trade,
because they assure product quality, said Sifelani.
</P>
<P>
The standards, which promote national production in terms of
quality, quantity and reliability and are used as a marketing
tool, have been adopted by 80 countries worldwide, 12 of which
are in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Manmohan Singh said that he expected the current shortage of
liquidity in the country's economy to end in three months, the
Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The general perception that credit is tight is not entirely
correct, Singh said while addressing an international conference
on India's trade and investment in Mumbai, Bombay, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that interest rates would come down shortly to
stimulate the country's growth, now around six percent.
</P>
<P>
Singh said that he expected inflation, which fell to less than
seven percent year-on-year last month, to fall further to five
percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the convertibility of the Indian rupee, the
minister said that the financial system should move in such a
manner to ensure no risk of inflation before such a step is taken.

<HEADLINE> Rural Families Become Smaller in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- After Tang Yu's wife gave
birth to a girl last year, the couple decided not to have a second
child. Instead, they raised money to run a forage plant, earning
200,000 yuan (about 24,093 US dollars) in the same year.
</P>
<P>
More rural couples like the Tangs in Hunan Province in central
China have started to prefer smaller families in a bid to shift
their focus to business. And they would like to pay more attention
to raising and educating their children.
</P>
<P>
"On weekends, farmers living in the suburbs of this provincial
capital often take their kids to the local children's palace to
learn Chinese calligraphy, dancing and painting, which used to be
a privilege for urban children," a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Even in the province's remote mountainous areas, kindergartens
have been built where pre-school children play games and learn to
read and write just like their counterparts in cities.
</P>
<P>
Qu Xianwu, who runs several factories in Huanglong New Village,
in Changsha county, got married at 32. Soon after, he took his
wife to the town several times a week to learn eugenics, the study
of ways of breeding stronger and cleverer children.
</P>
<P>
Their time and efforts paid off.
</P>
<P>
"Now my son is a top student in his class," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by those who have benefitted from having only one
and healthy child, farmers across the country began to realize
that the one-child policy is not only beneficial to the society,
but also to individuals.
</P>
<P>
And such traditional ideas that more sons mean greater wealth
and more help for one's old age, have been gradually discarded by
them, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a secure life for people in old age, the social
security system has been gradually improved in the province. An
increasing number of local farmers have had access to pension
insurance, and homes for the elderly have been built in most of
the local villages.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the population of Qu's village has sustained a
negative growth over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Family Planning Commission (SFPC)
show that over the past five years or more, China has built a
total floor space of 426 million sq m of training centers and
service agencies for family planning in rural areas, providing
technical know-how about family planning and medical services for
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
However, Peng Peiyun, a state councillor and minister in charge
of the State Family Planning Commission, said there is still a
long way to go to implement the one-child policy properly in rural
areas, where over 70 million farmers are living in poverty, most
of whom stick to the traditional idea of having as many children
as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director-General of
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Jacques Diouf has said
the world food summit scheduled for Rome, Italy in November
this year was an important summit.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he called on yesterday Zimbabwean
Vice-President Simon Muzenda, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said that the summit would be held for the first time in
50 years, to deal with the problem of food security in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa had the biggest problem because
agricultural production per capita had fallen. The summit would
try and find ways and means to deal with the problem of food
security in Africa, faced by 44 out of 52 African countries, and
intensifying production, improving technology to make agriculture
justifiable in financial terms.
</P>
<P>
There was a need to diversify agriculture, through vegetable
production, poultry and aquiculture. He said that 15 percent of
the overall fish supply came from aquiculture and it was expected
to rise to 30 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The summit would also be expected to find ways of controlling
water, which he said some 4,000 billion cubic meters went to sea
each year yet many countries had a problem of water.

<HEADLINE> Social Sciences Sector to Continue Importing Foreign Theories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The prestigious Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences (CASS) announced here today that it will
continue to import foreign theories.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the academy said that CASS will carry out
international exchanges and co-operation more actively, and create
more channels for conducting key research projects.
</P>
<P>
The academy has set 178 key programs for the coming five years,
and will train 200 top-rated scholars who can lead the
international trend.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman revealed at CASS's annual meeting that the
academy will send 250 to 270 researchers to study abroad before
the year 2000 and link its computer network with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"CASS's researchers should pay more attention to international
politics and economics at the turn of the century by launching
investigations into the international strategies, foreign policies
and policies toward China of certain countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can the scholars put forward proposals to the
government and help create a sound international environment for
China's modernization drive, he explained, in addition to the
improvement of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
The academy, which has a long history of academic freedom, will
always encourage the free discussion of foreign theories of
politics, economics and philosophy in academic terms, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed Tuesday night when their vehicle came under fire south of
Jerusalem, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at about 8:30 p.m. (18:30 GMT) on the main
road from Hebron to Jerusalem. It was not immediately clear
whether the attackers fired on the car from ambush or from a
passing car.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicated that at least one of the two got
out of the car and fired at the attackers.
</P>
<P>
A caller identifying himself as a member of the Mujahedin
al-Islam, a previously unknown organization, told Army Radio that
the attack was carried out in revenge for the assassination two
weeks ago of Yihye Ayyash, a Hamas bomb-maker known as "The
Engineer."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army is responsible for the security on the road
where the attack took place, while the nearby villages are under
joint Palestinian-Israeli control, with overall security in the
region in the hands of the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The army declared the region as a closed military zone, and
prevented Israelis from entering.

<HEADLINE> French Company to Expand China market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 17 (xinhua) -- The French Alcatel-Alsthom
Group has announced that it will further its presence in China
with the focus on high-tech areas while sustaining its current
leading position in technical transfer to Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
According to Serge Tchuruk, chairman and chief executive
officer of the group, the Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Co.,
one of China's largest foreign-funded enterprises and jointly
formed by China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and
Alcatel, has become China's top digital switchboard supplier. Its
production increased from 400,000 lines in the early 1990s to 4.5
million lines in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company has installed more than 30 million digital lines
throughout China since its establishment. Slated to become
operational next March, the new production facilities of Shanghai
Bell in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai will be "capable of
producing Alcatel's new generation of digital switches at the
world's advanced level," said Tchuruk.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alcatel is also active in China's fast-expanding
mobile telecom market. Following a project to expand the global
system for mobile telecommunication (GSM) network for Jiaxing City
in Zhejiang Province, the telecom giant has already signed deals
to set up GSM networks in Shanghai, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, and Jilin and Jiangsu provinces, with capacities ranging
from 40,000 to 160,000 sets a year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other companies affiliated with the group are
wooing projects in such domains as power plant equipment and
railway electrification for China's Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
These companies have provided equipment for the Daya Bay
Nuclear Power Plant and other hydropower projects.
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year Alcatel-Alsthom achieved sales
totalling 36 billion US dollars-worth worldwide, while its sales
in China topped two million US dollars-worth. enditem

<HEADLINE> GCC, Iran to Collect Ship Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, JANUARY 17 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) and Iran are expected to gather today in
Oman to discuss the issue of protecting their waters.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, senior officials from Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Oman are meeting in Muscat to discuss on setting up
centers to dispose dumped sludge and other waste by passing
tankers.
</P>
<P>
Gulf waters have been polluted because of continuous waste-
dumping by oil tankers and other merchant vessels plying the
region. Every year, nearly 30,000 vessels enter the Hormuz Strait
to ferry crude oil and other goods.
</P>
<P>
The increasing pollution was also partly blamed on leakage
from crude export terminals and pipelines as well as ships attacked
during the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of the 1980-1988
military conflicts between and Iran and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
stressed here Tuesday that the implementation of China's principle
of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" in the region after July 1, 1997, will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
It can be fully believed that Hong Kong's future will be
brighter, he said while meeting with a delegation from the Better
Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation is composed of well-known industrialists
including Li Ka-Shing and Tsang Hin Chi, who are advisors on Hong
Kong affairs and members of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
said that after China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, China will implement the
above-mentioned principle, which will certainly be a long-term
policy and is incorporated into the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that after its return to the motherland Hong Kong's
policies, regulations and laws that have proved to be effective in
practice, as well as its advantages and characteristics, will be
retained and even enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's position as the largest financial, trade, shipping
and information centers in the region will not be changed, he
said, adding that Hong Kong residents therefore have every reason
to be confident about their own future and to make Hong Kong more
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the economic ties between Hong Kong and the
mainland are so close as to make the two inseparable. To a great
extent, Hong Kong has received benefits from the mainland's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
So, he said, "our confidence in Hong Kong's future also comes
from the mainland's economic development. We take a very
optimistic attitude toward our country's economic development."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that since it started its reform and opening to the
outside world, especially since 1992, China has made great
achievements after conducting macro-structural reform and adopting
measures to strengthen macro-control over its economy. That can
not be denied by anyone, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has been gradually developing in a rapid,
sustained and healthy way, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which lasted one and a half hours, Zhu
expressed his complete support for the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Your organization is aimed at boosting Hong Kong
residents' confidence in their future, so as to promote Hong
Kong's smooth transition, and maintain its prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"This is also our goal. We should make concerted efforts to
this end," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Stages Dawn-to-Dusk Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition staged a
dawn-to-dusk nationwide strike today as part of their current
campaign to press their demand for the resignation of the prime
minister and the establishment of a neutral caretaker government
to supervise the upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The strike coincided with the last date for filing nomination
papers for the national elections, scheduled for February 15 by
the Election Commission, but has been rejected by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (People's)
League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami --
last night resolved to continue their earlier announced plan for a
siege to election offices across the country to resist what they
call "farcical" elections.
</P>
<P>
Last night the opposition canceled a scheduled meeting with the
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in spite of the efforts
by some Western envoys led by US Ambassador to Dhaka David N.
Merrill to bring the two sides to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The opposition would not accept anything less than a caretaker
government, said Sheikh Hasina, president of the largest
opposition party -- the Awami League.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated the opposition's demand for the resignation of
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and a written proposal from the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Solves Water Shortages in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Since the 1980s the Chinese
government has spent one billion yuan helping 24.2 million rural
residents in northwest China solve water shortages and drink clean
water.
</P>
<P>
The residents live in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi
Provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to local water conservancy departments, government
efforts have also solved the problem of drinking water shortages
for 26.24 million large domestic animals such as horses, donkeys
and cattle. Endemic diseases which used to plague the area have
been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China, where the Pamirs, Loess Highlands,
Qinghai-Tibet and Mongolia plateaus lie, is an arid and semi-arid
area, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Half of the local population used to suffer from drinking water
shortages and many others had to drink water containing harmful
elements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s the central and local governments have launched
a campaign to help local residents solve drinking water shortages
and improve the drinking water quality by drilling wells,
diverting water from rivers and storing rain water.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 700,000 water supply and 32,000 water quality
improvment projects have been completed in water-deficient Gansu
Province,
</P>
<P>
As a result, the drinking water quality has been improved for
583,800 people living in the fluorine poisoning area in Gansu,
said a local official.
</P>
<P>
Three water quality improvement projects completed in Weinan
Prefecture, Shaanxi, has benefited 1.1 million people over an area
of 2,400 sq km.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in the mountainous southern part of Ningxia
spent some 10 million yuan in 1995 drilling 36,000 wells in the
area, enabling hundreds of thousands of residents to drink clean
water. Some eight million rural residents in Shaanxi and Xinjiang
alone now have used tap water, according to an preliminary survey.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid have helped accelerate the construction of the
water supply and water quality improvement projects in northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
Using UN loans, Shaanxi Province completed a water-quality
improvment project to benefit 1.49 million people. Using
assistance from foreign governments, Gansu has completed 18 water
supply and water quality improvement projects to benefit 350,000
people in nine arid mountainous counties.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A commuter train crashed
into a stalled truck at a rail crossing near Boston today,
injuring at least 21 people, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The commuter train was carrying more than 700 passengers when
it ran into the flatbed truck straddling at the hilltop crossing
10 miles north of Boston, a United Press International report said.
</P>
<P>
The train, traveling at about 45 mph, ripped the truck in half
before its engine went off the tracks at about 5:30 p.m. local
time.
</P>
<P>
However, the truck driver managed to escape unharmed.
</P>
<P>
"The flatbed is very low and it got hung up on the tracks. I
couldn't go forward and I couldn't go backwards," the unidentified
driver told a local TV station.
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials credited the engineer's quick action for
averting a much worse collision that could have derailed much of
the train and injured many more passengers
</P>
<P>
"This could have been a very disastrous situation had the
entire train derailed, cars turned over and what not," the United
Press International quoted one local fire department investigator
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those injured in the accident were sent to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The train was traveling from Boston to Haverhill,
Massachusetts, when it hit the truck. Officials said they hoped to
have the line reopened in time for tomorrow's morning commute.

<HEADLINE> Woman Gives Birth to Female Quadruplets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A woman employee of a textile
plant in Jiaxing City, in east China's Zhejiang Province, has
given birth to female quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has decided to help support three of
her baby girls while she supports the other at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
Experts said there are possible quadruplets once every 510,000
births in normal conditions in China.
</P>
<P>
Just before the New Year came, Pu Liming gave birth to the four
babies, and was worried about how her poor family could support
them. This aroused wide concern in the city.
</P>
<P>
The local women's federation, civil affairs department,
children's care center and some teachers and students at a medical
school all came to help and started to donate money to help the
family. Some of the woman's medical expenses have been reduced or
voided.
</P>
<P>
When the mayor of the city learned about this, he decided that
the local government would support two of Pu's babies until they
are aged 18. And the township government where Pu lives also
decided to support one of Pu's babies until the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The textile plant where Pu works has offered her paid leave for
ten years so that she may have time to bring up the babies
well.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OECD Clarifies Singapore as More Advanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has been clarified
to be a "more advanced developing country" under the
classification of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), instead of a "developed country" as was widely
reported before, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's per capita income of 23,360 US dollars may be the
world's 12th highest, but it is not a developed country, the
Business Times said.
</P>
<P>
It said that according to the OECD's classifications, Singapore
is one of the six "more advanced developing countries," which also
included Brunei, the Bahamas, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted James Michel, chairman of the OECD's
Development Assistance Committee (DAC), as saying that the
Paris-based organization had not labeled Singapore as a developed
country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the OECD does not have a "developed country" category
in its classifications, though it considers all its 26 members to
be developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Local television reported Tuesday evening that the OECD had
reclassified Singapore as a "more advanced developing country"
instead of a "developed nation" as earlier announced.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times reported that Singapore's removal from the
OECD's "developing" list, together with the other five countries,
was formalized last year and took effect in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Many reports have interpreted this as the equivalent of
calling Singapore a developed nation, but this is not our
terminology," the Straits Times quoted an OECD spokesman in Paris
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have no official definition of a developed country," said
the spokesman. But the OECD members are loosely described as
"industrialized" economies.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper reports, Singapore Trade and
Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong commented that the new definition
of a more advanced developing country was a "more accurate
description" of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to be called 'developed country' when we're there,
but not prematurely," the minister reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
"We lack the depth and breadth of the developed economies," he
said, adding that in particular Singapore has little home-grown
technology, relying mostly on imported expertise.
</P>
<P>
"It'll take us another five to ten years to get there, but
we'll get there, provided the people continue to work hard and
smart, and we continue to put in the necessary investments in
education, business and social infrastructure," Yeo said.

<P>
DHAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A scheduled formal meeting
between Bangladesh's ruling party and the opposition fell through
last night after the opposition's refusal to join it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting under the mediation of some Western envoys was
scheduled for the eve of the last date for filing nomination for
the upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the scheduled meeting could have
provided an opportunity for resolving the country's prolonged
political crisis peacefully by achieving an understanding.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), a senior leader of the Awami (People's) League, the
largest opposition party in the country, told a BNP leader by
telephone five minutes before 6 p.m. local time that they would
not be able to join the meeting. No reason was given.
</P>
<P>
Six Western diplomats led by US Ambassador to Dhaka David N.
Merrill rushed to meet Hasina and Khaleda, but failed to bring the

the election under the parliamentary and participatory democratic

does not follow the election rules, we can deem it that such
quarters are not respectful to democracy."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mitterrand's Doctor Under Fire Over Cancer Secrets  (by Yang Qi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Francois Mitterrand's family said
Tuesday it was suing his former personal doctor for violating
medical secrecy by saying that the late French president had
hidden his cancer from the public for a decade.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Claude Gubler said in his book, due to be on sale from
Wednesday, that Mitterrand knew he had cancer a few months after
he was elected in 1981 but covered it up for a decade.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's family said they would apply to the court for the
seizure of the book, alleging it broke medical secrecy.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer of Mitterrand's family said the doctor did not consult
the late president for writing the book while Mitterrand was alive.
</P>
<P>
Excerpts of the book, The Big Secret, were published in the
weekly news magazine Paris-Match today.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said in his book that Mitterrand ordered him to
consider his cancer a state secret and issue dishonest six-monthly
medical bulletins until September 1992, when it was publicly
disclosed that the president had cancer after a prostate operation.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand won re-election in 1988, claiming he was in good
health. He died last week at the age of 79.
</P>
<P>
When first elected, Mitterrand decided to issue six-monthly
health bulletins, partly because former president Georges Pompidou
had died of cancer in office in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The French Medical Association accused Gubler of violating
medical ethics and even suggested disciplinary measures against
him.
</P>
<P>
But Gubler, the president's physician from 1981 until 1994,
said that he violated medical secrecy in the wider interests of
historical truth about the president.
</P>
<P>
He also defended his breach of medical secrecy by saying that
he believed he was following the late president's wishes.
</P>
<P>
Gubler also stirred a political furor in his book by saying the
president had been unfit to rule around November 1994, six months
before he left office after a record 14 years, because he was very
ill.
</P>
<P>
Many politicians tried to defend Mitterrand, all saying he had
been fit to hold power.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who was foreign minister from 1993
to 1995, said Mitterrand had never been incapacitated. "Never. His
illness was never an obstacle to his action," he told journalists
at his official Matignon residence here.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company To Assemble Trucks In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese company, China
Jiefang Uganda Limited, is breaking new ground by being the first
company in recent years to assemble trucks in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The company, founded with an investment of 300,000 US dollars
in May last year at the Nakawa Industrial Area of Kampala, is a
chinese sole venture firm. It consists of a sales department, a
spares office and an after-sell service shop.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of the company is a symbol for the new
achievement of the Chinese automobile industry, and this means
that the history of exporting Chinese vehicles through foreign
agents will be ended," said Lian Yunshan, Managing Director of the
company.
</P>
<P>
In nowadays, as a backer of China Jiefang Uganda Limited,
China First Automobile Group Corporation has set up many branches
all over the world, therefore more and more trucks made by the
corporation are sold in the globe.
</P>
<P>
So far, China Jiefang Uganda Limited has imported 50 medium
trucks into the Ugandan market and the response is good.
</P>
<P>
Products on offer include the long chassis truck's stocks,
tipper and high rack trucks with a loading capacity of six tons.
</P>
<P>
Jiefang vehicles, according to Lian, are suitable for roads in
Uganda because the trucks have 117-kilowatt engines, more
powerful than other trucks while the fuel consumption in each
vehicle is only 18 liters per 100-kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The trucks not only have a strong appeal to the local
customers but also attract buyers from neighboring countries like
Kenya and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Lian Yunshan added that Jiefang vehicles are also working very
well in countries like Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
With the high quality of their products, Lian is quite
self-confident with the future of the company.
</P>
<P>
As soon as it gets the good market, the assembling project
will be started.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- This booming capital of south
China's Guangdong Province will seek to attract more minor foreign
investors by allowing them to have as little as a one percent
stake in a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors will also be allowed to participate in the
trading of property rights. But approval by the city authorities
is mandatory when the property right of a state-owned enterprise
is to be transferred, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
Previously projects offered for foreign investment were large
and took a long time to complete and generate a profit.
</P>
<P>
The new measures, under which foreign investors are allowed to
join in enterprises of different ownerships, will enable foreign
investors to reap economic returns in a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
The measures will also allow foreign-funded ventures to enter
the Chinese market through the sales networks of local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors can remit their dividends and profits
overseas so long as this is agreed in contracts signed by the
domestic and foreign partners. However, they can not transfer
their stocks in an enterprise to its competitors.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipping Agency Gains ISO9002 Certificate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's largest shipping
agency, the China Ocean Shipping Agency (known as PENAVIC) and its
five subsidiaries have been granted ISO9002 certificates by the
British Standards Institution (BSI).
</P>
<P>
PENAVIC officials claimed that they are the first major Chinese
firm in the field of transport service to receive the
internationally-recognized certification for top-quality
management.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 standard series has been adopted by 68 countries
and regions worldwide since its initiation in 1987. In more and
more cases an ISO9000 certificate is becoming a must for market
entrance.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1953, PENAVIC has expanded its business to all the
major ports of the country and has close ties with over 2,000
shipping, trade, banking and insurance businesses across the
world.
</P>
<P>
PENAVIC's subsidiaries in Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai
and Guangzhou, which received the ISO9002 certification together
with the PENAVIC headquarters, are the five largest of company's
70-odd branches.
</P>
<P>
Though it was deprived of its monopoly over shipping in 1985,
the company still holds 80 percent of the national market.
</P>
<P>
PENAVIC's General Manager Zhang Liyong said that he feared that
his company will face fierce competition in future, as more than

<HEADLINE> UEFA Sticks to Three-Foreigner Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA would maintain the three-foreigner limit for this season, it
announced in Nyon, Switzerland, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said in a brief statement that it will not change the
regulations of the three European club cup cometitions in the
1995-96 season in the interest of continuity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
The decision ran counter to the European Union's highest court,
which ruled last December that the limit on foreigners is illegal
and should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
UEFA's stance also puts it at odds with the English Premier
League and powerful European clubs, which back the court ruling
and want to have as many foreigners as they wish in the Champions
Cup, UEFA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup.
</P>
<P>
UEFA regulations allow clubs to field three foreigners, plus
two "assimilitated" players who have played at least five years in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Farmers Enjoy Better Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have since 1990 begun to enjoy
better lives, thanks to rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that in 1995 the per capita income for
farmers in the region was 1,050 yuan, up from 594 yuan five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The increase helped the farmers raise their consumption
level. Their expenditure on food, clothes and services have all
registered high growth rates in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the farmers' expenditure on food  increased 76 percent
over 1990. More and more meat, eggs and fruit are finding their
way onto farmers' tables.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region's per capita spending on clothes for
farmers last year was up 33 percent over the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
Housing conditions have also improved. Statistics show that in
1994 the per capita living space for farmers in the region was
16.3 sq m, up 20 percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
Now farmers also boast more consumer durables in their
homes. In 1994 every 100 households had 86 television sets, 21
more than in 1990.

LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League clubs
decided Tuesday not to participate in next summer's Intertoto Cup
as a protest against UEFA's ban on two teams.
</P>
<P>
According to Rick Parry, Premier League chief executive, the

UEFA banned last Friday Tottenham and Wimbledon from European

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has become the country's leading air transport market
with its passenger, cargo and mail transport volumes and the
number of plane takeoffs and landings all ranking first in China.
</P>
<P>
With a relatively developed market economy, the province's
large flow of goods and people has greatly promoted the expansion
of its air transport industry.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is home to the headquarters of five airlines,
including China Southern Airlines, one of China's top three
carriers. The five airlines operate a total of 44 Boeing jetliners
with total seats numbering 8,152. Last year the airlines carried a
total of 7.73 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
The province now has six civilian airports, and half of them
are 4E-class ones able to accommodate Boeing 747s, the biggest
commercial airplane in use in the world. In 1995 these airports
handled 19.65 million passengers, and 394,993 tons of cargo and
mail, accounting for 13 and 20 percent of the nation's totals,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
One of the top three airports in China, the Baiyun
International Airport in this provincial capital, handled 12.57
million passengers last year, the second-largest number handled by
any airport in China.
</P>
<P>
Also boasting the busiest air traffic, Guangdong saw 178,000
takeoffs and landings on its territory last year, ranking first in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Protect Traditional Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering to
introduce a registration law to protect its traditional medicine
business, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law being drafted by the Public Health Ministry
and the Education Ministry, the registration process for
traditional medicines would be similar to that of a patent with a
period of protection.
</P>
<P>
Traditional doctors could register their ingredients with the
original inscription or photocopies, said Phenapha Sapcharoen,
director of the Traditional Medicine Institute.
</P>
<P>
Yet details on how to deal with the ingredients of well-known
medicines and their protection period have to be discussed,
Phenapha said.
</P>
<P>
Only scientifically proven documents can be registered at the
Commerce Ministry and traditional medicines cannot be put forward
for patent or copyright registration, she said.
</P>
<P>
The current patent law protects only new products and not
traditional medicines whose ingredients have been known for ages,
she complained.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry will register documented ingredients
of herbs used in Thai traditional medicines. Failing to do so,
Deputy Health Minister Thawatvong Na Chiangmai said, Thailand may
have to buy medicines originated from Thai herbs but manufactured
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia, Australia Agree To Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Australia
have agreed to improve bilateral ties and promote mutual
understanding so as to forge a "new and constructive relationship"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the achievements of Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating's three-day official visit to Malaysia which ended today.
</P>
<P>
During talks between Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir and
Keating, both sides wished to strengthen their existing relations
and overcome minor misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Describing their talks as "important and harmonized", Mahathir
told the press that Malaysia and Australia need to further develop
their relations and avoid or at least limit the type of "hiccups"
which off and on bedeviled the ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuala Lumpur and Canberra were strained on
may occasions, notably when Keating described Mahathir as
"recalcitrant" for not attending the inaugural leadership meeting
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Their relations took another twist when the Australian media
reported in early 1994 that the Australian secret intelligence
service has bribed some Malaysian opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
However, as Keating said,"the past can no longer be the primary
source of understanding between us. We must work hard to
understand the modern face of our two countries."
</P>
<P>
"We have the opportunity to create a new level of mutual
understanding between the peoples of Australia and Malaysia and to
forge a rich and rewarding friendship which will endure into the
21st century," Keating told reporters after his meeting with
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
The visit and the talks between the two leaders show both sides
are eager to forget the unpleasant "hiccups" and develop a new and
constructive relationship between them.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Australia have enjoyed a long history of
cooperation. In this regard, Mahathir reassured Keating that
Malaysia will play its part in creating a climate of cooperation
beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade rose to an estimated 7.5 billion Malaysian
ringgit (about three billion US dollars) in 1995, and Malaysia is
Australia's third largest ASEAN trading partner and its 11th
largest export market.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he saw tremendous potential in manufactured
products which account for a major portion of two-way trade as the
two countries take advantage of the benefits of industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
This year, Malaysia is expected to overtake Britain as one of
the Australia's 10 largest export markets, with the latter's
export to the country standing at 4.3 billion ringgit (about 1.72
billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the field of two-way investment which has seen encouraging
progress, Australia is the fourth largest investor in Malaysia
with more than 200 companies with equity interest in Malaysia.
Mahathir hoped the potential for increased joint ventures could be
further tapped by the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the countries' education departments has
been successful. With the signing of a memorandum of understanding
on education yesterday, more Malaysian students will study in
Australian institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also includes plans for exchange of scholars,
twinning programs for universities and other exchange programs
with a view to broadening the range of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to enhance cooperating in the
fields of environment, science, technology, finance, building and
construction and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said some major problems standing in the way of
development of bilateral relations have been solved through
Keating's visit, and, as Keating put it, there was no strain in
the Australia-Malaysia relationship now. But a lesson all seem to
have to bear in mind is that each country has different values and
no country has the right to tell other people how to run their
country.

<HEADLINE> Chad Adheres to "One China Policy," Prime Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
N'DJAMENA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chad recognizes the
government of the People's Republic of China as the sole
legitimate government of China and Taiwan its inalienable part,
Prime Minister Koibla Djimasta said here today.
</P>
<P>
Djimasta made the remarks at a meeting with Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who arrived here today
on a two-day official goodwill visit.
</P>
<P>
Djimasta said that Chad, which has received sincere and
selfishless support from China, always attaches importance to
developing relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that since President Idriss Deby's visit to China in
December 1994, Chad has paid more attention to its relations with
the ancient country, and such friendship is well embodied by
Qian's current visit.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral economic cooperation, Djimasta expressed his
thanks for China-aided projects, which he said have produced good
results and have strengthened the Chadian people's capability for
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties
between China and Chad more than 20 years ago, the two countries
have conducted effective political and economic cooperation, which
has brought about fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
China and Chad established diplomatic relations in November
1972.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for Chad's "One China Policy" and the
policy of not having official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It conforms to the interests of the two countries to
consolidate and develop bilateral ties of cooperation, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"This is my first visit to Chad, and my aim is to enhance
mutual understanding, deepen our friendship and further develop
our friendly relations of cooperation," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the assistant minister of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry, Ji Peiding, and Chad's Plan and Cooperation
Minister Mariam Mahamat Nour signed an agreement on economic and
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chad is the third leg of Qian's five-nation African tour, which
already took him to Libya and Tunisia. He will also visit
Djibouti and Seychelles.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Releases Legal Text of Devolution Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
Tuesday released the legal text of its proposed devolution package
through which it seeks to politically resolve the 13 year ethnic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were unofficially released last year to test the
pulse of the people. While the Tamil community welcomed the
proposals, some sections of the majority Sinhala community,
including the powerful Buddhist clergy, voiced opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
They opposed it because they felt that too much power was being
devolved and there was threat to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The text released Tuesday has been somewhat modified. It will
be discussed at a Parliamentary Select Committee for consensus
before being submitted to parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is also available for public debate.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the package is to establish a union of
regions with a large extent of autonomy to be vested in each of
the regional  administrations.
</P>
<P>
In the latest draft, it is proposed that no regional
administration shall attempt to promote secession or separation.

<P>
KATMANDU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- South Asian countries will
form a regional body of physicians to achieve better cooperation
in fighting common health problems in the region, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from South Asian countries Tuesday agreed to form a
regional association of physicians at the first preliminary

<P>
The association of physicians will maintain a central medical
data bank, organize continued medical education programs and

said the reports.
</P>
<P>
South Asian countries account for one-fifth of the world's
population, where the ratio of people to doctors ranges between
2,000 to one and 16,000 to one.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people in the region suffer from debilitating
diseases every year due to malnutrition and lack of proper medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
SAARC Secretary General Naeem Hasan said Tuesday that SAARC
would work to eradicate poverty, a major problem for public health
in the region, by the year of 2002.

this year with the help of foreign loans, according to a report
by the Mongolian Telegraph Agency.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Renew Feasibility Study on Nuke Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANKGOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Science,
Technology and Environment said that it would renew the
feasibility study on building the country's first nuclear power
plant, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Tuesday following a cabinet decision
last December to conduct the research.
</P>
<P>
The government will invite representatives from non-government
organizations and environmentalists to discuss the project, the
ministry's Permanent Secretary Kasem Sanitwong Na Ayutthaya was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The electricity generating authority of Thailand had earlier
conducted a similar study, but its report was not used because the
information was out of date.
</P>
<P>
The renewed study, to last for two months, will focus on
research on technology, impact on the environment, public
relations work and possible sites for the project, Kasem said.
</P>
<P>
The location of the proposed nuclear power plant must be close
to the sea or a river as a large quantity of cooling water is
needed, Kasem said.
</P>
<P>
It also must also be convenient for heavy equipment transport,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the understanding of people is important for
the project's success.

<HEADLINE> 37,118 Yuan Compensation for Panda Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A boy who became disabled last
year after being bitten by a giant panda has been given 37,118
yuan (about 4,419 US dollars) in compensation, court sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first known case of a panda actually attacking a
human being.
</P>
<P>
The court case also set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
The court in Huzhou City of east China's Zhejiang Province,
held both the local zoo keeper and the boy's parents responsible
for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, 1995, Lu Jie went to the Huzhou People's Zoo to
see the giant panda. He and two other children managed to enter
the cage and played with the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
But the giant panda finally got angry and bit Lu on his left
leg. Other zoo visitors called for help, but the giant panda
keeper failed to appear. Finally, the onlookers rescued the boy
from the cage and rushed him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The result was that Lu became crippled in the left leg.
</P>
<P>
Lu's mother blamed the zoo for negligence, while the zoo
claimed that the boy himself and the giant panda keeper should be
held responsible.
</P>
<P>
Lu's mother originally asked for 96,000 yuan in compensation.

ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The head of Italy's Mafia Toto
Riina, who has been imprisoned since 1993, appeared in court today
in northern Italy's Bologna to stand trial on charges of murders
and bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Riina, also known as "Boss of Bosses", was moved from a prison

</P>
<P>
The city's airport and the courtroom were highly fortified and

<HEADLINE> Leading Officials Must Heed Politics: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, has urged
leading Party and government officials to attach the utmost
importance to politics, and stressed the importance of combating
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials, primarily secretaries of provincial Party
committees, provincial governors, ministers, Party Central
Committee members and members of the Political Bureau of the Party
Central Committee, must attach the utmost importance to politics,
Jiang said in a speech at the Fifth Plenum of the 14th Party
Central Committee on September 27, 1995. The speech was made
public here today.
</P>
<P>
Politics includes political orientation, political stand,
political viewpoints and political discipline, he explained in the
speech, carried in today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
"We must be clear-minded on political issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Party's central task is to expand the economy, but the
fulfillment of the task must be guaranteed politically, he said,
noting, "It is imperative to attach the utmost importance to
politics and political discipline. This is especially important
for senior officials."
</P>
<P>
According to the leader, crucial to the strengthening of
political discipline is abiding by the Party Constitution. All
Party members must observe the various provisions of the Party
Constitution, and senior officials ought to set examples for
others to follow in observing the provisions, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption task will remain arduous for a long time in
the future, he said, adding, "We should never slacken our efforts
in this regard."
</P>
<P>
He urged Party committees and governments at all levels to
concentrate on economic construction and combine the
anti-corruption struggle with their work to promote the reform and
development, and maintain stability.
</P>
<P>
Leading Party and government officials must assume full
responsibility for the anti-corruption campaign in their areas or
departments, he said, adding that first of all, they must manage
leading bodies properly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked leading officials at all levels to improve their
Party spirit. "While transforming the objective world, we must try
to remold the subjective world, be strict with ourselves and
eliminate corruption at the outset," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that, regardless of their positions, if leading Party
officials give up remolding their world outlook, become divorced
from the Party's purpose of serving the people and abuse their
power for personal gain, they will certainly ruin themselves and
be utterly discreted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the issue of one's world outlook and outlook on
life must be resolved properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of tightening supervision
within the Party, improving the system within Party committees for
supervising leading officials and giving scope to the supervisory
role of the people and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
All leading officials must observe the Party's rules and
regulations, participate in Party's organizational activities,
carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conscientiously accept
supervision by Party organizations and the people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Santer Emphasizes Importance of Economic, Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer noted today that it is of great importance for
Europe to realize economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, he
pointed out that the establishment of such a union, as a
significant factor in building a vigorous, strong and prosperous
Europe, concerns the future of the whole Europe.
</P>
<P>
The union will eliminate risks in money exchange inside the
European Union (EU) market, cut the high expenses in the exchange,
make the allocation and transfer of funds smooth and reduce
dependence on the U.S. dollar, said Santer.
</P>
<P>
Santer made the remarks in response to growing speculation that
an economic slowdown in Germany and throughout Europe may force a
delay in the planned 1999 launch of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence in the launch of a single currency as
scheduled and believed that the EU can realize the economic and
monetary union successfully.
</P>
<P>
"Our heads of state have given a solemn commitment to economic
and monetary union. They must act -- and I am sure they will act
-- to meet this commitment." the president said.

<HEADLINE> Medical Devices under Firmer State Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Pharmaceutical
Administration (SPA) has monopolized authorization over imported
medical devices, starting today, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises producing medical devices across the
country, including joint ventures and foreign companies, are also
required to apply for marketing licences from SPA and provincial
pharmaceutical administrative departments for their products.
</P>
<P>
Unlicensed medical devices will be classified as substandard
products not to be marketed in the country and violators will be
fined and punished.
</P>
<P>
SPA promulgated two sets of regulations yesterday: one on
authorization over marketing of medical devices in China, the
other on administration over exportation of pharmaceutical
instruments.
</P>
<P>
Both regulations go into effect today.
</P>
<P>
SPA hopes the regulations will protect the safety of domestic
consumers and also safeguard the reputation of Chinese medical
devices in the world, said Bu Qicheng, director of the Medical
Devices Administration Department.
</P>
<P>
In line with the regulations, all medical devices are
classified into three groups.
</P>
<P>
The first is technically sophisticated devices that have direct
contact with the human body, such as needles and injectors and
those that can be transplanted inside the body, such as pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
The second category includes devices that require strict
inspection, such as X-ray diagnostic instruments and
electrocardiogram equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the last group are basic medical stocks such as ward beds
and supports for intravenous drips.
</P>
<P>
All imported items and domestically produced medical devices in
the first group must be licensed by SPA. Licenses for the second
and third groups of domestically produced devices will be granted
by appropriate provincial departments.
</P>
<P>
Imported second-hand devices must be approved by the national
quality inspection center for medical equipment under SPA.
</P>
<P>
Producers who want to export medical devices are also required
to undergo assessment.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 140 domestic factories and 68 foreign companies
have submitted their products to SPA for marketing licences, said
Bu.
</P>
<P>
The country has more than 600 enterprises manufacturing medical
devices, about ten percent being joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The factories are making some 3,000 varieties of products
valued at six billion yuan (about 705 million US dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year, medical equipment worth 123 million yuan (about 14
million US dollars) was exported to foreign countries, mostly
basic medical devices like blood pressure meters and routine
medical supplies.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Continue Assault on Chechen Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian commandos continued
their attack on Chechen terrorists holding hostages in the
Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye in southern Russia overnight,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
With night already fallen, the village was lit up with flares
dropped by combat jets, the reports said, adding that the
commandos have advanced to the terrorists' positions in the center
of the village near the Daghestani-Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
But the reports said only snipers maintained fire on the
terrorists in order to prevent casualities among the remaining
some 100 hostages.
</P>
<P>
Using man hostages as human shields, the Chechen fighters, who
occupied the central and northern parts of the village, put up
fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said there were more Chechen terrorists in
Pervomaiskoye than initially expected. According to official
reports here on Tuesday, some 100 of the total 250 terrorists
have been killed since the fighting started Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said on Tuesday that five Russian
servicemen were killed and more than 40 others wounded. The latest
death in the operation was Colonel Andrei Krestyaninov, commander
of the Moscow rapid reaction unit of the Interior Ministry, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency said the Chechen terrorists headed by
Salman Raduyev, the son-in-law of separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev, had been well prepared for defense and had a "huge amount
of ammunition."
</P>
<P>
In another development, some 30 Russian experts were abducted
Monday night by some masked Chechen militants from the power
station on the outskirts of Grozny, capital of Chechnya, and their
whereabouts are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a number of masked Chechen terrorists seized a sea
ferry with 120 passenger and 45 crew in the Turkish port of
Trabzon bound for the Russian Black Sea port of Sochi. The
hijacked ship has left Turkey with its destination unknown so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel Chechen leadership has reportedly ordered
a full-scale terrorist action in Chechnya and Daghestan, both
located in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
But the headquarters of Chechen rebel armed formations denied
the report, saying rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov "had never
given such an order and never will."

<HEADLINE> 37,118 Yuan Compensation for Panda Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A boy who became disabled last
year after being bitten by a giant panda has been given 37,118
yuan (about 4,419 US dollars) in compensation, court sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first known case of a panda actually attacking a
human being.
</P>
<P>
The court case also set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
The court in Huzhou City of east China's Zhejiang Province,
held both the local zoo keeper and the boy's parents responsible
for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, 1995, Lu Jie went to the Huzhou People's Zoo to
see the giant panda. He and two other children managed to enter
the cage and played with the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
But the giant panda finally got angry and bit Lu on his left
leg. Other zoo visitors called for help, but the giant panda
keeper failed to appear. Finally, the onlookers rescued the boy
from the cage and rushed him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The result was that Lu became crippled in the left leg.
</P>
<P>
Lu's mother blamed the zoo for negligence, while the zoo
claimed that the boy himself and the giant panda keeper should be
held responsible.
</P>
<P>
Lu's mother originally asked for 96,000 yuan in compensation.

<HEADLINE> Leading Officials Must Heed Politics: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, has urged
leading Party and government officials to attach the utmost
importance to politics, and stressed the importance of combating
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials, primarily secretaries of provincial Party
committees, provincial governors, ministers, Party Central
Committee members and members of the Political Bureau of the Party
Central Committee, must attach the utmost importance to politics,
Jiang said in a speech at the Fifth Plenum of the 14th Party
Central Committee on September 27, 1995. The speech was made
public here today.
</P>
<P>
Politics includes political orientation, political stand,
political viewpoints and political discipline, he explained in the
speech, carried in today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
"We must be clear-minded on political issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Party's central task is to expand the economy, but the
fulfillment of the task must be guaranteed politically, he said,
noting, "It is imperative to attach the utmost importance to
politics and political discipline. This is especially important
for senior officials."
</P>
<P>
According to the leader, crucial to the strengthening of
political discipline is abiding by the Party Constitution. All
Party members must observe the various provisions of the Party
Constitution, and senior officials ought to set examples for
others to follow in observing the provisions, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption task will remain arduous for a long time in
the future, he said, adding, "We should never slacken our efforts
in this regard."
</P>
<P>
He urged Party committees and governments at all levels to
concentrate on economic construction and combine the
anti-corruption struggle with their work to promote the reform and
development, and maintain stability.
</P>
<P>
Leading Party and government officials must assume full
responsibility for the anti-corruption campaign in their areas or
departments, he said, adding that first of all, they must manage
leading bodies properly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked leading officials at all levels to improve their
Party spirit. "While transforming the objective world, we must try
to remold the subjective world, be strict with ourselves and
eliminate corruption at the outset," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that, regardless of their positions, if leading Party
officials give up remolding their world outlook, become divorced
from the Party's purpose of serving the people and abuse their
power for personal gain, they will certainly ruin themselves and
be utterly discreted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the issue of one's world outlook and outlook on
life must be resolved properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of tightening supervision
within the Party, improving the system within Party committees for
supervising leading officials and giving scope to the supervisory
role of the people and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
All leading officials must observe the Party's rules and
regulations, participate in Party's organizational activities,
carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conscientiously accept
supervision by Party organizations and the people, he said.

SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- This east China metropolis is
soon to complete the construction of its third tunnel beneath the
Huangpu River, which will connect the city proper on the west side
of the river with the Pudong New Area on the east side.
</P>
<P>
The project started in January 1994, and so far 2,050 m of the
planned 2,207 m of the tunnel has been driven. The 4.5-m-high,
7.5-m-wide tunnel is to be completed before the Spring Festival,
which falls February 19 this year, and to open to traffic at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Two tunnels have already been built beneath the Huangpu River,
the construction of which took eight and five years,
respectively. With the construction of the new tunnel, traffic
across the Huangpu River as well as the investment environment in
Pudong will be further improved.
</P>
<P>
It is Shanghai's first city construction project adopting the
BOT (build, operate and transfer) mode, a popular contracting mode
worldwide nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is funded by the Shanghai CITIC Tunnel Development
Co. Ltd, a joint venture between the Shanghai Huangpu River Tunnel
Construction Co. and the China International Trust and Investment
Co. Ltd (Hong Kong Group).
</P>
<P>
Investing a total of 1.4 billion yuan, the company will be

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Threaten to Blow up Turkish Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chechen gunmen seized a
Russia-bound ship with 255 people aboard in the Turkish port of
Trabzon today and threatened to blow it up unless Russia ends
fighting with Chechen hostage-takers in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
Six masked men armed with rifles raided the ship around 6:20 pm
(1620 GMT) today, said the semiofficial Anatolia news agency. The
Panamanian-flagged ship with about 20 gunmen later sailed into the
Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The ship was abducted in the Black Sea port city of Trabzon 90
minutes before it was to leave for the Russian port city of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
"If the Russians do not free our 250 friends in the northern
Caucasus, we are going to blow the ship up in Istanbul's
Bosphorus," the gang's leader, identifying himself only as
Mohammed and from the northern Caucasus, told a private Turkish
television station.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the Chechen separatist fighters
holding dozens of hostages in southern Russia in a January 9
drama. They held out for a second day today against relentless
pounding by Russian artillery and helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
Police said one policeman was wounded in the attack before the
ship left port.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, who said no one has been killed or wounded in the
seizure, promised to free the Turkish citizens in Istanbul but not
the Russian passengers to protest Moscow's treatment of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Interior Ministry said 164 Russians were on
the ship, along with 46 Turks and a crew of 45.
</P>
<P>
With 8 million Caucasian-origin Turks and a 25,000-strong
Chechen community, the predominantly Muslim Turkey sympathizes
with the three-year drive for independence in Chechnya, a largely
Muslim republic in the Caucasus Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis with the Chechens in Russia began January 9,
when the rebels slipped past border guards and seized hostages in
Kizlyar to dramatize their demand for a Russian troop withdrawal
from Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Increases in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed
people in Finland reached 478,000 by the end of 1995, 30,000 more
than last November, the local newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is 19.6 percent now in the country and
over 25 percent in the northern parts, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The government could not achieve its goal of reducing
unemployment by half during its four-year term if no effective
measures are taken to solve the problem, the Ministry of Labor
also said today.
</P>
<P>
The government, which took office last April, has made the
solution of the unemployment problem one of its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
However, 20,000 more people are out of work now than before
last April, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen is expected to hold
discussions with both labor and management on measures to be taken
to create job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Finnish experts believed that the country's economic growth
over the past two years was not fast enough to reduce the number
of jobless. They suggested measures such as reducing interest
rates, invigorating the building industry and reforming taxes.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper blamed the unemployment problem on the building
industry and the health and welfare sectors. All the three sectors
had to cut the number of their employees due either to the
sluggish market or to a lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that more than 80,000 people aged under 25
are now out of work while more than 140,000 Finns have been
jobless for more than one year. Those who have been unemployed for
more than two years number 60,000, 13,000 more than the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Rebel HK Pro Soccer Body to Boycott New Year's Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A newly-founded rebel Hong
Kong professional soccer organization has decided to boycott one
of Hong Kong's major tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Association of Hong Kong Professional
 Football Clubs said that its member clubs will not send any of
their players to the Carlsbery Cup New Year's Tournament, which is
just one month away.
</P>
<P>
The traditional two-day tournament, slated for February 19 and
22, is to usher in the lunar Chinese new year. Originally
scheduled to play in the event were teams from Poland, Sweden,
Japan and a combined Hong Kong side with players from various pro
clubs.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the Pro Association itself last year has
already posed a fierce challenge to Hong Kong's current governing
body of the sport, the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA).
</P>
<P>
The Pro Association denounced the leadership of HKFA and
described it as "a group of amateurs managing the professional
football in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
It added that HKFA should take the responsibility for the fact
that Hong Kong has left behind other regional soccer powers who
only started pro football in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Pro Association also demands a bigger say in the
arrangement of Senior League, and a bigger share of revenue from
league competitions.
</P>
<P>
"If Hong Kong professional football is to become truly
professional, the Senior Clubs must have a reasonable return from
their investment."
</P>
<P>
It said that the huge deficits must be reduced so that the
Senior Clubs can be assured of their long term existence and be
willing to invest in the long term football development in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The crux of the problem is the lack of professional leadership
in the FA," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement also announced other decisions for Hong Kong's
soccer toward further professionalization.

<HEADLINE> Bank Vaults into Action to Lower Inflation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading State-owned
commercial bank claimed its top task this year is to "closely
center on curbing inflation", according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China made the pledge to
keep in line with the nation's macro financial control policy.
</P>
<P>
To realize the task, the bank will take measures to steadily
increase its deposits while keeping a close eye on its purse.
</P>
<P>
Increasing deposits, a basic condition for banking business
expansion, takes more cash out of circulation and thus plays an
important role in curbing inflation, the bank's vice-president Liu
Tinghuan told branch heads attending the bank's five-day national
conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bank's task is to attract 260 billion yuan worth
of new deposits. But the vice-president urged his branch heads to
work even harder to try to win 300 billion yuan worth of new
deposits.
</P>
<P>
The bank will set quotas for each of its branches throughout
the country to guarantee the fulfillment of this task.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to win more deposits from enterprises,
governmental institutions, non-banking financial organizations and
various funds. Deposits from those sectors usually have lower
interest rates than individual deposits and thus can help the bank
reduce operational costs.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the bank has also called on its branches to
explore new channels to attract deposits and increase the volume
of their debit cards from the current 7.26 million to 10 million
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the bank attracted 311.8 billion yuan worth of fresh
deposits, bringing its total outstanding deposits to about 1,444
billion yuan by the end of last year, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase of deposits has further strengthened the
bank's financial capability and made the bank's outstanding
deposits, for the first time in many years, exceed its outstanding
loans of about 1,404 billion yuan, Liu added.
</P>
<P>
While channeling more idle funds from the public, the bank will
also tightly control its credit volume this year. All the branches
were yesterday told not to break the loan quotas distributed by
the headquarters of the bank.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the headquarters this year wants a large slice of
its credit cake, which means the ratio of loans handled by its
branches will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the headquarters plan to control 30 percent of
the bank's total loans so as to give more financial support to
State key enterprises.

52.3-percent share of the regional total diminished 2.4 percent to
reach 25.2 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
As the gross domestic product of the Latin American countries
as a whole went up by only 0.6 percent in 1995, a sign of slow
economic growth, the demand for steel in this region fell 13.4
percent after rises for four years running, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The demand for steel ingots dropped from 38.1 million tons in
1994 to 33 million tons in 1995, a level similar to that in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted the gross domestic product of the Latin
American countries would increase 4 percent this year after last
year's slow but sustained improvement in the economic and
financial situation of Mexico and other Latin American countries
affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Total demand for steel ingots in this region is expected to
grow 3.8 percent to reach some 34.3 million tons this year and
steel production to rise 3.4 percent to a new high of 50 million
tons, with per capita consumption projected at 72.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The report said steel imports of the Latin American countries
would soar by 9.2 percent to 5.6 million tons this year while
exports would grow 3.8 percent to 19.2 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Rules to Curb Tax Evasion to Spread Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent measure aimed at
curbing tax evasion in the processing trade has had good results
so far, a foreign trade official told China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The "guarantee account" practice was introduced on November 27
last year in three cities--Dongguan of Guangdong Province, Ningbo
of Zhejiang Province, and Suzhou of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises dealing with the processing trade there have been
required to open a "guarantee account" in appointed local branches
of the Bank of China when bringing raw materials --duty free--
from abroad to be processed into finished products for the
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
If they fail to export these products in time, the Customs,
banks and other government agencies will work jointly to collect
the slipped tax. Those found guilty of smuggling will lose their
right to conduct foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to help curb tax evasion in the
processing trade with the participation of the banks. Imported
materials for the processing trade are duty free in China.
</P>
<P>
Between November 27 to December 31 last year, more than 4,900
such accounts were opened in the three cities, Wang Quiqing, an
official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
said.
</P>
<P>
After a trial period of three to six months, the practice will
be introduced to other cities, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that at present, Moftec and related government
departments are working on detailed implementation rules to
further improve the system.

<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- According to the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, China issued numbers to about 15
million telephone subscribers last year.
</P>
<P>
This brought the number of new subscribers during the period
1990-1995 to 11.2 times that of 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 27.76 million private telephones nationwide,
accounting for 70 percent of the country's total, while there were
only 1.52 million private telephones five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The telephone coverage rate in China's urban areas has reached
13 percent, with the availability rate exceeding 20 percent in 14
provincial capitals, while that of Haikou, Hangzhou, Guangzhou,
Fuzhou, and Beijing is above 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, the rate has
already hit 109 percent.
</P>
<P>
Attention has also been given to the development of public
telephones. The number of public telephones has reached 800,000,
while there were only 46,000 of them in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks International Aid to Save Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China is seeking international
co-operation in its efforts to save the endangered South China
tigers from extinction, according to the State Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Only about dozens of the tigers, which used to roam in the
mountainous areas of Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Fujian and other
southern Chinese provinces, have survived and most of them are now
in zoos.
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that unless immediate and effective
protection measures are taken, the number of South China tigers
will soon be reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
Last year a state program was worked out to protect the South
China tigers which had been moved from their original habitats and
housed in zoos. A long-term plan for their protection has been
drawn up, and a gene base of the South China tiger will be set up
at the Shanghai Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that the limited amount of funds and lack of
knowledge of breeding techniques are the major problems for the
protection work.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that zoos throughout the country work together in
pairing South China tigers according to pedigree and should
further co-operate with foreign researchers in learning new
breeding techniques, such as artificial insemination and embryo
transfer, so as to slow down the degeneration of the species
caused by inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to put an end to the inbreeding of South China
tigers in zoos, Chinese scientists must accelerate the search for
South China tigers living in the wild to provide more mates, they
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's only scientific research center which
experiments with protecting the endangered tigers through feeding,
breeding, nursing the cubs and treating diseases, has been
established at the Chongqing Zoo, in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The China Zoo Association and a Japanese zoo have already
established scientific co-operation, and plan to build some
research facilities for the protection of the tigers.
</P>
<P>
Also, a group of six researchers from a worldwide nature
protection federation have demonstrated how to choose tigers for
breeding at the Chongqing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The researchers say that if the number of a certain species of
tiger cannot be kept above 100, it will be very difficult for them
to multiply.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the number of South China tigers in chinese
zoos can exceed 100 by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Combines Jobless Insurance with Reemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has accumulated an unemployment insurance fund amounting to 569
million yuan (about 68 million U.S.dollars) since October, 1986,
of which 132 million yuan has been used as a training fund for the
unemployed and a self-help production fund.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang began its unemployment insurance system in 1986,
mainly for employees of state-owned enterprises, above
county-level collective enterprises and Chinese employees in joint
ventures who had lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the reform, some of the shortcomings of
the system began to be exposed. In view of these shortcomings, the
province perfected the system in 1992 by adopting a series of
reform measures which greatly enlarged the coverage of the
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the province began legislative work for a new
unemployment insurance system, and in August this year the
standing committee of the provincial people's congress endorsed
the Regulations of Zhejiang Province on Unemployment Insurance,
which went into effect on January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The regulations specifically stipulate the accumulation,
management and disposal of unemployment insurance funds; the
management and reemployment of the jobless; the supervision organs
and the legal responsibilities of those concerned.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000), the urban rate of unemployment is expected to
be kept under four percent and the rate of reemployment may reach
60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Marine Economy Striding Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has reaped a profit of 50 billion yuan (about six billion US
dollars) from its marine industry this year, quadruple the figure
for 1990.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, boasting the bulk of China's marine research
institutions and related scientific personnel, has 170,000 sq km
of offshore area, which is larger than the province's onshore
territory, as well as 3,000 km of coastline, one-sixth of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 the provincial government proposed a strategic
plan: Based on the exploitation of marine resources, the province
is determined to create on the sea "another Shandong" which
possesses economic power equivalent to that of the province.
</P>
<P>
With fisheries as the mainstay, comprehensive exploitation of
marine resources has been accelerated since then.
</P>
<P>
Aquatics production is expected to reach 3.8 million tons, four
times the figure in 1990, and aquatics product value is expected
to top 45 billion yuan, of which marine fisheries will account for
80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The marine chemical industry is a new force which has come to
the fore. It has reached a production capacity of 9.3 million tons
of crude salt, ranking first in China. Besides, its production
volume of soda ash and caustic soda also take the leading
positions in the country.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shandong boasts 24 harbors with 187 berths, of which
40 are deepwater berths. There are 10 harbors open to the outside
world, connected with over 300 ports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 460 aquatics-related joint ventures
have been set up in the province, introducing 220 million US
dollars in foreign capital. In addition, the export of marine
products is expected to top 500 million US dollars-worth, more
than five times the figure in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the marine economy has absorbed a
large number of surplus rural workers. To date, more than 200,000
laborers from other parts of China are employed in the marine
industry in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The output value of enterprises in connection with the plan
("another Shandong" on the sea) is expected to account for 30
percent of the provincial gross domestic product by the end of the
century, and to reach 50 percent by the year 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The pharmaceuticals industry
has been developing quickly over the past five years in east
China's Zhejiang Province, thanks to the adoption of high
technology in the field.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period

fivefold to reach nine billion yuan in 1995, compared with 1990,
while half of it came from hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
Such hi-tech sectors as bio-engineering, electronic
information, integration of machinery and electronics, and
high-efficiency and energy-saving technologies, have been used in
medicine production and in transforming traditional industries and
expanding production scales.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the province has been listed among China's
major medicine producers in terms of output, sales value and
profits. Medicines produced in the province sell abroad as well as
all over China.
</P>
<P>
The province has made special achievements in virology
research. Since the 1980s local medical researchers have conducted
systematic research into such viruses as those of hepatitis A and
measles and have made progress in controlling these viruses.

<HEADLINE> Winter Agriculture Popular in Northern Cotton growing Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Winter Agriculture has
transformed the traditional seasonal agriculture in northern
China's farming areas into whole-year agriculture, according to
Zhan Wu, a leading Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by its peculiar climate and traditional method of
farming, peasants in northern China do not carry out farming work
in the five-month period from early winter to early spring, which
they call "free winter".
</P>
<P>
The so-called winter agriculture, which originated in Lingxian
County, in east China's Shandong Province, means making full use

"free winter" period by means of promoting the planting of
vegetables.

Wei Xueping, an official of the county, said the planting of
vegetables in the "free winter" has changed the traditional cotton
growing areas from one-season planting to multiseasonal planting,
which greatly boosts peasants' incomes.
</P>
<P>
To date, winter agriculture has aroused widespread interest in
northern China's farming areas, and many peasants in these areas
are scheduled to carry out the agricultural reform this winter.

NEW YORK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chemical Banking Corporation

billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 25 percent from that of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Most People in Ulster Want Arms Decommissioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A poll published in Ulster today
said that 83 percent of people in the province maintained that
rival paramilitaries should decommission at least some or better
all of their weapons before all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
The poll for the Belfast Telegraph said 60 percent of those
questioned indicated that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and
Protestant paramilitaries should decommission all their arms
before being admitted to talks on the political future of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 percent believed that arms should be retained while
talks were held.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Times today, the IRA's arsenal is
estimated to include three tonnes of Semtex explosive, 650 AK-47
semi-automatic rifles, at least a dozen general-purpose
machineguns, 20 Russian heavy-calibre armour-piercing machineguns,
at least one Sam-7 missile, up to 40 rocket-propelled grenade
launchers and up to 100 Webley revolvers.
</P>
<P>
The IRA's most important weapon is the knowledge of how to
create lethal home-made devices, most notably "barrack buster"
mortars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 75 percent of the IRA arsenal has been
stored in the Irish Republic since the ceasefire of August 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the arsenals of two Protestant armed
groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence
Association (UDA), are smaller and less sophisticated than the
IRA's.
</P>
<P>
The UVF and UDA are thought to have East European assault
rifles, including a supply of AK-47s -- shotguns and handguns and
a limited supply of rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
Other Protestant paramilitary forces have relied more on
homemade weapons, including machineguns. Their explosives
capability is also less sophisticated than the IRA.

<HEADLINE> UN Council to Urge Sudan to Extradite Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council will urge Sudan to extradite three suspects wanted by
Ethiopia in connection with an attempt to assassinate Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa last June, said John
Weston, president of the Council for this month.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters today after a closed-door
meeting on a request last week by Ethiopia for a Council meeting
to force Sudan to surrender the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling that, so far as Sudan is concerned, there
is perhaps more to be done in terms of complying with the requests
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for the extradition of
the three suspects, who are thought to be in Sudan," Weston said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would convey this to Sudan's U.N. envoy or its
foreign minister, who is now in New York.
</P>
<P>
The attempt on Mubarak's life occurred shortly after he arrived
in Addis Ababa on June 26 last year for the 31st OAU summit
meeting. He was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Ethiopia found out the terrorists had been
plotting the assassination in Khartoum, Sudan, and three major
suspects were hiding out in the country after the failed action.
</P>
<P>
Efforts of Ethiopia to settle the issue bilaterally with Sudan
failed. It was then taken up by the OAU, which issued a statement,
calling upon the government of the Sudan to hand over to Ethiopia
the three terrorists who are sheltering in the Sudan on the basis
of the 1964 Extradition Treaty between Ethiopia and the Sudan.

<HEADLINE> US Corn, Soybean Outputs Decline Sharply in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) --Both corn and soybean
production in 1995 declined sharply from the previous year,
according to the U.S. Agriculture Department today.
</P>
<P>
The department said in its final production figures for the
1995 that the country's corn growers harvested 7.37 billion
bushels, a 27 percent below the record 10.1 billion bushels in
1994. The harvest for soybean growers totaled 2.15 billion
bushels, a 14 percent down from the 1994 record of 2.52 billion
bushels.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the reduction of both crops to a mix
of weather extremes, including a wet spring and early freezes with
hot, dry spells in between.
</P>
<P>
Corn yields averaged 113.5 bushels an acre, soybeans 34.9.
</P>
<P>
Tight supplies were reflected in the department's report on
stored grain as of December 1, 1995. Corn was put at 6.1 billion
bushels, down 24 percent from a year earlier after growers
harvested a record crop. Soybeans totaled 1.83 billion bushels,
down 13 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Wheat stocks were estimated at 1.34 billion bushels, down 10
percent from a year earlier and the lowest December 1 total since
the reporting period was adopted nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wheat growers reported planting 52 million acres for the crop
being harvested this spring, which is a 7 percent up from 1995 and
the largest acreage since 1990.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the department forecast the cotton harvest at
18 million bales, a 9 percent below 1994's record. Although
insects and cold weather damaged the Texas crop, most of the loss
was due to bad weather in the Carolinas.

<HEADLINE> US Urges India Not to Deploy New Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
today urged India not to deploy its new medium-range missile,
warning that such a move would create new tensions in one of the
most dangerous areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We think that deployment of this medium range missile would go
in the wrong direction and create new tensions, rather than to
reduce tensions in what is arguably one of the most dangerous,
least-stable areas of the world right now," Department spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We are working very hard in the Indian subcontinent with both
Pakistan and India to try to reduce tensions and to slow an arms
build-up there," Bacon said, "so we would urge restraint on all
sides, including India."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Indian defense officials said in New Delhi that
India would deploy the Prithvi missile, which has been tested for
a distance of 100 miles but can be extended to reach 150 miles.
</P>
<P>
The Prithvi is also capable of delivering nuclear warheads,
according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reported Ready to Discuss Oil Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is ready to
negotiate with Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the
Security Council's resolution allowing limited oil sales in
exchange for humanitarian goods, diplomats soureces said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the offer was relayed by Iraq's
ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon to envoys from
Botswana, Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau and Honduras, which were
members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Secretary-General said that Boutros-Ghali,
who was in London for talks on the question of East Timor, was
aware of Iraq's offer. Though he had not received the official
communication, he was ready to discuss the issue with Iraq
following terms of the Security Council's resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed sanctions against Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The council has refused to lift
the sanctions until the latter meets all U.N. cease-fire terms,
including revealing all information on its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has allowed Iraq to sell up to four billion dollars of
oil a year to pay for food and medicine imports. Iraq has
repeatedly turned down the offer, saying the attached conditions
violate its sovereignty.

MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower House
of the Russian Parliament, failed to elect its speaker in the
second round of secret ballot that stretched almost until midnight
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznev representing the Communist Party received 219
votes, just seven votes short of the required 226, in the second
round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rybkin backed by the pro-government "Our Home Is Russia"
bloc and independent deputies got only 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
Other 171 voting tockets remained unclaimed as Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party faction and a majority of
"Our Home Is Russia" and independents had announced they would not
take part in the vote, insisting it should be postponed until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Constitution, the Duma should hold a
third round of ballot to choose the speaker from the two
candidates, Seleznev and Rybkin, only by a simple majority
principle.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Seleznev will probably win in the
third round of voting scheduled for Wednesday morning.

WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) --Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. have halted their exploratory merger talks after
failing to reach agreement on money and who would hold the top
jobs in the new giant, according to the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Boeing, the world's largest commercial
aircraft-producer and McDonnell Douglas Corp, which were first

If Boeing --valued at about 27 billion U.S. dollars-- had taken
over McDonnell Douglas --valued at about 10.2 billion dollars--
the combined company was projected to have more than 37 billion
dollars in sales and 185,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The talks did not narrow gaps between the two giants because
Boeing was unwilling to pay the "big premium" sought by McDonnell
Douglas executives, including the company's chief executive
officer, Harry Stonecipher, reported the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Businessmen Tried for Alleged War Material Sale to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Four prominent Swiss businessmen
are being tried for alleged providing of war materials for Iraq to
help it build what was to be the biggest cannon in history, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The trial began on Monday in Lausanne, involving three directors of
Von Roll, Switzerland's largest steel group, and a director of the
trading company Uldry. They are alleged to have sold Iraq 10 million
Swiss francs, some 8 million U.S. dollars, worth of hardware for the
building of Iraq's "supergun" between 1988 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraq imported material from many countries
in the world to build the cannon with a range of between 700 and
1,000 kilometers, capable of hitting targets throughout the Middle
East, including Israel.
</P>
<P>
The four businessmen rejected the charges of violating Swiss law on
exporting war materials, saying they still believe that the machinery
parts Von Roll processed for the Industry Ministry of Iraq cannot be
used to build cannons.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of the case began in May 1990 after the steel
company's products heading for Iraq were stopped at Frankfurt and
Bern, being linked with Iraq's "supergun" project.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which is expected to last 4 to 6 weeks, is first such
since the autumn of 1970 when a businessman was sentenced to 8 months
in prison with reprieve and was fined 20,000 Swiss francs for illegal
sale of arms to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the four businessmen would face at least 3 year
imprisonment and a fine up to 500,000 Swiss francs.

LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Head of State
Captain Valentine Strasser has been overthrown and replaced by
his deputy Maada Bio, said the Nigerian National Television here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The television quoted the Sierra Leonean state radio as saying
that Strasser was removed for trying to force his National
Provisional Ruling Council to allow him to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
Strasser has left the country and the new chairman would
address the nation soon, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
February 26, 1996, was announced as the date for the Sierra
Leonean general election that will mark the return to democracy
by the country's interim National Electoral Commission last
December.
</P>
<P>
Strasser came to power in 1992, toppling the civilian
government of Joseph Monoh and promising to end the rebel war,
then just over a year old.
</P>
<P>
The war has wrecked Sierra Leone's mining-based economy and
driven more than one third of the country's four million people
from their homes.

SARAJEVO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Fearing possible sabotages by
some Serb extremists, 150 French soldiers moved in here to four
vital installations for protection, a French IFOR spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Major Herve Gourmelon told a press conference that the French
troops and 30 armoured vehicles were sent to guard a gas station,
a water pumping station and two electricity installations, all are
located in the west part of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"The French soldiers arrived at the four installations at 7:30
this morning to prevent desperate measures by some minorities and
extremists," he added.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that the Serbs, who have to hand over some
suburbs to the Muslim-Croat Federation, might destroy some key
installations before taking a mass exodus to other Serb
territories.
</P>
<P>
"We don't mean that the installations are already in danger,
but after making analysis on the situation, we decided to send
troops there to prevent possible sabotages," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The French IFOR official also said, "Both the Muslim-led
government and the Serb authority have been informed of this
action " which aims to maintain the important items to the life of

<P>
Mozambican coach Rui Cacador of Portugal was naturally
delighted with his team's first point in nations up finals.
</P>
<P>
"It was a satisfying result for us," said Cacador, but he
questioned the team's credentials as possible quarter-finalists.
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel we have much of a chance of making the last
eight, although my young squad will be trying their best," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, ranked second on the continent and 22nd in the world
by fifa (International Football Federation), were surprisingly
held to a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian coach of Poland Henry Kasperczak said: "this result
was not favourable for us."
</P>
<P>
"Reaching the quarter-finals is our target, but now we are
going to have to work twice as hard to achieve it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kasperczak blamed his strikers for the setback, saying "the
mid-field players performed the jobs i wanted them to do, but the
forwards did not."
</P>
<P>
He said the strikers failed to score more goals despite being
presented with many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The next game of group d is between Tunisia and Ghana on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Senior PASOK Officials Run for Greek Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek National Defense Minister
Gerasimos Arsenis officially announced today that he would run for
the position of prime minister following the resignation of the
country's premier Andreas Papandreou Monday due to health reason.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs a government of victory and prospects which
will ensure continuity, stability, development, social solidarity
and will decisively and responsibly deal with our national
issues," Arsenis said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is also a member of the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) executive bureau, described
Papandreou's decision to clear the way for the election of a new
prime minister as "great, historic and brave" in line with the
actions of "a leader and symbol of an epoch."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Industry Minister Costas Simitis, one of the
founding members of PASOK, officially announced earlier today that
he would be a candidate for the premiership at the party's
parliamentary group meeting and left open the possibility of
running for the presidency of the party at PASOK's next congress
scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou currently remains the leader of PASOK.
</P>
<P>
The current socialist government, which came to power in 1993,
has another two years to finish its term.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Telemachos Hytiris said today that the
presidential decree on the election of a new prime minister, as
requested by the constitution, would be signed later today by the
bed-ridden Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the decree would mark the commencement of
the three-day period during which PASOK's parliamentary group
meeting must be convened to elect a new premier.
</P>
<P>
PASOK's central committee will meet tomorrow to decide on
succession procedures for the replacement of Papandreou.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua)-- Liberia beat Gabon 2-1 in
the opening group C match of the 20th African Cup of Nations
today at Kings Park Stadium in Durban.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's defender Kelvin Sebwe scored the first goal from the
penalty spot in the fourth minute, the second goal was scored by
Midfielder Massa Sarr Jr. in the 54th minute, while Gabon replied
with a goal in the 58th minute by defender Guy-Roger Nzeng.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the game, Gabon started well, pushing
the ball around the park with confidence. However, Liberia took
the lead against the run of play.
</P>
<P>
Gabon was desperately unlucky not to score several times with
defender Jonas Ogandaga outstanding as he tore the Liberian
defence apart with probing runs, time and again.
</P>
<P>
Liberia now led group C, depleted by the absence of defending
champions Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The 20th African Cup of Nations began on January 13 in
Johannesburg. 15 African teams took part in the biggest sports
event on the continent. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Syria Hold Joint Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti-Syrian Joint
committee opened its fourth session here today to discuss means of
upgrading bilateral relations and economic cooperation in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the Ministry of Finance, was co-chaired by
Syrian Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Saleem Yaseen
and Kuwaiti Second Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Nasser Abdullah al-Rowdhan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Yaseen said that
the Syrian economy had developed during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Syria used to import barley and wheat, but since the beginning
of the 90s it has increased its production and become
self-sufficient and is ready to export agricultural and industrial
products, Yaseen said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has managed to changed its status as an oil importing
country to an oil producer and exporter, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the increasing investment flow to Damascus, Yaseen said it
was a result of the agricultural and investment laws as well as
the economic policy adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Syria will reach a stable exchange
rate for its lira, adding that the country has taken many steps
taken in this regard and that further measures would be adopted to
achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
The syrian official said a comprehensive and just peace in the
Middle East region would affect positively Damascus' economy,
stressing that Syria aims to regain every usurped right in
accordance with the international conventions and laws.
</P>
<P>
Yaseen was here referring to the occupied Syrian Golan Heights,
captured by Israel during the Arab-Israeli war in 1967.
</P>
<P>
On kuwaiti economic projects and investment in Syria, he said
the Syrian government is removing all obstacles blocking Kuwaiti
investments and will provide them with all required facilities.
</P>
<P>
In response, Nasser Abdullah al-Rowdhan said the Kuwaiti-Syrian
committee was designed to deal with economic, political, cultural
and social issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the planning ministries in both countries would sign an
agreement on exchanging experts, adding they will also sign health
and tourism protocols.
</P>
<P>
Yaseen and his accompanied delegation met earlier today with
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian delegation headed by Yaseen arrived here Tuesday to
attend the fourth session of the Kuwaiti-Syrian committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Poland is willing to establish
on its territory military facilities for the IFOR as may be
needed.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski during his meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and the ambassadors of the North Atlantic Council at NATO
headquarters here today.
</P>

said.

<P>
During his talks with NATO leaders, the President once again
expressed Poland's "strong desire" to join the Alliance as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Poland's integration with NATO, European Union, the West
European Union would not just serve our interest alone, it would
also be... an indispensable and necessary step towards creating a
new security architecture for Europe," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that Poland did not intend to draw new dividing lines
in Europe and that its membership in NATO would not be harmful to
the security interests of Russia or any other country.
</P>
<P>
He urged NATO to set the timetable for its enlargement soon so
that NATO can begin the accession talks with Poland "before the end
of this year".
</P>

"open and frank" talks with the Polish President.
</P>

between NATO and Poland, calling Poland "one of the most active
partners of NATO".
