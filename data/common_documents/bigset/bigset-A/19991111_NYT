EDITORIAL: MRS. CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton took her undeclared candidacy for the
U.S. Senate in a truly unfortunate direction this week. A year
before the election, the New York State Democratic Party started
running television commercials for Mrs. Clinton, paid for in part
by unregulated ``soft money'' raised by the national party in
Washington from corporations, unions and rich individuals. The ads
recall one of the worst fund-raising abuses practiced by President
Clinton in his own 1996 re-election campaign. Mrs. Clinton should
withdraw them or pay for them entirely with money raised under the
federal election law ceilings, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has done
with his first run of ads.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercials, which are running upstate, highlight the
first lady's listening tour, with scenes of her talking to New
Yorkers about health care, jobs and education. ``It's about
leadership that's on our side,'' a voice intones. ``Call Hillary.''
Because there is nothing in the ad asking anyone to vote for Mrs.
Clinton, the Democratic Party contends that the commercial is an
``issue ad'' that does not have to be paid for with money raised
under the ceilings imposed by federal election laws. That tortured
reasoning was exploited by both Clinton and Bob Dole in 1996 _ and
by both Alfonse D'Amato and his challenger, Charles Schumer, in the
New York Senate race last year. But simply because both Democrats
and Republicans have used the soft-money loophole to run campaign
ads throughout the country does not make it right.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law imposes ceilings on campaign contributions to
presidential, Senate and House races of $1,000 for individuals and
$5,000 for political action committees. The soft-money loophole
tapping unlimited sums for issue ads would be closed by campaign
finance reform legislation that has passed the House twice but has
been blocked in the Senate. Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats say
they favor such legislation but do not want to stop the use of soft
money as long as their Republican opponents keep up the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal solution would be for both Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani
to renounce the use of soft money. The mayor's campaign initially
hinted this week that it would take legal action against the first
lady's ads, but then indicated that it would not do so. That may be
a signal that the Republicans plan to engage in the same practice,
though probably next year. The Republican Senate Campaign Committee
has clearly indicated its intention to supply soft money for
Giuliani's campaign as it heats up. For now, however, the mayor is
showing commendable restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Mrson already faces the task of explaining to New Yorkers
why they should vote for someone who has never lived in the state.
She is going to make that job harder if she insists on importing
the soft-money abuses that marred the 1996 presidential campaign. A
progressive candidate has an obligation to provide a worthy example
in campaign fund-raising and spending.

EDITORIAL: HOME LEAVE FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 11
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around the world as an employee of the State
Department has an adventurous sound to it _ the intrepid American
facing daunting challenges abroad. That is why the news about Y2K
furloughs from our embassies in the former Soviet Union sounds like
such a faint-hearted idea. At American outposts in Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus and Moldova, non-essential employees have been told that
they can go to Washington over the New Year's holidays if they are
nervous about what mischief foreign computers will cause as their
time mechanisms shift from 1999 to the year 2000. The cost of
sending American employees to the nation's capital on Y2K leave,
according to estimates given to Michael Gordon of The Times, ranges
from $1.25 million to $8 million, depending on how many of the 800
authorized to go actually decide to take advantage of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Such a grand expense for employee safety might make sense if the
real fear is another Chernobyl or an accidental nuclear weapons
explosion or some computer glitch that releases the deadly ebola
virus. But these possibilities have been deemed virtually nil, or
at least no more likely than usual in countries where the worst
possibilities always seem to loiter darkly on the horizon. American
experts set up a Y2K stability center some time ago to double-check
computers operating Russia's nuclear warning systems, weaponry and
command and control centers. The science adviser to the American
Embassy in Moscow investigated a broad range of potential year-end
hazards and decided that, at the worst, Y2K problems would disrupt
electricity and phones for a short while. That means American
embassies would have to run on their own generators, with wattage
rationed until experts could repair any befuddled computers.
</P>
<P>
   As news of a potential diplomatic exodus spread, the State
Department spokesman James Rubin downplayed the offering of home
leave in those four countries, suggesting that maybe only a few
dozen employees would opt to return for New Year's. He even
surmised that emptying out the embassies might make room there for
ordinary Americans, who number 10,000 in Moscow alone, to take
refuge if they are stranded without heat during such a winter
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The run-for-home policy, based on worst-case scenarios that fall
far short of some accidental Armageddon, has baffled diplomats at
other postings around the world. An American diplomat in Russia
suggested that, if the Y2K crisis is defined as a mere power
outage, it is Y2K every day or so in Vladivostok.

TREASON CHARGE FOR PAKISTAN'S OUSTED PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page)  (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Almost a month after he was ousted from power
in a swift bloodless coup, the deposed prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, has been charged with hijacking and kidnapping for what
military officials said was his treasonous refusal to allow a plane
carrying the army chief to land at an airport in the port city of
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Sharif and other officials charged in the case
could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Sharif, which became known Thursday morning,
are at the heart of the armed forces' justifica4ion for the Oct. 12
coup and revolve around the still murky events that precipitated
the military takeover. The charges were leveled by the military in
a formal complaint to the police, who will now undertake an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the coup, the army chief, Gen. Pervaiz
Musharraf, and other military officials, have maintained that
Sharif endangered the life of the general and about 200 passengers
on his commercial flight by refusing the jet aircraft permission to
land.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, the prime minister had announced through the
state news agency that he had fired the army chief while Musharraf
was in the air returning from an official visit to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharif's action immediately set off an apparently well-oiled
coup. As the general's commercial flight approached the Karachi
airport, military officials say that his commercial Pakistan
International Airlines flight, carrying about 200 passengers was
denied permission to land. They have said the Pakistan
International Airlines plane had only seven minutes worth of fuel
left by the time the military seized control of the airport and
allowed it to land.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has been under house arrest since the coup and has not
been allowed to speak to reporters or visiting international
dignitaries. The military has yet to offer its proof of the prime
minister's personal involvement in the air traffic control
decisions about the plane's landing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States on Wednesday appealed to the new military
rulers of Pakistan to guarantee Sharif's legal rights. ``We have
continued to raise our concerns with Pakistani authorities about
former Prime Minister Sharif's well-being and our concern he be
accorded due process,'' said the State Department spokesman, James
Foley.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have also called for a return to democracy in
Pakistan, but Musharraf has adamantly refused to give any timetable
for new elections. And the general said in a recent news conference
that Sharif would have his chance to defend himself when he went on
trial, suggesting that he may not be allowed to speak beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   In a major televised address to the nation on Oct. 17,
Musharraf, who declared himself Pakistan's chief executive,
described himself as having taken over in highly unusual
circumstances ``not of my making'' and thanked the armed forces for
``spontaneously'' intervening to ensure the flight's safe arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would believe that the chief of the army staff, having
represented Pakistan in Sri Lanka, upon his return was denied
landing in his own country and instead circumstances were created
which would have forced our plane either to land in India or
crash?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials were also accused of conspiring with Sharif on
the day of the coup. They include G. Ali Shah, a former government
adviser; Shahid Haqqan Abbasi, former director of Pakistan's
national airline; Rana Maqbool, former police official in Sindh,
and A. Chaudhry, former director general of the Civil Aviation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the incident at the airport, Gen. Musharraf
declared a state of emergency, suspended the constitution and the
Parliament and assumed sweeping authority to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no reliable polls to gauge public sentiment,
there has been no outpouring of public support for the ousted prime
minister, who had been tarnished by accusations of corruption and
autocratic rule. Military officials have also said that Sharif, a
wealthy industrialist, may be charged in connection with the
failure of his family business to repay huge loans to state banks.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has promised that he will go after all the high-level
officials and business people who have stolen public money _ and
has said the real crack down will begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   And he has set an extraordinarily ambitious domestic agenda for
himself, saying he will revive the country's ailing economy,
restore harmony among the rivalrous provinces and clean up the
pervasive corruption and incompetence in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Until he achieves his goals, he has said, he will not be ready
to call new elections.

 (SUBS to update. Grafs 1-4 are new, replacing the original lede
graf. Beyond graf 14, a considerable amount of out-of-date material
has been deleted.) CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE NEAR A DEAL ON(lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress and the White House came closer to striking a budget
deal Wednesday night, reaching a tentative agreement on spending
for education, but still arguing over the environment, abortion and
back dues the United States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they would compromise on President Clinton's
demand for $1.4 billion to hire new teachers to reduce class sizes
in public schools. The Republicans had offered $1.2 billion for
school districts to spend mostly as they please. Splitting their
differences, the two sides agreed to spend $1.3 billion, dedicating
20 percent of the money to training teachers rather than hiring new
ones. In a concession to Republicans, the White House agreed to let
Congress closely monitor the progress of the program, a senior
White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Two major policy issues remain, beyond the all-but-settled
education deal. One is the $926 million in U.N. dues, which will
not be paid until a separate dispute is solved. Republicans want no
federal money to flow to international organizations that lobby for
changes in abortion laws overseas and have chained the two issues
together.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, Republican senators have pushed for favors for
the oil, gas, mining, ranching and timber industries that the White
House and environmentalists oppose. These issues, which the
environmentalist are using to challenge Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign, remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, no serious disputes over money remained. The
Republicans have agreed to roughly $3.2 billion in White House
requests for new spending for a variety of programs, a senior
Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert said an agreement on the budget could be
reached rapidly. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, showed less confidence in a quick deal. He said the
Senate would schedule no votes until Wednesday, the day that the
newest stop-gap resolution keeping the government open without a
real budget expires.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress pushing to leave for the year, the day began with
Hastert's returning a telephone call from President Clinton, who
left a message for him Tuesday night, asking to talk about the
budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker asked the president to give a little in the talks.
His aides said Hastert told the president that ``it's time for your
side to break loose'' and compromise on the intractable policy
issues that have stalled the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The two discussed the issues dividing them, laying out their
differences and voicing a desire to reach agreement, especially on
the teachers issue. ``Both sides suggested that an agreement could
and should be reached,'' a senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert then rallied his Republican troops at a closed meeting
in the Capitol, calling on them to hang together, stay in town and
vote on the still-unwritten bills.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to break for a Veterans Day weekend, return next
week and then quickly end this session, every day of which brings a
new Democratic attack accusing them of failing to agree to measures
for gun control, health care and overhauling campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats stepped up the pressure with a new television
advertisement. The 30-second ad shows a slow panorama of a
graveyard as an announcer intones, ``Congressional Republicans are
killing initiatives for working families and sending them to their
legislative graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican rank and file were restless before the meeting
with Hastert. ``I want to get out of here,'' Hastert said,
according to his staff and several Republican members at the
meeting. ``You want to get out of here. But we're not going to cut
a bad deal to get out of here.'' The members applauded him,
according to those present.
</P>
<P>
   So the Republicans went to work with their Democratic
counterparts in Congress and the White House budget director, Jack
Lew, trying to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to put the pieces of a grand deal together
all day,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee. The appropriations committees
control the 13 spending bills in the budget, five of which are
still unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   The budget talks have been tense, participants said, sometimes
confrontational, sometimes congenial. ``Like an average marriage,
it has its ups and down,'' a key participant said. The cordial
Young, the crusty Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and the calm but contentious Lew have
talked for nearly 100 hours since Sunday. Arguments have broken
out, but the talks have never broken down.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Hastert ordered members to return at noon on
Friday and to be ready to pass the spending bills that night. The
chamber rumbled with muted groans as the majority leader, Dick
Armey of Texas, made the announcement Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Between the $3.2 billion agreed to by the Republicans and
additional spending they have added to the bills, Congress and the
White House will need at least $6 in spending cuts to make the
budget balance and keep it from dipping into the Social Security
surplus. The Republicans will face a rank-and-file rebellion if the
spending bills touch the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans plan to try to pass all the bills at once, in an
omnibus package. The bills still have not been rewritten to reflect
the negotiations that have passed between the White House and
Congress, and among Republicans and Democrats in conferences. Each
may contain new potential pitfalls added in closed-door conferences
that could threaten their passage when the House takes them up, and
the Senate takes them up, no earlier than Wednesday.

MCCAIN ON TRAIL BATTLES OWN PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
It's not enough that John McCain, if he wins the GOP presidential
nomi nation, will take on the Democratic Party in the 2000
campaign.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes right now, the Arizona senator must feel he is taking
on his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which holds its Republi can primary on Feb. 22, the
same day as Arizona, offers a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner,
goes marching into Michigan Nov. 11 for Veterans Day campaign
appearances, he will be flanked by a virtual army of the state's
top Republican brass, from the fiercely loyal governor on down.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when McCain was campaigning in Michigan on Nov. 10,
not a single member of Congress or the state Legislature was in his
traveling party, and Republican Gov. John Engler ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   During his travels, McCain sat in the back of a sport utility
vehicle with a couple of advisers and some ham-and-cheese
sandwiches, McCain strategist Mike Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, one of the advisers would hitch a ride with the
press corps so that a reporter could slide in next to the
candidate. McCain will shortly begin rounding up a Michi gan staff.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for underdogs to lag in organizing staffs and
raising money in unfamiliar states, but McCain may face a greater
challenge than second-place candidates do his torically because
Bush has raised record amounts of money and locked up so much of
the GOP machinery. This has sometimes made McCain feel like a
stranger in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   While polls show him gaining steadily in New Hampshire, whose
primary is Feb. 1, McCain knows he must now begin establishing foot
holds for the second round of primaries if he is to stay in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Gov. George Pataki has endorsed Bush,
McCain's name may not even appear on the March 7 primary ballot in
all parts of the state because, according to the New York Daily
News, ``Byzantine'' primary rules work against GOP candidates who
are not backed by the state party.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Bush has won the endorsements of Engler, five of
the six Republicans in the Michigan congressional delegation (Steve
Forbes has the other), and the lion's share of the state GOP
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   While the significance of such en dorsements is open to
question, they can at the least create an aura of Bush as a
favorite adopted son.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Engler sought to isolate McCain from the state's
Republican infrastructure, he has suggested in the press that
McCain's hot temper might not be suitable for the presi dency.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the governor respects John McCain, in politics we take
sides,'' said Engler spokesman John Trus cott. ``We line up behind
our person, and the governor has chosen who he is going to
support.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain seems undaunted by having the odds stacked against
him, that's because it's a role he has played often. He and his
staff wear his underdog status as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, McCain has chal lenged the leadership of his
party in landmark, and ultimately losing, bat tles over his
anti-tobacco and cam paign-finance reform bills. He is accustomed
to waging wars against the heaviest of hitters. Indeed, those
struggles have become part of his campaign persona, along with his
history as a prisoner of war during Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his staff say they are not fazed by Bush's political
artillery in Michigan, New York or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly intimidated,'' said Murphy, who grew up
in the Detroit area and has advised Engler and Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., on previous campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Governor Bush has all the generals and all
the admirals in Michigan and every where else, but McCain has got a
better message,'' Murphy said. ``It makes for a great head table at
the fund-raising dinner having all that brass, but it doesn't
necessarily make for the best campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spread himself too thin, McCain is focusing on the
early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, hoping to
seize momentum from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John McCain breaks out in New Hampshire and South Carolina,
he's going to ride a media tidal wave right through the next round
of primary states,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications
director. ``If he's leading the network news each night, George
Bush can have the endorsements of the county supervisors and the
city council men.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ballenger, editor of the Inside Michigan Politics
newsletter, said free publicity may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were McCain and his people, that's what you would be
banking on at this point. And the only problem is that there's not
much time to take advantage on the ground of that kind of media
tidal wave that everybody talks about,'' Ballenger said. All of the
key early primaries are compressed into February.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy said the McCain cam paign is ``going to show up with
a better message, a better qualified candidate and a million
dollars. We're going to have a real Michigan campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the campaign won a surprise endorsement Nov. 10 when
a state senator, Joe Schwartz, ``en dorsed McCain on the spot''
after a town hall meeting in Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to good press, McCain is counting on the structure
of the Michigan GOP primary to benefit him. It is open to all
registered voters, not just Republicans. Mc Cain's message of
``taking back'' the government from special interests has had
appeal for independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Democrats will stage low-profile caucuses, but not
until later in the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure Bush, all things being equal, would wish that there
was a Democratic primary going on to keep independents and
Democrats attracted to that and stay out of the Republican primary
and let his organization and his money carry the day for him,''
Ballenger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's not going to have that luxury.'' &QL;

JOSEPH DIMONA, 76, WRITER; CO-AUTHOR OF HALDEMAN MEMOIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph DiMona, a professional author and screen and stage writer
who collaborated on the Watergate memoir of the imprisoned former
White House chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, died on Saturday at his
home in Brentwood, Calif. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He had been battling liver cancer for two years, said his wife,
Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 Haldeman book, ``The Ends of Power,'' spent nine weeks
on the New York Times best-seller list, including two weeks at No.
1. DiMona was also a credited co-writer of ``Frank Costello: Prime
Minister of the Underworld'' (1974) by Costello's lawyer George
Wolf, and of ``Coroner'' (1983) and the sequel, ``Coroner at
Large'' (1986) by Thomas T. Noguchi, the flamboyant former Los
Angeles medical examiner. He also wrote ``Great Court-Martial
Cases'' (1972).
</P>
<P>
   A jovial socializer and longtime New Yorker who held court at
P.J. Clarke's and Elaine's and entertained frequently at his Sutton
Place apartment, DiMona also wrote four novels, ``70 Sutton Place''
(1972), and the thrillers ``Last Man at Arlington'' (1973), ``The
Benedict Arnold Connection'' (1977) and ``To the Eagle's Nest''
(1978). ``Last Man at Arlington,'' about an ex-Green Beret stalking
former members of the Kennedy administration, was optioned for the
movies but never made it to the screen. His first book was a
collection of short stories, ``Husbands Who Love Their Wives Are
the Best'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   DiMona earned large fees writing documentary films and wrote the
screen adaptation for ``The Incredible Limpet,'' a partly animated
1964 feature starring Don Knotts as a man who turns into a fish and
helps win World War II. In the 1960s he teamed up with the
burlesque star Ann Corio to write material for the long-running
show ``This Was Burlesque,'' which moved from off Broadway to
Broadway and toured widely. The pair also collaborated on a photo
book, ``The History of Burlesque in the U.S.'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Born in Haddonfield, N.J., DiMona attended Duke University,
where he wrote for campus publications and became the head
cheerleader, earning the nickname ``Jumping Joe.'' He interrupted
his education to enlist in the Navy in 1942, seeing action on
Okinawa and throughout the Pacific. After the war, he returned to
Duke to graduate and received a law degree at George Washington
University Law School. While there he worked as a radio announcer
for the Washington Senators and Washington Redskins and as a copy
boy at The Washington Post. He passed the bar but never practiced
law, preferring to write.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1956 after his first
marriage ended in divorce, DiMona is survived by a son, Joseph, of
New York; a daughter, Darcy Mander of Rome, and four grandchildren.

DAVID SCHICKELE, 62, FILMMAKER AND WITH BROTHER A PARODIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   David Schickele, a film director and musician, died on Oct. 31
at his home in San Francisco. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was was brain cancer, said his brother, the composer
and musical humorist Peter Schickele.
</P>
<P>
   Schickele was born in Ames, Iowa, in March 1937 and grew up in
Fargo, N.D. He began his musical studies on the violin when he was
9, and later switched to viola, which became his principal
instrument. He was an avid chamber music player, but he also shared
his brother's interest in musical parody. Influenced by Spike
Jones, they formed a band called Jerky Jems and His Balmy Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   David Schickele also helped create the P.D.Q. Bach routine that
has been his brother's comedy vehicle since 1965. In 1953 the
Schickele brothers and Ernest Lloyd, a friend who played the cello,
made a home recording of a work they called the ``Sanka'' Cantata
(a parody of Bach's ``Coffee'' Cantata). When they had a private
acetate disc pressed, David Schickele drew a humorous cover that
listed the composer as P.D.Q. Bach and the artists as Sir Osbronk
Chapie, Bart., with Chamber Group. On the recording, which was
released in 1996 as part of a boxed set, ``The Dreaded P.D.Q. Bach
Collection,'' David Schickele provides the spoken historical
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation from Swarthmore College in 1958, David
Schickele worked as a freelance violist in New York. At the same
time, he sought to learn about film by working as an apprentice to
several filmmakers. He briefly gave up both music and film to work
in the Peace Corps _ from 1961 to 1963 he taught English at the
University of Nigeria _ but when he returned he devoted himself
mainly to film.
</P>
<P>
   Schickele's first feature film, ``Bushman,'' about an African
man who moves to New York and must integrate his personal, tribal
and racial identities into his new life, won the Best First Feature
prize at the Chicago International Film Festival. He also made a
documentary about the Peace Corps, ``Give Me a Riddle'' (1964). He
completed his last film, ``Tuscarora,'' in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother, Schickele is survived by his wife,
Gail; a son, Graham Spencer Nighttrain Schickele of San Francisco,
and a daughter, Laura Bissonette of Kalamazoo, Mich.

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE NEAR A DEAL ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to restore dateline) (lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress and the White House came closer to striking a budget
deal Wednesday night, reaching a tentative agreement on spending
for education, but still arguing over the environment, abortion and
back dues the United States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they would compromise on President Clinton's
demand for $1.4 billion to hire new teachers to reduce class sizes
in public schools. The Republicans had offered $1.2 billion for
school districts to spend mostly as they please. Splitting their
differences, the two sides agreed to spend $1.3 billion, dedicating
20 percent of the money to training teachers rather than hiring new
ones. In a concession to Republicans, the White House agreed to let
Congress closely monitor the progress of the program, a senior
White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Two major policy issues remain, beyond the all-but-settled
education deal. One is the $926 million in U.N. dues, which will
not be paid until a separate dispute is solved. Republicans want no
federal money to flow to international organizations that lobby for
changes in abortion laws overseas and have chained the two issues
together.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, Republican senators have pushed for favors for
the oil, gas, mining, ranching and timber industries that the White
House and environmentalists oppose. These issues, which the
environmentalist are using to challenge Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign, remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, no serious disputes over money remained. The
Republicans have agreed to roughly $3.2 billion in White House
requests for new spending for a variety of programs, a senior
Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert said an agreement on the budget could be
reached rapidly. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, showed less confidence in a quick deal. He said the
Senate would schedule no votes until Wednesday, the day that the
newest stop-gap resolution keeping the government open without a
real budget expires.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress pushing to leave for the year, the day began with
Hastert's returning a telephone call from President Clinton, who
left a message for him Tuesday night, asking to talk about the
budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker asked the president to give a little in the talks.
His aides said Hastert told the president that ``it's time for your
side to break loose'' and compromise on the intractable policy
issues that have stalled the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The two discussed the issues dividing them, laying out their
differences and voicing a desire to reach agreement, especially on
the teachers issue. ``Both sides suggested that an agreement could
and should be reached,'' a senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert then rallied his Republican troops at a closed meeting
in the Capitol, calling on them to hang together, stay in town and
vote on the still-unwritten bills.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to break for a Veterans Day weekend, return next
week and then quickly end this session, every day of which brings a
new Democratic attack accusing them of failing to agree to measures
for gun control, health care and overhauling campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats stepped up the pressure with a new television
advertisement. The 30-second ad shows a slow panorama of a
graveyard as an announcer intones, ``Congressional Republicans are
killing initiatives for working families and sending them to their
legislative graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican rank and file were restless before the meeting
with Hastert. ``I want to get out of here,'' Hastert said,
according to his staff and several Republican members at the
meeting. ``You want to get out of here. But we're not going to cut
a bad deal to get out of here.'' The members applauded him,
according to those present.
</P>
<P>
   So the Republicans went to work with their Democratic
counterparts in Congress and the White House budget director, Jack
Lew, trying to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to put the pieces of a grand deal together
all day,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee. The appropriations committees
control the 13 spending bills in the budget, five of which are
still unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   The budget talks have been tense, participants said, sometimes
confrontational, sometimes congenial. ``Like an average marriage,
it has its ups and down,'' a key participant said. The cordial
Young, the crusty Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and the calm but contentious Lew have
talked for nearly 100 hours since Sunday. Arguments have broken
out, but the talks have never broken down.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Hastert ordered members to return at noon on
Friday and to be ready to pass the spending bills that night. The
chamber rumbled with muted groans as the majority leader, Dick
Armey of Texas, made the announcement Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Between the $3.2 billion agreed to by the Republicans and
additional spending they have added to the bills, Congress and the
White House will need at least $6 in spending cuts to make the
budget balance and keep it from dipping into the Social Security
surplus. The Republicans will face a rank-and-file rebellion if the
spending bills touch the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans plan to try to pass all the bills at once, in an
omnibus package. The bills still have not been rewritten to reflect
the negotiations that have passed between the White House and
Congress, and among Republicans and Democrats in conferences. Each
may contain new potential pitfalls added in closed-door conferences
that could threaten their passage when the House takes them up, and
the Senate takes them up, no earlier than Wednesday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators and Clinton
administration officials announced Wednesday night that they had
reached a tentative agreement on legislation to restore some of the
money cut from Medicare in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts provoked howls of protest from the health care
industry, which sent dozens of lobbyists to Capitol Hill to
campaign for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the chairman of the Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Health, and Chris Jennings, the health policy
coordinator at the White House, said the deal would increase
Medicare payments to most hospitals, nursing homes, health
maintenance organizations and home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the agreement would increase Medicare spending by
$12 billion over the next five years. That represents 7 percent to
10 percent of the amount cut by the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would gradually reduce huge disparities in what
Medicare pays to train doctors in different parts of the country.
As a result, many teaching hospitals in New York City would lose
money, though the losses would be smaller than under earlier
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from negotiations Wednesday night, Thomas said: ``We
and the administration were partners in the Balanced Budget Act two
years ago. Now we are partners in knocking the rough edges off that
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said: ``This is an honorable compromise. It lays a
foundation for more significant Medicare reforms next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as lawmakers reached agreement on Medicare, they found
themselves stymied on another health care measure. A bill to
provide health insurance to hundreds of thousands of disabled
people, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House
and the Senate, became snarled Wednesday in a tangle of partisan
disagreements, raising doubts about whether it would become law
before Congress adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Different versions of this bill sailed through the Senate, 99-0,
and the House, 412-9, earlier this year. But negotiations bogged
down on the question of how to pay the comparatively modest cost,
less than $1 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained Wednesday that Republicans would offset the
cost of aid for the disabled by cutting housing and other programs
for people with low and moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
   People with disabilities have strongly supported the bill, which
would allow them to keep Medicaid and Medicare coverage after they
return to work. Under current law, they often lose such coverage if
they earn a significant amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the disabled and Democratic senators, including
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the minority leader, said they might oppose the bill if Republicans
financed it by cutting other social programs. ``We cannot support
any legislation that would advance the lives of people with
disabilities on the backs of poor and middle-class Americans,''
said Pat Wright, a lawyer at the Disability Rights Education and
Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that President Clinton was free to suggest
other ways of covering the cost, but that he had not done so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In talks on Medicare, two powerful New Yorkers _ Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, and
Rep. Charles Rangel, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means
Committee _ tried to protect the Medicare payments that New York
hospitals receive for training doctors. Hospitals like Beth Israel
in Manhattan and Montefiore in the Bronx get three or four times as
much for each trainee as hospitals in Los Angeles and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately Thomas prevailed in his insistence that such
disparities must be reduced. Under the agreement reached Wednesday
night, Medicare will move toward a standard national payment to
teaching hospitals for each doctor in training.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare now pays a different amount for each hospital, based on
its historic costs. Under Wednesday night's agreement, the
highest-paid hospitals _ those with payments more than 40 percent
above the national average for each hospital resident _ will not
get any allowance for inflation in 2001 or 2002. And in the next
three years, their payments will rise two percentage points less
than the Consumer Price Index, while other teaching hospitals get a
full allowance for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas praised Moynihan and Rangel, saying the two men had
persuaded New York hospitals that they needed to be ``part of the
solution'' this year. ``In the past,'' Thomas said, ``there had
been a degree of stonewalling,'' as New Yorkers resisted any cuts
in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is colored by the politics surrounding Hillary Rodham
Clinton's expected run for the Senate next year. Republicans said
they did not want to be too generous to New York hospitals because
they feared that she might get political credit for securing such
largess.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that the likely Republican candidate for senator,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, had ``zeroed in on this
issue to make sure New York hospitals would be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as she might like to fight for New York hospitals, Mrs.
Clinton could not openly do so on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers of both
parties said she would have alienated Republicans if she had tried
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he believed
Republicans wanted to ``embarrass Mrs. Clinton by getting the White
House to go along with legislation that would be devastating'' to
New York hospitals.

MIDWEST GRAIN PRODUCTS REPORTS SMALL INCREASE IN PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Midwest Grain Products Inc. on Wednesday reported a
small increase in its first-quarter profit. The increase was 13
percent from a year ago, but it wasn't large in terms of dollars
because earnings were relatively weak in both periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Atchison, Kan., maker of starch, protein and alcohol
products said it made $751,000 in the three months that ended Sept.
30. It earned $666,000 in the same period a year ago. Profit was 8
cents a share in the quarter, compared with 7 cents a share a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter, which began the company's fiscal year
2000, was $55 million, up from $52 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Grain said increased demand for wheat gluten and
specialty wheat proteins and starches helped offset a weak market
for alcohol products. Lower grain costs also helped earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat gluten imports from the European Union are restricted
under a three-year quota that entered its second year in June.
Midwest Grain said a ``huge wave'' of European Union gluten in June
filled the available quota for the ensuing 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wave of imports hurt Midwest Grain's first quarter,
the announcement said conditions should allow the company to
strengthen its position in gluten markets during the rest of its
fiscal year.

EX-SENATOR IS CONFIRMED AS A LOGJAM IS BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update, expand and totally rewrite)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Miss., N.C., N.H., N.J., Ky.)  (lh) 
 By DAVID STOUT and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun and Adm. Joseph
Prueher won Senate confirmation as ambassadors Wednesday night as
Democrats and Republicans reached an accord that cleared the way
for approval of dozens of envoys and federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, who will become ambassador to New Zealand,
and Prueher, who will represent the United States in China, were
the most notable beneficiaries of an easing of tensions on Capitol
Hill over nominations. Both nominees had faced opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges were also confirmed Wednesday, and others were
all but assured of approval in the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like the breaking of a logjam,'' said one
congressional aide who has been closely involved in the
long-running nomination disputes between Republicans and Democrats.
The extent of the accord, and whether it would lead to a period of
better relations on Capitol Hill, was not clear Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The thaw over the nominations was part of an agreement in which
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, agreed to
bring to votes no later than March 15 the nominations of two
Californians, Marsha L. Berzon and Richard A. Paez, to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats in return have agreed to drop
objections to some nominations favored by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun was approved on a 96-2 vote in the only
nomination that produced a roll call. Voting against her were two
Republicans: Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, who
defeated her in her 1998 bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun's confirmation had elements of a satisfying
personal victory. Helms had threatened to block her nomination,
perhaps because he was still miffed over a 1993 confrontation on
the Senate floor with Ms. Moseley-Braun over use of the Confederate
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Helms relented when it became clear that Republican leaders as
well as Democrats were siding with Ms. Moseley-Braun, and that the
episode might become a civil rights issue. Ms. Moseley-Braun is the
only black woman ever to serve in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Her new duties will include representing the United States in
Samoa as well as New Zealand. ``Everything I have heard about these
countries confirms that they are beautiful places with lovely
people,'' Ms. Moseley-Braun said after the vote. ``I look very much
forward to getting to know them, getting to know their countries,
and doing my best to represent America.''
</P>
<P>
   Prueher, who is retired from the Navy, had run into brief
opposition from Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., who had expressed
concerns that he was too friendly with China.
</P>
<P>
   As for judicial posts, the breakthrough apparently ends the
possibility that many would go unfilled until after the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, had
pressed hard for confirmation of Paez and Ms. Berzon, who have been
waiting for four years and two years, respectively, for
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Six judicial nominees were confirmed by voice vote Wednesday
night. Two are black and one is Hispanic, and four are female.
Democrats have asserted in recent months that Republicans have been
slow to confirm minority candidates and women. One of those
approved Wednesday night was Faith Hochberg, a former U.S. attorney
for New Jersey, to a district court seat in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Other ambassadors confirmed Wednesday night were Martin Indyk
for a second tour in Israel; Charles Manatt as ambassador to the
Dominican Republic; and Delano Lewis as ambassador to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dropped a hold on a nominee backed by Lott: that of
Glenn McCullough, mayor of Tupelo, Miss., to the board of the
Tennessee Valley Authority. He was confirmed for a seat on the TVA,
as was Skila Harris of Kentucky.

 Different ages, same workplace irritants  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Here's a top 10 list of what drives workers crazy. I
picked it up at a seminar for human resource and diversity
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers hate:
</P>
<P>
   10. Tiny raises.
</P>
<P>
   9. Insincere thanks.
</P>
<P>
   8. Being thrown into jobs without the necessary qualifications
or training.
</P>
<P>
   7. Disorganized, messy workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bosses who share the stress of visits from their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Do it because I said so'' management.
</P>
<P>
   4. Supervisors who overlook unacceptable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   3. Management that ignores ideas from employees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Failure to give consistent feedback or recognition when it's
due.
</P>
<P>
   1. Micromanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Does that hit your button?
</P>
<P>
   How old are you?
</P>
<P>
   According to a training video, ``The X Factor: Managing and
Motivating Generation X,'' that's the pet peeve list for Gen X, the
work set younger than baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, I like that list. And, judging from other nodding heads
at the seminar, so did my fellow boomers. The older-than-boomer
bunch was bobbing in agreement, too.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that meeting the needs of Gen X in the workplace
is, or at least should be, the same as meeting the needs of
everybody else. The only difference is that Gen Xers have been
brave enough to broadcast their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers and boomer-plus workers were too busy keeping their
noses clean and being loyal to employers. Oops. Too late. Many
found that the objects of their devotion didn't return, much less
reward, that loyalty when it came time to make important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Gen Xers, who grew up watching their parents regroup and
rebuild their work lives, are left to insist, ``You need me. You
need my skills. So here's what I want. I want you to recognize me _
and pay me well _ for doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Raines, a consultant who specializes in Gen X research
and whose video we viewed, says workers in their 20s and early 30s
are blunt about their wants. They say:
</P>
<P>
   - Appreciate me and show it. My regular paycheck is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   - Give me flexible hours so I can accommodate my outside
interests. Work is not the only important thing in my life.
</P>
<P>
   - Train me. I need portable, marketable skills to take from job
to job.
</P>
<P>
   - Listen to me and involve me in planning and decision-making
that affects me. I will work better if I feel ``ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   - Walk your talk. I can spot phonies and despise them.
</P>
<P>
   - Lighten up. Work can be fun, even under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once again: Does the list strike a chord?
</P>
<P>
   How old are you?
</P>
<P>
   Pinning labels on groups, be they segmented by age, race, gender
or ethnicity, is a convenient but dangerous thing. Beware of
building monoliths. It's not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   But if Raines, or any other consultant, wants to share basic and
sound workplace advice for any group, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Gen Xers, who are said to be good at handling change,
comfortable with technology, not intimidated by authority, and
creative, can help create dynamic, rewarding workplaces for
themselves, then maybe the rest of us can wade in their ripples.

COUPLE WINS EBAY AUCTION FOR BMW SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE

   OLATHE, Kan. _ There are so many ways to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Dawn and Brad Fire of Olathe chose to plunk down
$159,100 for a new BMW X5 Sports Activity Vehicle. That's almost
three times as much as the vehicle's suggested retail price.
</P>
<P>
   Now the young couple will be the first customers in the country
to jet around in BMW's latest.
</P>
<P>
   But the two, who value their privacy, didn't buy the X5 to stand
out. They liked the fact that BMW was going to donate all the money
they bid in an Internet auction to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother on my mother's side died of breast cancer when
Mom was 10,'' Dawn Fire, 27, said Wednesday. ``I've grown up
listening to my mom lecture me and my sister about (awareness).''
</P>
<P>
   BMW of North America, which regularly raises money for the
foundation, was pleased with the way the 10-day auction went,
spokeswoman Karen Vonder Meulen said. She said it was the first
time BMW had tried auctioning a vehicle for charity on eBay
(www.ebay.com).
</P>
<P>
   BMW says the X5 is not a sport-utility vehicle because it isn't
designed to haul anything big _ just people and skis and the like.
It will go on sale to the public in mid-December for a suggested
retail price, with the extras the Fires will get, of $57,105.
</P>
<P>
   The Fires should have their X5 _ in Titanium Silver Metallic _
by early December.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fire, 29, is a software engineer who works out of their
home. He likes the BMW sports car he drives, but Dawn Fire is sure
he'll be interested in the X5.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was looking forward to checking out the vehicle's
computerized navigation system. It tells drivers who plug in an
address how to get to where they are going. If you make a wrong
turn, it tells you.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband gets lost all the time,'' she said. ``I thought
that would be a great feature for him to have.''

BANK OF AMERICA REGIONAL HEAD TO RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City banker and civic leader William
C. Nelson will retire in March as president of the Bank of America
Kansas City Region.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 62, will be succeeded by Clyde F. Wendel, a regional
executive in Bank of America's Private Bank in Kansas City and a
veteran officer with Bank of America and its predecessor companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says he is ready to commit more time to his already
intensive civic and political involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be happy until we get a downtown arena,''
Nelson said in reference to a big item on his civic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also said he intended to take active roles in upcoming
state political campaigns, and he hinted at the possibility of
someday running for office himself.
</P>
<P>
   David Darnell, Bank of America Midwest president based in St.
Louis, said Wendel, 51, would spend the next five months working
closely with Nelson, whom Darnell described as ``an exemplary
banker and a distinguished community leader in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendel came to Kansas City in 1997. He has been responsible for
the bank's private banking operations in Kansas City, Topeka and
Wichita. The private bank's clients primarily are individuals with
at least $1 million to $1.5 million of investable assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in banking for 30 years and in Kansas City for just
over two of them,'' Wendel said, ``but my wife and I have never
felt so welcomed by business leaders and community leaders
anywhere. I couldn't be happier with this assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendel moved to Kansas City from St. Louis, where he said he
spent 14 years participating in volunteer, nonprofit and community
activities.
</P>
<P>
   When Bank of America and NationsBank, Nelson's previous
organization, combined operations last year, bank analysts
predicted management changes, as with any merger. Bank officials
said this announcement, though, was ``totally Bill's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leaving is the result of a successful merger transition,''
Nelson said. ``I feel comfortable that it's time for new leadership
to run with our new capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was the top executive at Boatmen's First National Bank of
Kansas City from 1990 to 1997 and then was the regional head of
NationsBank after Boatmen's became part of NationsBank in 1997. He
moved to Kansas City from Dallas when he joined Boatmen's in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about Kansas City's openness and a lot about
Bill himself that he's been in town for 11 years and has risen to
leadership positions in top community organizations,'' said Pete
Levi, president of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Levi said Nelson would be ``a great elected official'' if he
chooses to get involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a wonderful visionary for the community, a hard worker
and someone who always has the next good idea,'' Levi said. ``For a
businessman, he is particularly good at understanding the process
of government. He has been terrific at representing community
interests on both sides of the state line, and he knows how to
bring people to the table and motivate them to do great things.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to civic observers has been Nelson's role in
the bank's support of minority lending and minority business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Swords, president of Swords Associates Inc., a bank
consulting firm, said Nelson would leave ``big shoes to fill,
especially in his leadership of Community Reinvestment Act
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Swords and others noted that Nelson's intense civic involvement
is remarkable in that he was charged with leading the bank through
years of changes in ownership, name and corporate culture. Some of
those decisions were difficult and involved changes in customer
focus, real estate and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Don Borgman, executive vice president and head of commercial
banking for the Bank of America Kansas City Region, said people
within the bank were proud of Nelson's leadership record. They also
``definitely think Clyde is a great person to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is just beginning to understand our capabilities
and resources as Bank of America,'' Borgman said, pointing to the
bank's international scope. But, he added, the commitment to
community development will remain equally strong.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he intended to carry that commitment with him into
``a very active retirement.'' He plans to continue working with
ministers to develop a youth and family center at 27th Street and
Prospect Avenue, among other initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   He also is chairman of the Greater Kansas City Community
Foundation and a vice chairman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber
of Commerce. Through the chamber, he plans to remain the driving
force for downtown redevelopment, including a sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also has served as chairman of the Civic Council of
Greater Kansas City, an organization of the area's top business
leaders, and the Kansas City Area Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those influential community groups, Nelson and
his wife, Barbara, have led or served on the boards of many
philanthropic and cultural organizations. And he has earned
repeated recognition from minority groups for his involvement in
their organizations and for the lending policies of his bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally committed to staying here and being involved in
Kansas City,'' Nelson said. ``Our sons have grown up here. They and
we consider this home.''

CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS URGES RECESS APPOINTMENTS FOR JUDGE
NOMINEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Congressional Black Caucus on Wednesday called
on President Clinton to bypass the Senate and use recess
appointments for six African-American judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the president, the caucus said the Senate's
recent party-line rejection of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie
White for a federal judgeship ``left profound doubts about fair and
unbiased treatment'' for minority nominees. It said the White
episode ``had shaken the confidence of the African-American
community'' and others in the confirmation process and ``cast a
racial cloud over the process.''
</P>
<P>
   White's confirmation by the Senate seemed a sure thing until
Sen. Kit Bond, the Missouri Republican who had been his sponsor,
flip-flopped the day of the vote and opposed him. The other
Missouri Republican in the chamber, John Ashcroft, led the
opposition, waging a campaign that charged, among other things,
that White was ``the most anti-death penalty judge.''
</P>
<P>
   White's nomination was defeated 54-45. No Republicans voted for
him.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the caucus said 15 U.S. Supreme Court
justices, including Earl Warren and William Brennan, were recess
appointments. Of the 309 recess appointments made in the nation's
history, the caucus said, the Senate confirmed 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials previously said the administration would
not comment about the possibility of recess appointments, a
constitutional method by which a president can bypass Congress when
it is not in session.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus members said the judicial confirmation process had been
``unusually and inexplicably slow.'' On average, it said Congress
now took 232 days to confirm a judge after his nomination, compared
to 91 days between 1978 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Lopatto, a spokeswoman for the Senate Judiciary
Committee, defended its work. She said that the last Congress
confirmed 101 judicial nominees and that nearly 49 percent were
women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee does not consider race or gender when we are
evaluating nominees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatto said many factors went into the confirmation process and
each could slow the pace, such as weighing the nominee's judicial
temperament, intellect and knowledge of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifetime appointment, and we need to be very
thorough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But caucus members said the slow pace had created judicial
backlogs and delays. In the case of the six African-American
nominees who are still awaiting hearings, the caucus cited
statistics that its members said showed that white judicial
candidates nominated the same day or earlier had few problems
getting hearings and confirmation votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no room or place for the black and brown in this
country?'' asked Donna Christian-Christensen, a Democratic delegate
from the Virgin Islands. ``This is not just about Ronnie White. It
is about the right of African-Americans and other people of color
to have a fair chance at participating in the life of this country
_ in whatever field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopatto said the committee held a hearing for one of the six
black judicial nominees on Wednesday.

OPPOSITION FORMS TO PROPOSAL TO CLOSE KCK MENTAL-HEALTH FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Even before they reach the Kansas Legislature,
state plans to close the Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas
City, Kan., are generating opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal from the Department of Social and Rehabilitation
Services is the latest effort by Gov. Bill Graves' administration
to trim spending in the face of budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Hubbell, an assistant secretary for social and
rehabilitation services, said the plan had been forwarded to the
state Budget Division as part of the agency's recommendations the
governor will use in developing his budget for the 2001 budget
year, which begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``With budget constraints, this is one option we began
discussing,'' Hubbell said. ``I want to stress this is an option
and a recommendation on one budget option that went to the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Mental Health Coalition and the Association of
Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas have begun to rally their
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, they mailed out 13,000 notices of mental
health cuts, including the Rainbow closing, across the state in
hopes of generating opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors and administrators of the Wyandot Mental
Health Center are scheduled to meet Thursday with Wyandotte County
lawmakers to discuss the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all very preliminary,'' said Rep. Rick Rehorn, a
Kansas City, Kan., Democrat whose district includes Rainbow. ``This
is going to be a wild session. Apparently, they are going to give
us an earful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Haley, another Kansas City, Kan., Democrat, said he
had told mental health center officials that ``whatever in my power
I can do to keep it open, I will. I believe the Wyandotte County
delegation feels the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Durbin, the Wyandot center's interim executive director,
complained that the recommended closing was little more than a
``bottom-line'' move on the part of SRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were directed to make a budget cut,'' he said. ``They
made a decision without any input from community providers. There
wasn't any study on the impact in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said area mental health centers are concerned about the
possible closing of Rainbow because they work closely with the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   With Rainbow nearby, centers in Johnson and Wyandotte counties
are able to coordinate community services and support for patients
when they are released. That would be more difficult if patients
were treated at Osawatomie State Hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating Rainbow, which is located near the University of
Kansas Medical Center, would mean the 33 children, adolescents and
adults who now are being treated at the facility would be shifted
to Osawatomie, about 50 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow admits more than 250 patients annually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, David Wiebe, executive director of the Johnson
County Mental Health Center, said having Rainbow in the area
provides easy access for families who wish to remain involved with
their hospitalized relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned that law enforcement agencies would be asked
to transport patients to Osawatomie, and that could result in
mentally ill people being held in county jails ``as officers
realize jail is a more expedient alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiebe said he probably will schedule a meeting with Johnson
County lawmakers to discuss the potential closure.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow employs 120 persons and offers of positions at
Osawatomie probably would be made to about 70 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The facility has a capacity of 60 patients. Although there is
room for more children and adolescents, the 20 beds for adults are
filled.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Director Rosalind Underdahl said that on average,
children and adolescents stay in the facility for 55 days, and
adults stay 22 days. Most of those treated are indigent.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital operates on a budget of about $6.9 million, which
includes state funds of about $1.6 million. Federal dollars make up
most of the facility's funding.
</P>
<P>
   It serves adults from Johnson, Wyandotte, Douglas, Jefferson,
Leavenworth, Jackson, Atchison, Nemaha, Brown and Doniphan
counties. Children and adolescents come from the eastern half of
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that the closing would save about $1.3 million for
the state each year. Hubbell said that would be the savings after
costs for treating the patients at Osawatomie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Legislature approved a Hospital Closure Commission
recommendation that Topeka State Hospital and Winfield State
Hospital and Training Center be closed and treatment shifted to
community mental health centers.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1998, the last patients had been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want SRS to continue to explore all opportunities to
reduce in-patient care and increase community-based services,''
Hubbell said.

AUDITOR'S OFFICE WANTS TO STUDY HANDLING OF CALLS TO ABUSE
HOTLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ How the Missouri Division of Family Services
handles child abuse hot-line calls soon may come under scrutiny by
the Missouri auditor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor Claire McCaskill wants to study the division's response
to hot-line calls statewide by expanding an ongoing audit of the
division. That audit, required by law to be done annually, focuses
on the division's use of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill is expected to outline her plans Thursday in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, division officials announced that a hot-line call
taker was among several employees who made errors in the Larry and
Gary Bass case.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old brothers died in Kansas City last month after
suffering infected burns, starvation and other abuse. Their mother,
Mary Bass, 31, faces child-abuse charges and two counts of
second-degree murder. Authorities also charged the mother's
boyfriend, Tony Dixon, 36, with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The division suspended at least three employees 20 days without
pay for not properly doing their jobs in the Bass case. The person
who received the hot-line call no longer works for the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we will work with the auditor to provide whatever
information she needs,'' said Deb Hendricks, a spokeswoman for the
Missouri Department of Social Services, of which the Division of
Family Services is a part.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill was involved in several child-abuse fatality cases in
two terms as Jackson County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that her audit would focus on how all hot-line
calls were handled, not individual cases.

LAWMAKER IS TARGET OF GOP COMMERCIAL BLITZ ON SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) U.S. Rep. Dennis Moore, a Kansas Democrat who
campaigned saying his opponent would snuff out Social Security, now
is accused in a national Republican commercial blitz of
jeopardizing the program.
</P>
<P>
   And the television commercials run by the Republican National
Congressional Committee _ tailored in the Kansas City market to
attack Moore _ have been mimicked by a radio spot from another
group with apparent ties to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The television commercials show criminals ready to ``raid Social
Security'' and Democrats partying in a rain of dollar bills. The
radio spots, paid for by the Americans for Economic Growth, says
Moore and the Democratic minority in the House want to ``take money
from Social Security to pay for more foreign aid and big government
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have run occasionally since early October.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's staff says the attack ads distort his voting record and
his commitment to protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads imply that the congressman has not protected Medicare
and Social Security,'' said Marc Wilson, a Moore spokesman.
``They're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Moore voted for the Republicans' so-called lockbox
proposal to prevent the use of the Social Security trust fund to
mask deficits in the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Congressional Committee said it picked
Moore and a handful of other Democrats for the ads because their
opposition to Republican spending bills would force a run on Social
Security money in the House's appropriation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just hypocritical,'' said Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for
the Republican congressional committee. ``Our ads are running to
remind him that he made that promise'' to protect Social Security,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson dismissed that reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make the argument that when you vote against spending that
you are somehow promoting more spending is ludicrous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson noted statements from the budget-watching Concord
Coalition and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security
and Medicare vouching for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Moore,'' said the committee, ``has worked tirelessly to
strengthen Social Security for the benefit of today's Social
Security recipients, as well as for the generations to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported this week that Americans for
Economic Growth had corporate records on file in two states and
listed James W. Ellis as an official. The Associated Press also
reported that a man named James Ellis is an employee of House GOP
Whip Tom DeLay's political action committee, Americans for a
Republican Majority. It was unclear whether the James Ellis at
Americans for Economic Growth was the same man working for DeLay's
group. Calls to DeLay's congressional office and his political
action committee were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign that ousted one-term Republican Vince Snowbarger
last year, the Moore campaign quoted a 1996 statement Snowbarger
made that he wanted to ``phase out'' Social Security. In the rest
of that statement, nearly always omitted in mentions by the Moore
campaign, Snowbarger said that he wanted current benefits
guaranteed for the elderly while encouraging people still in the
work force to save for retirement in private accounts.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Becoming one of tomorrow's veterans means
getting up early.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Brian Osburn of Wichita, Kan., who reported on a recent
morning to the Kansas City Military Entrance Processing Station,
which opens at 5:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He raised his right hand and swore to defend the Constitution
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   He ate a sub sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Then he climbed aboard a Ramada Inn courtesy bus and left the
Kansas City processing station for the airport and a flight to Fort
Jackson, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Osburn began his new life in the U.S. Army. His old
life: a bouncer in a Wichita sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is proud of me, for trying to make something of my
life,'' said Osburn, who will train to become a light vehicle
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Osburn, 18, is one success story for military recruiters, who
are finding it tough to recruit the 200,000 young people needed
each year to join the active duty armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are contributing to the difficulty:
</P>
<P>
   - There are fewer 18- to 23-year-olds to recruit from than at
any time in the history of the all-volunteer force, according to
testimony last month before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   - More young people are going to college directly from high
school.
</P>
<P>
   - The armed forces are about 40 percent smaller than a decade
ago, so fewer young people know relatives in uniform who can
provide a model for the military way of life.
</P>
<P>
   - Most significant is the thriving economy. The unemployment
rate has never been lower since the all-volunteer force was
introduced in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that some service branches have missed their
annual recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marines achieved their goals in the most recent
fiscal year, but the Army and Air Force did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Army missed its goal of 74,500 by 6,290, after also falling
short the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that for the last five months of our
recruiting year, we either made or exceeded our mission. That
helped us to finish strongly and we hope to continue that
momentum,'' said Doug Smith of the Army's recruiting command at
Fort Knox, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, meanwhile, missed by about 5 percent in fiscal
1999, the first year since 1979 that it fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are quick to say that the country is not endangered.
The Navy, Army and Marine Corps essentially met their
congressionally mandated end strength for 1999, and the Air Force
missed by only a small percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The services maintained their strength in part by retaining
established members. One reason is a 4.8 percent across-the-board
pay raise, for both military and civilian workers, that will take
effect in January. It's the largest pay increase since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Other resources, however, are being put into recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Kansas City processing center, which also
administers aptitude tests and medical checks, is just the end of
the recruiting line.
</P>
<P>
   It's Army day at Oak Grove (Mo.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodge van decorated in Army colors stands near the school
entrance. A Humvee is parked nearby. Inside the school's media
center, a large exhibit and brochures detail the Army's education
program, its financial benefits and even how to audition for an
Army band.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody mentions enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to put you in the Army,'' Staff Sgt. Curtis
Reeds, an Independence-based Army recruiter, says to a group of
about 30 students. ``We want you to stay in school and stay off
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In a program repeated several times on a recent day, Reeds and
other Army officers showed slides and discussed the Supreme Court,
the dangers of drugs, the U.S. Congress _ everything but joining
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those traveling exhibits are not meant to be hard sell,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the exhibits reinforce basic, positive messages, such
as self-determination and taking charge of the future.
</P>
<P>
   If that future includes the Army, Reeds said, then Oak Grove
students will know where to find him. After football season, Reeds
plans to volunteer in the school's athletic program, helping young
athletes in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get them to trust me to be their friend, instead of
presenting the old image as a recruiter,'' Reeds said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is retooling its approach in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   As of August, the recruiting staff has included corporals, who
are closer in age to young people than are sergeants like Reeds. In
addition, some young recruits are sent back home after basic
training to be walking advertisements for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is reconnect with American youth and
trying to bring some younger faces into the recruiting mix,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other service branches, however, don't feel the need to tweak
their approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines take pride in 52 straight months of meeting their
national recruiting numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the decision to enlist remains a personal one.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kansas City processing station on a recent day, several
young people said they had relatives with military experience.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force recruit Stacie Slagle, 19, from southwest Missouri,
said her mother had served in the Army. Daniel Aguirre, 20, from
Chapman, Kan., pulled out a wallet that held photographs of both
his father and great-grandfather in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents threw a going-away party for me,'' Aguirre said.
``They think it's great what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the strong economy, many enlistees said the military
offers attractive intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are jobs out there, but this is something that will
teach you discipline,'' said Jaron Jordan, 19, a recent graduate of
Hickman Mills High School, who will train be a Navy dental
technician.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains important.
</P>
<P>
   Osburn, who signed up for a four-year tour, said he will receive
more than $900 a month in the Army, with no room and board
expenses. He will earn about $19,000 more for college, and a bonus
of about $6,000 after he completes his initial training.
</P>
<P>
   His pay as a sports bar bouncer: $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another reason, too. He wants to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in Kansas all my life,'' he said. ``I've never been
on a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   That would change soon enough.

STATION REOPENS AMID ECHOES OF PAST GLORIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's revered Union Station reopened
Wednesday with a celebration that hearkened back in spirit and
bustle to the landmark's original opening 85 years and 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   From the Indian summer weather and band music outside, to the
public's rush through the doors and expressions of wonderment
inside, Wednesday's ceremony and open house evoked striking
similarities to accounts of the day in 1914 when crowds greeted the
edifice as affirmation of the city's big-league status.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time _ long after the heyday of train travel and years
after the station was boarded up _ area residents and civic leaders
greeted the long-awaited restoration as affirmation of the region's
newfound bistate partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Union Station has been transformed into the Kansas City Museum's
Science City and a theater//restaurant complex at a cost of more
than $250 million. It was financed mostly by a record-setting
private fund-raising campaign and a voter-approved, one-eighth-cent
sales tax spanning the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Short, a Platte County commissioner and chairman of the
Bistate Commission that oversaw the restoration's tax spending,
captured Wednesday's overwhelming sentiment when, at the start of
the festivities, he told a couple of thousand folks in front of
Union Station:
</P>
<P>
   `` `There are epochs in the life of every individual and epochs
in the life of every city. Kansas City has had several of them.
Today we are entering an epoch of advancement that will be unlike
any the city had known.' Ladies and gentlemen, these words are not
my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``These words were first spoken by former Kansas City Mayor
Henry Beardsley at the dedication of Union Station in 1914, and
those words are as true today as they were 85 years ago _ but with
a difference. Because today is not merely an epic moment for the
city of Kansas City, although it is. Today is an epic moment for
the entire metro community.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a Science City actor portraying Jarvis Hunt, Union
Station's architect, proclaimed: ``We are proud to be part of the
rebirth of this landmark, so much a part of history, ours and
yours. Welcome back to Union Station.''
</P>
<P>
   This mingling of the past and present represented just one of
the ways Union Station's reopening resembled its first opening.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a day off _ a day to celebrate. She wanted all
her sisters to know how proud she is of her latest acquisition, how
well her faith is placed in her men when it comes to doing the
really big things.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the cheering and yelling came from the
station's new front driveway and grassy islands, where there were
high school bands from the suburbs, men and women in suits playing
hooky from the office, old-timers in lawn chairs and even some
construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of everyone, some of the area's leading luminaries
shared a stage. There were business executives such as DST Systems
President Thomas McDonnell and Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey,
who helped direct the station's redevelopment. There were
politicians such as Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan and Overland Park
Mayor Ed Eilert, who represented the political cooperation. And
there were civic volunteers such as Sharon Hoffman and Georgia
Lynch, who sat on various station advisory boards.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour, some of these luminaries recounted Union Station's
phoenix-like resurrection, its marriage with the Kansas City Museum
and its first-of-its-kind gift from bistate taxpayers after dozens
of other reuse attempts fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan: ``After all the years of trying to figure out what we
can do to restore Union Station, this landmark building is once
again a jewel in Kansas City's many treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer: ``This is a great day, because it
serves as a reminder that when we come together, we can do so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the crowd,... MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...we can do so much.''
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the crowd, taking it all in and taking pictures
of the ceremony, was Pat Willoughby. He was wearing dusty jeans,
worn work boots and a blue hardhat. He was taking a break from his
job managing landscaping and other site work for the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to be part of a job like this,'' he said. ``It
feels quite spectacular _ the atmosphere, the bands. I didn't
realize how grand it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)The greatest crowd ever gathered in Kansas City under one
roof raised what was perhaps the loudest shout ever heard anywhere
from an equal number of throats when at 2:47 o'clock yesterday
afternoon the first boom from the saluting guns of Battery B on the
hill south of the new Union Station proclaimed that the great
terminal was officially open.(END ITAL) _ From /{The Kansas City
Times on Oct. 31, 1914.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:07 a.m. Wednesday, as a message played on the outdoor
public-address system from former Kansas Citian Walter Cronkite
declaring, ``My beloved Union Station open,'' a confetti gun popped
multicolored streamers into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The public, numbering a few thousand Wednesday in contrast to
the tens of thousands that turned out in 1914, swarmed toward the
bright brass doors at the station's two front entrances.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)Both entrances were opened wide, and the crowd poured in,
thousand after thousand. They filled every spot and corner and
crevice in the grand lobby and the waiting room, and still they
came.(END ITAL) _ From the Kansas City Journal on Oct. 31, 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's crowd flowed through the doors like a river,
continued in a current through the appropriately named Grand Hall,
then under the famed 6-foot-wide lighted clock and into the old
waiting room, now named Festival Hall as the entry plaza for
Science City.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, an estimated 5,000 people had toured the
new city, housed mostly in an annex west of the waiting room.
Science City is supposed to be a next-generation science museum in
which visitors don't push buttons in an exhibit but instead
participate in an exploration, whether it's solving a crime in a
laboratory or harvesting crops with a simulated combine. The museum
will officially open Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   As for Union Station's other spaces, they're occupied in vastly
different ways than decades ago. Science City's store occupies the
former train passenger midway. Museum tickets are bought where
passenger baggage used to be dropped off. A seafood restaurant is
replacing a women's rest room. And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the building's decor _ its centerpiece _ remains, now
cleaned up. A few people caught in the initial rush through the
doors actually stopped and stared at the grandeur found in no other
Kansas City building. Mustard-colored stone walls. Buffed-up golden
chandeliers and wall sconces. Mahogany-stained balcony iron.
</P>
<P>
   And especially the cloudy blues and maroons, plus
chestnut-colored eggs and oak leaves, of the Grand Hall's ornate
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember it being that colorful,'' said Florence Houk,
a retired bus driver from Raytown, who had last seen the ceiling
when it was a dirty brown and the plaster was cracking.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)``It is hard to put into words a tribute to this wonderful
station. It is the greatest civic event ever celebrated in Kansas
City.'' _ H.E. Heller, vice president of the Traffic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I can't see one single thing _ no, sir, not one
detail _ in which the great Pennsylvania Station in New York excels
this one....This station can hold up its head with the best of
them.'' _ architect Jarvis Hunt.(END ITAL) _ From The Times on Oct.
31, 1914.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 85 years later, the newest impressions didn't
mince superlatives either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seeing something in Greece,'' said Scott Jones, of
Lee's Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupendous, colossal, gigantic and superb,'' declared
Howard Simpson, 85, a former station employee. ``I never dreamed it
could look like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's money well spent, even though it cost a lot.''

BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG FOUND TO CURB RISKS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (REMOVES ``bypass surgery'' from 1st graf) 
 (bl) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug that has been marketed for eight years to combat high
blood pressure turns out to substantially lower the risk of heart
attack, stroke and diabetes and its complications in those who have
heart disease, scientists reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that at least 10 million Americans and
their doctors may want to add the drug, ramipril, to standard heart
therapies and that it could save tens of thousands of lives each
year at a cost of about 85 cents a day, said the study's chief
author, Dr. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton,
Ontario, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Canadian government and by the
drug company Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City, Mo., which
manufactures ramipril as Altace. But scientists who were not
involved in it said they were excited by the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings will have a major effect on how physicians treat
patients who have known coronary artery disease or are at high risk
for it,'' said Dr. Robert Bonow, chief of cardiology at
Northwestern University in Chicago and chairman of the scientific
session at a conference of the American Heart Association in
Atlanta. ``It's a landmark study.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted among individuals with heart or blood
vessel disease but without heart failure, Yusuf said in reporting
the findings Wednesday at the AHA meeting in Atlanta. Participants
also had at least one risk factor for heart disease or strokes,
like high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels or cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 individuals who took ramipril once a day for
four years, the study found that 70 would avoid a total of 150
serious problems, including heart attacks, strokes, bypass surgery
and death. Ramipril's benefits were ``at least as large'' as other
drugs like aspirin, beta-blockers and those that lower lipids, said
Yusuf's team, adding that in the study, ramipril had been taken in
conjunction with those other drugs, not as a substitute for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, ramipril reduced the risk of death, heart attacks,
strokes and other problems about 20 to 25 percent beyond those
achieved by the standard drug therapies. Those are ``major-league
reductions,'' said Bonow.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are to be published in the New England Journal of
Medicine on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Ramipril belongs to a class of drugs, ACE inhibitors, that relax
blood vessels by blocking a protein known as angiotensin-converting
enzyme. ACE inhibitors are thought to slow the progression of both
heart failure and atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of heart
attacks. But more research is needed to better understand the
mechanism, Yusuf said.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf said doctors should now consider prescribing ramipril for
those who take aspirin to prevent heart attacks and for diabetics.
A clearer picture of which other patients should receive an ACE
inhibitor will come as experts discuss the findings at future
medical meetings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not immediately clear whether the findings about ramipril
will hold for the 10 other ACE inhibitors on the market. That point
was made Wednesday at the same meeting, in an unrelated study from
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Department of
Veterans' Affairs about a different class of drugs, beta-blockers.
While some beta-blockers are known to reduce death from heart
disease, scientists found that bucindolol, a beta-blocker drug,
surprisingly did not. Federal officials said they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   Bonow said ``the data seem very clear for ramipril but we do not
know now whether they convert to other ACE inhibitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramipril has been marketed in the United States since 1991 for
high blood pressure and chronic heart failure. Yusuf said that five
years ago he had performed a statistical review of previous studies
involving 9,000 patients that showed that ACE inhibitor drugs could
reduce the risk of a heart attack by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Food and Drug Administration and others did not
accept the finding, Yusuf said he undertook the new study. It was
carried out in 129 medical centers in the United States, Canada,
Mexico and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women at least 55 years old enrolled in the study from
December 1993 to June 1995 and were intended to be studied for five
years. Participants received either ramipril or a placebo, or dummy
pill, as a scientific control. But the study was stopped ahead of
schedule last March because a safety monitoring committee found a
clear benefit for ramipril in a preliminary review.
</P>
<P>
   Those eligible for the study had a history of angina, coronary
artery disease, stroke, diabetes or a painful leg condition called
claudication; they also needed at least one other risk factor for
circulatory disease, like high blood pressure, increased
cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
cigarette smoking. More than 10,000 patients enrolled in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The marked drop in the number of participants who developed
diabetes and complications from diabetes was considered a
significant benefit because diabetics are at increased risk of
dying from heart attacks and strokes than nondiabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Ramipril also reduced the rates of the following compared with
those receiving placebo: death from any cause (10.4 percent versus
12.2); death from cardiovascular causes (6.1 percent versus 8.1);
heart attack (9.9 percent versus 12.2); stroke (3.4 percent versus
4.9); bypass surgery and angioplasty (16.0 percent versus 18.6
percent); and heart failure (7.4 percent versus 9.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The benefits began to appear within a year of starting ramipril
and continued. Statistical analysis suggested that ``longer-term
treatment may yield even better results,'' Yusuf said.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent cough, dizziness and low blood pressure were the
most common reasons for stopping ramipril.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time within recent months that a remarkable new
use was found for an older drug. In July, researchers reported that
a 40-year-old blood-pressure drug, spironolactone, could save
thousands of lives among people with heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the drug's potential worldwide, Yusuf said that if
50 percent of people in developed countries and 25 percent of
people in developing countries with heart and blood vessel disease
and adult onset diabetes took ramipril, at least 500,000 deaths,
300,000 nonfatal heart attacks and 200,000 strokes would be
prevented each year.  &QL;

BUSH PROPOSES CHANGE IN FLORIDA'S RACE-BASED COLLEGE ADMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to move graf 18 up, to remove reference to quotas in graf 19
and to correct the labeling of percentages in graf 33.)  (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, in a move that could head off
a possible statewide vote on whether to ban affirmative action, has
offered his own plan to change race-based college admissions and
stop minority set-asides in state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Some here in Florida trumpet the plan as a fair and sound
solution to an often divisive issue, but others view it as the
latest attack on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   And some see the plan as a compromise motivated by politics
during a presidential race in which Bush's brother is the
front-runner for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan for college admissions, which must be approved by
the state university system's Board of Regents, the top fifth of
the graduating class at each high school in Florida _ whether in
minority communities or in predominantly white ones _ would be
assured admission to a state university.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have similar programs. California has a 4 percent
program, and Texas admits the top 10 percent. Other states are
considering such programs as a fairer way to diversify their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   As news of Bush's plan spread Wednesday, officials from several
other states called to ask about the plan, said Lucia Ross, his
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the letting of state contracts, an aspect of the plan that
has not generated the same emotional response, Bush's plan
eliminates racial set-asides. But it would not require local
governments like Miami and Miami-Dade County, where
multimillion-dollar companies headed by minority members have
historically landed contracts under current municipal guidelines,
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of that phase of the plan must be approved by the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   If all phases of Bush's plan win acceptance, it could derail a
statewide vote to end all affirmative action that is being pushed
by Ward Connerly, a black conservative businessman who has already
led successful campaigns to ban racial set-asides in California and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant step,'' said Kevin Nguyen, a spokesman for
the American Civil Rights Coalition, which Connerly heads. Nguyen
went on to praise Bush for trying to create a system that rewards
merit.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the coalition is not calling off its push for a
blanket end to affirmative action, though members will look deeper
into the Bush plan to see if it accomplishes enough of their
proposed reforms, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be treated differently because of the way you
look,'' said Nguyen, whose organization has collected enough
signatures for the state's attorney general, Bob Butterworth, to
consider its request for a place on the ballot in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some here in Florida, including black political leaders opposed
to the plan, accused Bush of playing politics with his initiative,
using it as a way to head off disruption in the national Republican
Party as his brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, campaigns for
that party's presidential nomination.

   Republican leaders have been concerned that Connerly's
initiative, if placed on the ballot in this politically important
state, could lead to a broader divisiveness within the party and
hurt George W. Bush's chances in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush dismissed that, saying he was merely keeping a campaign
promise he made years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's universities, experts on affirmative action said
his plan was a common-sense compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible it could turn out to be a positive plan,
especially since we're in an environment where there is opposition
to affirmative action as it is presently structured,'' said Kenneth
Nunn, associate dean and law professor at the University of
Florida. ``The program has promise. Whether it lives up to that
promise remains to be seen.''

<P>
   State universities currently consider race, sometimes to the
exclusion of other factors, in offering admissions. Under Bush's
plan, which requires approval from the Board of Regents, they would
no longer do so, but would still achieve diversity because the pool
of applicants would come from the best graduates from each the
state's high schools.
</P>
<P>
   A black or Hispanic student from Miami, where tests scores are
among the state's lowest, Ms. Ross said, could gain admission to a
state school by finishing in the top 20 percent of his or her own
school.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the plan said it blunted charges of cultural bias
by reducing the importance of scores on standardized test _ long
held to be unfair to minorities _ and giving a poor white student
from the Florida Panhandle the same chance at college admission as
minority students, preventing so-called reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many generations do we have to go through with quotas?''
said James Corey, a professor of political science at the
University of Miami, who supports Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents is expected to consider Bush's plan next
week. But University Chancellor Adam Herbert has already endorsed
it and is expected to push for its approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes us where Florida should be in becoming truly color
blind,'' said Keith Goldschmidt, the board's director of public
information.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the plan would increase the number of black students
in state universities, not decrease them as other alternatives to
affirmative action would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to eliminate these legally suspect
practices, that never fully achieved their purpose to begin with,''
said Bush, referring to both the educational and bid-letting
aspects of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   But some black political leaders in Florida oppose the plan,
saying it is just a cleverly disguised way of doing away with
proven laws that forced the state to create opportunities for the
people who had been held back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it all,'' said Les Miller, the Democratic Leader
in the Florida House of Representatives. ``I wouldn't be an elected
official if it wasn't for affirmative action. I don't even think I
would have gotten into college if it wasn't for affirmative
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, of Tampa, echoed other black leaders in calling it a
plan born of politics that would sacrifice some students who do
their best but cannot squeeze into the top 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to the student who is busting his behind for a
2.8 grade point average and has an afternoon job, and has to take
care of his family, all at the same time?'' Miller asked. ``What do
we say to that kid? Are we just going to say you're not the cream
of the crop, so forget about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Around the state, university officials were cautious about the
plan. Statistically, the old affirmative action laws, in place
since 1978, improved diversity in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious here,'' said David Colburn, provost of the
University of Florida. ``We don't want to lose any of the momentum
we've had in diversifying the student body, and I don't think
either the governor or the chancellor wants to do that. We've had a
system in place since the late 1970s that has worked well for us,
and now there's a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Florida, the student population is 9.2
percent Hispanic and 6 percent black, Colburn said. In the state
university system, more than 200,000 students, 64 percent are
white, 13.6 percent are black and 14 percent are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hearing is that we have the opportunity to improve
the diversity of the student body,'' he said. ``But that remains to
be seen. Check with me next fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the old system admitted students who did not meet
``basic admissions criteria,'' and he said that sub-par graduation
rates bore that out.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Jones, a black Democratic state senator from Miami,
supports the plan because, he said, it gives students a chance to
break their own cycle of poverty through hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has proposed a very logical goal,'' he said of
Bush's plan.

RANGERS FLIRT WITH A VICTORY BEFORE FALLING TO SENATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than 30 minutes Wednesday night, the New
York Rangers dominated the best team in the Eastern Conference. But
over the final 20 minutes, when it counted most, the Rangers found
themselves back in the familiar position of being dominated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a collapse; there is no other word for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a two-goal lead into the third period at
Madison Square Garden. They left saddled with a 4-3 loss to the
Ottawa Senators, another humiliating outing in a season full of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just all of a sudden happened,'' Tim Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, coach John Muckler said, definitely the Rangers'
most disappointing loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a team play so well in the second period and then
get so tight in the third period?'' said Muckler, whose team fell
to 5-9-3. ``I don't understand it. OK I understand it, but we
shouldn't be doing it. We should not be thinking about how or what
is going to happen to us. We've got to go out and make it happen in
the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone remember the last time the Rangers won at home? How
about the last time they scored a power-play goal?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is Oct. 17. The answer to the
second is Oct. 19, or nine games ago. The Rangers went 0 for 3 on
the power play Wednesday night and are 4 for 72 this season. They
are 0 for their last 32.
</P>
<P>
   One power-play goal would have made a significant difference
Wednesday night. But after the Rangers drew a blank on their second
power play of the game early in the third period, they allowed the
Senators (11-4-1) right back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Had they been able to score, the Rangers would have had a
commanding 4-1 lead. Instead, Rob Zamuner scored at even strength
for the Senators at 4 minutes 56 seconds of the third period to cut
the lead to 3-2. A couple of minutes later, Ottawa goaltender
Patrick Lalime robbed Eric Lacroix of his second goal of the game
with a brilliant glove save after Lacroix had skated in alone on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after that, at 7:12, Magnus Arvedson jammed home a
rebound during a scramble in the Rangers' crease on a delayed
penalty. And it was 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was 4-3 after the Senators capitalized on a turnover by
Kim Johnsson in the Rangers zone and eventually scored at 14:25 on
defenseman Chris Phillips' goal.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had jumped around Theo Fleury and into the play. ``That
was the worst play I've made in 10 years,'' a disgusted Fleury
said.
</P>
<P>
   And it left the Rangers _ who fittingly came up empty on a power
play over the game's final 93 seconds _ pondering what could have
been as they left for Washington, where they play the Capitals
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best power plays we've had in a long
time,'' Muckler said of the Rangers' final one, which included 30
seconds of a 6-on-4 advantage after they removed the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   It nevertheless ended in the same result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurt us most of the year,'' Brian Leetch said of the
Rangers' pathetic power play. ``And it was no different tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mathieu Schneider, whose assist on Lacroix's second-period
goal was his first point of the season: ``I've never seen a drought
like this. This is ridiculous. I've played on a lot worse power
plays that have scored goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Rangers could not score on the power play Wednesday
night, they wasted Johnsson's first NHL goal and Lacroix's first
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They wasted the 3-1 lead that rookie center Mike York had given
them at 16:37 of the second period. They wasted Adam Graves' finest
game of the season, as well as a strong performance from York.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wasted a season-high 41 shots on goal, not to
mention a stretch over the first and second periods in which they
outshot the Senators, 18-2. Most of all, the Rangers wasted all the
applause they earned over the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like in your mind, you're waiting for something bad
to happen,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   It did. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was by far our best game we've played as a team,'' Graves
said. ``And a few mistakes cost us the game.''  &QL;

NEW LA SCHOOLS EXEC VOWS HEADS WILL ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Unified's new leader Ramon C.
Cortines has pledged to cut jobs in ``almost every administrative
area'' in the nation's second largest school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make this place function,'' Cortines said during
an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines, a former New York and San Francisco superintendent,
</P>
<P>
   vowed to begin slashing jobs, reassigning administrators or
getting them to take early retirement and combining departments on
Jan. 16, the day he takes over as interim superintendent of the
$7.4 billion school system.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old educator from Pasadena, east of Los Angeles,
would not estimate how many jobs he intends to do away with or
specify which departments would suffer the greatest cuts. But he
described the planned reorganization as ``significant,'' saying he
hoped to use recent changes in state laws governing public
employees' retirement guidelines to ease many veteran
administrators out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said the district's management is so bad ``things
couldn't be more difficult'' with a lean staff. He added some of
his reductions will be ``arbitrary'' because it's ``easier to add
jobs back if you need to later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how bloated the district is. I have to be fair to
the people because many of those in the `bloated' areas feel they
are making a contribution, feel they are doing a sincere job.''
</P>
<P>
   Having cut thousands of posts when he was chancellor of New
York's public schools in the early 1990s, Cortines argued reducing
staff in Los Angeles will increase accountability and enable the
district to function better.
</P>
<P>
   He reduced New York's school budget by $750 million during his
two-year tenure. The district's administrative ranks have almost
tripled since his departure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Williams, executive director of the Committee for
Effective School Governance, a Los Angeles group, said Cortines'
reorganization plans coincide with his committee's recommendations
for school reform. Williams began meeting with Cortines last year
and played a significant role in the school board's decision to
hire the educator last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great confidence in Ray and in his judgment and his
approach,'' said Williams, president emeritus of the J. Paul Getty
Trust in Los Angeles. ``That's why we brought him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his other stints as superintendent in New York, San
Francisco, Pasadena and San Jose, Cortines plans to lead Los
Angeles Unified for only six to eight months. He has yet to
finalize his contract with the school board and maintains he will
walk away when the board hires a superintendent next year.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors create a unique challenge for Cortines.
</P>
<P>
   As an outsider to the district, he has few allegiances that
could influence where he would make changes. And district insiders
may believe his intention to stay for only a short period will
allow him to cut jobs without considering the effects his moves
might have on his relationship with those who stick around or the
school board.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky said he feels the district's
resources need to be redirected toward the classroom, which
administrative cuts would facilitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last line of superintendents told us they had paired the
staff down to the bone. It looks like Mr. Cortines is going to pair
it down to the marrow,'' Tokofsky said. ``If the organization needs
a transfusion of new blood, that's what we've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another board member, who asked to remain unnamed, said: ``We
expect a lot of people to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest management changes are expected to be made in
government relations division, the facilities and real estate
branches, and the offices of the chief financial officer and
general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Prescott, deputy superintendent in charge of Government
Relations and Public Affairs, said he has reached the eligibility
requirements for his maximum retirement benefits, but plans to
stick around. Prescott added he met with Cortines earlier this week
and had a productive discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the school board bought out the contracts of General
Counsel Richard Mason and Chief Administrative Office David Koch.
Both posts remain vacant.
</P>
<P>
   After only two full days on the job as an adviser to retiring
Superintendent Ruben Zacarias, Cortines voiced a growing
frustration with the staff's inability to give him consistent data
or the bottom line on the spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many layers and no one is really responsible for
anything,'' Cortines said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to be given notice that there is early retirement
available,'' Cortines said. ``Now is the time to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 1, public employees can retire at age 55 with the
same benefits that formerly would not have come with retirement
before age 60, according to changes in the state Public Employees
Retirement System.
</P>
<P>
   Of the district's 30 highest ranking administrators, about 10
are vested in the Public Employees Retirement System. Seven will be
eligible for the early retirement, said district spokesman Shel
Erlich.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Zacarias said about 350 employees _ from janitors to
top supervisors _ could exit the district under the new retirement
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said he hopes administrative changes will remake the
district into a ``service business'' that understands its clients
are the entire community _ parents and non-parents alike.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the Belmont Learning Center, the biggest scandal
in recent school history,Cortines said his instinct is to complete
the complex, although he stressed he has not read any reports on
the high school, located downtown atop an oil field seeping
potentially explosive and deadly gases. It has cost $170 million so
far and could reach $315 million to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we have to finish it and make it as safe a
possible,'' he said, pledging to move the administrative offices to
the complex if the school board opts to go forward with
construction.

AIKMAN SAYS TALK OF RETIRING IS `PREMATURE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman will
undergo tests on his brain this week that have never been done on
him before, but denied in the midst of wild speculation Wednesday
that he is thinking about retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's premature,'' said Aikman, who received a second
concussion in a span of eight days Monday night at Minnesota.
``Retirement is not a consideration. It's not something I'm
considering or even weighing as an option right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who has had seven concussions since joining the Cowboys
in 1989, will miss a game following a concussion for the first time
Sunday when Dallas meets Green Bay at Texas Stadium. For the second
consecutive week, Aikman underwent a magnetic resonance imaging
that bore negative results.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are in the works by Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, to
have the 32-year-old quarterback examined this week by a
neurologist with the latest technical training in the area of
sports-related concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been stepped up,'' said Aikman, referring to original
plan to have this done after the season. That thinking changed
after Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still experiencing some headaches and a little bit of
dizziness,'' said Aikman, who spoke for 20 minutes Wednesday with
both clarity and candor to a throng of nearly 80 media members that
ascended on the quarterback's locker at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the dizziness and uneasiness that I'm experiencing is
something that I didn't experience last week,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He called the decision to play at Minnesota on Monday night ``an
informed decision'' and refused to second-guess himself.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman received a concussion eight days earlier at Indianapolis,
although he returned after one series and finished the game. That
was not called a concussion until now. Aikman's concern, as it
always has been, is over the possible lingering and cumulative
effects on the brain that a series of concussions can have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be cavalier in my approach. ... I don't take
head injuries lightly, and I'm not trying to diminish the
seriousness by saying I'll be back playing, but that's how I
feel,'' Aikman said. ``I'll be OK, and I'll be back on the field in
a short amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical concerns over Aikman's concussions apparently have
heightened this week because of the effect of two concussions so
close together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the blow was that severe Monday night ...
(rather) maybe there was still some uneasiness left from the
previous week,'' said Aikman, referring to a sack by Vikings
defensive tackle Jerry Ball, who grabbed, wrapped up and dropped
Aikman to the artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as severe as the corner blitz that caught him at
Indianapolis the week before, although the symptoms this week are
actually more extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is why there is as much concern as there is right
now,'' said Aikman, who chose to play Monday after the headaches
had subsided. He said no one on the Cowboys' medical staff had
advised him not to play. He also said that he is comfortable that
his best interests are being kept in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much that's unknown when it comes to blows to the
head ... and what the long-terms effects are,'' said Aikman, who
has attended a workshop on concussions at Steinberg's offices in
Newport Beach, Calif. ``Everybody is trying to test the waters.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI does not detect what Aikman needs to know about what's
going on inside his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the MRI does show something, you're a little late in the
game anyway,'' said Aikman, explaining that a ``positive'' MRI
result indicates ``swelling of the brain, brain hemorrhaging, dying
brain tissue,'' and if that had been the case with him this week,
``then I would probably be at my retirement party.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Aikman to see a neurologist this week is to assure
that a ``baseline'' for comparison's sake can be established before
he steps onto the field again. Aikman said Wednesday that he
remembers the game _ just not the sack.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who is signed through 2005, understands how his
situation can be compared with that of San Francisco 49ers
quarterback Steve Young, 37, who is comtemplating retirement after
a concussion Oct. 24, the latest in a long series of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be logical to make those comparisons,'' said
Aikman. ``(But) what's good for one isn't necessary what's good for
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Packers quarterback Brett Favre said Wednesday, ``There's no
question that Steve Young and Troy Aikman are two of the toughest
guys to ever play this game, but there's only so much the head can
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman knows that his concussions are a cause for concern among
family and friends, adding, ``Everybody has moms, and they don't
ever like to see their boys go out there and get hit, and it's no
different in my situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they know how important it is to me and the kind of risks
that we take.''

TROY IS TRUE TO THE CODE; JERRY WILL BE STAYING PUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jones once said he had both a retirement plan for himself
and a promotion timetable for when son Stephen took over at Valley
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day Troy quits is the same day I pitch the office keys on
Stephen's desk,'' said Jones. ``By the next morning, I'll be
sitting on the beach in Cancun.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says Jones should have been packing a swimsuit
Wednesday and clearing Mexico customs this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, Troy Aikman wouldn't hear of such a thing.
Actually, he probably doesn't hear much of anything at the moment,
due to the constant ringing between the ears.
</P>
<P>
   If only Aikman's head was as hard as he is hardheaded. He would
be concussion-proof.
</P>
<P>
   It became ``official'' Wednesday that Aikman suffered a
concussion against the Colts two games ago, and not only returned
to that game after missing one series, but also played again Monday
night, and suffered a second concussion in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   While talking to a media mob at Valley Ranch, Aikman could not
lie. He said what the Dallas Cowboys would not say publicly: it was
a concussion against the Colts. But don't necessarily hold that
withholding of the truth against Jones or the team medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman makes his own calls with this concussion stuff. He always
has, and always will. He should not have been on the field against
Minnesota, but he always had played the next game following
previous concussions, and always would _ except for the first time
in Aikman's career, his noggin was cracked in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman can talk all he wants, and he did again Wednesday, about
how ``responsible'' he considers himself in dealing with his
concussions.
</P>
<P>
   So ``responsible'' that Aikman said he had ``pretty much
decided'' not to play against Green Bay this week. Later he noted
he wouldn't play at all on Sunday. See there, it's maturity.
</P>
<P>
   But for all those who have labeled the 49ers' Steve Young as
``nuts'' for his carefree approach to concussions, there is really
no difference with Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The football warrior in him will eventually push Aikman to that
fine line between a clear head or permanent brain fog.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of crazy, there were several media outlets who went
brain-dead Wednesday and reported Aikman would call a media
conference to announce his immediate retirement. When he did speak
to the media, however, it was mainly to undo those false news
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Aikman's medical tests on Tuesday had been reason for
concern _ he said that wasn't the case _ there could be no
retirement at this point. There are seven years remaining on a
contract, and Aikman thinks too much of Jones to leave him with
that kind of salary-cap wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest Aikman would ``retire'' is June 1, 2000, which
would mean the salary-cap hit for the Cowboys wouldn't occur until
the 2001 season. Again, however, that's just FYI. Aikman is going
nowhere on June 1, or any other time in the distant future. If the
brain eventually becomes soft and mushy from too many concussions,
I'm sure Jones will find him a nice ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Retirement is not a consideration or even an option,'' said
Aikman, meaning every word of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have three games coming up in an 11-day span. That
kind of scheduling alone would suggest Aikman, coming off
back-to-back concussions, should not be on the field again until
early December. If then.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody want to cover a bet that says Aikman is at
quarterback against the Cardinals in 10 days?
</P>
<P>
   But this is not just Aikman's getting carried away with being a
competitive fool. And this is not just a Jones or the Cowboys'
medical staff looking the other way while a player puts himself at
unwise risk.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually business as usual for most players in the NFL.
They do this because it's their calling, and because the money is
good, and because there aren't guaranteed contracts in the NFL. And
they do this on every team, particularly when it comes to
concussions.
</P>
<P>
   As Aikman said, this is not a knee injury, where an MRI will
show ligament damage. And it's certainly not bone sticking through
skin. The mental fog that comes with a concussion is something
``you have to balance between how you feel and what the long-term
effects are going to be,'' Aikman said. Which means it's usually
left up to the player to decide.
</P>
<P>
   But with Aikman, where's the ``balance?'' When he has a
concussion, he always plays the next week at the position that
invites the most violent collisions in football. It makes no sense.
It's not being ``responsible.'' But that's him. And that's the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's for a backyard dip in these warm November days,
Jerry Jones won't need a swimsuit. And certainly not a passport.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry is going nowhere, because Aikman isn't. nn

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
On a night in which Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal remade the
Barkley vs. Godzilla shoe commercial, the Rockets fell one punch
short.
<TEXT>
<P>
   O'Neal punched Barkley. Barkley lifted and slammed O'Neal to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Rockets' fifth consecutive loss was complete, it
was rookie Steve Francis who collapsed to the court feeling
``knocked unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   With the final seconds ticking, Francis faked to his left, but
Lakers guard Ron Harper would not be fooled. Francis juked to his
right once, twice. Harper reached out an arm but did not make
enough contact to be called for a foul.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets down by one, the final shot never came as time
expired and they fell to 0-5 with an 89-88 loss to the Los Angeles
Lakers on Wednesday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Before Don King screams for it, a rematch is scheduled for
Friday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember I didn't get the shot off,'' Francis said. ``I
felt like I was knocked unconscious. I just remember the clock went
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis led the Rockets with 26 points and tied for team highs
with 10 rebounds and five assists. But with O'Neal ejected and the
Lakers going with John Salley in the middle, the Rockets had looked
inside to Hakeem Olajuwon. Moments earlier, however, Cuttino
Mobley's pass to Olajuwon was easily intercepted. Looking in at the
same fronting defense, Mobley pulled the ball back in and called
time out with 5.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Rockets put the ball, game and losing streak in
Francis' hands. But after burning Derek Fisher and Tyronn Lue much
of the night, Francis couldn't Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said there was a reason for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was contact out there,'' Tomjanovich said. ``They just
didn't call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Harper, ``All this in-between-the-legs stuff isn't going to
get to me. If there was a call, it would have been a charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was contact on the play that wasn't called,''
Tomjanovich said. ``It looked like a training tape to me, just like
a training tape for a block.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing, however, for any contact to steal attention
from the monster truck collision in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The play began with Barkley posting up inside. When he made his
move, O'Neal went for the block and came down on the back of
Barkley's head. Brian Shaw was called for the foul, but with O'Neal
still holding his arm out over Barkley, Barkley shoved O'Neal's arm
away, setting off 600 pounds' worth of NBA Celebrity Death Match.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shoved Barkley. Barkley threw the ball at O'Neal. O'Neal
cocked his right arm and threw a left, scraping across the right
side of Barkley's neck. Barkley threw all of his cinder-block body
at O'Neal, then, virtually defying the laws of physics, lifted
O'Neal's 330 pounds off the court, slamming him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't let nobody hit me,'' Barkley said. ``Ain't nobody going
to hit me and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and O'Neal were tossed from the game with double
technical fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct. Tomjanovich was given
a technical foul for his argument that Barkley, as the recipient of
the first punch, should not have been ejected. Official Bob
Delaney, however, said he, Marc Davis and Nolan Fine did not
consider who instigated the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw two players committing unsportsmanlike conduct,''
Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspensions are almost certain. The other question before the
league office today is whether any players will be found to have
left the bench area, earning automatic suspensions from Friday's
game in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But before facing the prospect of chasing their first win
undermanned in a back-to-back road trip at Los Angeles and Golden
State, the Rockets went as hard after the Lakers and their first
win.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Barkley and with Olajuwon having missed his first
six shots, the Rockets went up by six when Olajuwon hit in the lane
52.3 seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers got a pair of free throws from A.C. Green, and
Rick Fox tipped in a miss. And Green nailed a running 37-foot
jumper at the buzzer to lift the Lakers to a 50-49 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even more frustrating, the Rockets let the lead slip away to end
the third quarter as well, and with less resistance. Francis flew
past Lue to put the Rockets ahead 66-65 with 4.9 seconds left in
the quarter. But the Rockets allowed the Lakers' inbounds pass to
roll all the way past midcourt while the clock stood still.
</P>
<P>
   Lue picked it up and found Devean George uncovered in the corner
for a 3-pointer to put the Lakers up 68-66 heading into the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up six points to end the quarters,'' Tomjanovich said.
``We work on those situations. Little things killed us. It was a
big opportunity we let get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon joined that chorus, but for a different reason.
Olajuwon thought with O'Neal out of the middle that the last play
and far more earlier plays should have gone to him inside.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon did get 18 shots, though many were not in the low post.
He made just five, finishing with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there,'' Olajuwon said of the play before Francis'
last-second move. ``Cuttino didn't want to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before that, I didn't think we capitalized on the
opportunity to get the ball inside. We should have pounded the ball
inside all day. There is no justification for us losing this game.
That's basic. We didn't capitalize on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Barkley-O'Neal heavyweight collision was one
situation they never saw coming. But it was the Francis-Harper
confrontation they lost.

LETT'S RETURN TO COWBOYS GIVES TEAM SHOT OF GOOD NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For the sake of the team, he'd probably
preferred to come back under different circumstances, but defensive
tackle Leon Lett couldn't have picked a better day for his first
practice with the Dallas Cowboys since last season.
</P>
<P>
   Lett missed all of training camp and the first eight games this
season serving an eight-game suspension for violating the league's
substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the horde of reporters and camera crews that swarmed the
Cowboys' Valley Ranch training complex Wednesday came not because
of Lett but quarterback Troy Aikman, and the update on his
concussions that will keep him out of Sunday's game vs. the Green
Bay Packers. The media-shy Lett, 31, has violated the
substance-abuse policy five times and has been suspended three
times.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't hurt that the team's litany of injuries forced
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey to alter practice. The team didn't work
out in pads, and Gailey cut practice short about 40 minutes,
meaning Lett's first day was also an easy one on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Lett is not much different than when he left. He still didn't
talk to the media and he still amazes coaches with his cat-like
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo said.
``He's very quick off the ball, there's no question about that. But
he's got fresh legs. The only thing I can say is that he's excited
to be back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the coaches won't know where Lett is
conditioning-wise until later in the week. But they plan on him
playing about 20 to 25 snaps vs. the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing in Lett's favor is that he knows the defense well,
considering the Cowboys have gone back to the same defense they
used in the first seven years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't lose anything mentally,'' Campo said. ``We are
running the old stuff.'' SMITH HAS SURGERY
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith underwent surgery Tuesday to
repair his fractured right hand. Smith had a metal plate and screws
placed in the hand and is expected to be out 2-5 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, it might be a shorter time considering that Smith is
trying to talk the Cowboys into playing him Sunday against the
Packers. Gailey said Smith is out for Sunday's game, but left open
the possibility of Smith returning for the Cardinals game Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said ``it will be a week-to-week decision.'' MORE BAD
NEWS FOR SECONDARY
</P>
<P>
   The already-decimated secondary received another blow of sorts
Tuesday when a magnetic resonance imaging exam on free safety Izell
Reese revealed that ``he has something a little more than a
stinger'' in his neck, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially listed as having a strained neck, Reese will have
more tests Thursday to determine the exact nature of the injury.
Right now, however, Gailey said Reese is ``very questionable'' for
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks Deion Sanders (strained right hamstring), Kevin
Mathis (strained left hamstring) and Kevin Smith (bruised left
knee) are also injured.
</P>
<P>
   Only Smith practiced Wednesday. Mathis and Sanders might not
practice all week and Gailey is not optimistic about their presence
for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping (on both of them),'' Gailey said. LOW BLOW COSTS
VIKINGS DEFENSIVE END
</P>
<P>
   Vikings defensive end Duane Clemons was fined $7,500, but
escaped a suspension for punching Cowboys offensive tackle Flozell
Adams in the groin area during Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cowboys, including Adams, thought Clemons should have
received a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Clemons said. ``I went a little too far.
If he was standing right here, I would apologize to him.'' nn

SABRES HALT BRUINS' UNBEATEN STREAK AT 7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ The Bruins began the night a half-step behind,
proceeded to get slower and sloppier, and in the end played perhaps
their worst game all season in a 6-2 loss here Wednesday night to
the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't in the game at all,'' harrumphed coach Pat Burns
after seeing his club's seven-game unbeaten streak (6-0-1) get
snapped before a crowd of 18,690 at Marine Midland Arena. ``I
haven't been too critical this year no matter what we've (gone)
through, but I can't accept that. Soft. We were soft. That was our
biggest problem. We didn't finish our hits. We didn't get in there.
That's not us.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it wasn't the product the Bruins iced for the last two
weeks, when they put together their best streak in some six years.
But here, faced with the club that chased them out of last spring's
playoffs, the blahs overtook the Black and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   They rated a gentleman's C _ for clunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flat, right from the get-go,'' said Boston defenseman
Kyle McLaren, who suffered a bad sprain of his right thumb and
might have to sit out Thursday night's Vault visit by the Maple
Leafs. ``It wasn't our night. We tried to pick it up, but they kept
coming and coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss, in which $9 million goalie Byron Dafoe also got yanked
after 30 minutes, brought the Bruins back to .500 (6-6-4). In
rattling off six straight wins, they outscored the opposition,
23-9, but here, against the club that KO'd them in six games of
Round 2 last spring, they gave up more goals than they had in one
game all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of measure ourselves against this club, this year vs.
last year,'' said McLaren. ``Well, we failed the test. We just
played bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, also .500 (7-7-2), took a 1-0 lead out of the first
period (goal by Erik Rasmussen) and salted it away with three goals
against Dafoe in the first 10-plus minutes of the middle period.
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav Varada, without a goal in about 10 months (Jan. 18 vs.
Florida) made it 2-0 with an embarrassing 55-footer that floated by
Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a horrible goal, but with some bad luck, too,'' said
Dafoe, explaining how Varada's shot eluded him. ``I turned to get
it with my blocker, but instead I knocked it in with my stick. The
first one got tipped. The others (goals three and four), they were
pretty much bang-bang plays. Hey, we had some bad bounces, but all
around it wasn't a good effort, and that includes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he exited, Dafoe was beaten by Miroslav Satan _ after the
Bruins failed to clear the puck from the zone _ and then by Alexei
Zhitnik. He departed for the end of the bench at 10:25 of the
second, thumped for four goals on 20 shots. Rob Tallas came in to
pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to get pulled,'' said Dafoe, whose timing looked that
fraction of a second off that can be lethal for netminders. ``I
wasn't pulled once last year, so that's really frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, explaining why he gave Dafoe the hook, said, ``You don't
pull the goalie to blame anyone. Sometimes, it just changes the
tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tallas back there, the Bruins were able to cut the lead in
half by midway through the third, backed by strikes from Joe
Thornton (No. 3) and Steve Heinze (5). But less than two minutes
after Heinze one-armed in his goal to make it 4-2, rookie
sensation-to-be Maxim Afinogenov, playing his first career game,
won a footrace against Thornton and fired in a backhander from the
slot. The final stake to the spoked B was Jay McKee's power-play
goal _ with help from Afinogenov _ with 5:09 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying irony in the loss was that it was the first game
this season that all of Boston's starting regulars were in the
lineup. Dafoe was in net for his second game, and Jason Allison was
back centering the top line after missing a couple of games with
wrist and forearm injuries. Instead of getting a boost, they got
their butts kicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good team,'' said Dave Andreychuk, who saw a
sure goal get rubbed out early when Rhett Warrener intentionally
knocked the net off its moorings as Andreychuk unloaded a gimme.
``They make good choices coming out of their own end. Hey, they
made it to the finals last year. They've got a good system. A good
coaching staff. You've got to be prepared when you face them, and
we weren't today.''

PISTONS TROUNCE CELTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expectations, even eight days into a six-month season, can be
heavy. Especially when you're not used to them. The Celtics of Rick
Pitino aren't accustomed to carrying such weight _ even against a
winless, porous team like the Pistons _ and it proved to be too
much Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Er, make that the previously winless, previously porous Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   All the ``Rocky'' themes and noise prompts in an otherwise
funereal FleetCenter (and a crowd of 15,638) couldn't atone for a
disastrous fourth quarter, overall sloppy play (21 turnovers), the
loss of Kenny Anderson (hip, not serious), or the inability to stop
Jerry Stackhouse (30 points) or the relentless Jerome Williams (20
points, 16 rebounds). The result was an authoritative 110-92
Detroit victory, sending the Celtics to their second straight loss
after opening the season with three straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which entered the game allowing an NBA-worst 113.7
points a game, overpowered Boston in the fourth quarter on the
scoreboard (36-18), on the boards (13-7), from the field (64.7
percent to 28 percent), and from the line (15 attempts to two). The
game was tied for the final time at 76 with 10:54 left and then the
Pistons went on a 12-4 run to lead by 8. The Celtics never got
closer than 6 the rest of the way as Detroit pulled away, getting
11 points and 8 rebounds from the maniacal Williams in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke down defensively, we just fell apart,'' said
Anderson, who was limited to 11 minutes by a left hip pointer. He
may play Thursday night against the Knicks. ``I thought everything
was in our favor. We were at home. We were playing well. It just
didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it didn't. The Celtics got 26 from Paul Pierce and 18 from
Antoine Walker, but surrendered 23 points off turnovers and shot a
season-low 41.3 percent. The Celtics never led after Pierce opened
the second quarter with a short jumper to make it 26-24. It was
their first home loss of the year to a team which had lost its
first four games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was worried about this one well before it got out of
hand. Earlier in the day, he had expressed concern about the
Pistons' ability to beat the Celtics (they've now won four straight
from Boston) and their success in the transition game, a Boston
shortcoming. He then saw his worst fears confirmed; at halftime,
the Celtics were shooting a higher percentage, controlling the
boards, and trailing by 8 _ all due to turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   On the blackboard in the locker room after the game, the figure
21 was circled, along with a cryptic note: ``You have no chance to
win.'' Pitino called the turnover difference ``alarming'' _ Detroit
had 14, leading to 10 Boston points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did not handle the ball well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't. The Pistons had a lot to do with that. They
easily could have folded the tent in the fourth, having seen the
Celtics rally from an 11-point hole to tie the game, 74-74. But,
instead, they went to work, and it was the Celtics who collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   At 76-76, Grant Hill (16 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists)
converted a layup to start the game-breaking run. Michael Curry
then nailed a jumper (after an offensive foul on Walter McCarty)
and a layup (after a Dana Barros miss) to make it 82-76. A Vitaly
Potapenko putback made it 82-78, but Hill and Williams got the lead
to 8. It was 10 with 4:29 to play, and then things just unraveled
for Boston from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we beat ourselves,'' Pierce said. ``I don't think they
outplayed us the way the score indicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Lindsey Hunter: ``Hey, a win is a win, whether it's a
runaway or a close game. That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons had what many teams will only wish for this season:
time to prepare for the Celtics (although Boston didn't press as
much due to injuries to Anderson and Calbert Cheaney). The Pistons
also were due; they had lost a tough opener in Miami (double
overtime) and last Saturday had blown a 17-point lead in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   It was their turn, their night, and the surprising Celtics were
reminded of just how fragile everything can be in the NBA.

   Problems solved.
</P>
<P>
   Or just beginning, if you're O'Neal's teammates, forced to play
the last 33 minutes against the Houston Rockets without their
All-Star center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Barkley were tossed for their second-quarter
Wrestlemania impersonation, but the undermanned Lakers somehow
pulled out an 89-88 victory at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets guard Steve Francis led a near-upset with 26 points, but
the rookie also failed to get off a potential game-winning shot
before the final buzzer, letting the Lakers escape with the win and
a 5-1 record. Houston stayed winless at 0-5.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the Lakers who have the most troubling questions to
ponder in the wake of a truly chaotic week for their 340-pound
leader. In the span of four games, O'Neal has been ejected twice,
and in between has fumed about intentional fouls designed to send
him to the line to exploit his greatest weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure appears to be getting to the self-described
Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't react like that,'' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson,
repeating sentiments of just a few days earlier, when O'Neal was
ejected in Portland. ``You react like that, they can run you out of
any game, just by creating a situation. That's true meat for other
teams to get you ejected. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious he's got some kind of frustration if he reacts at
this level, so quickly. I don't think of Shaq as a person with a
trigger temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley found a switch somewhere. With 9:03 left in the first
half and the Lakers up 30-26, O'Neal and Brian Shaw converged on
Barkley under the basket _ Shaw applying the foul, O'Neal following
with an arm across Barkley's head.
</P>
<P>
   Cue the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley swung his elbows, O'Neal shoved him hard in the right
shoulder, and Sir Charles responded with a basketball launch into
O'Neal's head. O'Neal landed a left hook, but Barkley somehow
toppled O'Neal to the floor, where they rolled around in a pile
that eventually included Shaw and Houston's Cuttino Mobley. Replays
showed Barkley swinging madly at O'Neal's head at the bottom of the
pile.
</P>
<P>
   The ejections are almost certain to be followed by suspensions
and fines, probably eliminating both players from Friday's rematch
at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal apologized to teammates but was otherwise unremorseful.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Barkley) was very unsportsmanlike. I just reacted,'' he said.
``Maybe next time I won't react. I'll resist protecting myself.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal claimed he swung with an open hand and blamed Barkley for
instigating the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious he didn't want to play tonight,'' O'Neal said.
``He wasn't doing that much. His team was 0-4. And he did one of
his Charles Barkley-like stupid things, and I just reacted. Any
time a person gets hit in the face with the ball, nine out of 10
times he's just reacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with me being frustrated. I'm ready to
play, because even though I'm not doing well at the free-throw
line, I'm still doing everything I'm supposed to do. I'm averaging
27 points. . . . My team is 5-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Just barely. Without O'Neal (six points), Glen Rice carried the
Lakers with a 20-point first half. But Rice managed just four
points in the second half, leaving an unanchored cast of supporting
players _ A.C. Green (14 points), Derek Fisher (14 points), Rick
Fox (11 points) and Ron Harper (eight points) _ to pick up the
slack.
</P>
<P>
   With a dearth of big men on the roster, it also left a rotation
of John Salley, Green and Fox to guard Hakeem Olajuwon. Fortunately
for the Lakers, the aging Olajuwon missed 13 of 18 shots and
finished with just 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led by five with 1:38 remaining, but the Rockets,
aided by a Rice turnover, cut it to 89-88 with 37.7 seconds left.
Fisher's missed 3-point attempt with about 20 seconds left was the
Lakers' last chance to pad the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they won with defense. Harper blanketed Mobley against
the sideline, preventing an entry pass, killing 10 seconds and
forcing the Rockets to take a timeout with 5.8 seconds left.
Houston's last chance ended when Francis brushed against Harper,
stumbled, then put up an errant shot after the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a 12-year veteran,'' Harper said with a smile. ``If they
don't call it, it's not a foul. . . . (Francis) probably thought he
had an old man, and he was going to do his thing on me. He missed
it.''

THEY'RE FLOORED BY PARQUET NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First it was the Old Garden _ gutted and erased from the North
Station landscape. Then the Red Sox put Fenway Park on life
support, announcing plans for a gaudy new ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Celtics' parquet floor is endangered. Officials at the
New Garden claim Boston's famous home court needs to be replaced,
possibly as soon as next season.
</P>
<P>
   This hurts. Life as we know it can never be the same if the
Celtics get new hardwood. How can we ever say goodbye to the floor
where Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain walked, ran, and jousted?
This is the floor that Larry Bird banged his head on during the
1991 playoffs. It's the floor where the Cooz made 30 free throws in
four overtimes against Syracuse in 1953. It's the floor made famous
on ``Cheers'' when they tried to count the bolts (there are 988
bolts securing 247 5-by-5-foot panels). It's the floor that Red
Auerbach walked across when he came out of the stands to challenge
Moses Malone to a fight during an exhibition game in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't nothing wrong with that floor,'' Bird said
Wednesday night from his home in Indiana. ``I guess you could say
it hurt my back because I kept falling on it, but the floor is
fine. Still, I don't want any part of it when it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Others will want part of it. And they'll pay. Like Elvis Presley
and John Lennon, the Old Garden floor will be worth more dead than
alive. The mind boggles at the prospect of what collectors and
get-a-lifers (hello, me) would pay for a piece of the parquet.
Think about it. How much would you pay for a floorboard that was
part of every Celtic home game ever played?
</P>
<P>
   The parquet floor is the signature symbol of the Boston Celtics.
For 53 years, fans tuning into an NBA game have always known when a
game was being played in Boston. The parquet is to NBA basketball
what Touchdown Jesus is to college football.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran NBA guard Ron Harper, when he first saw the floor, said,
``Man, my driveway is better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know the legend of the floor: gaps and dead spots. The
gaps between panels grow wider each year _ like Lauren Hutton's
front teeth when she forgets to wear her retainer. CBS's NBA
telecasts often featured a shot of four quarters wedged into the
seam between parquet panels. There are plenty of spots now where
you can stuff $1.25 into the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the dead spots. Garden lore is steeped in apocryphal
stories about out-of-town guards who drive to the basket, only to
leave the ball behind when it fails to bounce back from a dead
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get asked about that in context of Red's dirty tricks,''
said Bob Cousy. ``The dead spots were there, but it was a myth to
think of it as any kind of competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, speaking from his home in Washington Wednesday night,
said, ``There are dead spots on every floor. So what? Madison
Square Garden was the worst. But you think the Knicks knew where
they were? They didn't know. What the hell difference does it make?
People said the Celtics knew where all the dead spots are.
(Expletive!)
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor is put together with all those bolts. The new ones
just slide into place. They say this floor is kind of worn down,
but I don't think it's anything that can't be fixed. Like a lot of
things today, they want to take the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtic coach Rick Pitino, a stickler for detail, claims he has
no knowledge about a new floor and can't specify any problems with
the old one. Meanwhile, Antoine Walker and Kenny Anderson don't
seem to mind playing on 53-year-old boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Walker said before playing the Pistons
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson added, ``I've never had trouble with dead spots driving
to the basket. It's more when you are dribbling on the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many things does a floor do?'' asked the Cooz. ``Floors
are floors are floors. And this one looks fine to me.'' Tommy
Heinsohn concurred.
</P>
<P>
   Celtic scout Leo Papile favors progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing,'' said Papile. ``Guys fall down here more
than in any other place. It's all the wax they have to put on it.
That makes it too slippery. Someone's gonna blow out an ACL. The
floor has got to go. Put it in Dave Cowens's museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Tripucka, a veteran visitor to the Garden, said, ``I think
replacing it stinks. It's a piece of Americana, like the
cheeseburger and apple pie. Some things you don't replace. I
thought they missed the boat with this arena; it's a cookie-cutter.
You come to Boston you want what Boston is about, the little quirky
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Maxwell happily provided a tour of the parquet, pointing
to the dead spots and irregularities in the floorboard panels.
</P>
<P>
   Walking under the basket near the Celtic bench, Max pointed and
said, ``See that area there, there's a little extra bounce in the
boards. That's where Kevin (McHale) and I did a lot of our work.
Ask Marc Iavaroni. We called it the torture chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   A new floor for the new millennium? It's a sin against
tradition. Cheerleaders no doubt will follow. These folks who run
the New Garden simply will not be satisfied until a game in Boston
feels exactly like a game in Hartford or New Jersey.

TONY SCHUMACHER ENHANCES FAMILY'S RACING LEGACY (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Schumacher climbed out of his last Funny Car and walked away
from his last match race in 1974. That was one year before the
National Hot Rod Association's Winston Drag Racing Series was
launched.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher quit racing to take over his father's business,
Schumacher Electric Corp., and raise a family. Don Schumacher never
won an NHRA points championship, like the one his son, Tony, is
leading today. So it is understandable that the elder Schumacher
has allowed himself a bit of vicarious living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always feels better to live it through your kids,'' Don
Schumacher said after Tony had scored his first NHRA Top Fuel
national event victory at the Texas Motorplex. ``We're in the
running for the Winston championship. That's what I said we were
going after when we announced formation of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job my son and (crew chief) Dan Olson have done is just
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by his breakthrough victory over Scott Kalitta in the
14th annual O'Reilly Fall Nationals in Ennis last month, Tony
Schumacher will take a 109-point lead over two-time and reigning
series champion Gary Scelzi into the season-ending NHRA Finals at
Pomona (Calif.) Raceway this weekend. To clinch drag racing's most
prestigious title in his first full season, Schumacher must qualify
on the 16-car ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. Schumacher has qualified as low as 15th only
once this season through 21 national events, and set speed records
at nine quarter-miles. Last month at the Motorplex, Schumacher
upped the national speed record to 326.91 mph.
</P>
<P>
   As the season progressed, Schumacher evolved from Top Fuel
outsider to contender to headliner.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his timing flawless. The NHRA is about to embark upon a
three-year program designed to raise awareness of professional drag
racing by more aggressively promoting its star drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Promote this guy. At 29, Schumacher's racing genes, verbal
skills and driving prowess mark him as an heir apparent to aging
Top Fuel champions Joe Amato, Kenny Bernstein and Eddie Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says this is about camaraderie, and we're supposed
to be buds (buddies),'' said Schumacher, who won his first race in
his ninth final-round appearance. ``But when it comes down to it, I
get in that car and I don't like you any more. You've got to be
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumachers made their debuts with the Exide Batteries
Dragster at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis over Labor Day
weekend 1998. Since Olson joined the program at the outset of the
1999 season, Tony routinely has been firing off 4.5-second runs,
including a 4.540-second pass at 330.23 mph at Phoenix in February.
That was the first _ and remains the only _ lap run at 330 mph in
NHRA history.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Schumacher assumed the points lead after this year's
running of the U.S. Nationals, and has refused to let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Chase me,'' said Schumacher, who added 28 points to his
lead at the Matco Tools SuperNationals at Houston Raceway Park in
Baytown on Oct. 31. ``They've had their chances. We all have. But
it's awesome to have those guys behind you. It is awesome to get
out at the end of the track having just beaten the Budweiser King _
looking at Kenny Bernstein _ and he's shaking his head. That's
awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't come together as a team in one year, like we
did. Dan Olson has truly made a believer out of me. He has rallied
the team and he's as humble as can be. He's dynamite. Dan's theory
all year long has been don't look at the points. But at Houston, he
said to me, `You know, you little jerk, you got me thinking about
it.' We know where we are. We know where each car is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, of Park Ridge, Ill., said he certainly is aware of
the family's racing legacy, and the investments his father and
Exide have made in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a low-budget team by any means, or an also-ran,''
Tony Schumacher said. ``My dad's a team player, and I think that's
what's so cool about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Schumacher said he and Tony have a super father-son
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very close, but doing something with your parents is
always difficult,'' Don Schumacher said. ``Tony was too young to
remember when I was doing this. But a lot of times that drives a
person, because they want to measure up to, or surpass, their
father. He's never said that to me, but I know how I am in
business, because I took over my father's business after I quit
racing. It's something inside that drives you.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON... LABONTE CAN'T COMPLAIN DURING HIS CAREER SEASON
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup points runner-up Bobby Labonte admittedly is
not much of a public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread _ I hate _ doing a prepared speech of any type. I'm
not very good at that,'' said Labonte, a native of Corpus Christi.
``The times that I do have to, I kind of wing it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with Dale Jarrett bearing down on his first Cup championship
at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, this will have to suffice for
Labonte's concession speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematically, we're not out of it. But it would be hard for
me to believe that Dale Jarrett is going to finish worse than
eighth this weekend at Homestead.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett will take a 231-point lead over Labonte into the
Pennzoil 400, the first Winston Cup race to be contested on the
1.5-mile oval in South Florida. There are several scenarios by
which Jarrett can clinch, beginning with the aforementioned
eighth-place or better finish _ regardless of the performance of
Labonte or any starter. Through 32 races, Jarrett's average
finishing position this season is 6.97.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett can clinch by finishing ninth or better and leading one
lap, for five bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett also can join father Ned as a NASCAR champion by
finishing 11th or better and leading the most of the 267 scheduled
laps, for five more bonus points, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, incidentally, won the first NASCAR Busch Grand National
Series race at Homestead-Miami in 1995, but the track since has
undergone a substantial reconfiguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take our team to Miami with expectations to do
real well,'' said Labonte, driver of the No. 18 Interstate
Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix owned by Joe Gibbs. ``Even if we can't
win the championship we'd like to win the inaugural event.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has established career marks in every major statistical
category this season, including victories (four), top-fives (21)
and top-10 finishes (24). Labonte also has a career-best five poles
_ or, five more than Jarrett in 1999. Labonte and Jarrett each has
won four races and each has suffered through one DNF (Did Not
Finish) this season. Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care
Service/Ford Credit Taurus, has only one more top-five than Labonte
(22) and three more top-10s.
</P>
<P>
   That's how close the chase has been this season, during which
Labonte has completed all but 109.14 miles of the 12,343.45 logged
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has done a great job,'' said Labonte, 35, who
finished sixth in the standings last year. ``I think we beat
everything as far as goals we set. We can't complain about
anything. To be in contention for the Winston Cup championship this
late in the race ... I'm excited about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've learned a lot personally and as a team we've
learned a lot to maintain our position in years to come. It's not
all that bad for our first year in the top five.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte also has been quick to credit teammate Tony Stewart,
fourth in points and the runaway rookie of the year choice, with
raising the bar at Joe Gibbs Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving this way to begin with,'' Labonte said, ``but I
don't know if we would have been this far ahead without a two-car
team. Each weekend we do take advantage of it, whether it's setup,
a gear, shocks _ there's countless times it's helped us. I don't
know if we would have gotten this far this quick with a single-car
team.''
</P>
<P>
   LAST LAPS BRACK SIGNS WITH RAHAL
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three years, the Indy Racing League has
lost a marquee driver to a rival series.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack, the 1998 Pep Boys IRL champion and 1999
Indianapolis 500 winner, will drive for Team Rahal in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series in 2000. Wednesday's
announcement ended months of rumors about Brack's departure from
A.J. Foyt Racing of Houston and the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, the IRL's 1997 champion and its first homegrown
star, left the open-wheel wars after the 1998 season and has
emerged as the star rookie of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, 33, will replace Bryan Herta in the Shell
Ford-Cosworth/Reynard co-owned by former Indy 500 champion Bobby
Rahal and comedian David Letterman. Brack, of Sweden, will be
teamed with Italian Max Papis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fulfilled most of my goals in the IRL, winning the
championship in 1998 and finishing as runner-up in 1999, and
winning the Indy 500,'' Brack said. ``I learned a lot from A.J.,
the master of ovals, and I feel I'm ready for a new challenge. I
started looking for things and when this opportunity came up I
didn't have to think twice about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said he has begun exploring the possibility of competing
in the 84th Indy 500 next May with IRL equipment, allowing Brack
the chance to defend his title. BOAT SPLITS WITH FOYT
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat says he and team owner A.J. Foyt have ``mutually
agreed'' to part after a winless 1999 IRL season that saw Boat
finish a lackluster 12th in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our performance struggled so much the last half of the year,
and I don't know why,'' said Boat, who said he would like to start
an IRL team in his hometown. ``The key for me is I want something
based in Phoenix so I can have some say in the day-to-day input.
I'm thinking of the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL regular Jeff Ward has been hired to drive one of Foyt's two
cars for next year. The other seat could be filled by Foyt's
youngest son, Larry, who spent the 1999 season competing in the
U.S. F2000 National Championship series. Larry Foyt, 22, is
scheduled to graduate from TCU in May 2000. TMS TICKET SALE SET
</P>
<P>
   Individual tickets for every racing event on the 2000 schedule
at Texas Motor Speedway will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday. John
Schriever, the track's director of ticket sales, said tickets can
be purchased in person, by phone or via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket agents will be operating from trailers in the parking lot
throughout the day. Tickets can be purchased by calling the
speedway's hotline at (817) 215-8500 or Ticketmaster outlets at
(972) 647-5700 or (214) 373-8000. Fans also can get ticket
information or purchase tickets online at
www.texasmotorspeedway.com, which will link buyers to the
Ticketmaster site. GOULD WINS AT KENNEDALE
</P>
<P>
   William Gould drove from third to first on the first lap and led
all the way in the 30-lap IMCA-type Modified main event on the
final day of the Tournament of Speed at Kennedale (Texas) Speedway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, of Calera, Okla., pulled away to as much as a
three-car-length lead on the dry, slick, quarter-mile dirt track
Sunday night, but had to hold off several challenges from Darryl
Campbell and Kevin Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell finished second, with Simpson third, Gene Boyter fourth
and Jay Bransom fifth. More than 70 Modifieds competed in the
three-day event. Danny Fletcher won the 30-lap Street Stock main
event. LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very good rapport with A.J. He's a legend in his own
person, but he's also a lifelong friend to me. He took it very
cool.''

<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said
you could ``see and feel the intensity'' in talks between clubs at
the general managers meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the annual meetings draw to a close this morning, little
was heating up, the Dodgers and Toronto having pulled off the lone
major trade.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., the hottest property on the market, remained
too pricey a ticket, despite eight different offers alone between
Seattle and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Other rumors of deals remained just that _ pitchers Pat Hentgen,
Sterling Hitchcock, and even Dodgers second baseman Eric Young were
still with their same clubs. Wednesday night, the Padres did send
right-hander Andy Ashby to Philadelphia for right-hander Steve
Montgomery and two minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are supposedly in talks about Young with St. Louis.
Young, a disappointment last season, has two years remaining on his
contract at $4.5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't comment on any specific players,'' Malone said.
``Right now, we don't have anything on the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he did not anticipate making any additional deals
today before returning to Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've laid a lot of groundwork for some things to happen,''
Malone said. ``I don't know the timing of it. There's no clock
running here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this year's free-agent class is viewed as limited, some
clubs may be waiting to make a deal until after they can begin

   ``But the first choice to get things done seems to be a trade
because you know what you're going to pay,'' Malone said. ``It's
not only about filling baseball needs but financial needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, of course, will demand serious compensation in both
players and, if his new club can re-sign him, salary.
</P>

   Seattle general manager Pat Gillick said he had offers from six
different teams. The list is believed to include the Reds, Houston,
St. Louis and Mets. None of the offers was enticing enough to lead
to a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the right deal comes along, it could happen,'' Gillick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some good discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden said the Mariners were asking
too much for a deal to be even considered close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be doing the same thing,'' Bowden said. ``But right now
from our perspective, the price is much too high for it to make any
sense. We won 96 games last year, I can't see making a trade and
then winning 79, which is what I think would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, McRae to interview: Angels general manager Bill
Stoneman is scheduled to interview Yankees hitting coach Chris
Chambliss and Phillies batting coach Hal McRae on Friday in

there would be a second round of interviews with his seven
candidates.

CHARLES Barkley was both preacher and prophet.
</P>
<P>
   He sat at his locker stall night after night in the early days
of this season that began with such promise and lamented a wimpy,
winless Rockets start. He said the Rockets needed to show some
fight. Some nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate wimpy men,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   He saw how rookie Steve Francis walked away _ meekly, in
Barkley's opinion _ from a tough 35-point lesson from Bucks guard
Sam Cassell on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   He lambasted the rook for what Barkley thought the rest of the
league might think of Francis: soft.
</P>
<P>
   He saw how the Rockets failed to protect leads against the Bucks
and Magic _ teams they should have taken out like 98-pound
weaklings. He saw the confusion in Francis' face, the misfiring
offense, the many new faces in the locker room and the mystifying
and troubling winless start.
</P>
<P>
   He seethed, and he squirmed. And he preached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be men,'' Barkley said. ``We have to stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Wednesday was a night when the prophecy would be
fulfilled, even if the promise of finally winning a game was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't let nobody hit me,'' Barkley said. ``Ain't nobody going
to hit me and get away with it. Do you know how mad my grandma got
the last time I got hit and they got away with it?''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't about the likely call from NBA judge-and-jury Rod
Thorn as much as the dreaded call from Grandma. This wasn't about
walking away but standing up.
</P>
<P>
   For this Rockets team, at this woeful time in its transition
season, it might not have been the proper thing for Barkley to
throw Shaquille O'Neal to the floor like just another wimpy barroom
heckler from Orlando. But it was the best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Role models? Not this time. A cool head? Not when your team is
spiraling downward, looking for direction and an on-court rage that
you might know and Hakeem Olajuwon might know but few others on
this team have yet to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps they do.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lakers 89, Rockets 88 on Wednesday night at Compaq
Center, and certainly there were more eye-popping Rockets gaffes at
crunch time. Cuttino Mobley inexplicably dribbled himself into a
corner with five seconds left and a chance to win. Francis failed
to get off a buzzer-beating shot as veteran Lakers guard Ron Harper
harassed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of the moral victories,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``Somewhere along the way it's got to click in.
This was a great opportunity we lost. Our guys still have a lot to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they do. But how do you put a score on what they learned
from all that fight Barkley talked about coming to life? How can
you gauge how much it showed this team that the guy who talks a lot
can lead by example even if he knows it will cost him dearly in
fines and suspensions?
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me he wasn't bluffing in what he was saying,''
Francis said of Barkley. ``The game means something. He means
something to me, and I mean something to him. If it would have
happened to me, he would have jumped to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Barkley, but don't say he doesn't care.
Don't say he wouldn't do whatever it takes to fight for himself and
his team, even if it means charging the guy they call ``Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter of a game in which the Rockets
already had blown an 11-point lead, Barkley took a hard foul from
the Lakers behemoth, then flailed his arms to rid himself of O'Neal
and glared.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, himself frustrated over receiving a rash of hard fouls
in the opening days of the season, shoved Barkley, who then threw
the ball off O'Neal's head, ducked a punch from The Daddy and
tossed the 330-pound O'Neal to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And there they were _ 600 pounds of NBA flesh scuffling on the
floor, fighting and cursing and letting it all out. Both players
were tossed from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it was only another gut-wrenching Rockets loss.
Another one that slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the fight was not something you'd want your children
to emulate or revere. But it was a necessary evil. It was Barkley
showing something the Rockets desperately need: fight.

FISET'S RETURN UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The news on Stephane Fiset was encouraging. The
Kings starting goaltender underwent a second set of X-rays
Wednesday, which confirmed there is no fracture in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiset, who took a shot off his hand before Tuesday's game
against Edmonton, does have a deep bone bruise, and it is uncertain
when he'll return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of injury where the biggest problem isn't
stopping shots, it's grabbing the stick so you can clear passes,''
said Jamie Storr, who will start tonight in goal against the
Colorado Avalanche. ``You can always tape up the hand, but actually
using it can take a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray learned of the injury seven minutes
before the start of Tuesday's 1-1 tie with Edmonton. An equipment
man, not the team trainer as previously reported, came to Murray
and told him Fiset's hand was broken.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Murray learned an hour before the Kings game vs.
Philadelphia that top center Jozef Stumpel needed abdominal surgery
and would be lost two to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to the team right before each game, and it would have
been nice to give them good news for a change,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was X-rayed at the Staples Center before Tuesday's game.
He was re-examined Wednesday by Dr. Steve Lombardo at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings medical staff ruled out the need for an MRI. Late last
week, doctors used an MRI and discovered a small fracture in the
left foot of Luc Robitaille that did not show up on conventional
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Without Fiset, the Kings called up goalie Marcel Cousineau from
minor league Long Beach. Cousineau played Wednesday for the Ice
Dogs and was scheduled to join the team for this morning's pre-game
workout.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings had only one goaltender for Wednesday's practice
and enlisted the help of 18-year-old Matt Millar, son of equipment
manager Peter Millar and a senior at El Segundo High. The younger
Millar fills in about once a month at Kings' practices.
</P>
<P>
   Slapping Lappy: Third-line center Ian Laperriere was still in
the doghouse with Murray on Wednesday for the two 10-minute
misconduct penalties he received the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Murray held him off the ice for the final 17 minutes against
Edmonton and made him skate a few extra laps during the team's
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't mind the first offense, which came in defense
of top winger Ziggy Palffy. But the second happened midway through
the third period when the Kings were trying to hold off a late
Oilers rally. Edmonton had 16 shots in the period after just 10 in
the first two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got struck in the back of the head right in front of the
referee,'' said Laperriere, who was fined $100 by the league for
each infraction. ``It was the second time it happened, and when it
wasn't called I just snapped. I play on emotion and my emotions
really got the best of me. It was stupid on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   If Laperriere had received a third misconduct penalty, he would
have been suspended one game and fined a day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: The Kings spent most of Wednesday working on
their power play, which was 0 for 6 vs. Edmonton. The Kings have
installed Vladimir Tsyplakov and newcomer Len Barrie in place of
Robitaille and Stumpel. Stumpel, who underwent abdominal surgery
Monday, won't begin rehab for about three weeks. Doctors want the
tender area to heal before applying any pressure.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Preceding every Conference USA football media day, Cougars coach
Kim Helton always votes his University of Houston team No. 1.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, Helton stayed true to form, picking the Cougars No.
1 again after consecutive 3-8 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never vote against my team, even though others might have
more talent,'' says Helton. ``I'll always vote for my players with
my heart, for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton's faith in his players proved out in 1996. Following a
2-9 record in the final season of the Southwest Conference, the
Cougars rebounded to a 7-4 regular season, the nation's best
one-year turnaround, tied for the first C-USA championship and went
to the Liberty Bowl, losing to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with two games left in Helton's seventh season at UH, the
Cougars (5-4) are within reach of their best record since '96.
</P>
<P>
   With wins at LSU on Saturday and at Army on Nov. 20 in the final
game, UH would stand 7-4. The Cougars may still be a long shot for
postseason play with only three C-USA bowl tie-ins, but Helton
likely would return for at least one more season. A split in the
last two games, and a 6-5 record probably would make it a tough
call.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, athletic director Chet Gladchuk and Helton won't
discuss the future at this point in the season. Much still remains
to be decided, both on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``LSU is our bowl game,'' Helton says. ``If we can get that
sixth win and become bowl-eligible, then Army is the next
challenge, and hopefully a chance to be 7-4 and go to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure? How can I feel more pressure than trying to get our
seniors to go out with a winning season? This is a big week for a
lot of the 114 teams that are playing (Division I-A) football.
We're in that group with a lot of others that are 5-4 or around
there, trying to make it to a bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now out of contention for the C-USA championship at 2-3, the
Cougars early on lost a chance at their first objective. ``You
always intend to go undefeated; every team and every coach shoots
for that,'' says Helton.
</P>
<P>
   That ambition may not have been realistic, but the Cougars lost
to nationally ranked Alabama 37-10 in the second week of the
season. But it was a 29-10 loss to Alabama-Birmingham two weeks
later that UH couldn't overcome in the six-game C-USA schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with how hard we played,'' Helton says of the
first nine games. ``Unfortunately, we lost our quarterback for the
second half of the UAB game. We were one or two plays away against
Louisville and East Carolina (losses by 39-33 and 19-3,
respectively).''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, as some of them admitted later, began the UAB game
at less than full throttle, then saw quarterback Jason McKinley led
off the field early in the third quarter with a concussion that
sidelined him the rest of the game. Helton's preseason forecast
that UAB would be one of the better teams in its first season of
C-USA football proved even more accurate when the Blazers later
upset No. 17 East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Red-zone failures, too many penalties, the preseason loss via
injury of receiver Jerrian James _ they have all been factors
during a season that began with 12 senior starters and an opening
28-3 win over Rice in sold-out, newly expanded Robertson Stadium.
Seventeen touchdowns in 31 trips inside the 20 is below average. A
total of 381 yards in penalties the last three games is too much
for nearly any team to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Since the opener, crowds fell off to an announced attendance of
barely 20,000 for five home games and seemingly little student
support. For the final two home games (Tulane and East Carolina),
the visiting teams seemed to have nearly as many fans on hand as UH
students.
</P>
<P>
   Not that either coaches or players can shove fans through the
gates and into the seats. Winning and losing obviously are the
biggest factors. But neither is Helton's seven-year record of
22-53-1 a fair reading, based on the state of the program when he
was hired in 1993. The Cougars began his tenure with four wins and
a tie in the first four seasons after rebuilding from the depths.
</P>
<P>
   Helton retains two years on his contract after this season with
a total commitment of about $600,000. How much that financial
consideration will figure into Gladchuk's thinking is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A bowl might make a decision on Helton's future easier, even
though it likely would not do much for the revenue stream,
considering the number of tickets the school would be asked to buy.
If not exactly a financial bonanza, it would certainly make for an
on-field achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it would balance out the season,'' senior
Justin Stille says of the chance for a bowl but not playing for the
C-USA title. ``And the Liberty Bowl seems so long ago, going to a
bowl game to end my career would certainly be something
worthwhile.''

Charlie Himmelberg, who is single and lives in a four-room
apartment on the Upper West Side, owns six pieces: a futon, a
bookshelf, a television stand with a television, a coffee table, a
folding canvas patio chair and a pressed-wood kitchen table that a
girlfriend gave him. But there are indications that men,
notoriously resistant to the idea of buying furniture for
themselves, are losing their fear of furnishing, and discovering
the necessity, if not the joy, of having furnished homes. By

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LARRY Dierker can look back on 1999 as his lucky year. Before
opening day, the Astros manager lost his best outfielder, Moises
Alou, for the season. The team's hot catching prospect, Mitch
Meluskey, went down early. The gifted Richard Hidalgo missed most
of the second half. But the Astros kept winning.
</P>
<P>
   All teams have to overcome injuries, of course, but the Astros
turned it into an art form. Every regular except Craig Biggio and
Jeff Bagwell spent time on the disabled list. Dierker never knew
what his lineup would look like until he reached the ballpark and
counted the ones who were not on crutches or wearing a sling.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros kept winning.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the manager suffered a seizure in the clear view
of most of a petrified crowd and a regional television audience.
Unconscious, and unaware, Dierker remained on the floor of the
dugout for excruciating minutes, while one player sat on him and
others pinned his arms and legs to prevent him from breaking any
bones.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent brain surgery, and, yes, brain surgery is not
baseball. Missing a month of the season, he returned to the bench
just as the Astros had begun to wobble. They snapped a slump and
kept winning.
</P>
<P>
   They set a club record with 11 wins in a row in September,
collecting their third straight NL Central Division title. Destiny
appeared to be on their side when the Astros met Atlanta in the
playoffs and snatched the opener on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But they stopped winning. The Braves swept the last four games,
using up most of their pitchers and a considerable supply of
adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may or may not be related to news Wednesday that
Jack McKeon of the Cincinnati Reds was named the National League's
Manager of the Year. McKeon has about as much flavor as celery, but
he had the lightly regarded Reds in the race down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The honor is a fitting one for a grizzled vet whose team kept
him dangling from the chandelier before offering him a new
contract. McKeon did the best work of his career, and the same can
be said of Bobby Cox, who finished second, and Dierker, who ran
third.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. Dierker won it a year ago, and you would not want
him to get the idea that the difficulty of the job ranks right up
there with being a mattress tester. Besides, Larry will not go
shortchanged this winter in the honors department.
</P>
<P>
   He has a local prize coming up, the Mr. Sportsman Award
presented by the Interfaith Charities. This one puts him in the
company of Judge Roy Hofheinz, A.J. Foyt, Gordie Howe, Darrell
Royal and Rudy Tomjanovich, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner dates to 1960, and Dierker has been around for 30 of
those years as a player, broadcaster and manager. The entertainment
will include a musical tribute by Jerry Presley to his cousin
Elvis. Dierker can relate to that era, as a student of American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fans and the media cut him no slack when the Astros
crashed and burned again in the playoffs, Dierker came of age as a
manager in '99. That is, he milked 97 wins out of a team that
earned frequent-patient miles at Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His maturity as a manager may have revealed itself in a belated
display of sarcasm. Asked after one loss to the Braves if he wished
he hadn't pitched to game-breaker Brian Jordan, he said, ``No, I
was actually hoping that he would hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   And when questioned about what he could do to bring his team
back from a three-game losing skid: ``We're going to hold a pep
rally.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be a betrayal of timeless lodge secrets, but getting
cranky with reporters at sensitive moments is part of the privilege
of being a successful coach or manager. From Vince Lombardi to Bill
Parcells, from Leo Durocher to Davey Johnson, the tradition
continues, enjoyed in varying degrees by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Far less expected was an uncharacteristic blast by Dierker at
the pitcher who started the year as the ace of the staff, whose
work ethic ought to remind the manager of himself. Shane Reynolds
found the early going rough in Game 4, and in the middle innings
Dierker replaced him, observing later that ``he didn't seem to want
to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times in memory, he had questioned the desire
of one of his players, in public, and there were some strained
feelings in the clubhouse. One may assume that these have been
cured in an offseason that came sooner than anyone wanted. Dierker
doesn't attract anger or hold it.
</P>
<P>
   He is a good person and by every indicator a good manager,
although in baseball the warranty that goes with this designation
isn't real long.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once the province of the storied Valley Girl, the remodeled
Sherman Oaks Galleria in Los Angeles is about to be rejuvenated by
mega-tenant Warner Bros.' animation studios.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon giant that brought us Bugs Bunny is preparing to
consolidate its television and feature film animation operation in
a new building at the Galleria, said Warner Bros. spokeswoman
Barbara Brogliatti.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation includes television cartoonists who have been
at the Galleria in the Los Angeles community of Sherman Oaks for
years, and feature film animators, including about 30 from
Glendale, a city about nine miles north of downtown Los Angeles who
recently relocated to the mall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In total, ``several hundred'' people will be located there, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the best place to combine the production units was in
Sherman Oaks,'' Brogliatti said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is eager for the consolidation, because it is
cramped in its old quarters, including office space in the mall's
Imperial Bank building, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo said it is encouraging
that several hundred entertainment jobs will be secured within the
city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Valley civic leaders said the Warner Bros. consolidation is a
boon to the local economy in keeping and bringing back
entertainment jobs to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually preserves and makes economically viable an asset
in the Valley, namely the Galleria that's been sitting fallow for
so many, many months now,'' said David Fleming, chairman of the
Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said it has been an uphill battle to get and keep such
businesses because of Los Angeles' tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victories like this are very significant,'' he said. ``It's
nice to see a point on the board for the underdog.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BATON ROUGE, La. _ At the end of the 1997 football season, Gerry
DiNardo ranked up there with crawfish boils, boudin and Mardi Gras
as one of the best things in Louisiana.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two years later, the embattled Louisiana State coach
is about as popular as a Category 5 hurricane heading directly up
the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo, in his fifth year as the coach at LSU, is trying to
weather the storm of back-to-back losing seasons for the Tigers
that have led to speculation about his job status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just proceed forward and do my job every day,'' DiNardo
said. ``I don't see how you could approach it any other way. I
don't know what they (university officials) are going to do. When
they make a decision, they will tell me. That's good enough for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU enters Saturday's game against Houston with a seven-game
losing streak _ matching the longest downward spiral in the
106-year history of the program. The Tigers also have lost 10
consecutive Southeastern Conference games and 13 of their last 14
SEC outings.
</P>
<P>
   Making things worse has been a string of off-the-field problems
with several key players, contributing to the losses and the
uncertainty of DiNardo's future. It has been a stunning turn of
events for a coach who may have been the most popular man in
Louisiana 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo's tenure at LSU started with three winning seasons
(7-4-1, 10-2 and 9-3) and three bowl victories after he inherited a
team that had gone through six consecutive losing years.
</P>
<P>
   He brought in a blue-chip recruiting class his first year that
included Kevin Faulk, who would become the all-time rushing leader
at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo, who turned 47 Wednesday, seemed to be doing everything
right and was making the most of it. He was a man about town, even
opening a restaurant in Baton Rouge that had his name displayed on
billboards all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn native and former All-America guard at Notre Dame
was a local star, constantly showing up on TV commercials and being
asked to speak at various functions.
</P>
<P>
   But the fame was fleeting. Entering the 1998 season, the Tigers
were a consensus pick to win the SEC West, receiving 44 of 45
first-place votes from the media.
</P>
<P>
   LSU started the '98 season 3-0 and was ranked No. 6 in the
nation. Then the fall began. The Tigers lost seven of their last
eight games, and the fans were in shock.
</P>
<P>
   This season almost has been a carbon copy, the Tigers starting
out 2-0 and then losing seven conference games. Injuries and
heartbreaking last-minute losses have contributed to the fall, but
it has been a string of suspensions and arrests that have hurt the
image of the program:
</P>
<P>
   Larry Foster, a preseason All-SEC pick at receiver and team
co-captain, was suspended Sept. 14 after being arrested on a
purse-snatching charge from an incident that allegedly happened in
broad daylight on campus. Foster officially left the team this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Mark Roman and safety Clarence LeBlanc were ruled
ineligible last month, accused of inappropriate contact with an
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, LeBlanc, tackle Brandon Winey and three former
players were arrested in connection with alleged use of long
distance telephone access codes at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Randall ``Banks'' Menard, who law enforcement
officials believe works on behalf of sports agent William ``Tank''
Black, was arrested on 12 counts of felony bribery. Banks allegedly
tried to bribe an LSU assistant coach and an LSU academic adviser
in hopes of persuading two players to sign with Black.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who was represented by Black in his contract negotiations
with the New England Patriots, and his parents have admitted taking
money from Menard as far back as high school.
</P>
<P>
   The off-the-field problems have caused a feeling among some LSU
fans that DiNardo has lost control, but DiNardo said the incidents
are not unique to LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lost any more or less control than the average
American parent, teacher or principal,'' DiNardo said. ``We are
dealing with the same problems everyone else in the country is
dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us in college football, when we recruit someone, we
bring in all the issues of their environment back home. You are
reflective of your recruiting area. It's disturbing, but it's a
reflection on our society, not necessarily a reflection on football
or us.''
</P>
<P>
   The season easily could have turned out differently for the
Tigers if not for a rash of injuries to key players and several
last-minute losses that could have gone the other way.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-17 loss to Alabama last week went down to the final play
when LSU was on the Alabama one and officials let the clock run out
while an Alabama player lay injured on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we all need to go to church and talk to God about
changing our lives,'' said LSU free safety Ryan Clark. ``Somebody
can't be living right on this team for this stuff to keep happening
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was LSU's third loss this season in the final minutes to a
ranked team. The Tigers lost 23-22 to Georgia and 17-16 to
undefeated Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the injuries and suspensions have
left LSU with just 57 players who suit up each week. The Tigers
have only two senior starters on offense and two on defense.
</P>
<P>
   One of the talented young players is receiver Jerel Myers, a
true freshman from Madison High School who ranks No. 2 in the SEC
in receptions with 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to block out all the negative things going on,''
Myers said. ``We're getting better each week, but we haven't been
able to come up with victories. The good thing is a lot of young
guys are getting experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion has been heavily against DiNardo in recent weeks.
LSU athletic director Joe Dean said Oct. 17 that no change would be
made during the season: ``Gerry is our coach for the rest of this
season, and hopefully after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Dean's contract with LSU
expires in June, so he may want to leave the decision on the head
coach to the next AD. But angry alumni may force a change.
</P>
<P>
   If DiNardo is fired, it will be a costly decision for the
school. DiNardo has a five-year rollover contract that he signed in
1998. It pays him $585,000 a year, with a base salary of $150,000.
Sources say the university would owe DiNardo the $600,000 of his
base salary.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rampant about who might replace DiNardo. There even
was a wild rumor this week that R.C. Slocum would resign at Texas
A&AMP;M and take the job at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches who are mentioned include former Auburn coach
Terry Bowden and Marshall coach Bob Pruett. But the majority of the
speculation centers on Kentucky coach Hal Mumme, who seems to be
the favorite with the LSU fans.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo said he doesn't concern himself with all the uncertainty
around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some bad luck,'' DiNardo said. ``We've been faced
with a lot of distractions. The program has gone through some hard
times, but I can't let it bring me down.''

UCLA HAS HISTORY OF GOOD BYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It arrived two weeks too late, but come Saturday,
the UCLA Bruins might be thankful for last weekend's bye. They have
been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, the Bruins are 11-2-1 in games following
bye weeks. The losses were to No. 8 Nebraska in 1993 and No. 6
Michigan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Bruins followed a November bye with a 52-28
victory over Washington. Granted, a repeat seems unlikely _ that
was a far superior UCLA team _ but these Bruins will take any help
they can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bye gave everyone three days to get away from football,
and I think that's important,'' receiver Danny Farmer said. ``When
we came back, you could tell everyone was excited, more
enthusiastic. I think (the bye) was the best thing for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as UCLA has thrived after byes, Washington has faltered in
the reverse role.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three seasons, the Huskies are 0-4 against teams
coming off byes _ including a 31-21 loss to Air Force in September.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's success mirrors that of its peers. In 1997, Pac-10 teams
were 11-3 in games following byes. Last year, they were 8-5, and
this season they're 5-3. That's a three-year total of 24-11, or
68.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Spring in their step: Farmer (strained groin) and tailback
DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle) weren't the only players who
returned from the respite with renewed vigor. From the linemen to
the defensive backs, everyone has practiced with extra energy this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference is they feel like they have their legs
back,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``They've got a bounce in their
step. There's some excitement to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Time together: Washington coach Rick Neuheisel left UCLA before
Toledo arrived in 1994. But their paths crossed a few years
earlier, when Neuheisel, then a Bruins assistant, spent several
days observing Toledo during his tenure as Texas A&AMP;M's offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's standard procedure for coaches to visit other
programs,'' Toledo said. ``He was at A&AMP;M for two days. We went
jogging together, if you can believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   May I have another? He gets beat week after week, and sometimes
play after play, but true freshman cornerback Ricky Manning Jr.
keeps coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep my head on straight and keep my confidence
up,'' he said. ``If I get down, I'll keep getting beat. That's the
way a cornerback has to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is as pleased with Manning as he was in training camp; he
believes Manning's fearlessness eventually will make him an elite
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aggressive,'' Toledo said. ``Sometimes, he's too
aggressive. but that's what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup update: Senior tight end Randy Hakes is expected to start
over junior Gabe Crecion. Hakes is the best blocker, and it's his
last home game.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and Brad Melsby, also playing their last home game, will
start at receiver. Reserve Freddie Mitchell will play early and
often.
</P>
<P>
   True freshman Bryce Bohlander will start at left tackle. Either
redshirt freshman Blake Worley or junior Micah Webb will start on
the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Robert Thomas, who missed the Arizona game
because of a concussion, has been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Washington's run-oriented offense, the Bruins expect
to play their base defense (a 4-3 alignment) much of the game. That
means weakside linebackers Marcus Reese and Ryan Nece will split
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nece has really picked it up the last two games,'' Toledo
said. ``He's playing like he did a year ago.''

PALMER UNLIKELY TO RETURN THIS SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback Carson Palmer will accompany the
Trojans to Washington State on Saturday, but all indications are he
will not return this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll suit him up and see if we can't get a few series
out of him,'' USC coach Paul Hackett joked about taking Palmer to
Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did not throw Wednesday, and will not be allowed to toss
a football until Sunday, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was allowed to do his first upper-body exercises,
however, since breaking his collarbone in late September. He said
he worked on his rotator cuff, lifted weights and ran for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't wait until my shoulder gets stronger,'' Palmer
said. ``Hopefully, within the next couple days, it will get
stronger. Today went well. It feels good to be back out.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had said Tuesday night he hoped to throw Wednesday, but
USC's medical staff quickly nixed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a decision Sunday to see if he can throw and when
he can throw,'' Hackett said. ``It's iffy as always. I'm not going
to shut the door until I have too.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul poll results: A Daily Trojan poll asking readers if they
wanted Hackett to return concluded Wednesday night, with 74 percent
saying Hackett should be fired. Hackett received support from 26
percent of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Shotgun time? Hackett had quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst run
some pass plays out of the shotgun, but said it was merely to let
the defense prepare for Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good is I'm getting more of a look at it. Not that I'm
paying attention,'' Hackett said in jest. ``As the offseason
unfolds, I think we need to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many men: Hackett said coaching errors were responsible for
both 12-men-on-the-field penalties against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The first penalty occurred when the Trojans called a play and
then made a change in personnel. As a player ran on the field, the
Trojans broke the huddle, which brought the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The second violation involved offensive lineman Brent McCaffrey
telling Hackett his sprained ankle felt good enough to return.
Without looking at the huddle, Hackett sent McCaffrey back in. USC
had already broken its huddle, and a penalty can be called as soon
as the huddle is broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were five penalties in the game and two were on the
coaches,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Wide receiver Marcell Allmond (sprained shoulder)
will not practice this week, but Hackett said he should be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarship count: With Banning tailback Chris Howard's
commitment Monday, eight players have said they will attend USC.
The Trojans have 17 scholarships this year, and would ideally like
to sign five offensive and five defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   USC has commitments from two offensive linemen and two defensive
linemen, although Taft tight end Gregg Guenther is also viewed as a
future offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Howard's commitment, USC is still interested in
signing Valencia tailback Manuel White.

NEW `WAR OF BENEFITS' BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Troy Anderson  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles County pension official warned a
convention of pension officers that awarding county Sheriff Sherman
Block's widow the nation's largest public pension has sparked calls
for reform and ``a new war of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Russin, a pension board member, said the Block award
highlights state laws that give law enforcement officers and
firefighters full disability pensions for heart problems,
regardless of their health, job duties and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we have a new war of benefits starting with our
pension system,'' Russin told about 100 people Wednesday at the
annual State Association of County Retirement Systems conference at
the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long Beach, just south of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Block, the nation's highest paid public official, had survived
cancer and was in ill health with kidney failure, but he died at 74
in October 1998 after falling in his bathtub. His widow was granted
a full pension _ $232,908 _ because the county retirement-pension
board deemed Block's death was tied to his job as sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Following Russin's remarks, Ed O'Neill III, a member of the
Joaquin County Board of Retirement in California and past president
of the association, predicted that attempts to change the law would
be difficult because of strong opposition from public safety
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety people are so well connected politically _ they are
very tight,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firefighters have a lobbyist in Sacramento. In Sacramento,
they say the two most powerful people are God and the firefighter
lobbyist, and the lobbyist is in first place,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Political momentum seems to be building, however, for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by public outrage over the Block pension, county
Treasurer-Tax Collector Mark Saladino called this week for sweeping
reforms. He asked that county supervisors propose state legislation
that would force law enforcement officers and firefighters to prove
that their heart problems are caused by their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Saladino said he also believes changing state laws
would be difficult because public safety employees are ``extremely
strong politically.'' But Saladino said the county supervisors are
interested reforming the pension system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy makers I spoke to today want to do the right
thing,'' he said. ``They want to protect employees who are
legitimately disabled while guarding against fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum to county supervisors, Saladino said too many
workers or their families receive full-disability pensions because
injuries or deaths are determined to be service-related. Saladino
cited several examples of what he called ``shocking'' pensions
regarding law enforcement officers and firefighters who easily win
job stress benefits despite pre-existing health conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Saladino's principal concern is that the heart presumption is
``essentially not rebuttable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said a law that goes into effect Jan. 1 will award
full-disability pensions to law enforcement officers and
firefighters who suffer from cancer. ``If someone develops cancer,
even after they leave county service, it is presumed to have result
from their work with county,'' Saladino said.

</P>
<P>
   ``The policy makers I spoke to today want to do the right
thing,'' he said. ``They want to protect employees who are
legitimately disabled while guarding against fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum to county supervisors, Saladino said too many
workers or their families receive full-disability pensions because
injuries or deaths are determined to be service-related. Saladino
cited several examples of what he called ``shocking'' pensions
regarding law enforcement officers and firefighters who easily win
job stress benefits despite pre-existing health conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Saladino's principal concern is that the heart presumption is
``essentially not rebuttable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said a law that goes into effect Jan. 1 will award
full-disability pensions to law enforcement officers and
firefighters who suffer from cancer. ``If someone develops cancer,
even after they leave county service, it is presumed to have result
from their work with county,'' Saladino said.

<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson had 11 assists and sparked UCLA's
disruptive defense, which held Kraitene to 44 percent shooting.
Freshman forward Jason Kapono scored 18 points and center Jerome
Moiso had 31 for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA played without forward Matt Barnes (academically
ineligible), center Dan Gadzuric (aching knees), guard Ray Young
(sprained thumb), guard Ryan Bailey (tendinitis) and forward Todd
Ramasar (shoulder surgery) and forward JaRon Rush (strained elbow),
who was available if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, recruit T.J. Cummings signed a
letter-of-intent to attend UCLA next season. A 6-8 forward from
Homewood-Flossmoor, Ill., Cummings is a top-50 player nationally
and the son of NBA veteran Terry Cummings. He picked UCLA over
DePaul and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe T.J. is one of the premier frontline players in
America,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``His versatility and
skill level will be a great asset to our team.''

FOX COMFORTABLE IN TRIANGLE OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For some players, the triangle offense requires a
period of awkward adjustment. For Rick Fox, the offense actually
improved his transition to sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   After starting for most of his career, Fox went to the bench
last season and struggled through both injuries and his new role.
But he was a quick student of the new offense, and after struggling
in the exhibition season, he's thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first five games, Fox shot 60.5 percent and averaged
12.0 points, third best on the team. That despite playing just 20.4
minutes per game _ fifth highest on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, personally, it's just been a process of recognizing
where my opportunities are, knowing when they're coming ahead of
time, as opposed to having to search for them,'' he said. ``For me,
it's a lot more comfortable to know that if the ball is moved that
I can move my body to certain places, and I can sit back and read
the defense and I can know where the openings are. Because with
this offense, I know what is supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Foot problems initially knocked Fox from the starting lineup
last season and opened the door for Kobe Bryant to start. When Fox
returned, he found it difficult to get into a rhythm playing off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But the triangle offense, with its constant player and ball
movement, suits Fox well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I play the game, it's more mental than it is physical,
and to feel the rhythm of the game from the start was always
something I gained a lot of confidence in my game from,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   But the triangle's predictability helps no matter when Fox comes
into the game now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rhythm to what we're doing, and it stays constant
throughout the course of the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious he feeds on the system,'' coach Phil Jackson
said. ``He's one of the players we have that's been very
comfortable kind of knowing his niche, how to get his shots off,
how to play inside the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry waits: A difference of opinion is keeping forward Robert
Horry on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Horry says he still feels some pain in his left knee but is
ready to go. Jackson didn't talk to Horry but read his comments to
that effect and decided he should sit another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert's not ready to play,'' Jackson said, explaining the
decision as ``kind of a collective mindset between (trainer) Gary
(Vitti) and myself and Jerry (West).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like if I activated him, I want to play him. And I
don't feel compelled to play him tonight,'' he said. ``I think
psychologically he's got to get himself ready to play. I've been
reading things that (reporters) are writing that kind of sound like
he's not quite ready to play, although he hasn't come to me with
any of that. I'm kind of feeling that his mindset isn't there
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said he hoped to play Friday, when the Rockets come to
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident if I needed to play, I can play,'' he said.
``I've been playing in pain for what, eight years now, so I'm kind
of used to it. You (reporters) asked me how I felt, and I was just
telling you. It wasn't like I'm scared to play and all this kind of
stuff. I feel good.''

CLIPPERS' EFFORT COMES UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We'd like to report the Clippers finally played
like champions.
</P>
<P>
   But we might get busted for scalping wolf tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In fulfilling our commitment to reality, it should be noted the
San Antonio Spurs supplied a significant contribution to the
Clippers' best performance do date by sort of playing like them.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs eventually snapped out of these intermittent,
road-trip funks and posted a 99-94 victory Wednesday night over the
Spurs in front of 11,118 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   According to San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, the home team
while hardly a threat for a ring party deserves to take a bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Chris (Clipper coach Ford) had a great game plan,''
Popovich said, ``and the players came to work and win a basketball
game. That's all they were there to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs didn't exactly show up to dig the ambiance,
either.
</P>
<P>
   In winning for the fifth time in six games - and second
consecutive night - the league's oldest team was tugged home
against the NBA's youngest team by popular MVP nominee Tim Duncan
(22 points, 16 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (1-4) offered their most inspired effort of the
young season by figuring out that the same page they need to be on
should not contain obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed, 30-20, after one, cut the deficit to five (51-46)
at intermission, and trailed by a point (74-73) entering the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby - a Spur for an offer-sheet moment last summer -
dropped a free throw that tied it at 74 with 10:28 to play.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Spurs started playing like champs, and the
Clippers reverted to performing like the kids down the hall from
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making strides,'' said Ford, whose team will fly off
and start a five-game road trip this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of life were conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was hounded into missing 16 of 24 field-goal attempts.
The San Antonio defense, which can be as formidable as bad credit,
failed to hold an opponent under 40 percent from the field for the
first time this season. The Clips aimed and fired for 45 percent.
The Spurs checked in at 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson pitched in 28 points, 18 in the second half.
Lamar Odom, whose video replay experience from Monday's loss to
Utah must have seemed like ``The Rookie Horror Picture Show,'' came
back strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Utah game,'' Odom said, ``I couldn't look at myself
in the mirror. Tonight, we proved we can play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hitting the rookie wall after his rousing first-week
success, Odom decided to hang a few posters on it. He scored 16
points and took down 7 rebounds in a performance strangled by foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of a heart-searching,'' said Odom, whose efforts
were compromised by two charging fouls. ``I just have to start
taking the pull-up jumper.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi and Brian Skinner, the tree-house edition of
the Twin Towers, came out swinging, combining for 23 points (a
dozen by Olowokandi) and an equal split of 18 rebounds. Skinner,
who plays the ``Handy Man'' opposite the ``Kandi Man,'' also
swatted 4 San Antonio shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' ranking penthouse Towers, Duncan and David Robinson,
had a relatively pedestrian 30 and 23, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're challenging people down low,'' Ford said of Olowokandi
and Skinner. ``We hope we can continue to get that kind of play
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   And a bit more sharing on offense would be nice; the Clips,
again, finished with a meager assist total (13) and a few
questionable decisions down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well,'' Olowokandi said, ``but they won the game.''

DISNEY TO RELEASE 26 CLASSICS ON VHS, DVD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co., stung by a slumping
performance in its lucrative home video business, announced
Wednesday a major loosening of its policy of keeping animated
blockbusters out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant will make 26 of its classic titles,
including ``Pinocchio,'' ``Peter Pan'' and ``Lady and the Tramp,''
permanently available over the next two years on both the VHS and
DVD formats.
</P>
<P>
   It will create a ``Platinum Collection'' of 10 of its best
sellers, including ``The Lion King'' and ``Aladdin,'' and rerelease
one each fall before retiring it for 10 years. The platinum line
will start in 2001 with ``Snow White'' on both VHS and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's previous policy on releasing animated home videos
generally called for limiting the window of availability and then
waiting as much as a decade before rereleasing a title. The company
held off on a major rerelease this year in order to build demand
for older titles, but doing so pulled down fiscal 1999 profits in
the Studio Entertainment division by 85percent to $116million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which has been slow to issue on the increasingly popular
DVD format, also announced Wednesday that all future home video
titles will be released simultaneously on VHS and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that DVD represents a huge opportunity for our
company,'' said studio chief Joe Roth in a statement released
during a meeting of about 150 analysts at Disney headquarters in
Burbank. ``Just as with the VHS format, which saw incredible growth
of video unit sales as VCR penetration rose, DVD demand will surge
as penetration levels hit critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Adams of Adams Media Research said the new strategies
appeared to be sensible responses to a changing market. ``They're
giving something up in terms of making a big event of new releases,
but they're still not saying that all releases will be available
all the time. It's a good middle-of-the-road strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also said Disney should not be faulted for not moving more
quickly to release the animated titles on DVD. ``The biggest DVD
sellers so far have been action films like `The Matrix' and
`Armageddon,''' he noted. ``Now we're at a point where Disney's
best customers have bought a player, so this helps broaden the
demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney animated films are among the best-selling VHS titles in
the format's nearly 20-year history. ``The Lion King'' video is
estimated to have sold more than 50million copies worldwide, topped
only by ``Titanic.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

FLICK SIDEKICKS DON'T ALWAYS CLICK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seen too many Mini-Me scenes?
</P>
<P>
   Endured enough Jar Jar jokes?
</P>
<P>
   Join the club.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to pack movies with barrages of spectacular special
effects, today's filmmakers are wedging in needless characters: the
annoying comic sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-animated goofball in ``The Phantom Menace,`` Jar Jar
Binks (voiced by Ahmed Best) has inspired the most ire this year.
</P>
<P>
   But mite-sized Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) was no less silly in
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' due on video Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that ``Shagged`` is supposed to be a
wall-to-wall carpet of laughs, while ``Phantom Menace`` is an
earnest space adventure _ with Jar Jar for comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   Relief? Creator George Lucas used Jar Jar so much that viewers
needed relief from him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mini-Me wasn't much better. Like Dave Letterman repeating
the same lame jokes, Mini-Me endlessly aped the pinkie-sucking and
quote-mark gestures of his clone-daddy, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers).
</P>
<P>
   Mini-Me did have one good scene, attacking and biting '60s spy
Austin Powers (also Myers) in a fit of lunar lunacy. Otherwise, he
was the drain-stopper in a movie that already had tossed in the
kitchen sink. (He even spawned a mini-trend, the most notable being
Mini-Mimi, a pint-sized version of Mimi on ``The Drew Carey
Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for Jar Jar, some might ask: ``How do I hate thee? Let me
count the ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In scene after scene, the witless amphibian shrieked
hysterically in pidgin-English, got caught in machinery, stepped in
unmentionable substances, juggled and dropped objects, voraciously
zapped food with his tongue and made a nutty nuisance of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a little Jar Jar went a long way _ and ``Phantom Menace``
had a lot of Jar Jar.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he didn't deserve bearing the most vehement backlash to
``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Jar Jar has endured a hail of hateful complaints. There's
even a support-group Web site for Jar Jar bashers. Dubbed ``Jar Jar
Must Die,'' it's at www.diediediejarjar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jar Jar bashers even construe him to be a highly offensive
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Is Jar Jar a slur against black people? Against gay people?
</P>
<P>
   Like beauty, the answer is in the eye of the beholder. Suffice
it to say, he's not for all tastes.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who moan so monotonously about Jar Jar, we have
three words: Get a life.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, comic sidekicks can be annoying, but they needn't become
reactionary obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Jar Jar is popular with the kids for whom he was
created, and he hasn't kept ``The Phantom Menace`` from earning
$825 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he's not alone. Many other comic sidekicks entertain
yet often irritate, such as the parade of paired critters in
Disney's animated fare.
</P>
<P>
   From Flit and Meeko of ``Pocahontas`` to Pumbaa and Timon of
``The Lion King`` to Iago and Abu of ``Aladdin,`` such sidekicks
litter otherwise charming animated films with their incessant
slapstick and oafish banter.
</P>
<P>
   In other animation, Fox's ``Anastasia`` gave us an impudent bat
buddy named Bartok, who's even getting his own movie, ``Bartok the
Magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Also due on video Tuesday, the Bartok enterprise is like
watching the Taco Bell dog make mirth for a feature film. Come to
think of it, that tiny Chihuahua _ named Gidget _ popped up
throughout ``Phantom Menace's`` fast-food tie-in ads, too.
</P>
<P>
   Being small _ like a pesky mosquito _ seems to bring out the
worst in such characters. Indeed, the most oppressive comic
sidekick of the '90s has been a little guy with a big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Joe Pesci, who's played violent, loutish maniac
Leo Getz in the last three ``Lethal Weapon`` movies.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, ``Lethal`` cops Mel Gibson and Danny Glover wouldn't
tolerate this berserk bore for a second. He exists because the
filmmakers feel compelled to regale us with yet another comic
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   But not all sidekicks are a drag. When they're not pressed for
laughs, they have a rich history.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Watson often humanized the sharp precision of Sherlock
Holmes' investigations. Nor was the Lone Ranger truly alone with
his loyal partner, Tonto.
</P>
<P>
   Batman's Robin might be in that bunch, too, if Chris O'Donnell
hadn't turned him into a whining, self-centered brat in ``Batman &AMP;
Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   But those were heroic roles. Most of today's sidekicks stab at
funny bones _ and, to be fair, some have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys Ifans was a show-stealing hoot as Hugh Grant's repulsive
roommate in ``Notting Hill,'' new on video. Christopher Lloyd's
sentient spacesuit in ``My Favorite Martian`` also lent hammy fun
via inventive effects.
</P>
<P>
   So sidekicks can click. The trick is to 1) be funny and 2) stick
to the sidelines and not take center stage. These are, after all,
side-kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Lucas just got carried away. Perhaps he should have
contented himself with the sidekicks he invented for the first
``Star Wars`` trilogy: Han Solo's hairy Wookiee buddy, Chewbacca,
and Luke Skywalker's droids, C-3PO and R2-D2.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in ``Return of the Jedi,'' Lucas also gave us the

THE GOSPEL OF DOGMA ACCORDING TO KEVIN SMITH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Kevin Smith's hotel room has a bed the size of a
Buick, several big chairs and two plush, comfy-looking couches. A
giant picture window overlooks the city.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally we're sitting on the floor. Can't even see out the
window.
</P>
<P>
   It's unconventional for an interview, but then Smith is an
unconventional movie-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Since shooting to fame on the strength of the rudely funny
``Clerks'' in 1994, the former video-store employee has become a
figure of great notoriety as an independent filmmaker. His
studio-backed ``Mallrats`` was a disappointment, but he
re-established his indie reputation with ``Chasing Amy.``
</P>
<P>
   His script for ``Superman Lives`` _ now apparently deader than
Clark Kent in a Kryptonite casket _ created huge speculation and
debate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His character of Silent Bob, an (almost) unspeaking guest role
he plays in most of his movies, has become a minor cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's fame _ or infamy _ is likely to become much greater
with ``Dogma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma`` unhesitatingly charges into territory that few films
dare to enter: religious comedy and commentary. Using satire that
alternates between cleverly biting and annoyingly juvenile,
``Dogma`` tells of two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon
and Ben Affleck), who are trying to re-enter heaven in a way that
will bring about the destruction of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly protecting creation are Bethany (Linda Fiorentino),
the last descendant of Christ; a heavenly creature named Metatron
(Alan Rickman); 13th apostle Rufus (Chris Rock); and slacker humans
Silent Bob (Smith) and his never-silent pal Jay (Jason Mewes). Also
in the cast are Salma Hayek as Serendipity, Jason Lee as Azrael,
Janeane Garofalo as a mere mortal, and singer Alanis Morissette as
one of the physical manifestations of God.
</P>
<P>
   As is common in Smith films, characters speak in frequent and
colorful profanities. The humor is wild and sometimes vulgar. God
appears as a woman, and the 13th apostle relates that Jesus was
black.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 29, who says he is a practicing Catholic, was inspired to
write the screenplay five years ago while sitting in church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was watching people and listening to them quote-unquote
pray, and their funeral-dirge delivery of the creed: They weren't
really there to celebrate Christ or God. They were just afraid of
going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening to the priest in the pulpit rail against
abortion and the gay community, and nobody was really celebrating
the joy of being spiritual or a believer in God or in Christ. So I
wanted to do something more as a celebration of faith _ that just
happened to have a lot of (crude) jokes in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the movie was shown at film festivals, the
screenplay provoked loud protest from the Catholic League, an
organization with offices in New York that is not affiliated with
the Roman Catholic Church but represents the feelings of some
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very tone, tenor, content and characterizations in the
movie ridicule the Catholic faith,'' says Patrick Scully, director
of communications for the Catholic League.
</P>
<P>
   When we talked at the Toronto International Film Festival in
September, Smith had been defending himself against the protests
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a movie that mocks the Catholic faith or any faith,
as the Catholic League would have you believe,'' Smith says. ``It's
really a movie that upholds all the tenets of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In a broad sense, that is true. The movie portrays God as good
and wise, Satan as evil. It's the fine points that anger the
Catholic League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says now that this is a pro-Catholic movie,'' Scully says.
``What part of it is Catholic? Is it the descendant of Christ who
works in an abortion clinic? Is it the George Carlin character who
wants to replace the crucifix with a thumbs-up Jesus?''
</P>
<P>
   Religious protests have often helped films at the box office
(The Life of Brian, The Last Temptation of Christ, Priest), but
Smith insists he wishes the whole thing had never come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping we could avoid this altogether,'' he
says, lighting a cigarette and leaning back against a couch. ``You
can't see the title of this movie without seeing `controversial' in
front of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's much happier to talk about the movie's dream cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lucked into it,'' Smith says. ``Ben and Matt became real
famous while we were making the movie. Jason Lee I had worked with
before. Salma had a big summer with ``Wild Wild West.'' It pumped
up her profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alanis has been a friend for a long time. Chris Rock came
about because he'd read the script and really dug it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was not a problem getting his nonactor pal Mewes
to return as Jay or to cast himself as Silent Bob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said they were so out of place here in a serious
discussion about religion. I think they're necessary, because the
flick can tend to become too inflated with all this religious
stuff. Jay and Silent Bob put the pin in the balloon and bring it
all back to Earth. They represent the point of view of the audience
members who have no thoughts about religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a longtime comic-book fan, designed his latest film to
look like one, with broad comedy and action and primary colors. He
also writes comics and owns Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, a
comic-book store in his hometown of Redbank, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   One comic-book film he won't be doing is a new ``Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were looking good, and then (Batman director) Tim
Burton came on board and said, `I want to work on my version of
it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly Warner Bros. was like, `Do we stick with the script
we liked from the Clerks guy, or do we go with the dude who made us
half a billion dollars on Batman?' It's pretty easy to make that
decision. Just toss out the Clerks dude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burton wound up leaving after working on alternate drafts with
other writers. Now the project's back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith recently became a father, and his daughter, Harley Quinn,
bears the name of a character on the 1992 animated ``Batman`` TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   Will being a family man change his approach to making movies?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to become John Hughes,'' says Smith, who in
``Dogma`` mocks ``Home Alone`` and ``Flubber`` writer Hughes. ``If
I start making baby movies, I'd ask that you put a bullet in my
head.''

HOLIDAY CHEER FROM MICKEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `MICKEY'S ONCE UPON A CHRISTMAS'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1999, not rated, Disney, CC, VHS $22.99, DVD $39.99
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Disney's latest animated feature was made by its TV animation
studios and premieres on video, just like ``Lion King II,``
``Pocahontas II`` and others.
</P>
<P>
   Running just over an hour, it stitches together three tales with
narration by Kelsey Grammer. Each story is rooted in Christmas
traditions and themes.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the best, as Donald Duck's nephews _ Huey, Duey and
Louie _ have an experience straight out of ``Groundhog Day'': They
wish it were Christmas every day, and presto _ it is.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. That means they get a big, sloppy Aunt Gertie kiss every
day, the same breakfast every day, the same everything, at least
until they wittily impose experimental changes.
</P>
<P>
   This fun episode is followed by a pedestrian one of Max (Goofy's
son) having his belief in Santa Claus shaken. Goofy's tired
pratfalls fail to enliven the mopey, dopey story.
</P>
<P>
   Last is a warm reworking of O. Henry's ``Gift of the Magi,''
with Mickey and Minnie as lovebirds who each sacrifice a precious
belonging to buy a gift for the other _ and get something even more
precious in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Pluto and Figaro (of ``Pinocchio'') add some zest, and the
animation is colorful, although a gag of burning down a Christmas
tree lot is hardly amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, this is first-rate. Our stars sing many spirited Yule
songs, and the off-screen finale is a charming version of ``Deck
the Halls`` by the trio SHeDAISY.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`NOTTING HILL' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1999, PG-13, Universal, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.98  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: A beautiful but isolated American film star falls in
love with a nice, humble London book-shop owner.
</P>
<P>
   It could only happen in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts is the star, soft-peddling her narcissism with
smiles and wiles. Hugh Grant is the book guy, whose good looks and
good luck offset his lack of fame and fortune well enough.
</P>
<P>
   They indulge in standard movie-star whining about the price of
fame. (Hey, it's a trade-off, and you know that going in. Just
don't ask us to pity people who make $20 million per picture just
because they want privacy.)
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, chemistry is a no-show. Roberts and Grant reportedly
didn't get along, which explains a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But some lively comedy arises even if a strong romance does not.
Much of it comes from colorful supporting characters _ the kind of
uniform eccentrics usually found in small-town stories.
</P>
<P>
   Most aren't the usual attractive physical specimens movies
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Roberts _ known for her hands-on approach _ is as
insecure as her character and ensured she'd look better via
contrasts in the casting.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998, R and Unrated, A-Pix, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.98 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No love songs. No masks. No class. No matter.
</P>
<P>
   Either you buy the lurid fever dreams of Italian writer-director
Dario Argento, maestro of Eurotrash horror, or you don't. But at
least he gives new spins to the well-worn 1870s tale of a tormented
Paris Opera House ``phantom'' and the singer he adores.
</P>
<P>
   Argento retains some of the romantic tragedy at the story's
heart, but for the most part he delivers gory, overheated and
oversexed entertainment with no sense of decorum. The shame of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Released theatrically in Europe, ``Phantom`` appears here solely
on video. Its DVD has an unrated director's cut and includes an
interview with star Julian Sands.
</P>
<P>
   His Phantom is introduced in a watery scene shamelessly stolen
from the start of ``Batman Returns.'' Instead of penguins, rats
adopt the bobbing babe, who grows up to lurk beneath the opera
house in catacombs that look like sets from ``Journey to the Center
of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Argento's daughter, Asia, plays Christine, the lovely young
soprano who falls under the Phantom's spell and whose trysts with
him turn tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Her daddy takes ample liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For one, this Phantom isn't disfigured or masked but has '70s
rock-star hair and telepathic powers. For another, he and Christine
do not have a platonic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the gore. An opera house worker is cut in half.
Another's hand is chewed half-off by rats. Another is impaled on a
stalagmite.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Hungary with largely Italian actors, ``Phantom`` has a
rich old-Europe ambience, and its English voices are looped in
unobtrusively. Ennio Morricone of spaghetti-western fame composed a
fine, elegantly tragic score.
</P>
<P>
   Story and characters are slim, but what did you expect?
Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   If you appreciate Argento's evocation of highly stylized '70s
horrors such as his own ``Suspiria,'' this ``Phantom`` may fill the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DVD ADVANTAGES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DVD consumers are so spoiled by extras _ trailers, documentaries
and the like _ that they may diss discs that offer little more than
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Except for theatrical trailers, ``Titanic`` had a movie-only DVD
in August, and ``Pinocchio`` has one now.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the flip side: Most movies still haven't reached
DVD in any form, and George Lucas says he won't put ``The Phantom
Menace`` on DVD before 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Something is better than nothing, and with DVD, that something
can be a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio`` has a beautiful transfer, and chapter stops allow
you to access favorite scenes instantly. Also new on DVD are ``101
Dalmatians,`` ``Mulan`` and ``Hercules.''
</P>
<P>
   So just enjoy _ and no complaining.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; VIDEO RATINGS &LR;  &QL;

FINLEY TALKS OF LEAVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Angels' search for a new manager intensifies, it might be
coming at a steep price.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chuck Finley, whose 14 seasons in an Angels uniform are
more than any other player in franchise history, is telling friends
he's getting the feeling he doesn't figure in the team's plans.
</P>
<P>
   That is in contrast to what the club has been saying since
Finley became a free agent at the end of the season. Angels
management reportedly told prospective general manager candidates
that Finley was a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Finley's status fell behind the hiring of a GM and
manager. Bill Stoneman has been general manager for 10 days now,
but his focus has been on hiring a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman has interviewed four _ Bob Boone, Joe Maddon, Joel
Skinner and Mike Sciosica _ and has three more interviews planned.
Those three _ with Chris Chambliss, Ken Macha and Hal McRae _ will
take place in Montreal during the next few days as Stoneman ties up
loose ends in the city where he's lived and worked since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Chuck is looking at things as far as the timing,''
said Angels spokesman Tim Mead. ``But it's a situation where
there's been so many things to do that there's a lot of `No. 1'
priorities. To Chuck, there's only one No. 1. And to Bill, he's got
to hire a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Angels will lose exclusive negotiating
rights to Finley after today. And Finley is drawing plenty of
interest from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is getting attention from Seattle, Arizona, the Yankees
and Colorado, but no team seems as intent on signing Finley as the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians Wednesday hired Dick Pole as their pitching coach.
Pole, who was the Angels' pitching coach in 1999, got along well
with Finley, who liked Pole's easy-going style.
</P>
<P>
   Finley told a friend that the impression he got from talking
with Stoneman was that the club is on a three- or four-year plan.
But Finley, who turns 37 later this month, wants to win now and
feels the Indians have as good a shot next season as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was nearly dealt to the Indians before the trading
deadline this past season, but Cleveland was not willing to meet
the Angels' demands. Finley responded by going 7-1 with a 2.16 ERA
in his final 11 starts.

NASDAQ TO DELIST JERRY'S DELI
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry's Famous Deli Inc. will be delisted from the
Nasdaq exchange next month if it cannot come into compliance with
listing requirements, a company official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq National Market has informed Jerry's that it doesn't
meet listing standards for a minimum bid price or market value,
said Chief Executive Officer Issac Starkman.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jerry's stock price hasn't maintained a minimum bid price
sufficient to allow it to move its listing to the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq spokesman Wayne Lee said Jerry's stock price had dipped
below the exchange's minimum bid price of $1 and its public float
was less than $5 &UR;  &LR; million, which has put it in the position of
being delisted.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq will remove Jerry's Famous Deli from the exchange
Dec. 27. ``We won't be happy if it happens,'' said Starkman, ``but
we can only do what we can do and hope things change.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Starkman, ``We are considering all options. However, our
main objective is to stress to investors that our stock price has
been undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jerry's is delisted, Starkman said the company will consider
having the stock quoted and traded on the less-stringent OTC
Bulletin Board. Companies on the OTC aren't required to report
their financial results as rigorously as those on Nasdaq's other
boards, making them less frequently traded.
</P>
<P>
   Starkman said to help improve the company's stock value the
investor relations firm Coffin Communications Group has been hired
to work on expanding Jerry's brand image and investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's Famous Deli Inc. also announced on Wednesday quarterly
results, with revenues for the third quarter at $15.5 &UR;  &LR; million
compared with $17.2 &UR;  &LR; million for the same period a year ago. Net
income increased to approximately $33,000 compared with
approximately $10,000 for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in revenues was due to the closure of a Miami
restaurant for remodeling in September and the sale of a Pasadena
restaurant in May, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant chain operates Jerry's Famous Deli and Solley's
Delicatessen and Bakery in Southern California, and Wolfie Cohen's
Rascal House and The Epicure Market in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   More than 129,000 shares of Jerry's Famous Deli changed hands
Wednesday, closing unchanged at 68.75 cents. The 30-day average
volume had been 10,000 shares traded.

BASEBALL PLAYS GAMES TO GAIN EQUITABLE REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Baseball's annual round of salary ratcheting is
causing the predictable annual swoon from observers convinced that
doom is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   To which it must be said:
</P>
<P>
   Bah.
</P>
<P>
   For the nearly 25 years since the courts forced free agency upon
baseball, financial hand-wringing is as much a part of the
off-season as the proverbial player to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the game continues to expand, the players get richer and so
do the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The only consequence, outside of competitive imbalance, is that
more tax money is used to build more elaborate stadiums that
produce more money. And not many people care about that.
</P>
<P>
   Heckuva scam, no?
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened in Cleveland recently.
</P>
<P>
   While Seattle was obsessing over the fates of Ken Griffey Jr.
and Alex Rodriguez, the Indians quietly were sold to local lawyer
Lawrence J. Dolan for a staggering $320 million, despite claiming
that annual profits had become increasingly slim.
</P>
<P>
   The man who sold the team, Richard Jacobs, for whom the Jacobs
Field ballyard is named, bought the Indians in 1986 for $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   The sales price represents an eight-fold increase over 13 years
for a franchise that for most of its existence was the blind,
slobbering mutt of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The sales price runs counter to the ownership-inspired
lamentations about industry impoverishment owing to the player
salary spiral.
</P>
<P>
   As long as baseball remains a monopoly, as well as lucrative
programming for the networks 162 days and the postseason, franchise
values will continue to climb faster than the best annuity.
</P>
<P>
   The point is worthy of mention now because today's commencement
of the free agent signing period means players are coming in for
their annual demonization as the greedheads crippling baseball.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball is certainly screwed up, it isn't crippled,
because most everyone involved is either making buckets of money or
acquiring substantial equity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cleveland transaction points out, baseball is an equity
business, not a cash business. Think of it as Amazon.com in stirrup
hose. The Internet company has yet to make a profit, but that
hasn't stopped stockholders from getting rich.
</P>
<P>
   The point has local application. The Mariners sometime soon will
announce their annual operating losses, a ritual they eagerly
deploy in order to generate the political or emotional momentum for
whatever extortion is on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, with a half-season of lucrative revenues from the
Guilty Pleasure, the Mariners will have a hard time faking a
financial loss. But this organization has never lacked for
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they announce, it is of minimal consequence compared to
the increase in equity with the new stadium. If Cleveland's sale
price is a representative midmarket barometer _ obviously, some
teams' appreciation has been less _ the Mariners' value must be
close.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to the newness of the park and the smaller season-ticket
base, as well as lesser local broadcast revenues, the Mariners'
value arguably could be pegged around $280 million, even with the
impending departures of Griffey and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the owners have invested $125 million in the
original purchase price and operating capital, plus another $60
million or so in claimed cumulative operating losses. Throw in the
entire $100 million in cost overruns for the park for which they
committed to pay, and that adds up to a seven-year investment of
$285 million, with the big revenues imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from actual cash, each of the owners received tax benefits
from depreciation as well as operating a business as a loss. So the
owners' financial experience in baseball has been a wash at worst,
even when the owner-dictated construction pace created one of the
worst budget fiascoes in modern stadium construction history.
</P>
<P>
   So no financial suffering is detectable in the owners' position.
The conclusion becomes a large aggravation in the context of the
four-year salary comparisons that were distributed by the
commissioner's office at the baseball general managers' meetings
this week, and were in a chart in the P-I Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' 1999 payroll was reported to be $45.3 million, not
the $53 million they had been claiming. The figure was 18th among
baseball's 30 clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It also represented only a $7.3 million increase since the $38
million of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that Seattle ownership made an inadequate increase
in payroll over the last four years, which contributed greatly to
the losing records of the last two seasons and the subsequent
rejections by Griffey and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the historic, steady increase in baseball
franchise equity, the owners' net investment has never been in
jeopardy, even despite the stadium's huge cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   So when you see the whopper size of the next round of free-agent
contracts, remember that as long as you keep watching baseball in
person and on TV, those salaries are affordable, even by the
Mariners, even for Griffey and Rodriguez.

WESTPHAL SPEAKS, SONICS DELIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sonics coach Paul Westphal could be heard from the
nose-bleed seats.
</P>
<P>
   There were about four minutes left in the third quarter, and
with too many holes showing in the Sonics' defense, Westphal
verbally ripped into his troops.
</P>
<P>
   He simply wanted defense. He wanted the Sonics to run back in
transition. He wanted to stop exchanging baskets. He wanted to put
a lowly Washington Wizards team away.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly three minutes passed before a much calmer and more
satisfied Westphal light-heartedly issued another challenge. The
Sonics eventually managed to hold the Wizards under 100 points,
polishing off a 109-95 victory Wednesday night in a half-filled MCI
Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident Westphal's earlier message sank in the most.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics ended the third with a 13-4 run, a bunch of defensive
stops and an 11-point lead. The fourth quarter quickly became a
formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you have to do sometimes. You have to remind them
that the game isn't easy,'' Westphal said. ``You've got to do all
of the little things like getting back on defense, boxing out,
setting picks and swinging the ball. When we do that we're pretty
good. ... They just had to be reminded.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal had been witnessing a rerun of Monday night's 117-98
loss at Philadelphia. Admittedly, the Sonics (4-1) took the
depleted Sixers for granted.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics did their job and won a game they were
supposed to. They avoided a two-game losing streak and are 1-1 on
this East Coast trip with Cleveland, Detroit and New Jersey ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton vowed before the season that he wouldn't let the
team droop too much. And as much as the Sonics counted on defense,
they were just as reliant on Payton Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' star guard tied a career-high when he racked up 17
assists to go with 20 points and seven rebounds. The last time he
dished out so many assists was March 27, 1996, against Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's passing broke a MCI Center assist record of 16
previously held by Washington's Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best players in the league at the top of his
game. You don't even measure him by statistics anymore,'' Westphal
said. ``He's 100 percent focused on winning games. Scoring, assists
_ he'll do it all every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had five players reach double figures in scoring.
They were again led by Vernon Maxwell's hot outside shooting.
Maxwell, who missed 11 of 15 shots against Philadelphia, collected
a game-high 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's 3-pointer stretched the Sonics' lead to 79-74 after
they had blown a 12-point lead in the third. From there, Payton and
Maxwell took turns scoring baskets. The Sonics held the Wizards to
one field goal in the period's final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Payton closed out the quarter by sinking a 30-foot 3-pointer
that put the Sonics ahead, 89-78. Maxwell dropped in a 18-foot
jumper that gave the Sonics their biggest lead _ 104-86 _ deep into
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really concentrated before the game and got my ready to have
a good game,'' Maxwell said. ``When you don't have a conscience it
really doesn't matter. You just go out and play in the flow of the
game and that's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics run-and-gun as they did against the Wizards, it
is imperative that they sprint back and defend. Washington had six
turnovers and six field goals in the final frame.
</P>
<P>
   The winless Wizards entered the game in a state of flux.
Shooting guard Mitch Richmond was sidelined with a sore knee.
Wizards coach Gar Heard shook up his lineup and did not start
Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Wizards stayed close early.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting a lot of easy fast breaks,'' Payton said.
``We can't let teams come down and get easy layups and dunks. That
gives them confidence. They weren't shooting the ball that well
from outside. They were getting most of their (points) in the
paint, and we had to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was just that simple.

NASDAQ HALTS TRADING OF FIELDS AIRCRAFT STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nasdaq officials halted trading of Fields Aircraft
Spares Inc. requesting more information from the company in the
wake of a pending delisting hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock was slightly higher before the halt in
extremely heavy trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company based in Simi Valley, about 35 miles northwest of
Los Angeles, received notice last week from Nasdaq that the stock
exchange's officials believe the company has fallen below its
minimum net asset level required for continued trading.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fields, the company's president, said at the time the
company was working out a deal with some bond holders that will
convert their bonds into stock, pushing the company's net assets
above the minimum requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Fields also said the company plans to continue conducting
business and attributed the financial troubles to a slowdown in
payments from customers and a decrease in the amount of business it
had in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as June, Fields Aircraft was considering expanding
through acquisitions. By September, those plans were looking less
likely as the company scaled back its operations and moved into
smaller space.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which had traded as high as $7.875 per
share late last year, finished Wednesday at 93.75 cents per share,
up 6.25 cents from Tuesday's close on 136,000 shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   Fields did not respond to a message left with his office staff.

GALAXY FACES DALLAS IN GAME 3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Someone suggested that pounding on the players' hotel
room doors or early morning phone calls would have been a nice way
to spoil the Dallas Burn's rest before tonight's decisive MLS
Western Conference Finals playoff match at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even Galaxy management is doing its part, asking fans to wear
black in a united show of support for the home team in the 7:30
p.m. match.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Galaxy is looking for any advantage it can get, for
a couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One, the stakes are high. The winner heads to Foxboro, Mass.,
for the MLS championship match. Two, the Burn is as hot as its
nickname suggests, having won 11 of its past 14. And its last two
victories came in spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-0 to Chicago at halftime in the deciding match of the
first round, the Burn scored two goals in the final 10 minutes for
a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Dallas trailed the Galaxy by a goal on two occasions,
but rallied to tie the match 2-2 in the 73rd minute. In the
shootout, the Burn was down to its last attempts twice, and still
managed to pull out a victory to even the series.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take to finally put this team away?
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do, except what we're doing?'' said Galaxy coach
Sigi Schmid. ``If we always make them score great goals to beat us,
then I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult, but it's not impossible. It's just
a matter of us getting focused. That last loss was tough
emotionally, but I assure you we will have our best game ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has been fun for any fan to watch. Just when you're ready
to count the team out, it suddenly re-appears and keeps its season
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better attitude from a team than what
Dallas has,'' said Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. ``I think we
try as a team to emulate what Dallas does attitude wise. They never
say die and that alone makes them difficult to defeat. We have a
lot of respect for them at the moment and it's going to take a
complete game for us to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' main threat, Ariel Graziani, has been spectacular. He's
scored all three of Dallas' goals in regulation play. But the Burn
is more than just Graziani. Midfielder Mark Santel has provided
good service for the Burn and Jason Kreis and Oscar Pareja are
always a threat around the goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Burn is thin in the back. The team will be without
defender Eric Dade and midfielder Sergi Daniv because of
yellow-card accumulation. Defender Brandon Pollard is out after
suffering a broken right fibula in the first-round series with the
Fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make their back line work,'' said Schmid. ``Without
Pollard and Dade, they don't have as much depth on their back line.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I look at them, they have had to battle back in their
last three games and that eventually takes a toll. It's about us
now. We have to make them work and keep the pressure on. And we
can't give away easy opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos thinks the veterans _
players like Carlos Hermosillo, Robin Fraser, Paul Caligiuri and
Cobi Jones _ will all have big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're mature enough to know the position we're in,''
said Cienfuegos. ``Luckily, soccer gives you the opportunities for
rematches, and that's what we have. We have veterans that will pick
it up and get it done for us.''

   &LR; rt wrapper i  &LR; I 'm wary of optimism. Any time you're thinking,
``Hey, things could be worse,'' they probably are.
</P>
<P>
   But although these are challenging times for the city of San
Francisco, the picture isn't quite as bleak as it was 150 120
 &LR; years ago, unless you're a 49ers' fan, of course.

   John W. Geary was elected mayor in 1849 as the Gold Rush was
getting under way, and here's what the man had to say about the
city:
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we are without a dollar in the public treasury,
and it is to be feared the city is greatly in debt. You have
neither an office for your magistrate, nor any other public
edifice. You are without a single police officer or watchman, and
have not the means of confining a prisoner for an hour, neither
have you a place to shelter, while living, sick or unfortunate
strangers who may be cast upon our shores, or to bury them when
dead. Public improvements are unknown in San Francisco. In short,
you are without a single requisite necessary for the promotion of
prosperity, nor the protection of property, nor for the maintenance
of order.''
</P>
<P>
   What a nitpicker.
</P>
<P>
   But note that Mayor Geary didn't take any shots at Muni. It was
a sensitive topic, since one of his campaign promises was to fix
Muni in 100 years.

 WHEN S.F. COULDN'T GET WORSE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm wary of optimism. Any time you're thinking,
``Hey, things could be worse,'' they probably are.
</P>
<P>
   But although these are challenging times for the city of San
Francisco, the picture isn't quite as bleak as it was 150 years
ago, unless you're a 49ers fan, of course.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Geary was elected mayor in 1849 as the Gold Rush was
getting under way, and here's what the man had to say about the
city:
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we are without a dollar in the public treasury,
and it is to be feared the city is greatly in debt. You have
neither an office for your magistrate, nor any other public
edifice. You are without a single police officer or watchman, and
have not the means of confining a prisoner for an hour, neither
have you a place to shelter, while living, sick or unfortunate
strangers who may be cast upon our shores, or to bury them when
dead. Public improvements are unknown in San Francisco. In short,
you are without a single requisite necessary for the promotion of
prosperity, nor the protection of property, nor for the maintenance
of order.''
</P>
<P>
   What a nitpicker.
</P>
<P>
   But note that Mayor Geary didn't take any shots at Muni. It was
a sensitive topic, since one of his campaign promises was to fix
Muni in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   SHE SUES BARBIE for defamation of gender:
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Martin was in a Right Start kids' store, noticed a line
of dolls from the Smartees company. Different dolls have different
questions on the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to help animals?'' Inside is Vicky the
Veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to help people?'' Inside is ... No, not Bertha the
Brain Surgeon or Monica the Molecular Biologist. But: Ashley the
Attorney.
</P>
<P>
   FRANK McCOURT (``Angela's Ashes,'' ``'Tis'') stopped by
Whitehall Tavern, where little brother Michael tends bar. Frank had
the good fortune to be born into abject poverty and get kicked
around as an immigrant to America, thus being provided with rich
writing material.
</P>
<P>
   I could be a hotshot memoir writer, too, if while I was working
my way through college my envious fellow New York dockworkers had
spread pigeon poop on my sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Frank is in demand. His presence is requested by
Congress and the N.Y. Times Editorial Board. At recent book
signings, one woman brought him a lemon meringue pie (a rare treat
in his starving-immigrant days), and another brought him a bunch of
parsley, for no known reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman,'' McCourt told Kevin Keating, ``confessed that she
had shaved her legs for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicks dig the Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   STREISAND called him Tchaikovsky when he wrote and produced her
music. Among other titles, George Michalski is king of the
super-hip piano bar.
</P>
<P>
   His Monday night sessions at the Cypress Club were legendary,
now history. Friday (5-8 p.m.), Tchaikovsky-Michalski starts a
weekly gig high-high atop the Sir Francis Drake in Harry Denton's
Starlight Room.
</P>
<P>
   OR MAYBE you're looking for something more businesslike. Such as
Thursday nights at Spago in Palo Alto, now known as ``IPO
Thursday.'' It's a spontaneous drop-in of 100 or so
ultra-fast-track cyber-sooners, like: Steve Ballmer, Microsoft
pres.
</P>
<P>

 FORBES SAYS INTERNET MUST BE FREE TO FLOURISH AS CAPITALIST TOOL  &HT;     By PAMELA J. PODGER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Republican Steve Forbes came to the belly
of Silicon Valley Wednesday and expounded on his vision for strong
e-commerce, unfettered Internet trade and other steps to help
digital businesses prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the new frontier of freedom in the digital
age,'' Forbes told about 300 high-tech leaders attending a
Churchill Club luncheon at the Marriott Hotel in Santa Clara. ``We
dare not smother this infant of progress in the cradle. We must
nurture it and let it grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who attended a San Francisco fund-raiser at the Mark
Hopkins Hotel last night, heads next to San Diego and Orange
counties.
</P>
<P>
   In his Silicon Valley appearance, he sounded themes considered
important to high-tech, urging a permanent ban on Internet taxes,
an increase in visas for high-tech workers and deregulation of the
telecommunications and financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   He said the abolition of the capital-gains tax will help unleash
new investments and innovation, creating new jobs. ``The
capital-gains tax is a tax on the future,'' he said. ``In a Forbes
administration, it will go the way of the vacuum tube.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the recent Microsoft ruling,
Forbes said it will be regarded as a ``curiosity'' in the future.
``By the time this wends its way through the courts, it will be the
equivalent of `Jurassic Park,''' said Forbes, adding that the
decision was issued by a ``judge who still likes to write on
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Microsoft's dominance has not stifled competition.
Venture capital still flows to e-commerce ventures, more homes are
wired to connect with the Internet, the Palm Pilot and other
electronic organizers have been created, and Apple Computers has
made a strong comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``What harm was done? I think a case could be made that
innovation was not destroyed as the government contends,'' said
Forbes. ``If this (Microsoft) is a monopolistic power that controls
the universe, it is a pretty feeble one.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who is trailing in third place in national and New
Hampshire polls, predicted he will do better than in 1996, when he
entered the race late.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, his campaign's organizational strengths, his
accessibility at public forums and editorial boards throughout
California are giving voters more opportunities to understand his
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do things right until election day, which is the ultimate
poll,'' Forbes said.

 WELLS FARGO, BOFA LIMIT USE OF ATMS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a pointed warning to San Francisco about ATM surcharges,
California's two biggest banks announced that they will stop
letting noncustomers use their cash machines in Santa Monica when a
law barring the fees takes effect there Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America said it will take similar action in San
Francisco next month, when the city's voter-approved surcharge ban
is set to begin, unless the law is blocked in court. Wells Fargo
said it hasn't yet decided what it will do if the San Francisco ban
takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   The moves represent an escalation in the increasingly bitter
dispute between consumer groups and city officials on one side and
banks on the other side  &LR; over the practice of charging a fee for
ATM cash withdrawals to people who keep their accounts at other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business should be expected to provide free service to
noncustomers,'' said Gene Taylor, the top retail banking official
in the West for North Carolina's Bank of America, in a statement
announcing the bank's decision to cut ATM access to noncustomers
unless it can collect a surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, San Francisco and Santa Monica officials
described the banks as sore losers unwilling to accept the will of
voters or their elected representatives. ``Here are these enormous
institutions behaving like an 8-year-old boy who says, `If I can't
win, I'll take my marbles and go home,' '' said San Francisco City
Attorney Louise Renne.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Golinger, consumer program director of California Public
Interest Research Group, co-sponsor of San Francisco's ballot
measure banning ATM surcharges, called the cutoff ``a desperate act
by fee-addicted bankers attempting to scare off ATM laws in other
cities.``
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Second Fee at Issue
</P>
<P>
   At issue is one of two fees that consumers usually pay when they
use a cash machine not belonging to the bank, thrift or credit
union where they keep their money.
</P>
<P>
   The first fee is what financial institutions charge their own
customers for using an outside ATM, typically $2 in California. The
second fee is the ATM surcharge, the fee the outside ATM owner
charges noncustomers who use their machines, typically $1.50 in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Only that second fee, the ATM surcharge, is banned under the San
Francisco and Santa Monica laws.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco voters approved Proposition F banning ATM
surcharges by a 2-to-1 ratio November 2. Santa Monica's City
Council enacted a similar measure October 12.
</P>
<P>
   The two cities are the first in the country to ban ATM
surcharges by referendum or legislation. State officials in Iowa
and Connecticut have barred the fees through administrative action,
and the Pentagon has proposed banning surcharges in installations
under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   BofA, Wells Fargo and the California Bankers Association filed
suit to overturn the two laws in a San Francisco federal court last
week, the day after the election. District Judge Vaughn Walker has
scheduled a hearing for Monday on the bank's request for an order
halting the surcharge bans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the San Francisco and Santa Monica bans have prompted
officials in cities from New York to San Diego to consider similar
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Moves by banks to prevent noncustomers from using their cash
machines could run afoul of rules set by the big ATM switching
networks _ such as the Star System and Visa's Plus and MasterCard's
Cirrus networks _ which connect machines owned by different
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Star System rules let banks remove a small fraction of their
ATMs from the network, a Star spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of cash machines in Santa Monica are presumably
well within that limit. But any widespread moves by BofA and Wells
Fargo to deny noncustomers access to ATMs would violate network
rules, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some serious implications,'' said Jeffrey Cheung,
executive vice president of California Bank &AMP; Trust, a unit of
Utah's Zions Bancorporation.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo consulted with network officials before cutting
noncustomers off in Santa Monica, spokesman Lance Berg said. ``This
decision does not violate the network rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of their statewide networks of thousands of cash machines, only
the 21 BofA ATMs and 12 Wells Fargo ATMs in Santa Monica are
cutting off access to noncustomers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ATM surcharges are big income producers for the two banks. The
188 BofA ATMs and 174 Wells Fargo machines in San Francisco
generate about $5.5 million in yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Wells Fargo has said it takes in about $50 million
annually in surcharges. BofA won't say what it makes from ATM
surcharges, but if the bank's usage rates are comparable to Wells
Fargo's, the figure is probably between $125 million and $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   At a San Francisco news conference Wednesday, BofA officials
played down the revenue issue and stressed the principles of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly about this issue,'' said former
California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, now an executive in BofA's
private bank, which provides banking services to the wealthy. ``Is
it fair for consumers to demand products and services for free?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups accuse banks of double-charging noncustomers,
since they already get a portion of the fee consumers pay their own
financial institutions for using an outside ATM. These so-called
interchange fees charged by the ATM owner to the customer's bank
are typically 50 cents for each withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   BofA officials declined to answer questions about other income
in addition to surcharges the bank gets when noncustomers use its
ATMs, such as interchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim that ATM service is being given away for free is
nonsense,'' said Santa Monica Deputy City Attorney Adam Radinsky.
``The banks are already well compensated for every ATM
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathleen Shilkret said the surcharge
bans are unfair because machines not owned by financial
institutions _ including many of those installed in supermarkets,
convenience stores, gas stations and casinos _ will still be
allowed to levy surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns against ATM surcharges ``are deliberate moves by
consumer groups to upset people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of small and midsize banks were torn by the BofA and
Wells Fargo moves.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, many small banks also levy ATM surcharges, and
officials support the right of the big banks to impose fees. At the
same time, they fear that customers will move to the big banks if
they can no longer use their ATM cards widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a positive for our customers,'' said Steven
Barlow, executive vice president of Mechanics Bank in Richmond.
``It means fewer machines and less convenience for them.''

 SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM'S ART TREASURES RECOVERED  &HT;     By JONATHAN CURIEL and STACY FINZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Twenty-one years after brazen art thieves broke
through a skylight at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum
and stole four prized paintings, three of the works have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch Old Master paintings include the most valuable piece,
``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' which was painted by either Rembrandt or a
17th century contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified man dropped off the Dutch paintings at a New
York auction house last week, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A de Young Museum curator in New York confirmed Wednesday that
the paintings, which had been ripped and damaged, are the ones
stolen in 1978 during the biggest and most daring art heist in San
Francisco history.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' the recovered works
include Aert van der Neer's ``River Scene at Night'' and Anthonie
de Lorme's ``Interior of the Church of St. Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Who stole the works, who returned them and where they have been
over the past two decades remain mysteries. The fate of the fourth
painting, Willem van de Velde's ``Harbor Scene,'' also is not
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased to have them recovered, but it's not all
euphoria,'' Harry Parker, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco, said last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' which was worth $1 million in 1978,
might be worth $20 million today if it were in perfect condition
and if it is an authentic Rembrandt. Some scholars believe
``Portrait of a Rabbi'' was painted by a student or a colleague of
Rembrandt. Now that the painting has been returned, it can be
examined by experts using verification techniques and technology
that did not exist in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very valuable,'' said Louis Webre, a vice president
with William Doyle Galleries in New York, where the works were
returned.
</P>
<P>
   A man dropped off the paintings in a box November 2, when the
auction house was holding its weekly ``Walk-in Tuesdays'' a day in
which the public can bring in a prized possession and have it
appraised by an expert. The man left the box on the floor of the
gallery and left before anyone noticed him. Alan Fausel, an art
specialist at the gallery, received an anonymous call hours later
from someone who told him to look for the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we didn't know if the box contained something
dangerous, we called the police,'' Webre said.
</P>
<P>
   New York police later contacted the FBI. Soon after opening the
box, Fausel and authorities realized the paintings inside were
three of the four stolen from the de Young. A note inside was
written in English and did not include an detailed explanation _ or
an apology, said Parker.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents want to question the man who left the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we see up to 100 people on Tuesdays and didn't
get a good look at him,'' Webre said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how much harm has been done to ``Portrait of a
Rabbi.'' Parker said that the thieves tried to ``clean'' the
painting and caused some damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three paintings, ``River Scene at Night,'' was cut in
three. The other returned work, ``Interior of the Church of St.
Lawrence,'' was also damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so sad,'' Parker said. ``These paintings have
not been cared for'' since being stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The four works were stolen on Christmas Eve, in the middle of
the night. The thieves broke into the de Young through a gallery
skylight, removed the paintings, then escaped through the skylight
by climbing atop an antique cabinet on display.
</P>
<P>
   Museum guards discovered the theft on Christmas Day. At the
time, the museum's skylight was not equipped with an electronic
alarm. After the theft, the museum paid $1.2 million to install
security devices and offered a $50,000 reward for the paintings'
return.
</P>
<P>
   The theft could have been worse. The thieves apparently did not
realize that another painting by Rembrandt _ ``Portrait of Joris
Decaullerii'' _ was in the gallery that day. That portrait, which
has been verified as an authentic Rembrandt, is now worth between
$25 million and $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not too knowledgeable,'' said Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' even if it is not an authentic
Rembrandt, may still be worth $1 million. It is 31 inches by 251/2
inches, and is dated from 1657. The other three paintings were
worth $75,000, collectively, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen paintings were not insured, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why someone decided to return the three paintings
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because of guilt,'' Parker speculated, ``and maybe
it's (because they) didn't have so many options left to do with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Their return was a cause for celebration among art lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art market has been beleaguered with so many stories of
art thefts that we're so happy to be part of the solution,'' said
Webre, the gallery executive.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the paintings will be returned next week and that
they will eventually be displayed, especially because of the
interest they have piqued since their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic theft and unexpected return ``make their curiosity
value go up,'' Parker said.

OLD FOES PROTECT CONSERVATION BILL EARMARKING OIL ROYALTIES
FOR  ENVIRONMENT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two longtime congressional enemies _ East Bay
Democrat George Miller and Alaska Republican Don Young _ Wednesday
threw their combined weight behind sweeping legislation that would
tap billions of dollars in offshore oil royalties for environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary display of bipartisanship, Young joined
Miller, whom he deposed as chairman of the House Resources
Committee in 1994, to fight off a raft of amendments from
Republicans and move what Young called ``a truly historic bill''
through the committee 37 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   All the committee's Democrats and 13 Republicans voted in favor.
Young said that was enough to give the legislation a good shot at
House passage by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller heralded the legislation as the ``most significant
environmental legislation in 25 years,'' calling it ``sweeping in
its scope, unique in its parentage and long overdue.'' He thanked
Young for having the ``courage'' to make compromises.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was hammered out over two months of intense
negotiations that brought ardent property rights conservative
Richard Pombo, R-Stockton, together with Miller, who is equally
fervid in support of environmental regulation and federal land
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would earmark $2.9 billion a year in revenue raised
from federal fees on offshore oil and gas drilling _ $2 billion a
year more than is currently earmarked for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Money would be available for states and localities to spend on
coastal protection, urban parks, wildlife conservation, historic
preservation, land acquisition and other conservation efforts.
Coastal states like California would get a larger share of the
money than landlocked states.
</P>
<P>
   California would receive roughly a third of a billion dollars
every year to spend on conservation projects. And extra money would
be specifically allocated to coastal counties, such as San
Francisco, San Mateo and Marin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said Jay Watson, California director for the
Wilderness Society. ``It came out of the committee unscathed, and I
think it is a terrific accomplishment. When it is enacted, it will
be a historic moment in land conservation in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists in the packed committee room marveled aloud at the
``extraordinary'' compromise between the two powerful House members
whose often bitter, ideological divisions have thwarted efforts to
pass new conservation legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure I've taken my lumps on this bill, and George
has taken his,'' Young said, ``but this is the first time we've
ever been in a lump together.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill still faces tough going in the full House. Amendment
votes revealed deep fractures in Republican ranks. Pombo promised
to fight the bill after failing to insert an amendment to protect
landowners surrounded by federal land from stricter environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Equally profound splits divide the environmental community, with
the Audubon Society and the Wilderness Society supporting the
legislation, and the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife and the
National Parks and Conservation Fund opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club lobbyist Melinda Pierce said the biggest problem
with the bill is a provision that she argued could allow
conservation money to be used for road construction. Pierce said
Louisiana wants to use part of its money to rebuild its coastal
Highway One.
</P>
<P>
   Miller spokesman Danny Weiss said the provision was the subject
of hours of negotiations that left Miller satisfied that
``sufficient safeguards'' exist to prevent conservation money from
being spent on roads or other building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before people oppose this legislation, they should consider
long and hard the benefits,'' Weiss said. ``We're talking in
California $320 million a year for environmental purposes. That's
very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law sets aside roughly $900 million from oil revenues
for the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, but just $370
million of that is spent on conservation because Congress spends
the money on other things. The new bill would change that dynamic
by earmarking the money, so that states would have to either use it
for conservation or lose their allotment.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan coalition included powerful Republicans from
states with huge coastlines, including Alaska and Louisiana.
Louisiana's Rep. Billy Tauzin, who forcefully turned back
amendments from his GOP colleagues, argued that the bill includes
important new property rights protections.
</P>
<P>
   While the bill won support from a bizarre coalition of lobbies,
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Wilderness Society, it had
some familiar critics. Republican Senator Helen Chenowith-Hage of
Idaho faxed out a press release headlined, ``Stop the Great Land
Acquisition!''
</P>
<P>
   Young shot back at opponents on both the right and left. He
accused those who claim the measure provides incentives for
offshore drilling of perpetrating ``outright lies,'' and he said of
claims that it strips property owners of their rights, ``Frankly,
that is utterly ridiculous.''  &LR;

   COMMENTARY: HOW TO CLEAN MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS
</P>
<P>
   Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial queues for release
Sunday, Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   By ANDREW J. GLASS
</P>
<P>
   c .1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflect on a world in which any attempted phone
call could prompt a computerized voice to say: ``Your provider is
not authorized to reach this number. Please use a valid provider.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a hodgepodge existed until Ma Bell came on the scene as a
regulated monopoly. When she went away in the 1980s, universal
service remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now reflect on the federal judge who has branded Microsoft an
illegal monopoly that has run roughshod over the
electronic-business economy. In mulling potential sanctions,
prosecutors have set as their goal dissolving Microsoft's Windows
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a position to get a rather dramatic remedy,''
Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney general, told The New York
Times. ``It's an overwhelming opinion now that it has to address
their monopoly in operating systems'' for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But busting up Windows (as opposed to busting up Microsoft)
neither protects consumers nor elevates the economy. Instead, we
should invoke the antitrust laws to reflect the real world by
turning Windows into a regulated monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   To see how that might be done, you need to look back to 1889,
when the notorious financier Jay Gould gained such a choke hold
over railroad facilities in St. Louis that his rivals couldn't
carry anything or anyone across the Mississippi River without
paying an outrageous fee to the Gould combine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, the Supreme Court denied the government's bid to
dismantle the cartel. But the court also ordered Gould to charge
usage fees that would ``place every (competitor) upon as nearly an
equal plane ... as that occupied by (Gould's) companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal principle set forth in the Terminal Railroad case has
come to be known as the essential facilities doctrine. Quite
simply, it holds that a monopolist who controls a facility
essential to other competitors must provide reasonable access to
that facility.
</P>
<P>
   To declare Windows and its built-in Internet Explorer browser to
be an essential facility would be to acknowledge that technological
progress is often served best through a common standard _ which can
be, but need not be, the best available system. That approach has
placed Europe's one-size-fits-all wireless grid many years ahead of
the fractured U.S. grid for cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   IBM paved the way in 1981 by adopting an open standard for its
trail-blazing line of personal computers. That decision led to
Microsoft's eventual dominance while fueling a digital revolution
that has changed how we live and work.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Windows over to an industry-wide consortium as a
low-cost essential facility wouldn't bar the remaining branches of
the Microsoft corporate tree from sprouting further innovative
products or from enjoying financial rewards. But it would put
Windows under the same sort of strict regimen that today requires
natural gas pipelines, municipal piers, airport terminals and
travel reservation systems to welcome all comers.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a solution could also mean compensating
Microsoft to comply with the unfair takings clause of the Fifth
Amendment. In practice, it could prove too bold a software diet for
the courts to swallow.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Israel's dilemma in one square block
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only are the Israelis trying again to make peace with the
Palestinians. Now they also must make peace with the Christians.
That's because the Israelis have been trying to be fair to Muslims.
Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   All this is over what amounts to a zoning dispute, but one to
which the disputants have brought outsized demands, umbrage and
threats. The Holy Land is having another of its little holy wars.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a vacant lot in Nazareth. Catholics, though they
have no title, want it as a plaza for their cathedral, but Muslims
have camped there for a year, staking a finders-keepers claim. They
consider the lot a proper site for a mosque, if not holy at least
historically sanctified by its association with Saladin.
</P>
<P>
   Saladin was the warrior who ran the Crusaders out of medieval
Palestine, forcing the church militant to recede from its
high-water mark and humbling Christendom. The Middle East is, in
effect, an open-ended grudge match. Clashes over the disputed lot
sparked riots in Nazareth last Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which doesn't have a dog in this fight, has tried to
split the differences. It granted permission for a mosque but
persuaded Muslims to build one of only modest size. An early plan
called for minarets taller than the steeples of nearby churches, an
exercise in literal theological one-upmanship. And Israel convinced
Muslims to delay construction until Christian millennial
celebrations are over.
</P>
<P>
   For their exercise in Solomonic triangulation the Israelis have
won only grief.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic and Orthodox leaders say they will close their churches
in Nazareth for two days in protest. (Worship is expendable?) They
are threatening to torpedo the millennium tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   There are even mutterings from the Vatican that John Paul II may
cancel his trip to Israel next March. The peaceable pope doesn't
want to fight with the Muslims. He wants Israel to.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders have declared Israel's attempt to accommodate
Muslims an ``act of clear discrimination against the Christian
community.'' The Catholic spokesman even said, ``The entity to be
punished by this action is Israel. The Palestinians have proven
that they are better at protecting minority rights.'' Yet in their
time, Palestinians, when they controlled East Jerusalem, paved
roads with Jewish gravestones and denied Jews access to their holy
sites. Not to mention that Saladin thing.
</P>
<P>
   Through its ministry of religious affairs, Israel takes its
stewardship of the holy sites of three religions seriously,
deferring their management to each religion's authority and
intruding only where it must. (Refereeing sectarian Christian
disputes, for instance, which at times can be like refereeing a
National Hockey League game.)
</P>
<P>
   For its pains in Nazareth, Israel has sputtering priests,
indignant patriarchs, a sulking pope and marginally peeved Muslims
on its hands. And the apocalyptic millenarians are warming up and
ready to go in, Coach.
</P>
<P>
   Making peace with the Palestinians may begin to look like light
labor.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Blame it on anything, even your dog
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 14, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my four children were growing up and one or more of them
unintentionally (I think) damaged something in the house, it always
was Brownie who got the blame. Brownie was a boxer dog we had, who
apparently was capable of leaving chocolate cookie stains on
bedsheets, toys askew in the living room, bubble gum stuck under
the kitchen chair and ceramic lamps shattered on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   During any of these incidents, with me giving it my best
I'm-mad-as-hell look, the children would tell me: ``Brownie did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Brownie. He was a scapegoat; he bore the blame for others.
</P>
<P>
   Few admit to doing anything wrong these days. It's always
someone or something else.
</P>
<P>
   When computers began to creep into our lives, it offered
potential for scapegoating. The payment of bills, the recording of
satisfied bills and any number of things are done by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus were computers linked to the Brownie Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the computer: ``Oh, the computer is down. Can you
call back in a day or two?'' Or: ``We're in the process of putting
in new computers and so we can't handle your complaint now.'' Or:
``No, I don't see it on the computer. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is getting to be old hat, so there is need for
a new, updated scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   We've got two of them: Y2K and solar flares.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a health physicist reported that the sun's 11-year
cycle will peak in March 2000, which could, the article said,
``expose travelers and flight crews to the equivalent of 20 chest
X-rays.'' It added that people who fly more than 75,000 miles
annually could face a 1 percent higher risk of dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the 20 percent higher risk to smokers, 35 percent
higher risk to people who don't exercise, an additional 15 percent
risk to those who eat fatty foods and 35 percent risk to people who
drink a quart or so of vodka every day and life cycles are in deep
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to have frequent fliers dispatched via solar flares,
an article this month alluded to those same flares. There was
nothing in it, however, about the flying public. Instead, this was
about the flares interrupting power grids, satellites, pagers and
just about everything but your mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves an opportunity for power companies, cellular phone
people, paging companies and the like to transfer blame for lack of
service from their everyday company goof-ups to the flaring object
93 million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But this will not affect us until March. Before then, we've got
Y2K to blame. The doomsday zealots think we won't have to worry
about March solar flares because we're all going poof on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is very real, somewhere. Our mails are flooded with notices
from the bank, the credit card company and others that they are
Y2K-complaint, yet so many of us are hiding under our beds on New
Year's Eve, along with the cash we've squirreled away just in case
the ATM machines start dispensing Mountain Dew.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers, facing 1 percent greater risk of getting
cancer, won't have to worry either. On Jan. 1, all the planes are
going to fall out of the sky. Or haven't you heard?
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K Syndrome, cousin to the Brownie Syndrome, has been
activated. Just this past week, my daughter received a notice that
she was overdue on a payment. Psst! The payment is not due until
March -- sometime around the solar flare crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   When she called the creditor to register her displeasure with a
premature dunning, the person on the other end told her it was a
Y2K problem and to just ignore the bill _ which also threatened to
turn her account over to a collection agency if she did not pay up
within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The course of human history often has been diverted through
scapegoating. In its worst form, civilizations can be annihilated
through scapegoating. It also can, and is, maneuvered to shirk
responsibility, credibility and sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be used even to slander your dog.

AIR CAMPAIGN OVER IRAQ CALLED GROWING US RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND JONATHAN GORVETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Air Force officers are increasingly worried that
the pilots flying in the United States' $1 billion-a-year air
campaign over Iraq face growing risks due to anti-aircraft fire and
the intense pace of the mission, which is straining both the pilots
and their jets.
</P>
<P>
   As the US pursues its quiet war with Iraq, a one-sided air
battle in which US and allied pilots have dropped more than 1,000
bombs this year, Clinton administration officials harbor fears that
a pilot will eventually be shot down or crash, giving Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein a propaganda victory and raising the
profile of a military mission that few officials want to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of the loss of American lives was raised earlier
this week when the Pentagon said US pilots have reported ``a couple
of close calls'' with anti-aircraft fire in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's just dumb luck'' on the part of Iraqi gunners,
said Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   But US Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican and
chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, said an even
greater risk may be a malfunction of one of the approximately 200
US fighter jets because of the harsh climate and the high number of
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is risky, day in and day out,'' Goss said in an
interview. ``I'm very concerned that we are using the equipment,
the planes, at such a rate that we are wearing out the planes and
the pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   US and allied pilots have been flying daily sorties over
northern and southern Iraq almost since the end of the 1991 Gulf
War to protect the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Arabs in the
south from Hussein's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which has protested the no-fly zones and repeatedly asked
the United Nations to order a halt to it, has stepped up
anti-aircraft fire at US and British aircraft since Operation
Desert Fox, a four-day US bombing campaign in December.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as an incentive, Saddam has offered an approximately
$25,000 bounty to any gunner who shoots down a US jet. Even though
US officials say Iraq's anti-aircraft technology is crude, pilots
routinely fly at altitudes of at least 20,000 feet for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, the Pentagon spokesman, refused to give details about
the recent near-misses, but he described the anti-aircraft fire as
``ready, aim, fire _ just trying to put as much flak up in the sky
in hopes of a one-in-a million shot.''
</P>
<P>
   US Central Command says Iraq has fired at US and British jets
more than 350 times to date, prompting return fire from pilots. But
US pilots also have on a number of occasions in recent months set
off on aggressive missions to bomb anti-aircraft batteries,
including one that attacked more than 30 targets.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, US pilots have flown more than 6,000 sorties.
The jets take off from bases in Turkey and Saudi Arabia and from
aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf. Since the end of the Gulf
War, no US or allied jet has been either shot down or crashed over
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the number of total missions there, the fact there
has been no loss of life or aircraft is absolutely phenomenal,''
said Capt. Ron Watrous, spokesman at Central Command Air Force at
Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina. ``You're talking about
operating in some very harsh conditions, for which you need a lot
of time and care to put into those aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Watrous said maintenance officers have sufficient time to keep
up the aircraft. ``The record speaks for itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But two US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said senior Air Force officials have strongly expressed their
concern in recent months about the condition of the fighter jets
and the rigorous schedule of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Goss said he has heard similar sentiments. He also said
that there should be much more public debate over the military
mission in Iraq and its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have repeatedly said the US military
flights have helped contain Saddam, a key component of US policy
toward Iraq. But Goss said, ``It's a strange thing for Americans to
agree to be bombing another civilization of innocent people because
we don't like the guy who is running the railroad. This is not good
for many reasons, including what I cynically call collateral
damage, by which I mean arms and legs and human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   At Incirlik Air Force Base in southern Turkey, pilots said last
month that their lives seemed an endless cycle of flights, attacks
and counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned real fast here into Groundhog Day,'' said one pilot,
who asked that his name not be used in case his jet is shot down.
``They call this `the forgotten war.' You know, `what if somebody
held a war and nobody came', but while all eyes have been on
Kosovo, daily this was happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another pilot from Stoughton, Mass.: ``Last summer people
were saying Kosovo was the most protracted conflict there was. But
I thought, wait a minute, since Desert Fox, it's been on again, off
again, pretty much on again since then for us.''

   Florida's role in WW II revealed in Kleinberg book
</P>
<P>
   My friend and colleague Eliot Kleinberg, who is threatening to
turn into the Martin Gilbert of Florida history, has written
another book. Florida in World War II is full of interesting
vignettes of our state's always surprising history. Did you know,
for instance, that there's a cemetery in Florida containing 23
Englishmen who were killed in training?
</P>
<P>
   There's also full documentation of the German U-boats that
patrolled off the coast, whose crews, according to urban legend,
came ashore to have a drink or two along Worth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The book is published by the Florida Historical Society and may
be ordered directly from them.
</P>
<P>
   Te-pocketa-te-pocketa ...
</P>
<P>
   The winner of this year's Thurber Award is Our Dumb Century, the
riotous compilation of fake front pages from the online newspaper
The Onion. The award is given by the Thurber House, in Columbus,
Ohio, where the climate and the local dialect force many people
into comedy.
</P>
<P>
   This year's judges were the famously blocked writer Fran
Lebowitz, the famously unblocked writer George Plimpton and Max
Rudin, who publishes the Library of America. Winning a posthumous
award was Veronica Geng, who probably feels a lot better about
dying young than she used to.
</P>
<P>
   Dear John Adams ...
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library has published an original compilation called
Jefferson Abroad ($22.95). The collection concerns itself with the
five years Thomas Jefferson spent in Paris, where he adored the
people but found the government and sexual mores abominable. Well,
maybe Meat Loaf was wrong; maybe two out of three is bad.
</P>
<P>
   All of the letters have been previously published in the
multiple volumes of Jefferson's letters, but there is much here
that is unfamiliar to the general reader, especially Jefferson's
flirtatious, witty letters to Maria Cosway, who was, unfortunately,
married to somebody else:
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to breakfast with you according to promise, and you had
gone off at 5 o'clock in the morning. This spared me indeed the
pain of parting, but it deprives me of the comfort of recollecting
that pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote Unquote ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What they never tell you is that yes, anyone can become a
writer. Merely consider any book by Judith Krantz and you'll know
it's true. The trick is not to become a writer, it is to stay a
writer. Day after day, year after year, book after book. And for
that, you must keep working, even when it seems beyond you.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The winter heat in New Hampshire
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Naming only one leader of four hot-spot
countries in a TV reporter's recent pop quiz isn't a fatal flaw for
George W. Bush's presidential candidacy. Bush's communications
director Karen Hughes correctly pointed out that very few people in
America could have done so.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is nipping
at Gov. Bush's heels in New Hampshire, the fact Bush was unfamiliar
with those names underlines that his concentration for the last few
years has been on, in reverse order, state government, baseball and
the oil bidness. International affairs hasn't been high on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Texas governor has been more intent on
shaking hands in New Hampshire, California and South Carolina than
on brushing up on the pecking order in Chechnya. Meanwhile, Bush's
dwindling lead over McCain in New Hampshire polls swings the
spotlight in McCain's direction. With contenders such as Dan
Quayle, Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander already conceding that
Bush's lead in money and the polls killed their candidacies, McCain
is now about the last standing mainstream alternative to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when there may be increasing nervousness about
fidgety former Soviet states with the bomb, a reunified Germany and
jitters elsewhere in the world, the nation may be looking for
someone whose tests have included more than being the president's
oldest son.
</P>
<P>
   So while George W. figures out a way to joke about his pop quiz
experience, like he did after shooting a killdeer while hunting
doves, McCain will get even more time in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, of course, is that he may also be toasted by it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, who co-managed Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, once
commented that nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the
laser-hot attention of the New Hampshire primary, where the media
focus has the intensity of a thousand suns.
</P>
<P>
   Part of McCain's feisty appeal is that he not only faced real
combat in Vietnam, but also spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war.
Before and after, he had a reputation as a tell-it-like-it-is,
against-the-grain kind of guy whose opinion you didn't ask for
unless you really wanted it _ and often you didn't have to ask.
</P>
<P>
   That damn-the-torpedoes demeanor of bravado and occasional anger
has its definite appeal. It reminds of the late President ``Give
'em Hell'' Harry Truman, who called a critic of his daughter's
singing an SOB and said of the president's desk that ``the buck
stops here.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who served in the Texas Legislature with another former
POW now in Congress, Republican Sam Johnson of Dallas, said Johnson
feels completely free to do what he thinks is right. Johnson's
torture back then gives him a calmness now to stand up to any
political heat he may encounter, from his party's leadership or
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they gonna do _ break his arms?'' the former
legislator asked.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain has his shot at much greater attention. The question
now is whether he can survive that as successfully as he did his
POW experience _ and whether closer inspection of his temperament
will make him look like a steely-eyed warriorr, or a loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and his advisers, mindful of Bush's own reputed
temper, will be carefully watching to see just how tough John
McCain really is.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Have schools conveyed clear and present danger of
words?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When my youngest son was in second grade learning
spelling words, his teacher, Mrs. Robson, liked to slip in a
vocabulary stretch or two that was as imposing as the gaps in his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   My son's favorite show-off word from class was
``terror-stricken.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have spelled it two hundred times, the ``s'' whistling
like it came from inside a pop bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robson has retired, so I can't advise her on stretching
words in 1999. But for all second-grade teachers who remain, I want
to offer a phrase to share with your class: ``terroristic threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Spell it. Define it. Discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going in the post-Columbine age,
``terroristic threat'' is going to threaten gum chewing as the No.
1 disciplinary problem in public schools. And unlike gum, which you
can't chew without meaning to, some children who don't mean to
terrorize anyone are going to get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That will be because we big people are reactive by nature. We
don't get down to eye-level with littler ones to actually share
what's bothering us, or what's bothering them.
</P>
<P>
   We don't explain. We just throw out blanket pronouncements and
``zero tolerance'' plans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week three children made the news for writing things that
scared other people. A local high school freshman was detained by
juvenile authorities after writing an essay in which he said he'd
``blow up all the schools and kill all the cops'' if he ruled the
world. The charge: terroristic threat.
</P>
<P>
   This came on the heels of a story out of Ponder, Texas, where a
13-year-old spent five days in juvenile detention for doing what
his teacher asked: write a Halloween horror story. Horror? This was
it: references to real classmates and a real teacher getting blown
away. Is it possible to do an assignment too convincingly?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a 16-year-old in Dallas was suspended for three days
and sent to a school psychologist for months-old death threats
scribbled on his day planner, plus doodles of himself with a gun,
bombs on a school map and a swastika.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things have gotten where it is as serious as saying
there is a bomb on an airplane,'' said District Judge Ralph
Strother.
</P>
<P>
   You can't contest heightened precautions in the wake of school
shootings that had their share of warning signs. And you've got to
assume that these are warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wonders if sufficient thought is going into helping
the average child deal with what he or she sees, feels and
naturally will express.
</P>
<P>
   In Ponder, the school superintendent said the district is
reviewing potentially violent or scary books that may be in the
school library, ``like Goosebumps and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   We blame R.L. Stine for kids being scared?
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering. Does Ponder have televisions? Does the
superintendent realize that the scariest thing any child encounters
isn't some piece of fiction in an easy chair _ it's the evening
news?
</P>
<P>
   Inventorying library books shows that someone isn't focused on
the children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   How many schools, in the wake of Columbine, have had children
sit down and discuss what they're feeling? How many schools have
explained that making a threat must be taken every bit as seriously
as physically hurting someone?
</P>
<P>
   In Ponder, they talked about re-examining writing assignments.
Get real. With some seventh-graders you could ask for a recipe for
pumpkin pie and have severed heads in the whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   What about average children? Aren't they bothered by what they
see? Do they know what a terroristic threat is? Or is this
something with which a child shouldn't be bothered except when his
essay lands before a judge?
</P>
<P>
   Does he get points for spelling ``terror'' correctly?
</P>

Lipton, Stefanie Powers, Mia Farrow and _ perhaps most surprising _
Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher on Dietrich: ``She was a complete woman; she knew how to
be a with a man, how to please a man. She had all the experience in
the world, but her behavior was that of a young woman. She taught
me a lot about love and life.''

   JUMPWORD
</P>
<P>
   From ??
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Eyman
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Books Editor
</P>
<P>
   It's not like he wasn't warned. Carrie Fisher had told her
father, ``Don't say anything bad about Mommy. If you do, you'll
never see Billie again.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie is Carrie Fisher's daughter, Eddie Fisher's
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fisher's new autobiography, Been There, Done That, hit
the stores, the compulsively candid demands of celebrity
autobiography led Fisher to dish, not merely his first wife Debbie
Reynolds, but his second wife Elizabeth Taylor and a host of other
women.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who will be signing copies of the book at Liberties
Tuesday, said the response from family members and ex-family
members has been ``overwhelming, much more than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids and the exes are very unhappy. Carrie wanted to make
sure that I didn't go into details that we both know about. First
she was going to change her name; now she's gonna change her DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I seeing my granddaughter? Not right now, no. There's a
party for Carrie's birthday, which I've always attended, and I
wasn't invited. I hope that when all of this dies down, she'll
forgive me and come back home. I've always loved her madly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is now 70 years old, and his career has long since
headed south, nothing much has changed for Eddie Fisher. He is
still an overgrown kid and marginally famous, known more for the
women he slept with than for his singing, mainly because the women
he slept with were more interesting than his singing.
</P>
<P>
   A self-confessed lousy father (''I didn't do a job with my kids;
I did nothing.'') and professional coaster, Fisher went a long way
on the smooth sound he was born with.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to remmber what a big star Fisher was. The
appropriate analogy might be Sinatra in the early days _ the
bobby-sox period, five shows a day at the Paramount, when he was
every teenage girl's idol. But Sinatra grew and evolved. Fisher
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much in Been There, Done That about singing, but
there is a great deal about women, some of it remarkably crude even
by modern standards. The implication is that women have been more
important than work to Fisher. It's a presumption he says is
absolutely correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing was the most important thing in my life,'' he recalls
from his home in San Francisco. ``I'd been doing it since I was 3
years old, it was my first love, and I turned my back on it. It was
a critical mistake to forget the thing that allowed me to do all
the other things I did in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, what led Fisher astray was drug addiction
begun by the infamous Dr. Max Jacobson, the legendary Dr. Feelgood
whose injections of speed perked up everybody from Cecil B. DeMille
to John F. Kennedy. Fisher's first autobiography, My Life, My Loves
, published 15 years ago, skipped that and a lot of other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reluctant to go into detail and talk about the
intimacies in my life. I thought the first book was very vanilla;
it didn't have the bite. It was not my life story. And I was still
under the influence of drugs when I wrote the first book. I was
kind of afraid; I was thinking of my image and everybody else's. I
wasn't ready 18 years ago to talk about the real hard facts of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard facts, as narrated by Fisher, mainly involve a laundry
list of the women he had sex with. Occasionally, there are some
surprises, often involving women that seemed to be more discreet _
Ann-Margret _ or at least to have better taste _ Marlene Dietrich.
The only notable omission is Madonna, but there's still time.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Marlene Dietrich the best?
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a complete woman; she knew how to be with a man, how
to please a man. She had all the experience in the world, but her
behavior was that of a young woman. She taught me a lot about love
and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's halcyon period was the mid-'50s to the early '60s.
After marrying Debbie Reynolds (''the sex was terrible''), he left
her to marry Elizabeth Taylor after Mike Todd was killed in a plane
crash. There was plenty of money, there were 22 consecutive hit
songs, there were even a few bad movies in which Fisher was the
caboose to his wife of the moment _ Bundle of Joy with Reynolds,
Butterfield 8 with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to call the book Prisoner of Love. I was a matinee
idol, I sang a hell of a song, I was rich, I was good looking. (I
can't say that anymore.) I was charming. I had easy access to all
the women of the world. I was a force. Terrific charisma. I had it
all. And then I blew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it took me two books to write about it. I could
never be bitter. I find that the women, not all of them, but the
few that have responded, are bitter. That's not my way. I'm a cynic
and a pessimist, but I try to be positive. The last thing you want
to do in your life is be bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Fisher is a low-rent tragedy, the equivalent of a
pitcher with a million-dollar arm and a five-cent head. He wasn't
smart enough to realize he was destroying his talent and career
until it was almost gone. The self-realization is evident in his
response to a question about the best performer he ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say that Sinatra was the best. And his longevity,
his growth! He had the best taste _ impeccable, immaculate taste in
music. No one else can claim that kind of repertoire. He didn't
record My Heart Cries for You, or Good Night, Irene. I can't think
of a gimmick song. He didn't want hits, he wanted great songs.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is crushing. Unlike Fisher, Sinatra's primary
allegiance was to his work. Singers such as Sinatra and Tony
Bennett survived the onslaught of Elvis and the Beatles because
they were the gold standard, but there wasn't enough air in the
room for the second tier to survive. Say goodbye Eddie Fisher,
farewell Pat Boone, hasta la vista Dick Haymes.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons Fisher has learned in his life can be quickly
synopsized: There is the one about paying attention to your craft,
and the less obvious but equally true dictum: ``Never marry an
actress.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the biggest misapprehension that people have about him?
</P>
<P>
   ``That the marriages not working out was my fault. I didn't know
that, in any battle with a woman, the man always loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one addiction is not to women or even drugs, it's
fame. Not to take anything away from drugs and alcohol. I never got
over my success. I worked hard, but not that hard. It was easy for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who do a magnificent job handling their
careers, but I didn't have my nose to the grindstone. Becoming a
star was something I could never handle. It changed my personality,
for better and worse. I didn't pursue my career as much as I did
the women I married.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fisher is clean, waiting for his comeback, attempting to
stoke it by peddling stories about women, his conversation halting
and uncertain. He knows just how he lost what he had, but he
doesn't know how to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't even drink Coke, no coffee, no caffeine. I do a
concert now and then. What I really want to do is wind up my life
with one more shot at Carnegie Hall.''

   In an inner-city high school in Queens, conditions are bad and
getting worse. No heat, no books and no support apart from one good
teacher who's quickly suspended. It's an explosion waiting to
happen, and when a bad-attitude cop with a real-life gun is
assigned to patrol the teeming hallways, the fuse is lit.
</P>
<P>
   Light It Up is a surprisingly effective film about an unlikely
bunch of high-schoolers who take over their school after an
accidental shooting, holding the cop (Forest Whitaker) hostage and
barricading the building. They're in way over their heads and they
know it; they also know that though their lives are at stake, this
could be their one and only chance at making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Six kids are involved, and in their characters all the
high-school stereotypes are covered: Lester (Usher Raymond), the
scholar/athlete and unlikely leader; Stephanie (Rosario Dawson),
very smart and very pretty; Ziggy (Robert Ri'chard), artistic and
abused; Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.), high-tech and jaded; Lynn
(Sara Gilbert), pregnant and scared; and Rodney (Fredro Starr),
who's just plain dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   With their hostage and their gun, the kids hold the attention of
the city. The media take up the case and the kids work it, but law
enforcement is itching to get the public-relations nightmare behind
them. The clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Some trite moments _ sob stories, heart-to-hearts, new
understandings _ are overcome by the actors' strengths and
believability. Usher, the R&AMP;B phenom, proves he can carry a movie.
He's ably supported by the others in what amounts to a Breakfast
Club-like arrangement, complete with Judd Nelson as Mr. Knowles,
the teacher who cares.
</P>
<P>
   Light It Up is a bleak tale of breakdown and redemption _ sort
of. It's even inspiring, to a point, and its refusal to bow to
racial stereotyping is absolutely refreshing. There's no easy way
out for the movie or the kids involved, and the tension builds to a
beautifully filmed and inevitable climax, a tragedy with a noble
result.

   THE BELOVED BUFFET
</P>
<P>
   The midnight buffet, once a staple on all cruise ships, has been
disappearing from many lines in favor of smaller specialized
buffets such as a chocolate feast. And with the increase of pizza
parlors on the seas, who needs another buffet? A lot of people,
apparently. A recent Omega World Travel/cruise.com online survey
found respondents going 2-1 in favor of keeping the midnight
buffet. Omega World Travel is a travel management company and
polled 2,416 people in June. Participation in the current online
cruise survey is available at www.cruise.com

   CRUISE CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   Life is sweet on a five-day cruise. Here are a few ways to while
away the hours.
</P>
<P>
   -- 'Re-mineralize' the skin with a seaweed facial; submit to a
105-minute pressure-point and Shiatsu massage; hand your plain,
ugly self over to a European hairstylist for a continental haircut.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eat 13 times a day _ lobster, escargot, cheeseburgers, hot
dogs _ not to mention 24-hour room service. Eggs Benedict, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   -- Viva Mexico! Mariachis! Silver jewelry! Mayan ruins!
</P>
<P>
   -- Pretend to be Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip as you pose
in evening dress for a formal portrait.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bingo, blackjack, slot machines and many more ways to lose
your money.
</P>
<P>
   -- Below: Play a half-court game of basketball on the top deck
(the roll of the ship and ocean wind require special skills).
</P>
<P>
   Left: Port of call, Cozumel, Mexico. You can eat lunch at an
outdoor cafe, shop for silver jewelry or visit Mayan ruins.
</P>
<P>

West before heading home.

<P>
   COZUMEL, Mexico _ Monday, Monday, so good to me.
</P>
<P>
   Monday mornin', it was all I hoped it would be ...
</P>
<P>
   The Mamas and Papas' hymn to that most uninspiring of days
turned into my theme song for a recent cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The song popped into my head on Interstate 95 as I was heading
to the Port of Miami. It really was Monday morning, and I could
have been driving to work. But, fortunately, I was heading south to
hop on Norwegian Cruise Line's Leeward for a five-day jaunt to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise or work? You be the judge:
</P>
<P>
   Monday on the cruise _ five-course lunch and sunset sail east of
the Florida Keys. Monday at work _ greasy cheeseburger and irate
readers who can't find a cheap hotel in Paris, London, New York or
...
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday on the cruise _ games by the pool and a 50-minute
massage by a sturdy English lass who worked miracles on my tense
back muscles. Tuesday at the office _ hunched over the computer
tensing up my back muscles.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Other people must have had the same thought, because quickie
cruises _ three- and four-night trips _ are the fastest-growing
segment of the cruise industry, and for obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For folks who are short on time and money, the Monday-Friday
cruise sure beats a week doing 9 to 5 at the office.
</P>
<P>
   The short cruise makes a great romantic getaway for harried
couples and an easy trip for families who want to get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   And on the five-day cruises, you still have the weekends before
and after for your at-home leisure activities. The short cruises,
especially the three-day cruises, are popular for family reunions,
and the more family you have, the cheaper the fare.
</P>
<P>
   These cruises generally start at about $100 per person per day,
a bargain considering it includes obscene amounts of food (13 times
to dine and snack a day) and lavish entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very popular, especially for Floridians who don't have
to get on an airplane,'' says Stacy Moyer, spokeswoman for
Norwegian Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   The short cruises attract a lot of first-time passengers, who
feel uneasy about committing to a seven-day cruise. And they
attract younger passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line will be bringing the Norwegian Majesty, a
larger ship than the Leeward, to Miami for short cruises beginning
Jan. 7. (The Leeward, which was leased, is going back to its owners
in Finland.)
</P>
<P>
   The three-night cruises from Port of Miami, Port Everglades and
Port Canaveral go to Nassau, Bahamas, and the four-night cruises go
to Mexico, usually with a stop in Key West.
</P>
<P>
   But the ship is usually a bigger attraction than the ports.
Carnival's Ecstasy offers Las Vegas-style shows, neon lights and
lots of bars. The passengers are generally a late-night,
heavy-drinking crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line's ships, however, are known for the
outstanding food and sophisticated entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On my cruise, The Pirates of Penzance, a light opera with full
orchestra, was a highlight. But the casino stayed full, and I know
that one lady won $1,800 because she screamed that fact at the top
of her lungs. The top deck's half basketball court had continuous
pick-up games; and the fitness room was busy with aerobic and
stretching classes.
</P>
<P>
   In Cozumel, you could go to Mayan ruins, shop in silver-jewelry
stores, buy a Panama hat or have lunch in an outdoor cafe. In the
main square in San Miguel, mariachis sang and played their guitars
under flaming poinciana trees, and fishing boats docked in the
harbor in the shadow of mega-cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Key West's Mallory Dock for an afternoon. It was
strange to walk off the ship instead of having to drive the five
hours from West Palm Beach. Passengers took the Conch Train tour,
or walked to Ernest Hemingway's house, or sat in Mallory Square
drinking mango margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   And, then, Friday morning, we were back in Miami. Just in time
for the weekend.

 &HT;    Helping the World War II orphans
 &HT;    By Ben Sutherly
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH TWP., Ohio _ While on a troop ship in the Pacific
Ocean in December 1944, 22-year-old Pfc. Garner Mott mentioned in a
letter to his uncle and aunt that he had received a photograph of
the son he had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Nickey is 5 months old today,'' he wrote. ``Jeannie sent
me a swell picture of her and Nickey today. It just about brought
tears in my eyes. It was so wonderful, they both looked like they
could talk in the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five months later, Mott was killed by mortar fire on
Okinawa. (May 7, 1945)
</P>
<P>
   His infant son, Nick, now a 55-year-old Vietnam veteran, was
among the estimated 183,000 American children left fatherless by
World War II, which claimed 406,000 American lives.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Mott's mother, Jean Brown, 76, of St. Paris, remarried, and
Nick said he was blessed with a good family life. Still, he said,
he always wanted to know his father. Now, 54 years after Garner
Mott's death, his son has found a measure of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nick and his wife, Darlene, became active in the American World
War II Orphans Network.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1991 by Ann Bennett Mix, whose father was killed in
Italy, AWON has helped put to rest unresolved grief and loss
harbored by many sons and daughters of slain or missing soldiers
for more than half a century. AWON locates and registers those left
fatherless by the war and serves as a resource, directing sons and
daughters to military and government records, and to veterans who
knew their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Mix, who serves as AWON's executive director, said the
organization currently has about 500 active members and has located
over 3,000 children who lost their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the network's success in helping people locate
companions of their slain or missing fathers, the Motts began
searching for veterans who knew Nick's father. Through a series of
e-mails, Garner Mott's former platoon leader, Robert ``Bucky''
Pearson, learned of Nick Mott and left a message on Mott's
answering machine in May. Less than three months later, the Motts
met Pearson at a reunion of the 1st Marine Division in
Philadelphia. At the meeting, Mott learned his father was
well-respected by other Marines, and that ``he loved me and thought
about me a lot.'' The experience, Mott said, was healing and gave
him a sense of closure about his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made his dad come alive to us,'' said Darlene Mott. ``Words
can't express how we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   AWON members also communicate with each other online,
encouraging those curious about their long-dead fathers to begin
searching for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orphans are hesitant to search for (information about)
their fathers because of their fear of rejection once they find
someone who knew them, or because they might offend the person by
bringing up bad memories of the war,'' Darlene Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, many veterans welcome hearing from children
of their fallen or missing companions. ``It brings closure for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when Garner Mott would have celebrated his 77th
birthday, Nick and Darlene Mott received a letter from Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought full closure for me as it was what I had hoped
could be,'' Pearson wrote of the Philadelphia reunion. ``It all
came about through your search for anyone who might have known your
Dad in K Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. How great it all was
I I felt that Garner was with me _ with us in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meeting will stay with me forever, and it now seems that
it was something that had to be. I am at peace and it feels so
good. Thank you Nick J. Mott.''
</P>
<P>
   Many AWON members, including the Motts, are empty-nesters who,
after raising their families, have more time to learn who their
fathers were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in our 50s, and everyone's trying to find out the
connection with their fathers,'' Nick Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   Many children left fatherless by World War II also are realizing
that time is running out to locate veterans who may have known
their dads. Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman Steve
Westerfeld said America's World War II veterans are currently dying
at a rate of about 1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   AWON's growth coincides with a number of veteran-related
developments. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _The introduction of Ohio House Bill 116, which would require
school districts to devote at least one hour on Veteran's Day for
observance of the day's significance. The measure would also
require the adoption of a policy regarding recitation of the Pledge
of Allegiance as part of the school's program. Denver Combs,
service officer for the Montgomery County Veterans' Service Center,
said the bill was ``long overdue.'' Combs said he fielded a call
Wednesday from a teacher desiring clarification of the significance
of Veterans Day. The teacher had confused Veterans Day with
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   _A memorial designed to honor World War II veterans, to be
located on the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington
Monument in Washington, D.C. Groundbreaking is currently slated for
Veterans Day 2000 on the 7-acre site. Donors can help AWON meet its
goal to become a ``major contributor'' (minimum $10,000 donation)
by marking the organization's code number (GR090) on their
donation. The group hopes such exposure will help them reach
additional members. More information is available at
www.wwiimemorial.com
</P>
<P>
   _The repeal of a 1990 law in June that permanently terminated
eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation for spouses
of deceased veterans who remarried. Spouses of deceased veterans
may now receive survivor benefits upon termination of a subsequent
marriage.

   A book salty and dry, like a cracker
</P>
<P>
   Fla. journalist's 'Cracker' book salty, dry
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Browning
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I despair of Florida, whenever the whole state appears
broken beyond mending, crowded beyond endurance, Kentucky-fried,
Big-Macked, Starbucked and Taco-Belled beyond recognition _ I visit
Al Burt.
</P>
<P>
   Al Burt lives in retirement on a 6-acre plot of paradise beside
a tranquil lake near Melrose, east of Gainesville, in the scrub-oak
country of Florida. It's a place where deer are still more common
than sport-utility vehicles. He has a new book out, The Tropic of
Cracker, and he read little excerpts of it to me, sitting in his
living room, under a single lamp's light.
</P>
<P>
   It's a book you can judge by its cover, winsome within and
without. Burt, veteran columnist for The Miami Herald, has gotten
painter James F. Hutchinson to lend his art for the dust jacket,
which shows a fiery-blossomed poinciana tree in full bloom. The
poinciana was known as ``the cracker tree'' because it bloomed in
early summer, after the Yankee snowbirds had all gone back north.
</P>
<P>
   Burt knows Florida like his own back yard, and he describes it
as he has seen it himself _ a glowing kingdom within his mind and
memory:
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, the smell of an orange blossom triggers it. For
others, the sight of Spanish moss hanging off the twisted black
limbs of a live oak. For a few, reminders of the wild bring it
alive _ the roar of a bull gator, or maybe the leap of a dolphin
between a swimmer and the shore, or a rattlesnake defensively
coiling under a palmetto and flicking its forked tongue and angrily
rattling its tail. The oddly sweetish taste of a fresh muscadine
grape might do it, or the shock of a dive into the exhilaratingly
cold waters of a deep spring where thousands of bubbles trail
across the body and curious fish swim close to see the intruder.
The sound of the first chuck-will's widow in the spring could
induce it, or the sight of lightning bugs bumping against the
windows at night, flashing semaphore signals from the wild...''
</P>
<P>
   A sweep and vision
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what to say, after such jeweled words, so I
awkwardly praised the dust jacket of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a dust jacket like this, Al, you didn't even have to
write a book,'' I needled him, enviously. ``You could print up the
Melrose telephone directory, wrap this dust jacket around it, and
people would still buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Melrose telephone directory is too shocking for innocent
eyes,'' Burt replied gravely. He has a very dry sense of humor and
is inordinately fond of Melrose, a town he prays no one will
discover.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at my entreaty, he read some more to me, from the last
chapter, which describes Florida, past and future, with the kind of
sweep and vision that only a man who has lived here all his life
can command:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you have not seen Florida in the days when a 50-foot
oceanfront lot at Flagler Beach could be bought for $25 down and
$10 a month, and there were few takers. Maybe you don't remember
when Naples was a remote place, and property sold for the price of
a dinner in a fine restaurant there today, or when Destin was a
long stretch of unbroken dunes, and you could stand out in the Gulf
chin deep and see your feet in the clear water, wondering why so
magnificent a beach had so few people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you don't remember the days when you could meet
strangers in Florida and they probably would be Floridians. Maybe
you don't remember the lean-to shops at citrus groves along the
highway where mom-and-pop owners would go out back and pick some
rust-streaked oranges and squeeze the juice out of them for you _
all you could drink for a
</P>
<P>
   dime ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you don't remember the days when Floridians could go out
on the beach and dig buckets of donax and make soup any night, or
net blue crabs nibbling at a piece of meat tied to a string and
dipped into a briny creek, or stand knee-deep in the surf and cast
out, any day of the week, and fill a frying pan for lunch ...''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a civil tongue
</P>
<P>
   There is a richness and sadness in this book _ Florida is in
many ways going to hell at a high rate of speed _ but Burt never
loses his temper or shouts. He always keeps a civil tongue, remains
patient. He has to. He lives in some degree of physical pain every
day, ever since he was shot nine times by trigger-happy Marines at
a roadblock in Santo Domingo in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His hip was rebuilt, and he armed himself with a succession of
walking canes, visiting every corner of the state for over 30
years, interviewing everyone, seeing everything, watching small,
colorful histories unfold and writing them down in his weekly
column..
</P>
<P>
   These columns, expanded, reworked and interpreted, form the
contents of Tropic of Cracker. The result is a museum of Florida's
choicest people, places and moments.
</P>
<P>
   Here are pen portraits of John Olan Pearce Sr., an old-time
Florida cattleman; Norton Baskin, husband of Marjorie Kinnan
Rawlings; the Suwannee River; pioneers around Lake Okeechobee; Paul
Dickman, founder of the town of Ruskin; Zora Neale Hurston, the
brilliant black writer who died in poverty, working as a maid;
Virgil D. Hawkins, who fought to become the first black law student
at the University of Florida; R.P. McLendon, the hard-bitten warden
of Raiford known as the ``Dean of Death Row;'' Ross Allen,
legendary reptile expert at Silver Springs; and many more.
</P>
<P>
   There is a thrilling element of rescue to Burt's pages. Many of
the people he interviewed are dead now. He managed to catch them
just before they winked out.
</P>
<P>
   Limited, signed, boxed edition
</P>
<P>
   Burt stopped reading to me, and we talked for a bit about
Florida. The air was absolutely still. There was a breeze from off
the lake, clicking the oak leaves outside, under a star-prickled
sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al, I don't know how many more of these wild nights in Melrose
I can stand, before my health breaks down,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 'bout to reach fever pitch here,'' he agreed, without
missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   The next-best thing to having Al Burt read to you is to read Al
Burt yourself. The Tropic of Cracker, all 240 pages of it, has just
been published by the University of Florida Press at $24.95. A
limited, signed, boxed, two volume edition of Tropic of Cracker,
together with its predecessor, Al Burt's Florida: Snowbirds,
Sand-Castles and Self-Rising Crackers, will be out at the same time
for $65.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I was feeling sluggish,
i.e. like a slug, the other night and decided to forswear books,
the woodshop and even National Public Radio for a night of channel
surfing. I lost some brain cells in the process. (Gary Borders is
editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ The way things are going in the
post-Columbine age, ``terroristic threat'' is going to threaten gum
chewing as the No. 1 disciplinary problem in public schools. And
unlike gum, which you can't chew without meaning to, some children
who don't mean to terrorize anyone are going to get in trouble.

   EDITORIAL-MINWAGE _ Q. When is a minimum wage increase not
really a minimum wage increase? A. When Republicans in Congress use
it as cover for excessive tax breaks. (Shame on Max Cleland for
voting for it.) This measure should be shelved, along with the
so-called bankruptcy reform bill to which it is attached.

   NEW-THANKSGIVING _ For a growing number of people, Thanksgiving
no longer means sitting down to a home-cooked meal. It's still a
time to be with loved ones probably over a feast that features
turkey and dressing...but they're eating it in a restaurant,
carrying it in from the supermarket or take-out shop, or
mail-ordering it from department store catalog. A look at the trend
and what's driving it, plus a short box with some resorces for
folks who don't want to cook. (Walker, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-DISNEYY2K _ ORLANDO _ For most us, welcoming the new

downright over the top, welcoming the new age is a 457-night

World's four major theme parks. The challenge: Do it all in only 3

produced by the Shriver family. It's an extremely reverent telling
of Mary's story, with the necessary embellishments, kept plausible,

<P>
   BOOKTAB-GIFTS _ Coffee-table books, those glossy, oversize tomes
that pop up like Christmas tree lots every holiday season, were
aimed at the very rich when they were first published in the 1820s.
And they weren't called coffee-table books. According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, that term was not used until 1963. Until then,
they were called ``grand piano books'' because that's where they
usually were stacked. Or perhaps because only those affluent enough
to own a grand piano could afford them. That's no longer true. With
advances in color printing in the 1960s and '70s, coffee-table
books are now cheaper _ and more plentiful. Here are some of this
season's new offerings. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   West Berliners chisel out chunks of the Berlin Wall in the heady
days following the opening of the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   By Cheryl Blackerby
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated ladies in fur coats and high heels chipped off
pieces of the Berlin Wall with dainty strokes of borrowed hammers.
Men in black leather jackets passed the beer and pounded the wall
with sledge hammers. Couples with bundled-up babies claimed their
own small pieces of history.
</P>
<P>
   The graffiti-splattered chunks of concrete were stuffed into
coat pockets, briefcases and cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pieces of the Berlin Wall,'' they would tell future
generations in somber tones. ``This piece of concrete separated
families and took the lives of 77 East Germans _ killed while
trying to escape over it. The wall divided a city for 28 years.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what I planned to do with my own pieces of the
wall. I, too, was there in the days following the opening of the
Brandenburg Gate on Nov. 9, 1989 _ 10 years ago today.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, my bits of history were stolen from a checked bag
on the return flight to the United States. Two expensive cameras
were bypassed for a small plastic bag full of colorful pieces of
stone and mortar. My only consolation was that maybe the thief
would tell others what I had planned to say.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, no one can take away memories of those heady
days when the wall came down piece by piece and East Germans
flooded a Berlin that had been denied to them for nearly three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   East Berliners in shabby coats and cheap polyester clothes
crowded through the gate and into the downtown streets of West
Berlin. At night, they crammed the halls connecting three floors of
shops in the trendy Europa Center. The stores were closed, but it
didn't matter since the East Germans had no money. It was
entertainment enough to gaze at the dazzling array of jewelry,
clothes and household appliances displayed in the windows.
</P>
<P>
   So this was the West.
</P>
<P>
   The shop windows were nothing compared to what they saw at West
Berlin's La Vie en Rose nightclub, an eye-opening window into the
anything-goes West. Eyes were riveted to a line of chorus girls
wearing nothing but rhinestones, and faces showed the shock of
raunchy jokes told by transvestites.
</P>
<P>
   These were the glory days in East and West Berlin_ la vie en
rose, life in the pink.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening of the wall, life was a cabaret, old chum, and
the possibility of a unified Germany was emotionally overwhelming.
Only eight months before, East German party chief Erich Honecker
vowed the wall would remain for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The champagne flowed, and so did the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Andree Hoffmann's tears came unexpectedly when we stepped off
the subway in East Berlin. He quickly wiped his eyes and tried to
regain his composure. I had met Andree, who worked for the West
German Ministry of Intra German Affairs, when I was doing research
on the city. He was reluctant to return to East Berlin, but I
talked him into going with me.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent two months in East Berlin's Keibel Street Prison in
1976 for trying to escape across the wall. In 1980, he finally left
legally. And now, he was back at home, and the wall was down.
Before we started walking, he warned me that East Berlin wouldn't
change overnight.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as we stepped out of Friedrich subway station, the
differences between East and West were apparent. Acrid smoke from
coal heating, used in East Berlin because it was cheap, hung over
the houses and narrow, potholed streets.
</P>
<P>
   The BMWs and Mercedes of West Berlin were replaced by rusty
little Trabants and Wartburgs.
</P>
<P>
   On a street corner near Alexanderplatz, no cars were in sight,
and I walked into the street even though the ``Don't Walk'' sign
was flashing.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann called me back, and we patiently waited with a dozen
other people until the green light flashed. ``They will fine you,''
he explained. ``And the police will ask `Why do you refuse to obey
the law? Why do you defy the government?'''
</P>
<P>
   At the Havana Club at the Metropol Hotel, Elton John's Goodbye
Norma Jean played in the background, but no one seemed to be in a
celebratory mood. Two dozen people in the room stared out the
windows or at their drinks.
</P>
<P>
   After we sat down, a brawny man standing behind the bar told us
in a voice unnecessarily loud, ``You must check your coats at the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann told him we would prefer to keep our coats. Every
person in the room looked in our direction.
</P>
<P>
   The man was obviously angry. He switched from English to German,
demanding, ``Take your coats to the door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep our coats,'' Hoffmann calmly replied.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender glared at us for the duration of our dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be able to change the flag but not the attitude,''
Hoffmann commented.
</P>
<P>
   His assessment of the incident was harsh but understandable.
Hoffmann's greatest fear of going back to East Berlin was that he
might see one of the Secret Service men who had tortured him in
prison. What if he bumped into one on an East or West Berlin
street?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those faces,'' he said. ``They liked to wake me up
in the middle of the night and ask questions like `Where did you
get the gun?' when I had never had a gun. They would say, `Don't
tell us stupid lies.' I will never forget the sound of the two
clicks of the bolt and the click of the key latch.''
</P>
<P>
   But on our walk, he was astounded at the small changes that had
occurred in only a few days. He continuously commented on the
number of people reading West German newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palast Hotel coffee shop, a young couple's heads were
bent over a a West Berlin City magazine. ``Never would you have
seen that before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he noticed the absence of the Secret Service. ``This is
strange. I haven't seen any police,'' he said after the first 15
minutes on East Berlin streets.
</P>
<P>
   Late on that cold winter afternoon, we decided to see the old
synagogue on Oranienburger Strasse, which was scheduled to be
refurbished with donations from American Jews. Opened in 1866, it
was once one of the most well-known synagogues in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann warned me that the last time he had been there it was
badly deteriorating. When we rounded he corner, however, we saw the
building was surrounded by scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   We walked down a side alley for a closer inspection, and a
workman brusquely told us to leave, that it wasn't a tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   As we were walking away, another construction worker caught up
with us and explained that work was being done on the supports and
the building wasn't safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But come back,'' he said, smiling. ``It will look better than
it did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Better than before it was hit by bombs in 1943. It was a nice
thought and a nice end to my day with Andree in East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue opened in 1995 as a memorial museum called Centrum
Judaicum, and today it is a popular tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin is once again a capital city, and children in the old
West Berlin don't remember a time when they wouldn't have been
allowed to see the front of the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't remember a wall that once separated the city.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I was feeling sluggish,

so-called bankruptcy reform bill to which it is attached.

   NEW-THANKSGIVING _ For a growing number of people, Thanksgiving
no longer means sitting down to a home-cooked meal. It's still a
time to be with loved ones probably over a feast that features
turkey and dressing...but they're eating it in a restaurant,
carrying it in from the supermarket or take-out shop, or
mail-ordering it from department store catalog. A look at the trend
and what's driving it, plus a short box with some resorces for
folks who don't want to cook. (Walker, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-DISNEYY2K _ ORLANDO _ For most us, welcoming the new
millennium will be a one-night affair, whether decadent or
down-home. But for the folks who never do anything less than
downright over the top, welcoming the new age is a 457-night
affair. And it's already begun. Disney World has new fireworks and

the new millennium every day until January 2001.(Walker, Atlanta

dangerous dinosaurs on Countdown to Extinction and coarse through
blood veins to attack a splinter in Body Wars. The place: Disney
World's four major theme parks. The challenge: Do it all in only 3

   REVIEW-MARY _ Review of ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' airing Sunday
on NBC with Pernilla August (Annikin Skylwalker's mom) as Mary, and
produced by the Shriver family. It's an extremely reverent telling
of Mary's story, with the necessary embellishments, kept plausible,

Biblical films by having characters who look too American and too

until now. The University Press of Mississippi is re-issuing the
book in hardback later this summer along with ``Remembering
Willie,'' a collection of tributes ... This year's Atlanta Writers

write than the blind biological instinct to survive. A charge of
malice, all things considered, would sound better. (Skube, Atlanta

   BOOKTAB-GIFTS _ Coffee-table books, those glossy, oversize tomes
that pop up like Christmas tree lots every holiday season, were
aimed at the very rich when they were first published in the 1820s.
And they weren't called coffee-table books. According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, that term was not used until 1963. Until then,
they were called ``grand piano books'' because that's where they
usually were stacked. Or perhaps because only those affluent enough
to own a grand piano could afford them. That's no longer true. With
advances in color printing in the 1960s and '70s, coffee-table
books are now cheaper _ and more plentiful. Here are some of this
season's new offerings. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

HOT WHEELS' HOTTEST DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Talk about your trade-in value.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wheels toy car collector Chris Marshall of Overland Park has
struck a deal to sell the rarest of all Hot Wheels vehicles _ a
one-of-a-kind, hot-pink die-cast prototype of a 1969 Volkswagen
Beach Bomb van.
</P>
<P>
   Price? $72,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the holy grail of Hot Wheels,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 37, already has received a non-refundable deposit of
$1,000 from a California collector who wishes to remain anonymous.
With the balance he plans to purchase another set of high-dollar
wheels: a 2000 Dodge Viper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coincidentally, it's about $72,000,'' Marshall said of the
street-legal race car, which actually lists for $76,000. ``I've
decided to trade a toy collector's dream car for a genuine dream
car.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds frivolous, that's because it is, said Marshall, a
husband and father of two who makes his living selling high speed
and wireless access to the Internet. He has bought and sold several
thousand Hot Wheels since taking up serious collecting of the
itty-bitty roadsters more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife, `I've bought these cars out of my own fun
money,' '' Marshall said. ``I didn't take food out of the babes'
mouths or the shoe fund or anything. I said, `If I realize this
much money, then I'm going to spend it on something that I would
not otherwise have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wheels enthusiasts, 50,000 strong, have been vicariously
thrilled by the deal as reported in toy collecting publications and
on Hot Wheels Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The price, believed to be the largest ever offered for a Hot
Wheels car, seemed ``a little high'' to Jon Brecka, who writes a
monthly Hot Wheels column for Toy Cars and Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like an art piece,'' Brecka said. ``Is some painting
by van Gogh worth $49 million? It's worth what anybody will pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wheels hobbyist Trish Glore, who operates CB's Die Cast Car
Museum Web site out of Alamogordo, N.M., has 11,000 Hot Wheels and
counting in her collection. But she doesn't expect their value to
skyrocket in the wake of Marshall's stellar sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (sale) is so rare it really won't have that much effect
on your everyday, average collector who runs into Wal-Mart and buys
their cars for a dollar,'' she said. ``It does give us all a sense
of envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if she had unlimited funds, Glore, 44, doesn't know if she
could feel good about plunking down 72 grand for an item destined
to rest on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``But would I sell it for any amount if I had it?'' she said.
``No way. The historical value is too important.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall became part of toy collecting history in March 1998,
when he traveled to California and paid a former Hot Wheels
engineer $9,000 for his 250 vintage Hot Wheels, including 25
prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledged jewel of the collection was a ``spectraflame
pink'' rear-loading Beach Bomb with two tiny surfboards sticking
out of the back. Mattel mass-produced the Beach Bomb starting in
1969, but never with surfboards loaded in the rear and never in
pink, the rarest and most desirable of Hot Wheels colors.
</P>
<P>
   Until Marshall's find, no pink Beach Bomb prototype was known to
exist. Marshall knew he'd found something special. He just didn't
know how special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who sold it to me said, `I hope you get $10,000 for
it,' '' Marshall said. ``I didn't know if I would get that much.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't in a hurry to find out. Marshall enjoyed showing off
his prize possession to other Hot Wheels devotees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I announced that it had been found I literally got
hundreds of e-mails saying, `You've found the holy grail of toys!
You've found the rarest thing ever!' It was incredible. I had
people offer to buy it on the spot. One guy said, `I'll give you
$10,000' for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took it to a local toy show in May of '98, I had a guy
offer to trade me a new $25,000 Blazer for it even up. I didn't
want a Blazer.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later Marshall's priorities had changed. The demands of
work and family were taking up more time, and tracking down old Hot
Wheels was no longer quite the buzz he knew it still was for
thousands of other collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people like me get in to relive their youth,''
Marshall said. ``Smelling the oil that they use on these cars
brings back all the memories from the late '60s and early '70s,
when it was the dominant toy _ which it still is, by the way. It's
the hottest-selling toy in the world. They've sold over 2 billion
of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall got to thinking: Beach Bomb prototypes were listed in a
Hot Wheels price guide for $7,000 each, and a pair had recently
sold above guide for $25,000. He also knew that pink Hot Wheels
typically sell for five to 10 times more than other colors. What
might the rarest pink one of all fetch?
</P>
<P>
   He decided the time was right to sell when in June the Ultimate
Hot Wheels Web site praised it as the ``pinnacle'' of the hobby and
estimated its value at $70,000 to $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Marshall had visions of a Viper sports car revving in
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Why do I have a toy car in a plastic case, when I
could have a really awesome car in the garage?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In July Marshall began a $7,000 campaign to advertise his
treasure throughout the toy collecting community. When it sold in
October for $72,000, more than 10 times the guide price, the
still-proud owner felt his first twinge of separation anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to let go,'' Marshall said. ``It was my 15 minutes
of fame in the collecting community. Everybody knew who Chris
Marshall was because, by golly, he had the holy grail of toys.''
</P>
<P>
   But has Marshall really sold his Beach Bomb? He's still owed
$71,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find in this business a lot of people will back out on even
nominal stuff,'' cautioned Ron Reusch, a vintage Hot Wheels dealer
who runs Collectors Toystop in Milwaukee, Wis. ``I don't want to
jinx the deal, but it's not done until it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Done or not, Marshall pledges to go ahead and buy his Viper, on
which he's already put down a deposit of $5,000. Of course, he's
still counting on the rest of his Beach Bomb money coming through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure as (heck) better,'' he said. ``Otherwise my wife will
no longer be happy with me.''

BMI: HOW MUCH WEIGHT DOES IT CARRY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again the vexing BMI, body mass index, has crept into the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Harvard University on Monday reported that women
who live the healthy lives we're all supposed to live _ eating
right, not smoking, exercising 30 minutes daily, drinking no more
than one glass of alcohol a day and not being overweight (having a
BMI ratio of 25 or less) _ cut their chances of heart disease by an
astounding 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to understand? You bet. Except for this:
</P>
<P>
   Most people have no idea what their BMI is or what it means,
doctors say. And once they calculate it (which is quite simple),
many are often depressed to find the numbers tipped against them.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Institutes of Health announced in 1998 that
the body mass index would be used to calculate the rate of obesity
nationwide, the numbers quickly showed nearly 55 percent of the
nation's adult population _ greater than anyone expected _ to be
overweight or obese.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps toward healthier living, therefore, is to
understand exactly what the BMI means, how it is calculated and
how, in some instances, it falls short as a measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body mass index is simply a formula that compares weight to
height,'' said James O'Keefe, head of preventive cardiology at St.
Luke's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And that's it. It doesn't consider age. It doesn't consider
whether you're male or female. It's doesn't take into account
whether you're big-boned or frail, pear-shaped, apple-shaped or
shaped like a mythological god or goddess. Height. Weight. That's
all the formula uses.
</P>
<P>
   The exact formula is easy. To calculate your BMI, multiply your
weight in pounds by 704. Then divide the answer by your height in
inches. Then divide that answer again by your height in inches. If
the result is between 18.5 and 24.9, you're in what's considered
the normal weight range. A BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered
overweight. Obesity is defined as a BMI between 30 and 39.9, with
40 the beginning of extreme obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it means. Say you're 5-foot-8. The ``normal'' weight
range would be anywhere between about 122 and 163 pounds. But
remember, the index doesn't take into account sex. So that's for a
man or a woman, although presumably women would be at the lower end
of the scale and men at the top. Presumably.
</P>
<P>
   Shadrach Smith, director of the weight management clinic at the
University of Kansas Medical Center, said many people become
concerned thinking that the numbers stand for their percentage of
body fat. This is not so. The numbers are just ratios used as
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people,'' O'Keefe said, ``the body mass index is a
way to get you in the ballpark of where you should be.''
</P>
<P>
   It offers a range, not an exact body weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a screening test,'' Smith said. ``This is not
something that is absolute. It's a test to see if you should be
more concerned and, if the number is elevated, to think about
making changes in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly it has flaws. O'Keefe emphasizes, for example,
that the BMI doesn't take into account the amount of lean muscle
one might have. Muscle is more dense than fat. A person, therefore,
can be extremely muscular and fit, have a BMI between 25 and 29,
and still not be overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, because it offers a range of weight and doesn't take
gender into account, it can misjudge overweight people as skinny.
Based on the BMI, for example, a 5-foot-2 woman would be considered
of normal weight if she weighed anywhere between 101 and 136
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians emphasize that the BMI still requires people to use
common sense. Just because the numbers say you're ``normal''
doesn't necessarily mean you might not be overweight and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who desire a more precise calculation of body fat
can visit a physician to have an impedance test (which sends a
slight electrical charge through your body) or a skin caliper test
(which squeezes your skin with pincers), or be submerged in a water
tank, to get an exact reading of the percentage body fat.
</P>
<P>
   That people are often shocked to find out how little the BMI
says they ought to weigh, O'Keefe said, may be more a reflection of
how common obesity has become in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days Americans keep getting fatter,'' he said, ``so the
norm is to think that people who are a normal weight look skinny,
and people who are overweight look normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take people who look thin in our society, and then
look at pictures of how people looked 30, 50, 100 years ago, these
are people who today we should consider thin. And that was the
average.''
</P>
<P>
   The BMI may not be perfect. ``But for the average person,''
O'Keefe said, ``it is a good way to get people thinking about where
their weight should be.''

   Kevin Smith's love of words, of giving his characters an almost
desperate need to explain themselves to the world, to their
friends, to each other, takes on a perverse streak in ``Dogma,'' a
movie that looks as if it were cast out of a year-end issue of
Vanity Fair.

Affleck) break out of their amiable, slightly irritated rap with
each other and stand up to wreak havoc on a bunch of innocents at
an airport, or in the boardroom of a corporation that has fouled
the spirit of the Old Testament by turning a biblical icon into an
animated trademark. It becomes a parody of the violence erupting in
the midst of self-absorption in ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's fixation on popular culture is rooted in a running love
of media, a love that amounts to a fleet-footed clash of
mythologies. It includes the Old and New Testaments, cartoons and
comic books _ certainly anyone who's ever read an issue of ``The
Mighty Thor'' won't be surprised to see that Loki is one of those
responsible for the chaos. (In ``Thor,'' Loki took his name from
the Norse god of mischief.) But Smith respects all of this stuff _
he's not just looting it for an easy laugh. Most of the time,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose previous films include ``Clerks,'' ``Mallrats'' and
``Chasing Amy,'' gets better with his actors in each picture. In
``Dogma,'' you can see this with Affleck, who is so much improved
that he no longer seems to be using English as a second language.
``Dogma'' gives Smith a chance to work on the heme that he began
with ``Mallrats,'' an addled search for both a good time and
spiritual fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   That search for transcendence starts with Bethany (Linda
Fiorentino), who laments the void in her life. In a crank-fest with
her co-worker (Janeane Garofalo), it's clear that Bethany's griping
is actually a groping for meaning. And true to her Catholic girls'
school name, it's not long before an angel (Alan Rickman, testament
to the fact that there are no orthodontists in heaven) appears
before her.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Bethany is on the road for New Jersey to prevent the End
of the World as we know it. Bartleby and Loki have been laid off by
God, who seems to have lost interest in the mortal plane, and to
have confined them to Wisconsin. They have to make their way to a
church in the Garden State so they can reclaim their status, but
their doing so will cause a rift that will lead to Armageddon _ if
you'll pardon the reference to another Ben Affleck movie.
</P>
<P>
   On her journey to Jersey, Bethany runs into the 13th disciple,
Rufus (Chris Rock), whose name seems to indicate that he was the
patron saint of Amos and Andy. Rufus begins his rapid-fire
monologue, and, like everyone in ``Dogma,'' he has a lot to say. It
wouldn't be a Kevin Smith movie if Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob
(Smith) didn't turn up. They become aides to Bethany, her earthly
protectors. (In the ragged, unlikely band brought together to save
the world from an Old Testament-sized destruction, Smith pays
subtle tribute to Matt Wagner's ``Mage,'' a comics series in which
Excalibur is a baseball bat.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of ``Dogma'' seems to derive from the Smith approach, in
which it often feels as if he hurls subplots and characters at the
wall to see what will stick. As a result, the movie is a sprawl
that could use some trimming, even though it's often amusing.
(After a success, Loki strides down a highway singing the theme to
``Martin.'') The grimy, cheap look of the movie provokes a few
laughs. Because of its look, ``Dogma'' feels undernourished, but
Smith has made slovenliness into a style. This approach lends
itself to ``Dogma,'' a shaggy-dog story about the need for faith
and the apparently aimless stride toward that state. The movie
really isn't aimless at all, though. Its effects are quite
specific.

FAMILY VALUES MAN NEEDS TO LEARN SOME FAMILY VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The bigger the blowhard, the harder he blows up.
Boy, has Newt Gingrich blown up.
</P>
<P>
   The former speaker of the House of Representatives and crusader
for traditional family values is wrapped up in an ugly divorce
case, revealing he had a six-year extramarital affair with a
congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to hypocrisy, one of his own lawyers said that the
56-year-old Gingrich recently gave his 33-year-old lover, Callista
Bisek, a $1,300 set of Callaway golf clubs and a pearl ring that
was ``not even a really nice ring.''
</P>
<P>
   There never was a nice ring to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker of the House, he shut down the federal government out
of spite. He said being gay is similar to alcoholism. He said
child-killer Susan Smith was evidence of how sick society is and
``the only way you can get change is vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also said, ``over time, we want to have a bias in favor
of heterosexual marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements were made in 1994, the year Gingrich led the
Republicans in a congressional election that humbled President
Clinton. That also was the first year of his affair with the
then-27-year-old aide.
</P>
<P>
   So much for his bias in favor of heterosexual marriage, a bias
he had previously demonstrated in 1980 by abandoning his first wife
while she had cancer. Gingrich has been a nasty piece of work all
along.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1987 memoirs, ``A Man of the House,'' the late speaker of
the House, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, ripped into Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``What infuriated me about these guys is that they had no real
interest in legislation,'' O'Neill wrote of Gingrich and his gang.
``As far as they were concerned, the House was no more than a bully
pulpit. If the TV cameras were facing the town dump, that's where
they'd be speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad O'Neill didn't live to see how deep Gingrich is buried
in the town dump.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's love life wouldn't be any business of ours, except
for the fact that he made our love lives his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the pathologies and weaknesses of America
today, re-establishing the centrality of marriage and of the role
of the male and female in that relationship is a very central issue
of the next 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said that in November 1994, exactly a year after
beginning his affair with the congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   Live by the centrality of marriage, die by the centrality of
marriage. Gingrich was aware that insiders knew of his marital
problems. In 1989, he admitted to the Washington Post that he had
read a book called ``Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love
Them'' and ``found frightening pieces that related to my own
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had formed ``habits of dominance'' from being the
center of attention. The man can't even confess without bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich would talk to anyone and say anything. Invariably, he
revealed a frightening contempt for opponents. This was a man for
an empty, paranoid time in American history. And he was considered
a potential president.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Gingrich in action at a restaurant in Washington in
October 1995, when he was at the height of his arrogance (and two
years into his affair).
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to a group of the press with astounding sarcasm,
meanness and pseudo-intellectuality. He talked about ``paradigm
shifts'' when his real concern at the time was shutting down the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich strutted around the restaurant and said he wanted to
throw then-Secretary of Labor Robert Reich out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of an unemployed secretary of Labor,''
Gingrich said. However, it felt like he was picking on Reich
because Reich is short.
</P>
<P>
   I like the idea of an unemployed Gingrich, but recently he said
he wants to be an adviser to public leaders and ``wouldn't rule
out'' running for office.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in July, on the same day he filed for divorce from
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras come on again, I really want to see him
standing in the town dump.
</P>

`PARTRIDGE' STORY DARKLY IRONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  2.5 stars  
(Eds: Not for use before Saturday, Nov. 13). 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom.) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd expect the title ``Come On, Get Happy: The Partridge
Family Story'' would be ironic in a flip, kitschy way, but who
would've guessed the irony would be quite so dark? This backstage
yarn _ told from Danny Bonaduce's (aka Danny Partridge's)
perspective _ has such wild mood swings that it could use a
prescription for lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the teleflick is content to revel in the benign
loopiness of the sitcom in question, famous for its
counterculture-as-pablum premise. At times, though, it aspires to
being the ``Raging Bull'' of sappy sitcom tell-alls, as it depicts
the violent physical abuse Bonaduce (played by Shawn Pyfrom)
received from his father, an embittered, struggling writer.
Director David Burton Morris hasn't a clue how to handle these
tonal shifts _ the confrontational scenes, though staged in a
heavy-handed fashion, are shot and lit in the same pointedly inane,
light-headed manner as the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come On, Get Happy'' at its best is a once-over-lightly parody
of the network executive sensibilities that created the show.
``Like the Monkees, only less threatening'' is an early pitch for
``The Partridge Family'' in sessions that would be called
``brainstorming'' if, in fact, any cerebra had been in use while
devising the series.
</P>
<P>
   In quick order we meet the players _ Shirley Jones (Eve Gordon)
and Dave Madden (Michael Chieffo), who are fondly delineated; David
Cassidy (Rodney Scott), depicted as a spoiled artiste chafing
against the yoke of mainstream-television oppression; and everyone
else, who fail to make much of an impression. Except, of course,
for Bonaduce, who, the film suggests, was even at 10 years old the
go-to guy when mining for comic gold (Bonaduce served as the film's
consultant).
</P>
<P>
   Outside of some rather bland revelations that won't make
headlines (heck, they barely serve as subplots) _ Jones warned
Cassidy to treat with compassion Susan Dey, who had an unrequited
crush on her co-star; Cassidy battled with the network over money
and his highly publicized private life _ Bonaduce tells no tales
out of school. The film doesn't belabor the sheer cheesiness of the
musical sequences in the series, as the actors lip-sync'ed the
tunes and put shockingly little effort into playing their
instruments with anything approaching verisimilitude, but neither
does it fully exploit its comedic potential. And the scenes with
Danny's father _ who does everything except wickedly twirl a
handlebar mustache _ bring down the tepidly giddy fun of the rest
of proceedings significantly, without adding much substance or
insight in the way of a trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   There's scarcely an interesting anecdote offered about the
making of the series, so it's appropriate that the show's own
turgid musical cues are frequently employed. At the end, Bonaduce
(as voice-over narrator) blandly enthuses, ``It was the bus ride of
a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to take his word for it; for viewers, it's little
more than an excuse to go nowhere, just vegetate on the couch for a
couple of hours. &QL;

WARMING UP TO KNITWEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Art of `ER's' Lily Mariye and her husband, jazz saxophonist
Boney James, modeling knitwear is en route to NY Times News Service
clients. Package also includes sidebar FASHION-KNITS-MODELS) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Loopy knits, crocheted fringe, multicolor weaves,
and silky-soft pashmina.
</P>
<P>
   They're the newest purls of wisdom on the fashion front,
signaling a global-warming trend for knitwear. And not just
sweaters, but all those '70s favorites such as ponchos, capes,
shawls, stoles and ski caps.
</P>
<P>
   So ignore those millennium soothsayers who shout the praises of
futuristic fabrics that won't snag, tear or self-destruct, and
indulge in fashion's softer side, even if it is a little itchy.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are ready with numerous knits, from Christian
Lacroix's pricey multicolor knit dresses to Target's little acrylic
knit ski caps. However, the highest-profile styles of the season
are Max Azria of BCBG's sleeveless turtleneck sweater knitted with
plump yarn that's fattening even on a skinny model; Bette Paige's
body-conscious, feather-trimmed separates; and Donna Karan's
gossamer-light mohair sweater that is so much like a spider web
you'll need a Lycra top underneath for modesty's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the poncho, that flirty, impractical little coverup
that can be knitted, crocheted or worn long, as in Mondi's hooded-
blanket style. Even the alpine-inspired ski sweater with a
turtleneck by Ralph Lauren and Liz Claiborne is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the pashmina that packs the most panache in the world
of clicking needles.
</P>
<P>
   The word pashmina has become synonymous with a silky fringed
stole worn by umpteen celebs from Uma Thurman to Julia Roberts, but
actually it refers to the silky hairs on the underside of a certain
geographically located goat (think Indian and Pakistan), explains
Edith Eig, who teaches men and women how to knit the stoles at her
Studio City store called La Knitterie Parisienne.
</P>
<P>
   The French-born knitting maven has run her little shop for more
than 25 years, catering to the whims of crafty types. And this
year, the shop is jammin'.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are coming back to the old-fashioned quilting
bee, where people sit around and talk ... perhaps because families
have become fragmented over the past century,'' Eig said. ``And
besides, it's therapeutic, a bit like yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clients? ``They're teen-agers, young moms, movie stars and
fashion designers. Some will come in saying they want to learn how
to make a pashmina (stole), but it's really difficult since it
requires tiny needles and is very time consuming,'' says Eig.
</P>
<P>
   What's easy for beginners, she says, are ponchos and caps. But
in the end, it's determination that helps a knitter finish.
</P>
<P>
   Says Eig, ``I had a woman who was inspired because she wanted
that new bulky sweater with turned-back cuffs by Marc Jacobs but
didn't want to spend $1,500. So she made her own for less than
$350.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a young man who said he needed to learn how
to knit in a few hours so he could get a part in a new Banana
Republic commercial. And he did, thanks to Eig.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrity members of her unofficial knitting club include
Bob Mackie and his design team, and performers Shari Belafonte,
Brett Butler, Genie Francis, Laurie Metcalf and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's not one of Eig's students, Lily Mariye, who plays
Nurse Lily on TV's ``ER,'' is also a fan of knitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knitting is a great way to zone out and yet not take away from
what you need to focus on,'' says Mariye, who admits she originally
took up the hobby to help herself quit smoking, but found it was a
nice pastime while sitting for hours on the set of the television
show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mariye, ``I think the hand-crafted fashion trend is
cool, especially since I didn't grow up with it like baby boomers
did. My all-time favorite is a blue sweater, the first thing I
knitted all by myself ... without my mother's help. And I think
that's part of the popularity of the trend ... the idea that
someone compliments you not only for the style but the idea and the
workmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Although lots of men have started knitting since Rosie Greer
made it politically correct a few years ago, Mariye says she hasn't
been able to teach her husband, jazz saxophonist Boney James, the
fine art of knitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too impatient. He'd rather just go to the store and buy
one,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For those like him, 'tis the season. &QL;

<P>
   Why did the Soviet Union reconcile itself to ``peaceful
revolution'' in the nations of central and eastern Europe? Why did
we not do everything in our power to keep hold on East Germany?
Should we have fought to keep it in our sphere of influence?
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union understood the abnormality of having the German
nation divided in two. In fact, more than once in the past, Soviet
leaders had submitted proposals for consideration by its Western
partners that would provide for the unification of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the West rejected these, considering them to be mere
propaganda, or trickery, on our part. To a certain extent, the
proposals did have a propagandistic, or self-promotional, purpose.
But our Western partners never once tried to take Moscow at its
word.
</P>
<P>
   During my tenure, in the first years of perestroika, the
question of German reunification did not arise as a specific
problem. East Germany was a place where the people lived better in
material terms than the population of other ``socialist'' countries
of central and eastern Europe. In terms of political freedom,
however, the situation was bad.
</P>
<P>
   As we got under way with perestroika _ the movement that was to
bring freedom to our own people _ the Soviet leadership could not
apply different criteria to the other countries in our domain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the process of democratization in the Soviet Union made
the East German citizens' unhappiness with their own repressive
regime increasingly manifest.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean that there were any kind of hints of pressure from
us. When changes began in eastern Europe, the expression of the
people's will was recognized as legitimate and as the expression of
the freedom of any people to choose their own path of development.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leadership made its own domestic plans and actions
known during visits to the Warsaw Pact countries. But the Soviet
leadership nonetheless did not wish to export its own aims and
intentions, its own experience.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the truth is that interference in the internal affairs
of our neighbors was ended. No longer was advice given from Moscow,
let alone orders or commands.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, sometimes certain politicians even took offense at
this _ especially those who wanted Moscow to push in a certain
direction. But Moscow remained true to its position.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the leaders in Bonn would make a point of commenting
on the division of their country. Our attitude was that the
division of Germany was a product of history and that history would
take care of it some day. Without categorically denying the
possibility of reunification, the Soviet side suggested that time
be allowed to solve the problem. This same idea was repeated during
my visit to Bonn in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, however, events began to develop at a rapid
pace. There were outbreaks of discontent and mass demonstrations.
Support for the East German regime was rapidly collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The East German citizens fled the country en masse, even at the
risk of death. There was an exodus to West Germany _ at first
through Hungary and later Czechoslovakia. Some people left the
country by any means available, even crossing the Berlin Wall,
which separated West Berlin from East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the East German citizens understood that the Soviet
Union would not use force to prevent the unification of their
country. This was a signal to them that their will to have unity
could be realized.
</P>
<P>
   From our standpoint, any effort to try forcibly to preserve this
system would have only vastly weakened the Soviet position and
discredited us in the eyes of the Germans, our people and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In early November 1989, Moscow still hoped that the East German
leadership would be able to cope with the situation, preserving
East Germany as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But events developed in a much more precipitous way. A process
began in which the government structures of East Germany began to
fall apart. The pressure grew, resulting in the resignation of the
old leadership under Erich Honecker, the opening of the Brandenburg
Gate and, on Nov. 9, the fall of the Berlin Wall _ that symbol not
only of the division of Germany but of all Europe into East and
West.
</P>
<P>
   I can say now that Moscow conducted itself optimally in these
circumstances. It ruled out the use of force, including the use of
Soviet troops deployed on East German territory.
</P>
<P>
   It did everything possible to allow the process to develop along
peaceful lines, without violating the vital interests of the Soviet
Union or those of East or West Germany, and without undermining
peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that we lost our allies in eastern Europe,
that we surrendered these countries too easily and without
compensation. This is folly. After all, to whom did we surrender
them? To their own people.
</P>
<P>
   Any use of force to oppose the will of the German people for
unification would have been fraught with the risk of war, perhaps
world war. How was the Soviet Union to ``save'' this regime? By
revving up the tank motors?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was a heavy concentration of armed forces
stationed in Germany. This nation was important to both the East
and West. And its system could be ``saved'' in only one way _ by
once again sending in the tanks, as we did in Czechoslovakia in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such action _ such unjustified action _
could have included a general European war. And for what? Was it
not so that the nations of eastern Europe, amid a free expression
of the will of the people, chose their own path of development
based on their own national needs?
</P>
<P>
   The system that existed in eastern and central Europe, as well
as in our country, was condemned by history; it had long since
outlived itself. It was a burden on the people.
</P>
<P>
   And so we allowed reunification to proceed calmly, without
complications or disruption of European stability.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty on the final normalization of relations with Germany
was signed in Moscow on Sept. 12, 1990, and on Oct. 3 German
unification became a fact.
</P>
<P>

its collapse in 1991 and Nobel Peace Prize winner, now heads the
Gorbachev Foundation, a political think tank in Moscow. He
addressed the German Parliament on Nov. 9 in a special ceremony to

   As a mother and daughter, Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman
match up like they were cast out of a DNA research lab for the wan
melodrama ``Anywhere but Here.'' They really could be mother and
daughter _ they have the same eyes, a similar banked fury. They
bail out of their hometown in the Midwest for Los Angeles; Sarandon
is intoxicated on dreams of the glamorous life in Beverly Hills.
But, as the old song goes, without love, it ain't much.
</P>
<P>
   Especially without the love of her teen-age daughter. Portman
misses home _ her cousin, her grandmother, her stepfather. She has
far more common sense than her mother does. That's Portman's stock
in trade, her ability to project maturity far beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a piece of sticky, boyz-to-men lumpiness like
``Beautiful Girls,'' when she stalked Timothy Hutton, or her debut
in ``The Professional,'' where her older-than-her-years heart was
the point of the picture. Here, the restive soulfulness in her eyes
functions as a kind of moral superiority. One wonders if she's a
little bored with such roles. She's an unbelievably charismatic
actress, too young solely to be playing parts primarily built on a
streak of knowingness.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon takes to her role, the mom pushing herself into the
center of places she doesn't belong _ bad relationships, apartments
she can't stand or afford _ like a raccoon attracted to shiny
things. She even looks like she belongs behind the wheel of the
vintage Mercedes she proudly drives, an extravagance that
symbolizes (and underlines and italicizes) her spoiled streak. You
half expect to see a caption appear over her head that blinks ``Old
enough to know better'' when she cruises a middle-aged hunk of a
dentist (Hart Bochner) and pines for him like he's the subject of a
shout-out on some lite-oldies radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what's supposed to be the comedy, and the drama, is
Portman's resignation to her mom's childish behavior and diva-like
hunger for life. But both actresses have played these parts before.
Some scenes structured around their scummy apartments _ just within
hailing distance of 90210 _ seem to have been lifted from ``Slums
of Beverly Hills,'' another picture about a teen-age girl coming
into her own on the margins of a posh area code.
</P>
<P>
   You may find yourself wishing for a minor twist on the theme,
like maybe if Sarandon had abandoned a modest, respectable life for
a stab at fun ... then the horror-struck Portman would suddenly be
competing with Mom for ``Coolest Teen'' title. As it is, we've seen
this dance too many times. You don't even have to look that closely
for the worn spots in the shag where the actresses' feet have
fallen before.

DANNY BONADUCE IN SPOTLIGHT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Saturday, Nov. 13). 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Bonaduce sounds almost giddy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar feeling from the local radio personality who's
still probably best-known as impish Danny Partridge, the
red-haired, freckled kid from ABC's '70s sitcom ``The Partridge
Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce, paired since Sept. 15 with Jamie White as co-host of
the 5-to-9 a.m. weekday program on Burbank adult contemporary
station KYSR-FM (98.7) _ Star 98 _ has just been chosen to do
commercial voice-over work for TV's UPN network, situated just
downstairs from his radio gig.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce, who grew up in Woodland Hills, is plainly on top of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier,'' he says. ``My whole family is here in
Los Angeles. The weather is great. The radio show is doing well.
And now this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the jury is still out on ``The Jamie &AMP; Danny Show.''
After a radio career that took him around the country, Bonaduce
bounced to Los Angeles to replace White's former co-hosts, Frosty
Stillwell and Frank Kramer, White's broadcast partners since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've hit it off,'' Bonaduce says about his on-air
chemistry with the frequently raunchy White. ``I wouldn't say it
was a gamble. I mean, I'm a professional. I do what management says
to do. They said come to Los Angeles and go on the air with Jamie
and talk about whatever comes up. It's funny _ I feel like I'm the
sensible one in the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ken Christensen, vice president and general manager of
Star: ``Danny brings star appeal and a familiar, warm personality,
thanks to his work on `The Partridge Family.' He and Jamie are a
perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce says he doesn't particularly enjoy talking up his
former fame as precocious Danny Partridge. But this past week, it
came up often on Star because ABC's ``Come On, Get Happy: The
Partridge Family Story,'' a behind-the-freckles look at the '70s
sitcom and its stars, is airing at 9 tonight on KABC (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce was a consultant on the film, which uses newcomers and
veteran performers to portray the actors who played TV's fatherless
family of six and their traveling pop group, but admits he penned a
first draft when he and a pal pitched it to Fox in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been through so many revisions,'' Bonaduce, 40,
explained. ``They asked me if I wanted a hand in casting. I said,
`No, I'm too close to it.' Casting people get their jobs because
they're good.''
</P>
<P>
   The telefilm reveals how the pressures of instant success
</P>
<P>
   when the show hit the airwaves Sept. 25, 1970, and its abrupt
cancellation on Aug. 31, 1974 _ Bonaduce's 15th birthday _ forever
changed the stars of the series. ``The Partridge Family'' also
featured Oscar winner Shirley Jones and her real-life stepson,
David Cassidy, who became a '70s teen idol and pinup.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce's problems have been well-documented. The youngest of
four children, he landed his first commercial at age 4 and at 7
scored a spot in an episode of ``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' that his
dad wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce says he began smoking pot on the ``Partridge'' set at
the age of 13 and lost his virginity to one of Cassidy's castoffs
soon after. Shortly before the series wrapped, Bonaduce's parents
divorced, and he rented an apartment, enrolling at a private high
school in Encino where he was introduced to LSD and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Although he landed a few small TV parts, Bonaduce realized he
had hit bottom in 1988 when his mom tracked him down in a dingy
motel room on Sunset Boulevard, where he weighed just 112 pounds
and was subsisting on a diet of freebase and orange juice. He told
the story in a recent anti-drug message taped for Fox's ``America's
Most Wanted'' and repeated on the radio show.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he'd already been arrested for cocaine possession in
West Hollywood but would face another drug charge and, most
famously, an arrest for punching a transvestite prostitute in
Phoenix during the next three years before he cleaned up for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those people whose motto was: `If it's worth
doing, it's worth overdoing!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Free of drugs for almost 10 years, Bonaduce now lives in the
Hollywood Hills with his wife, Gretchen, whom he married eight
years ago, and their 4-year-old daughter, Isabella.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce scored his first radio job at WEXG-FM in Philadelphia
in 1988, next moving to Phoenix, then back to Philadelphia and
Chicago, Detroit and New York before starting at Star two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, he admits, is the toughest radio market in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, there was Howard Stern, but I was doing an adult
contemporary show, talking about raising a child and stuff like
that,'' Bonaduce said. ``Here, you've got Rick Dees, Mark and
Brian, Kevin and Bean, Stern again .... that's a lot of talent on
the air in the morning. But I think Jamie and I have a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce says he doesn't have the slightest idea why ``The
Partridge Family'' continues to fascinate. Hit songs like ``I Think
I Love You'' and ``Come On, Get Happy,'' the family's cherished
psychedelic bus and their crushed velvet costumes have attained
iconic status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any idea what we were doing,'' Bonaduce said.
``We didn't know this thing would live on as long as it has. We
were just trying to get through the day, you know?''

``Beautiful Girls,'' when she stalked Timothy Hutton, or her debut
in ``The Professional,'' where her older-than-her-years heart was
the point of the picture. Here, the restive soulfulness in her eyes
functions as a kind of moral superiority. One wonders if she's a
little bored with such roles. She's an unbelievably charismatic
actress, too young solely to be playing parts primarily built on a
streak of knowingness.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon takes to her role, the mom pushing herself into the
center of places she doesn't belong _ bad relationships, apartments
she can't stand or afford _ like a raccoon attracted to shiny
things. She even looks like she belongs behind the wheel of the
vintage Mercedes she proudly drives, an extravagance that
symbolizes (and underlines and italicizes) her spoiled streak. You
half expect to see a caption appear over her head that blinks ``Old
enough to know better'' when she cruises a middle-aged hunk of a
dentist (Hart Bochner) and pines for him like he's the subject of a
shout-out on some lite-oldies radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what's supposed to be the comedy, and the drama, is
Portman's resignation to her mom's childish behavior and diva-like
hunger for life. But both actresses have played these parts before.
Some scenes structured around their scummy apartments _ just within
hailing distance of 90210 _ seem to have been lifted from ``Slums
of Beverly Hills,'' another picture about a teen-age girl coming
into her own on the margins of a posh area code.
</P>
<P>
   You may find yourself wishing for a minor twist on the theme,
like maybe if Sarandon had abandoned a modest, respectable life for
a stab at fun ... then the horror-struck Portman would suddenly be
competing with Mom for ``Coolest Teen'' title. As it is, we've seen
this dance too many times. You don't even have to look that closely
for the worn spots in the shag where the actresses' feet have
fallen before.

`JOE THE KING' DIRECTOR SHOWS SURPRISING PROMISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an actor, Frank Whaley has never made much of an impact _
he's done his most memorable work being berated, by Samuel L.
Jackson in ``Pulp Fiction'' and by Kevin Spacey in ``Swimming With
Sharks.'' So the resonance of Whaley's writing-directing debut, the
'70s coming-of-age drama ``Joe the King,'' comes as a pleasant
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's blatantly derivative _ Whaley freely admits that
it was inspired by Francois Truffaut's ``The 400 Blows'' _ it's
nevertheless affecting, and Whaley shows unexpected promise behind
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Joe (Noah Fleiss) _ whom we first see as a 9-year-old, standing
away from the rest of the kids and smoking a cigarette _ is a
screw-up. He's embarrassed by and afraid of his father (Val
Kilmer), a school janitor prone to sudden violence; he's only
marginally closer to his mother (Karen Young), sharing her
affection for '50s crooner Johnny Ray. His closest tie is with his
brother, Mike (Max Ligosh), who is blessed with the looks,
personality and brains in the family, but understands the turmoil
that Joe's going through.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``400 Blows,'' ``Joe the King'' is a portrait of a
delinquent in the making; even working at a local greasy spoon
can't make Joe shape up. As he grows into his teens, so does his
knack for thievery, which starts small but blossoms into full-blown
acts of rebellion. But his crimes have a Robin Hood quality; Joe
instinctively understands that as bad as he's got it, some people
have it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Fleiss instinctively understands Joe's character. The
14-year-old star is on screen for the bulk of the movie, and he's
completely in touch with Joe's feelings of love, frustration and
pain. It's here that Whaley does his best work as a director,
taking a talented young actor and helping him form one of the
year's best performances.
</P>
<P>
   But Whaley appears to be intimidated by _ or too trusting of _
the more experienced members of the cast. Kilmer is far too
self-conscious as Joe's volatile father; he's full of mumbles and
actorly slouches that proudly show off his bloated gut. Kilmer's
method-acting feels out of place in this movie's more naturalistic
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Hawke is a school counselor who's the only adult who comes
close to getting through to Joe, but again, his slacker persona
doesn't quite fit the film's tone. Only John Leguizamo, as a
co-worker who sees right through Joe's antics, blends in
seamlessly. It's interesting to note that Leguizamo, who served as
executive producer, has never co-starred with Whaley, while Kilmer
and Hawke have, in ``The Doors'' and ``A Midnight Clear,''
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley's screenplay is a little too intent on easy villains,
with virtually every adult in the film either evil or idiotic; he
lets Joe off the hook too easily, giving him an excuse for his
crimes. But he also studiously avoids sentimentality in a film that
could have easily sunk into maudlin territory. There's enough going
on here to indicate that Whaley's true place is behind the camera,
not in front of it.

DANNY BONADUCE IN SPOTLIGHT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by  LANG Group )  
(Eds: Not for use before Saturday, Nov. 13). 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER, Staff Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Bonaduce sounds almost giddy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar feeling from the local radio personality who's
still probably best-known as impish Danny Partridge, the
red-haired, freckled kid from ABC's '70s sitcom ``The Partridge
Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce, paired since Sept. 15 with Jamie White as co-host of
the 5-to-9 a.m. weekday program on Burbank adult contemporary
station KYSR-FM (98.7) _ Star 98 _ has just been chosen to do
commercial voice-over work for TV's UPN network, situated just
downstairs from his radio gig.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce, who grew up in Woodland Hills, is plainly on top of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier,'' he says. ``My whole family is here in
Los Angeles. The weather is great. The radio show is doing well.
And now this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the jury is still out on ``The Jamie &AMP; Danny Show.''
After a radio career that took him around the country, Bonaduce
bounced to Los Angeles to replace White's former co-hosts, Frosty
Stillwell and Frank Kramer, White's broadcast partners since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've hit it off,'' Bonaduce says about his on-air
chemistry with the frequently raunchy White. ``I wouldn't say it
was a gamble. I mean, I'm a professional. I do what management says
to do. They said come to Los Angeles and go on the air with Jamie
and talk about whatever comes up. It's funny _ I feel like I'm the
sensible one in the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ken Christensen, vice president and general manager of
Star: ``Danny brings star appeal and a familiar, warm personality,
thanks to his work on `The Partridge Family.' He and Jamie are a
perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce says he doesn't particularly enjoy talking up his
former fame as precocious Danny Partridge. But this past week, it
came up often on Star because ABC's ``Come On, Get Happy: The
Partridge Family Story,'' a behind-the-freckles look at the '70s
sitcom and its stars, is airing at 9 tonight on KABC (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce was a consultant on the film, which uses newcomers and
veteran performers to portray the actors who played TV's fatherless
family of six and their traveling pop group, but admits he penned a
first draft when he and a pal pitched it to Fox in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been through so many revisions,'' Bonaduce, 40,
explained. ``They asked me if I wanted a hand in casting. I said,
`No, I'm too close to it.' Casting people get their jobs because
they're good.''
</P>
<P>
   The telefilm reveals how the pressures of instant success
</P>
<P>
   when the show hit the airwaves Sept. 25, 1970, and its abrupt
cancellation on Aug. 31, 1974 _ Bonaduce's 15th birthday _ forever
changed the stars of the series. ``The Partridge Family'' also
featured Oscar winner Shirley Jones and her real-life stepson,
David Cassidy, who became a '70s teen idol and pinup.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce's problems have been well-documented. The youngest of
four children, he landed his first commercial at age 4 and at 7
scored a spot in an episode of ``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' that his
dad wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce says he began smoking pot on the ``Partridge'' set at
the age of 13 and lost his virginity to one of Cassidy's castoffs
soon after. Shortly before the series wrapped, Bonaduce's parents
divorced, and he rented an apartment, enrolling at a private high
school in Encino where he was introduced to LSD and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Although he landed a few small TV parts, Bonaduce realized he
had hit bottom in 1988 when his mom tracked him down in a dingy
motel room on Sunset Boulevard, where he weighed just 112 pounds
and was subsisting on a diet of freebase and orange juice. He told
the story in a recent anti-drug message taped for Fox's ``America's
Most Wanted'' and repeated on the radio show.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he'd already been arrested for cocaine possession in
West Hollywood but would face another drug charge and, most
famously, an arrest for punching a transvestite prostitute in
Phoenix during the next three years before he cleaned up for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those people whose motto was: `If it's worth
doing, it's worth overdoing!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Free of drugs for almost 10 years, Bonaduce now lives in the
Hollywood Hills with his wife, Gretchen, whom he married eight
years ago, and their 4-year-old daughter, Isabella.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce scored his first radio job at WEXG-FM in Philadelphia
in 1988, next moving to Phoenix, then back to Philadelphia and
Chicago, Detroit and New York before starting at Star two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, he admits, is the toughest radio market in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, there was Howard Stern, but I was doing an adult
contemporary show, talking about raising a child and stuff like
that,'' Bonaduce said. ``Here, you've got Rick Dees, Mark and
Brian, Kevin and Bean, Stern again .... that's a lot of talent on
the air in the morning. But I think Jamie and I have a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaduce says he doesn't have the slightest idea why ``The
Partridge Family'' continues to fascinate. Hit songs like ``I Think
I Love You'' and ``Come On, Get Happy,'' the family's cherished
psychedelic bus and their crushed velvet costumes have attained
iconic status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any idea what we were doing,'' Bonaduce said.
``We didn't know this thing would live on as long as it has. We
were just trying to get through the day, you know?''

`PARTRIDGE' STORY DARKLY IRONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  2.5 stars  
(Eds: Not for use before Saturday, Nov. 13). 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom.) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd expect the title ``Come On, Get Happy: The Partridge
Family Story'' would be ironic in a flip, kitschy way, but who
would've guessed the irony would be quite so dark? This backstage
yarn _ told from Danny Bonaduce's (aka Danny Partridge's)
perspective _ has such wild mood swings that it could use a
prescription for lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the teleflick is content to revel in the benign
loopiness of the sitcom in question, famous for its
counterculture-as-pablum premise. At times, though, it aspires to
being the ``Raging Bull'' of sappy sitcom tell-alls, as it depicts
the violent physical abuse Bonaduce (played by Shawn Pyfrom)
received from his father, an embittered, struggling writer.
Director David Burton Morris hasn't a clue how to handle these
tonal shifts _ the confrontational scenes, though staged in a
heavy-handed fashion, are shot and lit in the same pointedly inane,
light-headed manner as the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come On, Get Happy'' at its best is a once-over-lightly parody
of the network executive sensibilities that created the show.
``Like the Monkees, only less threatening'' is an early pitch for
``The Partridge Family'' in sessions that would be called
``brainstorming'' if, in fact, any cerebra had been in use while
devising the series.
</P>
<P>
   In quick order we meet the players _ Shirley Jones (Eve Gordon)
and Dave Madden (Michael Chieffo), who are fondly delineated; David
Cassidy (Rodney Scott), depicted as a spoiled artiste chafing
against the yoke of mainstream-television oppression; and everyone
else, who fail to make much of an impression. Except, of course,
for Bonaduce, who, the film suggests, was even at 10 years old the
go-to guy when mining for comic gold (Bonaduce served as the film's
consultant).
</P>
<P>
   Outside of some rather bland revelations that won't make
headlines (heck, they barely serve as subplots) _ Jones warned
Cassidy to treat with compassion Susan Dey, who had an unrequited
crush on her co-star; Cassidy battled with the network over money
and his highly publicized private life _ Bonaduce tells no tales
out of school. The film doesn't belabor the sheer cheesiness of the
musical sequences in the series, as the actors lip-sync'ed the
tunes and put shockingly little effort into playing their
instruments with anything approaching verisimilitude, but neither
does it fully exploit its comedic potential. And the scenes with
Danny's father _ who does everything except wickedly twirl a
handlebar mustache _ bring down the tepidly giddy fun of the rest
of proceedings significantly, without adding much substance or
insight in the way of a trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   There's scarcely an interesting anecdote offered about the
making of the series, so it's appropriate that the show's own
turgid musical cues are frequently employed. At the end, Bonaduce
(as voice-over narrator) blandly enthuses, ``It was the bus ride of
a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to take his word for it; for viewers, it's little
more than an excuse to go nowhere, just vegetate on the couch for a
couple of hours. &QL;

LEWIS IS MOVING FOR A CHECKMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Boxing is not Lennox Lewis's game, chess is. Therein
lies the root of his problems with prize fighting.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the opinion of his trainer, Emanuel Steward. To
Steward it is chess, not what beats inside Lewis's chest, that has
made him often seem the reluctant warrior. It is not a lack of
heart but rather a love for that most thoughtful of games that has
made the WBC heavyweight champion too often resemble Hamlet in
short pants, a man unsure of whether to press forward or retreat.
</P>
<P>
   When you stand 6 feet 5 inches tall, weigh 250 pounds, and
choose to fight for a living, the cerebral is not what is expected
of you. Dominance is. The boxing ring is a place for that. It is a
place for courage and for aggression. It is not a place for the
faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Lewis's performance in the second half of his first
fight with Evander Holyfield in March led to a distasteful draw
rather than the victory Lewis believes he earned. Rightly or
wrongly, when his moment came to dominate, he chose to play it safe
in the most dangerous arena in sport, and he was punished for it.
He was not in the hurt business that night. He was in the insurance
business, and he blew the actuarial tables when two judges were
unwilling to take away Holyfield's titles and hand them to a man
who didn't seem inclined to fight for them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis didn't lose his third of the heavyweight title that night,
but he lost his chance at greatness, a chance that will come around
again Saturday when he faces Holyfield for a second time at the
Thomas and Mack Center. Lewis seems to sense this. He has promised
a different fight, a fight in which he says he will impose his will
on a 37-year-old warrior who many say has taken too many arrows
over the years to survive another battle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are right. Perhaps Lennox Lewis means it this time.
Perhaps, at 34, he will come out and attack and destroy Holyfield.
But when he talks for more than a few minutes about that, he no
longer appears to be someone ready to slay the dragon. After an
opening salvo of bravado, he soon enough comes back to playing the
same role in the same play.
</P>
<P>
   He always comes back sounding like Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to be a warrior,'' Lewis said.
``Warriors have to take punishment and come back. I think there's a
point where you can't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's point may be well taken. Certainly he was implying that
Holyfield is such a man. But can a chess player who holds such a
world view defeat an angry warrior?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis thinks so and so does Steward, but only if his man turns
out to be a fighter Saturday night and not a chess player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last fight I was upset for boxing,'' Steward said. ``I saw
people scraping up every penny they had to get seven guys in a room
to see a great fight, and they didn't see it. This time, Lennox has
got to prove he can be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criticism he received was that he didn't knock
Holyfield out. He won with ease, but he won using 70 percent of his
abilities. He realizes he should have knocked him out. Lennox
learned he's a better fighter than he thought, but he paid a big
price for laying back. This is a very powerful kid, but his nature
is to lay back. He was never in a mode to go for the knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox doesn't need to change his style, just his intensity.
Holyfield knows he can't outbox Lennox, so there has to come a
certain point in this fight when it will be like Frazier-Ali, two
guys blasting away. There's no avoiding it. It''s gonna happen,
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, can Bobby Fischer defeat Evander Holyfield?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis believes so. He long ago rejected Steward's antipathy
toward his favorite game, insisting the one has nothing to do with
the other, although he admits rooks and knights going to battle is
the kind of warfare he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   So on the one hand, Lewis says of Holyfield: ``This is his
retirement fight. It's time for him to retire, and I'm going to
make him. I think he's lost a lot of respect because of how he made
up all those silly excuses (about problems with cramps during the
fight). I never made any excuses after the Oliver McCall fight
(when he was KO'd in the second round in his only defeat). I just
learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but on the other hand, when he talks of that night
caution laces his voice. He is back in smoky Wembley Arena, his
mind blinking like a phone on hold, the only noise the sound of
waves crashing on a beach as he falls to the floor. When he thinks
of that, Lennox Lewis no longer talks of retiring Evander
Holyfield. At such moments, he thinks of checkmate, not check this
out.
</P>
<P>
   So what did he learn that night in London, when McCall turned
the lights black with one right hand to the face? Did he learn
about the warrior's fate, or did he learn that boldness is rewarded
in boxing more often than blandness? Listen long enough, and you
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Oliver McCall is a bit of a ghost for me,'' Lewis
admitted. ``I would be lying if I said I wasn't aware of what
happened to me with McCall when Holyfield was against the ropes
(and in trouble) in that fifth round (back in March). People keep
telling me I should have finished Holyfield, but they weren't in
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have all their life's hopes at stake. When Michael
Moorer seemed on course to beat Holyfield a second time, remember
that Moorer was confident he had him and then Holyfield jumped off
the ropes and put an end to him. You have to respect a fighter like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very cunning, very ruthless. He admitted he was trying to
draw me in and deliver a sucker punch in the first fight. So I'm
not walking into the ring thinking it's a formality. I want to
knock him out, but it's not an easy task. He's a warrior. If I
didn't recognize that, I wouldn't be a warrior. I'd be a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe just a chess player trapped one fight too many in a
warrior's sport?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over all my fights, you'll see any time Lennox
Lewis is put under pressure, he answers the question,'' Lewis
insisted, citing his 34-1-1 record to back his statement up. ``I
fight my way out of it. Evander Holyfield still don't have no
answer for me. He has never seen a boxer like Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the things Lewis has said the past few weeks, that is the
truest statement of all. The Warrior has never seen a boxer like
Bobby Fischer . . . or a chessman like Lennox Lewis.

FUND MANAGERS LOOK OVERSEAS FOR THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the investment world, the 1990s has been an American decade.
The US economy has outperformed the rest of the world and so has
the US stock market. American investors have responded to these
developments just the way you would expect: They have kept their
money close to home.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Analytical Services, mutual funds that
invest in overseas stocks have less than 8 percent of the money in
equity mutual funds overall.
</P>
<P>
   But economists and portfolio managers say that going forward the
action will be elsewhere and that investors who want to do well
should be looking across the oceans. ``We think the opportunities
are going to be more exciting outside the United States,'' says
Miren Etcheverry, manager of John Hancock's International fund.
</P>
<P>
   The case for the rest of the world is built on a few key
assumptions. The first could be summed up as follows: The United
States has had a great run, but how much further can it go?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into the tenth year of an economic expansion,''
says Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in
Waltham. The jobless rate here is at a 30-year low and inflationary
pressures are starting to build. The US stock market has been
rising steadily since 1990 and the price-to-earnings ratio of the
market is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is ready to say the US market has topped out, there
is general feeling that the best days may be behind us.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Europe and Asia. The European economies are growing
but in many countries, the jobless rate is still close to 10
percent. There is plenty of room to expand, say analysts, without
bumping up against any limits. Ditto for Asia, where Japan and many
other countries are just emerging from recession. Perhaps more
critically, the rest of the world is just starting down the
restructuring road. The United States has spent the past ten years
merging, restructuring and deregulating. More recently it has also
begun transforming itself into an information economy.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States is at the 10-mile mark along this road,
Europe is at the 5-mile mark, and Japan is just putting on its
walking shoes. Both will have to catch up, say money managers.
``There is only one model of capitalism going forward,'' says Nigel
Hart, manager of Putnam's International Voyager fund.
</P>
<P>
   Following the American lead should result in more efficient
economies, greater profits and rising stock markets. Portfolio
managers are especially bullish about prospects for Japan because
it has so much room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, American investors could safely ignore
the rest of the world. Between 1994 and 1998 the typical
international fund badly underperformed the typical American fund.
In 1999, however, the lines have crossed. As of early November, the
average international fund was up 18 percent compared to 11 percent
for the average domestic fund, according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Some mutual fund investors have started to notice. They have
poured money into some of the hottest international funds,
including Janus Worldwide and Fidelity's Japan Small Company fund,
which is up an astonishing 203 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many investors, the prospect of international
investing is frightening. Like tourists venturing far from home,
they are afraid of what they might find. With good reason. In late
1994, the Latin American markets plummeted after the Mexican peso
crisis. In 1997 Asian markets melted away; Russia did the same in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the developed world, currency and political risks cannot
be discounted. The Japanese government dithered for years before
coming to grips with that country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take people a while to warm up to foreign funds,'' says
Russel Kinnel, mutual fund editor of Morningstar.com, a financial
analysis website.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that life is still pretty cozy here at
home. The typical domestic mutual fund has had a double-digit gain
this year; some growth funds with a heavy exposure to technology
are up more than 30 percent. When the familiar works, why try
something new?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculate it may take bad news on the home front
to get investors to look overseas. But look, they should, say
global money managers, most of whom are already putting their money
where their mouths are.
</P>
<P>
   The '90s was an American decade. The next one may belong to
someone else.

POLICEMAN ACCUSED OF SCAM INVOLVING ELVIS COLLECTIBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Fla., Ark.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A veteran police officer has been arrested on
suspicion of defrauding a Florida man and several people of up to
$32,000 worth of Elvis Presley memorabilia, including rare compact
discs, photographs and books.
</P>
<P>
   John Solis, who has been on the San Francisco police force for
15 years, was arrested Monday night after officers searched his
home in Hercules, a community north of Oakland. The officer faces
four counts of grand theft and four felony counts of forgery, the
Hercules police said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest stems from a series of transactions that Solis
allegedly made over the Internet, by mail and by telephone
beginning in June 1997, Detective William Imboden of the Hercules
police said. The investigation began in July when a man in
Sarasota, Fla., complained to the police that he sent Solis $1,600
worth of CDs and books but was never paid for it, Imboden said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Florida contacted the Hercules police, who began
their own investigation. Solis said he had never received the
items, the police in Hercules said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, Solis apparently contacted Elvis
collectors through the Internet, where numerous sites exist hawking
posters, records, videos, Elvis razor relief lotion and jailhouse
rock dolls. Several of his alleged victims have their own Web pages
offering Elvis collectibles. Others were apparently contacted
through news groups.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Solis then arranged to buy the collectibles.
Imboden said Solis would either stop payment on checks he mailed or
have the credit card charge reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The police believe that Solis defrauded an Arkansas man out of
90 rare Elvis videos worth $2,700; took a 17-year-old in Memphis
for 27 compact discs worth more than $500; and scammed a Texas
woman for $3,700 worth of books, CDs and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Imboden said that Solis may have obtained at least $32,000 in
collectibles through fraudulent means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elvis world is a tight-knit community,'' Imboden said.
``There are apparently other victims out there. There are other
complaints that we are investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco police suspended Solis without pay on Tuesday.
He had been assigned to the department's record room for the past
several months, said police spokesman Sherman Ackerson. If
convicted of a felony, he would automatically be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Solis was being held at the Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez
in lieu of $100,000 bail.

US HISTORY REFLECTED IN GARDENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In closing down the vegetable garden this year, I started
thinking about how our garden beliefs and interests have changed
over the years. Certainly growing vegetables in the backyard has
had its ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   During the Second World War (Eisenhower, Roosevelt, Hitler, and
all that) everyone grew vegetables to help the war effort.
Rationing was in effect on many foodstuffs. If I didn't clean my
plate my mother would remind me that children were starving in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother grew giant cucumbers, which were bitter and
inedible. One day the jars of preserved tomatoes exploded in the
cellar spewing red gunk all over the ceiling. After that my mother
preferred roses.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone put a life back together after that war, and vegetables
were forgotten by most. Then came the 1960s, which were laid back
and soft, the Woodstock era.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, people fantasized about being self-sufficient, and
it was popular for little vegetable plots to be dug and ``farmed.''
The ``Victory Garden'' began on television, and neighborhood
community gardens were started, many of which are thriving to this
day. Chemicals, fertilizers, and water were used with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, everyone adjusted to expensive gasoline and high
living. The thrill and challenge of just growing food was boring,
and vegetables went from beans and cabbage to radicchio and
Japanese radishes. The flower children of the '60s had become the
sophisticated gardeners of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting was how gardening had changed. No more
seat-of-the-pants old farmers' wisdom. Familiar chemicals like
arsenate of lead and DDT became suspect, then outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Plant hormones and fertilizers allowed us to control growth as
never before. Super seedlings were bought in nurseries instead of
grown on one's own sunny windowsill. All kinds of gadgets like
water and pH meters were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   New theories like integrated pest management (to use fewer
chemicals) were popularized. We began to wonder if we really needed
a weed-free lawn and did each tomato have to be perfect? Soil
microorganisms were being researched. DNA and gene splicing had
already begun. These are now the common currency of today's
gardening and agribusiness.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s brought more technology, more plastic, more
irrigation, more growth regulators. The poor little plant became
almost an intruder in this brave new world.

NO LANDSLIDE _ YET _ FOR E-VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a few hours on Tuesday (Nov. 2), Helen Steverson had the
toughest job at the Lexington Street Fire Station in Cambridge,
Mass. She was assisting voters with the newfangled ballot box, a
super-high-tech innovation that left locals scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They upgraded the system,'' Steverson explained. ``They
replaced the old machine with the crank.''
</P>
<P>
   The machine with the crank? It looks like Cambridge has made it
into the 20th century, with minutes to spare. Actually, the city
got rid of the old crank machines two years ago. But the rest of
the system is a relic of the Paper and Pencil Age. Here's the
drill: You give your address to a volunteer who crosses your name
off a computer printout. No one asks for identification, and the
list almost always includes names of neighbors who have moved or
passed away. You step behind the star-spangled curtain and fill in
little circles, like a standardized test. Easy enough. But what do
you do with the cardboard sleeve that says, ``Insert finger here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what that means,'' says Steverson. ``We confused
them good this year.'' At 79, the Cambridge native has been
volunteering at the polls for 24 years. She works alongside her
friend Ethel Odell, 78, and the two have become Election Day
fixtures at the fire station. ``It's a civic duty,'' says
Steverson. ``It's a community,'' adds Odell. ``I see people I
haven't seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do the experts think about voting on the Internet? ``It
will be a long time before it gets here,'' says Steverson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe or maybe not. Voters in eight precincts in Iowa tested
voting on the Internet this week, and more than 85 percent of the
1,253 participants in the volunteer pilot project said they would
vote on line again, according to Iowa Secretary of State Chet
Culver. The program was run by a company called VoteHere.net;
naturally, the software developers will tell you that the future of
democracy (and their companies) depends on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? You can bank on line. You can buy (or learn to fix)
a kitchen sink. You buy a little red sportscar or fulfill other
little red fantasies. ``We need to do everything possible to
encourage participation in the democratic process,'' says Culver,
ticking off the depressing statistics. Voter turnout nationwide was
only 44.9 percent last year. Two million eligible voters between 18
and 24 are not voting. The US ranks 137th out of 167 democracies
when it comes to voter turnout. But if folks were allowed to click
and pick in their pajamas, the numbers might improve.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, security and privacy issues need to be ironed out.
There's also the question of the digital divide. Polling places
will always have to remain an option for people who do not own or
even use computers. But Iowa is testing the system again in
January, when high school students statewide will cast ballots in a
mock presidential caucus, and Culver predicts on-line voting will
be common in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that encourages folks to vote is a good thing. But at
the same time, the pundits and software peddlers should consider
what's lost in the name of progress. ``Voting should be a
quasi-religious experience,'' says Tracy Westen, president of the
California-based Democracy Network (www.dnet.org). ``It should be a
philosophical and ethical commitment, and the ceremonial aspects
are important. You go to the place, you see the flag, you walk into
the booth, you take your kids with you, and you hand in your
ballot. Those things are important.''
</P>
<P>
   And some day, they might disappear. Frankly, I'd choose on-line
voting over going to the polls any day (especially a stormy one).
But I'll miss the familiar walk to the fire station, the dodging
past the sign-holders and the hand-shakers, the fumbling with the
ballot. What are you supposed to do with that stupid ``Insert
finger here'' sleeve anyway? It's for privacy, Steverson says, but
it's OK if you ignore it. ``I'll be 80 soon,'' she adds, ``and this
might be my last year.''
</P>
<P>

   Here's a new low, as seen on eBay: A greedy little entrepreneur
is auctioning the domain name, egyptair990.com, with bids starting
at $2,500. The seller, who goes by the tag keith786 and claims to
be from Atlanta, didn't return e-mail messages. No wonder. The
speculator in other people's misery doesn't even own the Web
address. That privilege goes to Doug Desjardins, a Washington
attorney with the firm R. Jack Clapp and Associates. Desjardins
insists he has no intention of using the address for a profit, and
that he isn't selling it on eBay or anywhere else; he says he gave
the domain name to the families of victims of ValuJet Flight 592 to
set up an informational site.

THE SMIRK ON BUSH'S FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anything was funnier than George W. Bush's D-minus
performance on Boston newsman Andy Hiller's pop quiz, it was Trent
Lott's attempt to defend it.
</P>
<P>
   By now you have heard how the GOP front-runner embarrassed
himself in his one-on-one interview with Hiller. Bush was asked to
name the political leaders in ``four hot spots'' _ Chechnya,
Taiwan, Pakistan, and India _ and managed to identify only one,
Taiwan's President Lee. He did know that Pakistan is ruled by a
general who recently seized power in a coup d'etat. The general's
name he couldn't recall, but he did seem to approve of the coup.
``It appears he's going to bring stability to the country,'' Bush
said, ``and I think that's good news for the subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   That last, by the way, is not a wholly indefensible position _
Nawaz Sharif, the deposed prime minister, turns out to have been a
corrupt thief. But when Bush was asked in a later interview how he
could support the overthrow of an elected government, he promptly
denied having done so. ``Of course not,'' he told Sam Donaldson.
``No, no, no, no, no, no.''
</P>
<P>
   That was last week. This week Lott, the Senate majority leader,
rode to Bush's defense. On Brit Hume's TV show, Lott brushed off
the Hiller quiz as ``strictly a media thing . . . a Washington,
D.C., thing.'' Hume politely pointed out that the interview aired
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's even worse,'' was Lott's snappy riposte. ``I
mean, if there's any place in the country worse than Washington,
it's Boston, for goodness sakes. . . . They are known for, you
know, their liberalism and for that sort of activity in the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Well now. I am hardly one to gainsay liberal media bias or to
make excuses for Boston's knee-jerk politics. Certainly something
is out of balance in a state that sends 12 Democrats and zero
Republicans to Congress. But if Andy Hiller is a left-wing attack
dog for asking a presidential candidate to name the prime minister
of India, what must Senator Lott think of Alex Trebeck?
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is clear that Bush's real failing wasn't that
he didn't know who Atal Bihari Vajpayee was, but that he didn't
know who his interviewer was.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller has played the quizmaster with politicians before,
notably in 1984, when he grilled the candidates running in that
year's US Senate race in Massachusetts. Congressman Ed Markey, a
very liberal Bay State Democrat, assuredly remembers the ordeal. A
five-term House veteran, Markey was unable to name the Israeli
prime minister, estimate the size of the defense budget, or
identify the countries in which the United States was deploying
nuclear missiles. Bush might take some comfort in that. Or maybe
not. Markey dropped out of the Senate race soon after his Hiller
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Is Bush unsuited for the White House because he doesn't know who
the Chechen leader or Pakistani strongman is? Of course not. Not
one American in a thousand would have known those names. Hiller's
quiz would have revealed more had he asked Bush to identify the
Canadian and Russian prime ministers. Those are names familiar to
any foreign policy dilettante; if Bush had drawn a blank on them,
it would have said something about his readiness for the
international stage.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the most worrisome response in the whole interview was
the one that came first. Responding to the suggestion that he is
weak on foreign policy, Bush said: ``No, I've got a clear vision of
where I want to lead America.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he? Granted, the election is a year away, but Bush has been
the GOP front-runner for a long time now. If his vision of
America's place in the world is so clear, why does nobody seem to
know what it is?
</P>
<P>
   Bush needn't apologize for not being a master of minutiae. If
the Clinton and Carter administrations taught us anything, it is
that policy wonks and detail freaks do not necessarily good
presidents make. President Bush was a walking Rolodex of
international politicians. Yet his own foreign policy amounted to
little more than a preference for the status quo and a refusal to
condemn totalitarian brutality.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ronald Reagan, a president who sometimes failed to
recognize members of his own Cabinet, would have flunked the Hiller
quiz. And it wouldn't have mattered in the least. The humblest
American voter and the most arrogant foreign tyrant knew what
Reagan stood for. What does George W stand for?
</P>
<P>
   Take another look at that TV encounter. (You can watch it on
line at www.whdh.com; click on ``The Hiller Instinct.'') What is
striking is the look on Bush's face _ it is a mocking sneer, a gaze
of contempt for the reporter daring to ask him questions he didn't
have prebaked answers for. His manner drips with disdain _ disdain
not just for the quiz, but for the very idea of judging a man by
what he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sneer puts me in mind of his father's administration, in
which popularity was the measure of all things. In 1989, George
Mitchell, then the Senate majority leader, rapped Bush Sr. for the
``timidity'' of his foreign policy. James Baker scornfully refused
to hear the criticism. ``When the president of the United States is
rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating,'' he said,
witheringly, comments from critics could be ignored. Is that W's
attitude too?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people like the governor. A lot of other people aren't
sure what to make of him. Maybe it's time Bush wiped the smirk off
his face and started taking their questions seriously.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by the official military history of World War II, the
555th Parachute Infantry Battalion could hardly have been less
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns: None
</P>
<P>
   Battles: None
</P>
<P>
   Losses in action: None
</P>
<P>
   The official record does not even begin to tell the tale of the
nation's first black paratroopers, men who succeeded despite having
been programmed to fail, athletes and college boys whose desire for
combat was rejected for social reasons, soldiers who finally
distinguished themselves in a semisecret effort to thwart a
Japanese attempt to set the Pacific northwest aflame with
incendiary bombs borne by high-altitude balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integration of the army rode in on the backs of the 555,''
said Bradley Biggs, who was a young second lieutenant, the first
officer assigned to the unit. Biggs, who retired as a lieutenant
colonel in 1961, subsequently headed the Boston Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   From 1941 until the present, Americans have honored whites who
rushed to the defense of their country in what has been widely
accepted as ``the good war.'' Only in recent years have they begun
to appreciate the blacks who soldiered loyally in the face of
demeaning, discriminatory treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am invited to the different camps now for Black History
Month or Veterans Day, and I see the Army integrated, male and
female, black and white and red and yellow, all colors of people
working together, it is so uplifting,'' said Walter Morris, 78, the
first black man to receive paratrooper's wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back when we couldn't go into a post exchange _ even
in uniform,'' said Morris, a native of Waynesboro, Ga., who grew up
in Newark, N.J. More than a half century after the fact, his voice
is softly incredulous. ``They let (white) prisoners of war go in
and sit down and have a Coke and not their own soldiers. Young
people now can hardly believe it when we tell them, but that is
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   About one million blacks served in the US armed forces in World
War II, and a few _ notably the now-famous Tuskegee airmen and the
Buffalo division infantry _ distinguished themselves in combat. The
overwhelming majority never got the chance; they were assigned to
service companies, where they were little more than servants to
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was made acting first sergeant of such a company, serving
a white paratroop corps at Fort Benning in Georgia. The unit's sole
duty was guarding the barracks, training fields, and aircraft that
the white paratroopers used.
</P>
<P>
   Housed next to the calisthenics field, where day after day they
watched white paratrooper candidates training, the blacks were
commanded by a white officer who had washed out of paratroop school
and spent his days in the officers' club awaiting reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale and self-esteem among the men was as low as it could
get,'' Morris said. ``We were walking around with empty guns doing
guard duty from 4 p.m. to 8 the next morning, 24 hours on weekends.
They wouldn't even give us live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not like the Tuskegee airmen, who were for the most
part college graduates,'' he said. ``We were blue-collar folks and
these guys were looking at themselves as servants. I thought it
would help them to go through the training routine of those white
paratroop students.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, all the blacks not on guard duty were running onto the
training fields on the double and going through training drills
daily when the whites departed. Behavior, attitude, and appearance
improved as they began to feel like trainees and act like soldiers.
They were not servants any more.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Brigadier General Ridgley A. Gaither,
commander of the parachute school, passed the training area at a
time when it normally would have been empty. He saw the field
filled with black soldiers, and instructed an aide to find out what
was going on. Morris was summoned to headquarters the next morning
to speak with Gaither.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither ``was tough, but he was straight as an arrow,'' Morris
said. ``When I finished explaining, he said he was going to let me
in on a secret _ that in a few weeks the Army was going to
authorize a company of black paratroopers.'' The general asked
whether Morris would like to be the first sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so glad, my heart just about jumped out of my chest,''
Morris said. ``How I got back to my office, I don't know. Maybe I
flew back on wings. I honestly don't remember going.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first year of the war, black leaders, including A.
Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, and Benjamin Oliver Davis, the first
black general, had been pressing President Roosevelt to open up
more opportunities to blacks in defense industries and in the armed
services. Now, halfway through the conflict, the effects were
percolating down to the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a visit by Davis to the Buffalo Division, stationed at
Camp Robinson in Arkansas, that set Biggs on the road to being the
first officer assigned to the 555th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to talk with him about the shabby treatment of black
officers. We were being pushed around like we were animals,'' Biggs
said. ``He told me, `Keep your temper, curb your tongue, because
things are going to be breaking for you. There's going to be guys
going into all areas.' He mentioned the paratroopers and that
struck my ear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army sent Biggs and five other black officers to Fort
Benning to run the new unit, which was started as a platoon _ the
smallest military unit _ despite Roosevelt's expressed desire that
it be a battalion. Biggs and the other original members of the
555th took this as indicative of senior commanders' conviction that
they would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were programmed for failure, and we were determined
none of us was going to quit,'' Biggs said. ``We were not only
trying to prove those people wrong, we felt the entire nation, the
entire Negro race was looking at us. We said we would soldier right
down to the wire, that no matter what job came along we were going
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one candidate for the initial platoon was unable to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Once the others earned their wings, other blacks were allowed to
volunteer, and they came in droves, from Europe, the Pacific
theater, and posts around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a paratrooper, you had to come in as a private, but we
had sergeants coming anyway,'' Morris said. ``They were so anxious
to become real soldiers that they gave up their stripes gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, ``we were ready for combat and we thought we were going
overseas,'' Morris said. ``What we didn't know was General
Eisenhower and General Mark Clark (commander of the Italian
theater) didn't have any intention of having black paratroopers,''
because they feared friction with whites. ``We thought, `maybe the
Pacific,' and when the order came to move West for a secret
mission. we thought we were going to General MacArthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 555th was sent to Camp Pendleton, Oregon, where
they learned that numerous incendiary bombs, launched from Japan on
helium balloons, had been exploding in the American West, starting
forest fires and, at one point, endangering the nuclear reactor
where components of US atomic weapons were being made.
</P>
<P>
   The number of bombs reaching the US was far greater than the
public _ or the Japanese _ were aware, and the 555th was assigned
to detonate unexploded bombs and fight the fires. To avoid
panicking the public, and to keep the Japanese ignorant of the
success rate _ in all, nearly 300 of the bombs landed _ the
operation was to be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the end of the war, and almost a year before
President Truman ordered the desegregation of the armed services,
the military leadership paid its greatest compliment to the 555th:
It ended the life of the battalion by dispersing it into previously
all-white paratroop units. Its members became some of first black
soldiers ever to give orders to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``when I look ahead, I think about Texas, where they picked
up this black man and chained him to a pickup truck, and I think
`Damn, we haven't moved an inch,' '' Morris said. ``But that's not
true. We have. There's just still a long way to go. This is our
country, and we have to fight for it. We have to keep on keeping
on.''

PATRIOTS' NUMBER MAY BE UP WITH FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A message to the Patriots as the season's
second half begins _ keep winning.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to leave a mark on team history, it's imperative
they continue their early-season streak, because the window for
success is beginning to close on New England.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's become a race against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will have nine significant unrestricted free agents
available at the end of the season, and each one has contributed to
the team's 6-2 start. They could also be key to New England's
postseason hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is a Catch-22. Having several players
available for unrestricted free agency is good in the sense that
hungry players are giving management more bang for their buck, but
there's a sense of uneasiness as well, because of all the hassles
with impending free agency for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't motivated by that,'' said Patriots chief operating
officer Andy Wasynczuk. ``Our view of free agency is that you
always need to be looking to keep your core players. It's not just
the Patriots but it's the way it is around the league. You're going
to lose players and you have to keep reinventing yourself every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who are a mere $80,000 under the cap, already have
committed a significant amount of payroll toward next season as
deals given to players such as Willie McGinest, Ted Johnson, and Ty
Law escalate. That leaves limited dollars for those seeking new
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it's easy to surmise that a good number of the freeagents won't be with the team next season, and some players under
contract will likely be cut if their salaries don't match their
production.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots do go deep into the postseason, there will be
even more pressure on owner Robert Kraft and his staff to keep the
core of the team together. Yet they realize this is virtually
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   What will likely end up happening is that younger players have
to replace veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have taken more than their share of criticism for
losing Willie Clay, but they replaced him with a much cheaper
player in Chris Carter. A glance at the roster indicates this could
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Johnson is healthy next season, the Patriots
would love to have four starting linebackers in Chris Slade, Tedy
Bruschi, Andy Katzenmoyer, and Johnson. But will one of them have
to go?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Patriots made the tough decision on Todd Collins,
who signed with St. Louis because the Patriots decided they could
replace him with Bruschi. And they were right. Bruschi is having a
terrific season, earning the restricted free agent tender of
$934,000. But Bruschi will be an unrestricted free agent after the
season and will want to be paid what other linebackers at his
experience and performance level earn.
</P>
<P>
   At cornerback, the Patriots have been grooming Tebucky Jones for
two years. He wasn't able to beat out Steve Israel, but he hasn't
been moved to safety. Why? Because Israel's contract is up at
season's end. Israel is having an excellent season and will be
worth more than his $800,000 salary. Israel likes living in the
area and could return at a discount, but his agent, Gary Uberstine,
will certainly be seeking the best deal possible for his client.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at wide receiver. There's no denying the value of
Shawn Jefferson. He caught touchdown passes of 64 and 35 yards two
weeks ago against the Cardinals, is in great shape, and, at 30, is
still fast.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is the consummate team player, but will the Patriots
be able to afford him? Jefferson already is earning $1.8 million.
He's not going to want the same salary or take a pay cut, for this
offseason likely will prove to be his last big contract score.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I care about right now is winning a Super Bowl,'' said
Jefferson. ``I've been to two Super Bowls and have come up empty.
That's the first thing on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But his second concern is whose uniform he will wear for the
remainder of his career. He'd like to remain a Patriot, but he
knows his salary is high and his demands as a free agent will be
high, perhaps too high for New England. That's why Jefferson
recently repositioned himself, firing his longtime agent, Phil
Williams, and hiring Uberstine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great for us to win it now,'' said Jefferson.
``When you have the chance to win, you have to do everything you
can, because it might your last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brown is in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a bargain at $400,000 this season, but everyone knows
his reputation as a third-down receiver. Brown has been waiting for
his true value for a long time. Will he get it in New England?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a young receiver in Tony Simmons, who has been
brought along slowly. Like Jones, however, the Patriots are ready
to spring him as the starting receiver if they can't afford
Jefferson or Brown in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   On the defensive line, the Patriots face similar problems with
end Brandon Mitchell, who isn't having a great year but has been
making steady improvement. He'll be a restricted free agent and
would require compensation if another team signed him to an offer
sheet, but defensive linemen, especially youngsters with upside,
have a market.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will probably have to bite the bullet and pay
Mitchell, but then what happens to Chris Sullivan? Sullivan is an
unrestricted free agent, earning $934,000. He's versatile and he'll
get some offers.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive line, the big decision will involve Heath
Irwin, the starting left guard. The Patriots do have the option of
inserting Max Lane back in the spot if they lose Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   What will eventually help the Patriots keep some of these
players will be the renegotiation of quarterback Drew Bledsoe's
contract. His cap number will take a considerable dive from this
season's $7.2 million to somewhere probably in the $4 million
range. Bledsoe likely will earn a Troy Aikman-type deal, earning
upward of $20 million up front in the form of a signing bonus and a
five- or six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whither Ben Coates? Do the Patriots pay him $2.7 million or do
they cut him loose and take their chances on Rod Rutledge or a less
expensive free agent tight end?
</P>
<P>
   On a good team, there is a lot of uncertainty. If the Patriots
wanted to create a situation in which players have performed to
their peak, they have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   After the season, they will deal with the consequences.

2000 XTERRA: SUV WITH A RETRO LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days of ever-more-rapid introduction of new models and
types of cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs to fill ever-more-specific
niches, how long does it take before some manufacturer steps up and
goes retro in a class not really that old?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of SUVs, apparently not long. For that is what
Nissan has done with the 2000 Xterra. Remember when SUVs were
spartan, spunky, actually spent time in mud, snow, clambering over
rocks and got scratched by brush _ and were affordable by even
folks with modest incomes?
</P>
<P>
   I give you the Xterra, promoted as a Gen-X car, but nothing to
be scoffed at by anyone looking for the fun and affordability of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-sitting, angular box of an SUV, based on the Nissan
Frontier 4-by-4 truck platform. It comes in two- and
four-wheel-drive versions, with four- and six-cylinder engines.
Priced from the mid-$17,000s to the $25,000 range, it's formidable
competition for the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V. It's bigger
than either of them, will go where they won't go and, in fact, at
its highest price, ends up where similarly sized SUVs, like the
Toyota 4Runner, barely let you open a door.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are options you'll want. I tested the XE 4-by-4
(base model 4-by-4 at $21,499) but could not imagine it without the
powdercoated, rubber-treaded step-up rails (modern lingo for
running boards) and the signature powdercoated roof rack/gear bin.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting an Xterra without the latter would be like seeing a
snowboarder in baggy jeans, a hard-core mountain biker without
scabs, or a skateboarder without piercings.
</P>
<P>
   The rails, rack, and bin come as part of a utility package
($999) that also includes auxiliary 12-volt power ports, extra rear
tie clips, first aid kit, upgraded tires with fender moldings, rear
wiper, retractable cargo cover, tilting steering column, and
variable intermittent wipers.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to do serious off-roading, you'll need the sport
package ($799) that includes alloy wheels, fog lamps, a front tow
hook, and limited slip differential. You don't need everything in
either of the two packages, but some of the things you will not
want to do without.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can live without power door locks, power mirrors, a
leather-wrapped steering wheel and assorted other extras (power
package, $1,299), you'll bring it home nicely appointed at just
about $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll get is a sturdy, all-steel romper with body on frame
construction, engine and fuel tank skid plates underneath, that
will take you smoothly along the highway and bopping on offroad
trails.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you get bucket seats up front, a three-person,
50/50-split rear seat coated in water-resistant fabric that has an
industrial feel to it so you don't worry about dripping snowboards
or muddy mountain bike tires.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation and controls, like much of the interior, are
spartan: basics behind the wheel, climate up top in center dash,
audio below, and beneath that a small bin and 12-volt outlet.
</P>
<P>
   There are bins in all four doors and a deep center console;
pockets on the backs of the front seats and a small pocket on the
inside of the front passenger's seat _ a good spot for sunglasses
or cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The rear cargo area is ample, and since the rear seat cushions
are removable, it can be expanded into a deep, flat space. Outside
and inside, a lot can be hauled in the Xterra. There are optional
racks for skis, snowboards, kayaks, and bicycles. For the latter,
both interior and exterior racks are available, and you can carry
as many as six bikes.
</P>
<P>
   With such an obvious aim at the adventurous, it's no wonder
another Xterra option is a first-aid kit, complete with scissors,
bandages, ointments, and even two emergency blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Unless I just wanted the SUV look to tool around a suburban
neighborhood or downtown Boston, I'd stay away from the 4-cylinder
engine and go right for the V6. The former is 143 horsepower and
the latter 170 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   But for trips into ski country, or offroading, you'll want the
extra power. The XE V6 was good enough for highway passing, though
I'd certainly go with the 5-speed standard over the 4-speed
automatic just because the standard is more responsive at that
horsepower. If I pull out to pass, I want personal control of
shifting _ though I was struck in the Xterra by the long, long
floor-mounted shift, reminiscent of old trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But bear in mind, please, that this is not a car. It sits high,
and it transfers weight more radically than a low-slung car will.
Passing and cornering in the Xterra, I was acutely aware of weight
shifting transversely to the outside of my turns and diagonally to
the outside front tire. Drive this or any other SUV as if you're in
a standard car and you can get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Offroad, while the Xterra lacks the power of its larger ilk, it
makes up for it by being light. It nimbly climbed a steep, muddy
grade; worked its way in proper mincing fashion over large rocks;
held itself back nicely, using the engine, on steep downhill
stretches.
</P>
<P>
   It was stiff side-to-side and rocked stiffly front to back on
undulating terrain. It has double wishbone suspension up front,
good old dual leaf springs in the rear. ABS is standard on all
models, with discs up front and drums in the rear. Gas mileage _
the usual soccer games, commuting, fetching of morning newspapers _
was an acceptable 17 1/2 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --Rear door handles mounted high up and vertically on the back
edge of the door. Ever approach a vehicle, arms loaded with
packages or gear, and fumble to reach down and lift a handle you
cannot see? With these, you lean the load against the body near the
handle and flip it out toward you.
</P>
<P>
   --Cup holders. Five. Good sized. Not tucked away. Don't have to
search for them.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The parking brake. Pulls out from under the dash to the right
of the steering wheel. A real hassle to take off. Lots of twisting
and turning and maneuvering to get it fully disengaged (at least
that's what the parking brake light told me).

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are other worthies, all of whom undoubtedly will
be mentioned by Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, who was told he had cancer in spring training,
received a standing ovation from a sympathetic Boston crowd when he
returned to the Yankees in May, and was not only a survivor in
October, but a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Art Howe, widely nominated to be fired last winter, guided the
unheralded Oakland Athletics from oblivion to playoff contention
until the last week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates won 95 games and a division title in Texas with a
pitching staff that allowed better than five runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Mike Hargrove won 97 games, one fewer than Torre's
Yankees, an achievement that should not be trivialized in the wake
of the Indians' playoff collapse and his subsequent firing.
</P>
<P>
   But when the results of balloting by 28 members of the Baseball
Writers Association of America _ two from each American League city
_ announced, it was Jimy Williams who was expected to be named the
American League's Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   This was his reward for guiding the Sox to 94 regular-season
wins and their second consecutive postseason appearance, the summer
after their best hitter and supposed spiritual leader, Mo Vaughn,
left for Anaheim. The votes were cast even before the Sox stormed
back from a two games to none deficit against the Indians to win
their AL Division Series, or proved a handful against the Yankees
in the AL Championship Series. Otherwise, Williams might have won
by an even greater margin than the one anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 83 years since a Sox team went to the postseason in
back-to-back seasons. The last time that happened, 1915-16, Rough
Bill Carrigan was the Sox manager, and he kept his star pitcher,
Babe Ruth, out of the '15 World Series, to teach the wayward Ruth a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams this summer sat down his star pitcher, Pedro
Martinez, to teach him a lesson, too. Martinez showed up for a
Saturday matinee at about the same time his teammates would
normally show up for a night game. He paid a penalty for his
tardiness; Williams refused to allow him to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's classic Jimy,'' said John Cerutti, who pitched for
Williams when he managed the Blue Jays in the late '80s and is now
a broadcaster in Toronto. ``Be on time and play hard. The Boston
organization, I think, and the entire team respects Jimy for that.
I think he handled it the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``His message was, `I don't care who you are.' He treats
everyone the same, and gets the respect of the players because of
that. Ultimately, I think Pedro respects him for what he did. It
certainly didn't hurt him, or the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, who turned 56 five weeks ago on Oct. 4, has
managed the Red Sox for the last three years and is under contract
for a fourth season. The writers have been giving out the manager's
award since 1983. The only previous Sox manager so honored was John
McNamara, in 1986, the Buckner year, and Johnny Mac was fired
before he completed his fourth season, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The last man to manage the Sox for more than four seasons was
Don Zimmer (1976-80), and he is such a Williams man, he ripped his
own boss, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, for suggesting that
Jimy ``incited'' spectators to litter the field with debris by his
ejection from Game Four of the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Williams needed any help handling Steinbrenner _ or
``Georgie-Porgie,'' as he repeatedly called the Yankees' boss the
next day. ``When Georgie-Porgie talks,'' Williams told a delighted
corps of national media, ``I don't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people who believe Williams shouldn't have
to worry about job security, not after what he did with a team that
lost not only Vaughn but its All-Star closer, Tom Gordon; endured
three trips to the disabled list by its second-best pitcher, Bret
Saberhagen; and started games with 13 different pitchers, most in
the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox is one. Cox, who was succeeded
by Williams as Toronto manager in 1986 and later reclaimed Williams
as one of his coaches in Atlanta after Williams was fired in 1989,
said on more than one occasion this past season that the Sox should
lock up Williams for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To finish just four games behind the Yankees was
unbelievable,'' Cox said during the World Series. ``To get as far
as they got is maybe unachievable. Talk about holding together. He
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had a lifetime of practice. The original plan was to arrive
in the big leagues as a player, but that dream ended when he tore
his rotator cuff flinging a Styrofoam cup, of all things. Today, he
would have had Saberhagen-like surgery and probably kept on
playing. Thirty years ago, that meant a career switch for an
aspiring shortstop. Like stocking shelves in a St. Louis
convenience store in which he owned a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, it seemed Williams had a better chance of returning
to central California and following his father into the
cattle-ranching business than landing a job in baseball. But a
former college teammate at Fresno State, Tom Sommers, offered him a
job managing a Class A team in Iowa in 1974 for the Angels, and
Williams hasn't taken off the uniform since.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Howarth was hired as a broadcaster by Salt Lake City in
1976, the same year Williams was promoted to manage the Triple-A
farm club, and followed Williams to Toronto after he was hired as a
coach in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy is exactly the same person in 1976 as he is today,''
Howarth said, ``in terms of consistency of values, work ethic, and
positive attitude. He's the same premium teacher and instructor, a
reflective person who is the most other-directed person I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Williams has changed, too. Only a fool fails to learn
from experience and failure, which is what Williams ultimately
tasted in Toronto, with a team that took a 3 1/2-game lead into the
last week of the 1987 season and lost the division title to the
Detroit Tigers. The Blue Jays were a talented team, but they were a
handful, too. One player, Damaso Garcia, became so enraged one day
in Oakland, he took off his uniform, doused it in alcohol, and set
it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lit up Garcia in front of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in the uniform I wear and you only get
so many years to wear it,'' Williams said at the time. ``I'm proud
of it. If you burn your shoes, that's one thing. If you burn your
shorts, that's another thing. But if you burn your uniform, I take
it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerutti, a Blue Jay when Garcia conducted his private bonfire,
recalls Williams skating through that one with relative ease. He
didn't survive the challenge to his authority from George Bell, the
1987 American League Most Valuable Player who became enraged when
the Blue Jays decided to make him their designated hitter instead
of left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was made above Williams's head; to this day, then
Toronto general manager Pat Gillick rues his failure to give
Williams more backing. But the manager took the fall, claiming it
was his call, and the following year he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt him awfully, but that's Jimy, he's an upfront guy,''
Cerutti said. ``We didn't play well that year, and he battled all
year with George and with the media. It hurt us as a team. It was a
black cloud that hung over us all year.''
</P>
<P>
   His former pitching coach in Toronto, Al Widmeyer, says few
people knew that Williams was suffering from a painful ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hardly told anybody,'' Widmeyer said from his home in
Tulsa, Okla. ``He told me because we were friends for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But a greater sensitivity for defusing controversy has served
him well in Boston, where he has deftly handled the defections of
Roger Clemens and Vaughn, the arrest of Wilfredo Cordero, the
position switch of John Valentin, and the missed Martinez wake-up
call among other managerial obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jimy has matured a tremendous amount over the years,''
Howarth said. ``He used to let a lot of little things bother him.
Jimy is the most positive person I've ever met, but now he's
learned to deal with the negatives and still remain positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams _ undoubtedly with considerable reluctance _ will
meet with reporters in Fenway Park. Negatives? Yeah, the AL Manager
of the Year will mention one. He'd much rather be showing off a
World Series trophy. But it's unlikely anyone will claim it's his
fault the Sox don't have one. Not on this day.

FIRE OFFICIALS SAY HALOGEN FLOOR LAMPS POSE DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fire departments and the Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric
Co. are urging people in the San Francisco Bay Area to turn over
for recycling an inexpensive type of halogen floor lamp that is a
potential fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers nationwide have purchased more than 50 million of the
torchier lamps that officials say have a history of easily igniting
flammable materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cheap and provide a lot of light,'' said Chris
Calwell, a consultant for Ecos, a company specializing in pollution
prevention. ``The problem is that they produce too much heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there have been more than 400 fires, 114 injuries
and 31 deaths related to halogen floor lamps, Calwell said. In
California, 30 fires have been attributed to the product.
</P>
<P>
   Lamps turned in Saturday in the Bay Area will be recycled into
steel. The first 1,000 people bringing in lamps will receive $5
certificates, which they can apply toward new federally approved
fluorescent devices, known as Energy Star lamps, available at
stores such as Target and Wal-Mart for $40 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   A halogen lamp uses more electricity. Fluorescent lamps use 80
percent less power, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who cannot find the new Energy Star lamps in stores
can get more information or purchase one through the Internet at
www.lightsite.net.

1930S GM BUS OFFERED A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, it cradled the future, rolling out of post-Depression
America and touring the United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Canada
with 11 other silver-and-red vehicles just like it, promise on
wheels, revealing the wonders of science and technology that
offered a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it sits gutted and rusty in a tight little hilltop
neighborhood in a small New Hampshire mill town, awaiting
restoration and a chance to tour again.
</P>
<P>
   For auto buffs, there is not much more exciting than an
extraordinary find in an unlikely place. And the General Motors
``Futurliner'' belonging to restaurateur-turned-carpenter Kendrick
Robbins is a rare find.
</P>
<P>
   Its roots are found in the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, where the
most popular display was GM's Science and Technology exhibit. It
was such a tantalizing glimpse into the future that GM decided to
take it on the road. So the Parade of Progress, using eight
van-like trucks, was launched on Feb. 11, 1936, in Lakeland, Fla.
As it grew in popularity, GM replaced the original vehicles with 12
Futurliners, built in 1939 at a cost of $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Built by the GMC Truck and Coach Division and GM Research
Laboratories Division, the Futurliners were 33 feet long, 8 feet
wide, 11 feet 4 inches high, and had a wheelbase of 248 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The driver sat in a ``cockpit'' that was reached by entering a
door on the front ride side of the Futurliner and climbing stairs
to a center-steering perch. The driver's eyes were 10 feet above
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in Fridigaire-cooled comfort, with power steering at his
command, he peered through a curved E-Z-Glass windshield that
surrounded him like a bubble. An Autronic Eye sensed the approach
of other vehicles and automatically dimmed the Futurliner's
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   A 302-cubic-inch, 145-horsepower gasoline engine, supplying 262
lb-ft. of torque powered the rumbling exhibit and a HydraMatic
transmission took care of shifting.
</P>
<P>
   The interior was upholstered in vinyl-coated fabric in lime and
hunter green.
</P>
<P>
   A gull-wing door 45 inches high and 16 feet long opened up,
while a similar door of the same length and 36 inches high opened
down to form a stage and reveal interior exhibition space. At
night, a 15-foot lighting tower rose from the roof to a height of
18 feet and its 36 fluorescent tubes, aided by two 250-watt
incandescent lamps at each end of this ``inverted canoe'' lighted
the area around the Futurliner.
</P>
<P>
   Each Futurliner had a purpose: lecture stage, a display of
modern power featuring the diesel engine, an animated diorama
called America at a Crossroads, the kitchen of tomorrow, the living
room of tomorrow, information, aviation, national defense,
scientific research, an album of motoring, the story of gasoline,
and the evolution of motor car coach craft.
</P>
<P>
   With a crew of about 60 _ ``most of whom are young college
graduates,'' GM literature of the day boasted _ the tour rumbled
from city to city. Some Futurliners were connected by awnings to
form an enclosed warren of exhibits. A feature of the parade was
the Aer-o-Dome, an exhibition tent holding 1,500 people supported
by ``airplane alloy girders'' and covered with ``aluminum
impregnated skin'' _ a huge and early free-standing dome tent.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were also lecturers, and the lecturers were also the
grounds crew that set up and took down the exhibit at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   They visited more than 250 cities and the exhibit was seen by 12
1/2 million people before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor shut down
the Parade of Progress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, GM decided to restart the parade and, keeping in mind
that progress now meant covering new gains such as jet propulsion,
radar and television, retrofitted the Futurliners. In stripping his
Futurliner for restoration, Robbins found the date Dec. 24, 1952 _
the day before he was born _ scrawled on its inner skin.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins found his Futurliner in a curious way, in a junkyard in
his small New Hampshire town. He owned a restaurant at the time and
was out looking for an antique auto he could use as a salad bar and
conversation piece. But he spotted the Futurliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Forget the salad bar,' '' he says. For $3,000, the
Futurliner was his.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has all the exterior parts and can do an authentic
exterior restoration. Inside, he will have to improvise, and he
wants a diesel engine for his Futurliner. His hope is that he can
one day put it on the road to tour again _ perhaps exhibiting
tires, automotive breakthroughs, automobilia.
</P>
<P>
   He visited a California man who restored a Futurliner _ an Art
Deco treatment that cost $200,000 _ so he knows it can be done.
He's talked with people who can bend new glass for the cockpit;
he's bought a welder; he's collected all the literature he can find
_ and there's not a lot _ on the Futurliner. He's discovered that
the adjustable driver's seat in his Futurliner is identical to a
radar man's seat he spotted in a World War II submarine on display
in Portsmouth _ perhaps a sign of the crossover of military and
industrial aims in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, heading into the restoration, is entering a time warp
woven with irony: recreating a past that once tried to foretell the
future. Bringing back a vehicle whose demise _ their rebirth lasted
only from 1953-56 when they were sold off and fell into disrepair
in junkyards _ was precipitated by one of the very modern wonders
the fleet had touted: television.
</P>
<P>
   For when you could display the wonders of the future on
television, who needed the Futurliner any longer?

SEXIEST MAN ALIVE WITH ABSURDITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you haven't noticed his face gazing at you from every
newsstand, Richard Gere is People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's the setup. What's the punch line?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a punch line, except of course for the whole Sexiest
Man Alive issue, which is a joke, and a very successful one for
People.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, along with thousands of other suckers, I grab the
Sexiest Man Alive number and devour it. Why? I'm a fool for trash.
But it's more than that. After a great deal of thought, reflection,
soul-searching, getting in touch with my inner what-have-you, I
suspect that I am mesmerized by this issue of People not because
the subject is so close to my heart, although it is, but because
the concept is so irresistibly ridiculous. I mean, Richard Gere?
The Sexiest Man Alive?
</P>
<P>
   Gere has many fine qualities, but from where I sit, usually on
the left, near the back of the theater, he's about as sexy as an
old rubber boot. Let me delete ``old'' from the phrase, because his
somewhat advanced age of 50 has nothing to do with how sexy he
seems on-screen. He was just as uncompelling at 30.
</P>
<P>
   People lards on plenty of quotes from Gere's female costars
attesting to his charms, his ``hypnotic'' effect on women. He may
be a thrill to know, to work with, but somehow the excitement
doesn't come across on-screen. I'm thinking of ``Runaway Bride.''
Gere and Julia Roberts had less sexual chemistry than Regis and
Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   I don't expect everybody to be as obsessed by this stuff as I
am, so you may, or you may not, recall that in 1993 Gere, with
Cindy Crawford, was half of People's Sexiest Couple Alive. Crawford
subsequently left him and took up with Rande Gerber. Now, on his
own, Gere is the Sexiest Man Alive. But what about Crawford? People
has never named another Sexiest Woman Alive. They wouldn't dare.
All hell would break loose. So is she still it? And where does
Gerber fit into all this? How sexy is he? I'm just asking. These
are the things I turn over in my mind at 3 a.m., when I can't
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   I also worry about what happens to the Sexiest Man Alive when he
has to surrender the title. Is it a letdown? Does Harrison Ford,
last year's winner, get up in the morning, look in the mirror, and
say to himself, ``Woe is me, I am no longer the Sexiest Man
Alive.'' Or is it a relief? After all, it must be a terrible
burden.
</P>
<P>
   And how does People go about selecting its Sexiest Man Alive
cover boy? I imagine an arcane process involving astrological
charts, ``Q'' ratings, SAT scores, Beyer speed figures, credit
reports, cholesterol levels, perhaps even sperm counts. I can
almost see People's editors sitting in conference, debating the Big
Issues, asking one another: What do we mean by ``sexiest''? What do
we mean by ``alive''? And finally, after lengthy deliberation,
comes the answer: Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gere? In fact, the choice may come down to which
celebrity is willing to be anointed, because these days, in
celebrity journalism, the star, through his or her representatives,
calls the shots. Magazine covers are often a matter of which
celebrity has the most effective, or the most cooperative, public
relations person.
</P>
<P>
   Since People launched this issue in 1985 their sexiest men have
all been actors, with one notable exception, John F. Kennedy Jr. He
was in show business too, in a sense, although he didn't need an
agent to get him bigger and better parts. Over the years, a number
of those singled out for the honor have been actors who have needed
a little image enhancement. Mark Harmon. Harry Hamlin. Patrick
Swayze. Tom Cruise. Nick Nolte. Richard Gere. The Sexiest Men
Alive? Only in People.

TRAGEDY SPURRED TOBACCO WHISTLEBLOWER 
</HEADLINE>

 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the deadliest fire in 18 years. Out of its ashes
emerged an impassioned whistleblower, ready to begin the epic
battle against Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The four-alarm blaze raged through a Roslindale apartment on May
27, 1990, killing five members of an Irish immigrant family and one
of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Myles O'Neill, a handyman who had come from Ireland four years
earlier, his wife Maureen, their three young children, and the
boyfriend of Maureen's younger sister, Deirdre Kearney, perished in
the savage fire _ a fire that was started, Boston fire officials
concluded, by a burning cigarette accidentally dropped between
cushions in an overstuffed chair.
</P>
<P>
   Only Kearney, who also lived in the first-floor apartment,
survived the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   From this traumatic fire, she and other grieving relatives
launched an attack on the nation's tobacco industry in a lawsuit
charging Philip Morris Cos. with responsibility for the deaths,
because it failed to use available technology to produce a safer
cigarette. To support their claims, they enlisted the help of
Jeffrey Wigand, former top researcher for tobacco giant Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., whose ordeal with the tobacco industry is
the subject of a new film, ``The Insider,'' which is airing in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Wigand is being acclaimed as a hero, his fame is
casting new attention on the fire that propelled him into the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's anger at the outcome of the Roslindale case, which was
dismissed without coming to trial, helped spur him to go public
about attempts by industry executives to hide what they knew about
the addictive effects of nicotine and carcinogens used to sweeten
pipe tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's disclosures, nationally aired in a long-delayed segment
of ``60 Minutes,'' helped undermine the industry's position in a
1997 mega-lawsuit involving 40 attorneys general, which resulted in
a historic $249 billion payment by the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-known is the case of the Roslindale fire, in which
Wigand was blocked from giving evidence by federal judge Robert E.
Keeton. The judge ruled that Wigand was an unfit witness because a
confidentiality agreement he had signed with Brown &AMP; Williamson
prohibited him from speaking publicly about tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cut to the core of my values,'' Wigand, 56, said
Wednesday. ``I had scientific knowledge that would have been useful
in the case and I knew that some of the evidence had been tampered
with. That someone would prevent the truth from coming out really
bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that his confidentiality agreement should
not have been applicable because he was giving evidence about work
done by Philip Morris, not Brown &AMP; Williamson, and because he did
not intend to reveal any trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand also said he believed that the Roslindale fire could have
been prevented if the tobacco industry had produced fire-safe
cigarettes, which, he said, it knew how to do before 1990.
Fire-safe cigarettes are less likely to cause fires because they
are thinner, less dense and less porous than other cigarettes, and
hence produce less heat when lit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A favorable outcome could have forced the tobacco industry to
produce a fire-safe cigarette,'' said Gregory Connolly, director of
the Tobacco Control Program in the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health. ``There's no question that suppressing Jeff's
testimony had a deadly effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, 193 Massachusetts residents have died from fires
ignited by cigarettes, Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stephen Fine, a New Hampshire lawyer who
represented the families of the Roslindale fire victims, Myles
O'Neill was last seen drinking heavily and smoking in a living room
chair after midnight on May 27, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that he dozed off and, unbeknownst to him, dropped
a cigarette into the crevices of the overstuffed chair,'' Fine
said. At 1:30 or 2 a.m., O'Neill went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, the chair went up in flames and fire
engulfed the apartment, killing Myles O'Neill, 23; Maureen, 22;
their children, Charlene, 3, Stacy, 2, and Lea Ann, 10 months; and
Patrick McGovern, 21, Kearney's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   As shock waves from the deadly fire rippled through Boston,
Congress was considering legislation to develop methods for testing
fire-safe cigarettes, which were technically and economically
feasible according to a 1987 federal report.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill smoked Marlboros, so the O'Neill and Kearney families
decided to put the pressue on the tobacco industry by blaming the
blaze on Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery phase of the proceedings stretched on for
several years, remembered Andrew McGuire, now executive director of
the Trauma Foundation at San Francisco General Hospital, who began
the campaign for fire-safe cigarettes in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand had attended meetings on the progress of the safe
cigarettes and had talked with McGuire many times by phone. He had
been fired from Brown &AMP; Williamson in 1993, and in the spring of
1994, McGuire convinced him to accept phone calls from Lowell
Bergman, a producer at ``60 Minutes,'' and also from Fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable, unthinkable that a tobacco executive
would testify against the industry,'' Fine recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But when he met Wigand at his Kentucky home, Fine found him to
be ``a sincere, compassionate human being'' willing to do what he
could to help, despite the risks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wigand said, he was using his expertise to shed light
on tobacco industry practices. He had interpreted ``Project Hamlet:
To Burn or Not To Burn,'' a Philip Morris report about fire-safe
cigarettes, for CBS, and worked with the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown &AMP; Williamson did not know about his dealings with CBS
or the FDA. ``Those were all secret interactions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Fine announced that Wigand would be an expert witness in
the Roslindale case, it was the first time the noted biochemical
researcher's willingness to share his expertise publicly was
revealed and that the meaning of his confidentiality agreement was
tested in court.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson unleashed a torrent of complaints, Fine
remembered, with which the judge eventually agreed, and Wigand says
he became the target of threats, intimidation, and harassment that
still continue.
</P>
<P>
   After being fired from Brown &AMP; Williamson, Wigand taught high
school in Kentucky until, he says, harassment forced him to leave
the job and the state. He now lives in Charleston, S.C., where he
heads a nonprofit organization called ``Smoke-free Kids,'' aimed at
discouraging youths from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' captures his odyssey ``with an extremely high
degree of fidelity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he decided to speak out against tobacco, his character has
been maligned, his children threatened, his marriage has fallen
apart, and his professional life has been turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if one child becomes unfettered from addiction from
tobacco because of what's happened to me, it's worth it,'' he said.
``I'd do it again in a heartbeat.''

HELP YOUR KIDS BE TOBACCO FREE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Smoking starts in childhood: 89 percent of the adults who smoke
on a daily basis started before they turned 18. Each day more than
3,000 children and teens in the United States try cigarettes for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can't sit on the sidelines and hope for the best. If we
want tobacco-free children, we better start early and come out
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   We need to powerfully reinforce an understanding of the
addictive nature and harmfulness of tobacco because we are
challenged by an industry that has spent billions of dollars on
advertising and promotional programs to influence our children to
have positive attitudes about this drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Great American Smokeout on November 18 is an ideal time for
parents to initiate family communication about tobacco and to
increase the resistance of children and teens to this dangerous
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to help parents discuss both the dangers of
tobacco and the concept of addiction to children in an
age-appropriate manner. 5- to 8-year olds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even 5- to 8-year-olds can begin to understand a little bit
about the idea of addiction. You can ask your children: ''Did you
ever have the feeling that you couldn't stop yourself from doing
something?'' Bring up eating favorite foods as an example. ''You
know, maybe you had one scoop of ice cream and felt like you just
HAD to have another scoop, and if you took it, sometimes you felt
like you still needed another one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, addiction to cigarettes is a little like that. People
feel as though they can't stop smoking. They always need another
cigarette. The trouble is, this doesn't just cause a little upset
tummy, the way too much ice cream might. Cigarettes are very
unhealthy and can cause all kinds of illnesses, including ones that
kill people.''
 &UR; 9- and 10-year-olds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With a 9- or 10-year-old you can talk in more detail about
addiction. I like to tell kids that addiction actually means being
a slave. When you are addicted to a drug, you are controlled by the
drug. You need more and more of it.
</P>
<P>
   I let children know that tobacco is one of the toughest
addictions to break. Because it is legally available to adults and
socially accepted, many young people are very surprised to hear
this. They may have heard of cocaine, heroin or speed, and believed
that these were tougher addictions. Tobacco is in the same league
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your children if they have ever seen people ''climb the
walls'' because they needed a cigarette. You could talk about
public places, such as movie theaters where smokers charge to the
door to get their fix at the end of the show. Explain that these
people were uncomfortable because they couldn't smoke for just the
length of the movie _ less than two hours.
 &UR; 11 and 12-year-olds
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11 or 12, children are able to understand and
discuss the concepts of tolerance and withdrawal that underlie
addiction. For a drug to be physically addictive, it must create
both tolerance in a user and a withdrawal syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance means that a person needs more and more of a drug to
get the same effect. As people begin to use more tobacco, they may
worry about how much they smoke and feel as though they want to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Once addicted, however, it's not easy to pull out. When addicted
individuals stop using a habit-forming drug, such as tobacco, they
will experience a wide range of uncomfortable symptoms during the
withdrawal process.
</P>
<P>
   Children may have seen documentaries or fictional movies that
demonstrate this. They may have seen or heard about ''the shakes''
that occur when alcoholics quit drinking. You can explain that
withdrawal symptoms from tobacco are severe. They vary from person
to person, but typical ones include coughing, sweating, muscle
aches and cramps, nausea, headache, hypersensitivity to physical
stimuli, sleep disturbance and weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to illustrate tolerance is by referring to a thriller
or adventure movie that children have seen several times.
</P>
<P>
   For example: ''Do you remember the thrill you got the first time
you saw (whatever happens to be the current hit)? When you went
back the second time, did you get the same thrill? How about the
third time? Sometimes drugs are like thriller movies. People want
more of that same feeling, so they keep going back for more. But
they're never satisfied the way they were the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''With drugs, this reaction is called tolerance. A smoker needs
more and more tobacco to feel good when smoking. That's why they
may start by only occasionally smoking a single cigarette or two,
but eventually find themselves smoking a pack or more every day.''
 &UR; The teen years &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By the teen years, all of our tobacco prevention education
should be interactive. That is, it should involve a respectful
dialogue between parents and children. We need to share ideas,
express our thoughts and feelings, and listen to those of our
adolescent children.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange-of-information model is a disciplined way for
parents and teenagers to be rational, even though they are
discussing issues that are emotionally charged.
</P>
<P>
   The model has five parts:
</P>
<P>
   1. Children and parents agree to have a discussion about
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   2. Parents present their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   3. Children present their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   4. They discuss each other's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   5. Parents and children reach an understanding and make
agreements with one another.
</P>
<P>
   When children become adolescents, we can no longer get away with
simply laying down the law. We must involve them in a discussion.
If we discount their thinking, we will find ourselves in power
struggles. The dialogue will come to a grinding halt. When this
happens, we will no longer know what our children are thinking or
doing. We cannot help advance their thinking or influence their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another way that parents end the dialogue and lose their
influence is by listening as long as they like what they hear, but
then hitting the roof when they hear something they don't like.
Adolescents respond to this aggressiveness by hiding the truth.
They begin to say only what they believe their parents want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   The key to effectively influencing the behavior of adolescent
children is to use an educational approach: to create and maintain
dialogue. Adolescents benefit from the adult perspective. Parents
benefit by better understanding their children. Good discussions
increase mutual understanding and can lead to agreements when none
seemed possible. When agreements are made after a thorough
discussion, children feel a sense of ownership in the outcome and
are likely to abide by the terms they helped establish.
 &UR; Parents who are smokers &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Parents who smoke worry that it would be hypocritical to insist
that their children refrain from smoking. Although their children
may accuse them of hypocrisy and embarrass them, their own
discomfort is a secondary issue. It is a primary parenting
responsibility to call for a clear message that tobacco products
are unhealthy and children should not use them.
</P>
<P>
   If you are addicted to nicotine and regret that you smoke, you
can say this to your children. Let them understand what has
happened to you, how it happened and that you hope to spare them
from the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the best thing for all involved is for you to
overcome your own addiction. Sometimes people cannot make difficult
changes for themselves, but can for others. You could channel an
urge to care for your children into something that would be
positive for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Often people try to stop and fail several times before they
finally succeed. But many do succeed. The Great American Smokeout
is a good time to start.

TOXIC E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Microsoft Corp. has had a pretty rough week, and I was
planning to ease up on them. And then along came Bubbleboy.
</P>
<P>
   By now you've heard of this computer virus. If you use
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5 browser and the company's Outlook
or Outlook Express e-mail programs, Bubbleboy will send a copy of
itself to everybody in your address book. Other than that it's
pretty much harmless. The scary part is the way it works. You get
Bubbleboy by reading an e-mail message. Just display the message on
your screen, and your computer can be infected.
</P>
<P>
   It's not supposed to work this way. And it didn't, until
Microsoft got a little creative, and a little careless.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the drill. Computer programs like viruses are clumps
of binary ``machine language'' which must be run in order to do
anything. Standard e-mail messages are sent as plain text, and so
cannot contain a virus or any other executable programs. So
standard e-mail is safe. E-mail attachments can be dangerous
because they can contain computer programs, including viruses. So
never open an attachment that comes from a stranger _ or at least
run it through a virus scanner first.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I've been writing for years. And it's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Standard e-mail is safe, but many of us don't just use standard
e-mail. For years there have been e-mail programs that allow you to
send and receive messages in HTML, the simple language used to
create Web pages. These mail programs work by having little Web
browsers in them, or by using features from the browser already
installed on your computer. Open the e-mail, and the message window
becomes, in effect, a minibrowser, running the HTML code that's
part of the message.
</P>
<P>
   Browsers don't just run HTML code. They'll also let you run
software written in ``scripting languages'' like Microsoft's Visual
Basic for Applications and Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Javascript. Unlike other computer languages, scripting languages
don't have to be converted into machine language _ they'll run
as-is.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what this means. An e-mail written in HTML can have a
program lurking inside. Open the message and your browser can start
running that program. Actually, this happens all the time. Many of
the fancy features on your favorite Web sites are little Javascript
programs included on the Web page. Your computer downloads the
Javascript, and your browser runs it.
</P>
<P>
   This makes HTML e-mail riskier than traditional plain-text mail,
but nothing to panic about. The computer is supposed to set limits
on what a Javascript or VBA program can do. But it turns out that
IE 5 has a bug that lets malicious VBA scripts run wild.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, retired founder of Phar Lap Software Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., told me that the bug has been common knowledge
for months. It was published on Bugtraq, an Internet mailing list
where security experts swap tales of software gone wrong
(www.securityfocus.com). Microsoft promptly issued a repair patch
that plugs it up. But how many people actually download patches?
``They have a patch,'' said Smith. ``Great. Now all we have to do
is get 50 million people to install it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith directed me to the web site of a Bulgarian programmer
who's posted a demonstration of the bug. This version installs a
creepy but harmless bit of code on unprotected machines. Sure
enough, it worked on my computer. That sent me scurrying to
download the patch. Microsoft has made IE 5 browser upgrades dead
easy. Connect to the Internet, click the Tools menu at the top of
the browser and then click Windows Update. You're taken to a Web
site that offers a selection of available upgrades, with the
life-or-death ones at the top. Download and reboot. You can also
download Bubbleboy shields from the leading antivirus software
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith thinks that the creator of Bubbleboy read about the bug
somewhere on the Net and whipped up his virus as an experiment.
Then the parent of Bubbleboy turned in this delinquent child to an
antivirus company, before it did any real damage.
</P>
<P>
   We come away from the Bubbleboy affair with our software intact,
but with a good deal less confidence in the safety of e-mail. In
the old days the stuff was drab but harmless. But add HTML, and
e-mail becomes colorful, memorable _ and occasionally toxic.

<P>
   In recent months, the phrase ``dot-com'' has become synonymous
with the very idea of doing business on the Internet. Screaming
headlines tell us that ``dot-com'' _ or if you are very clever,
``.com'' _ is the future of the e-business and the I-economy. To be
dot-com is to be young, hip, involved with high-tech, and making a
killing on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com is a frenzy being fed by a lot of really strange
advertisements and marketing moves. Last year Sun Microsystems
began advertising itself as ``the dot in dot-com.'' Now Sun is
bringing out a new version of its Solaris Operating System, calling
it ``the .com OS.'' According to the company, the new Solaris ``is
designed for the .com age.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week the computer industry will flock to Las Vegas again
for the Comdex trade show. An advertising campaign currently
running in the computer trade press jokes that perhaps the show
should be renamed ``.COMdex,'' since there is so much emphasis on
the new Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company originally charged with managing the
``com'' domain, Network Solutions Inc., is trying to make the most
of its electronic franchise. Calling itself ``the dot com people,''
the company's new Web site practically begs visitors to register
their own dot-com Web address _ for a price of $70 for the first
two years.
</P>
<P>
   All of this dot-com stuff got its start in the early 1980s. Only
a few hundred computers (we called them ``hosts'') were on the
Internet then. Most had names with dashes in them, such as
``MIT-Multics'' and ``MIT-Eddie.'' The address of each computer on
the network was stored in a file called ``HOSTS.TXT.'' Whenever a
new computer was added to the network, the listing would be added
manually to the file. Naturally, as the network grew, it became
harder to keep this file up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that this centralized repository was doomed, the
network engineers proposed replacing the HOSTS file with a kind of
distributed database. They called this database the domain name
system, since it arranged all the computers on the Net into
categories called domains. Whether these were typed in capital or
lower-case letters didn't matter. The computer MIT-Eddie became the
computer ``eddie'' inside the ``mit'' domain. The ``mit'' domain,
in turn, was put in the ``edu'' domain, with ``edu'' standing for
``educational.'' So Eddie's new, full name became
``eddie.mit.edu.''
</P>
<P>
   The domain name system _ which predates the World Wide Web by
nearly a decade _ works like a big telephone book. When you type
www.boston.com, for example, your computer uses this system to
translate the name into an Internet address made up of four numbers
separated by periods _ in this case, 199.95.74.90. (Eddie's
Internet address happens to be 18.62.0.6.) It's these addresses,
and not the names, that the Internet's underlying systems use to
send messages.
</P>
<P>
   This multilevel system for naming computers on the Internet made
sense in the 1980s, and it makes sense today.
</P>
<P>
   So much for history. The problem with all of this is that the
dot-com explosion has turned the domain name system on its head.
Domain names no longer point to just computers on the Internet;
these days, most domain names point to Web pages. More and more
companies have multiple dot-com names _ one for each product,
perhaps, with a few extra thrown in for frequent misspellings of
product names.
</P>
<P>
   But dot-com is about more than simply doing business on the
Internet. It's really about globalism without global thinking. The
whole idea of dot-com was fundamentally flawed, because there is
one, and only one, ``dot-com'' domain for the entire planet. Back
in the 1980s, this didn't seem like much of a problem for the
Internet's fathers. But it caused a heap of problems in the 1990s,
when multiple companies started fighting over the same dot-com
addresses. And it's left us with a lot of strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ``tower.com'' domain. You would think it might
belong to Tower Records, but it actually belongs to Tower Concepts
of Oneida, N.Y., which obtained the domain in December 1992. Tower
Records didn't wake up to the Internet until May 1995, when it
obtained the domain towerrecords.com. More recently, Tower Records
has gone on a domain-buying spree, picking up towerkids.com,
towersale.com, towereurope.com, towerfranchises.com, and
djcrisis.com. (Most of those dot-com addresses don't actually work.
At $70 apiece, I can't imagine that Tower's managers care very
much.)
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of dot-com action in recent months. Although
Network Solutions once had a monopoly on the .com, .net and .org
domains, you can now sign up with four other companies _ the
Internet Council of Registrars, Melbourne IT, France Telecom, and
Register.com. Theoretically, this should create competition,
ultimately producing lower prices and better service. For example,
if you go through Net Wizards, which is a member of the Council of
Registrars, you can register a domain for bargain-basement $60.
</P>
<P>
   Next year we're likely to see a whole bunch of new top-level
domains, including ``.arts'' for culture and entertainment,
``.firm'' for professional firms, ``.info'' for information
services, ``.nom'' and ``.per'' for personal home pages, ``.rec''
for recreation, and ``.shop'' for online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that more domain names will reduce contention in
the ``.com'' domain. But I'm not sure that these new domains will
work the way that the Internet architects have planned. Certainly
Xerox and Sony won't sit by idly while some upstart grabs names
such as Xerox.firm or Sony.shop. Meanwhile, I can't believe new
companies will be happy being a dot-firm or a dot-shop, when they
could be a dot-com.

HELP YOUR KIDS BE TOBACCO FREE
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT SCHWEBEL, Ph.D. 
 c.1999 Robert Schwebel 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smoking starts in childhood: 89 percent of the adults who smoke
on a daily basis started before they turned 18. Each day more than
3,000 children and teens in the United States try cigarettes for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can't sit on the sidelines and hope for the best. If we
want tobacco-free children, we better start early and come out
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   We need to powerfully reinforce an understanding of the
addictive nature and harmfulness of tobacco because we are
challenged by an industry that has spent billions of dollars on
advertising and promotional programs to influence our children to
have positive attitudes about this drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Great American Smokeout on November 18 is an ideal time for
parents to initiate family communication about tobacco and to
increase the resistance of children and teens to this dangerous
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to help parents discuss both the dangers of
tobacco and the concept of addiction to children in an
age-appropriate manner. 5- to 8-year olds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even 5- to 8-year-olds can begin to understand a little bit
about the idea of addiction. You can ask your children: ''Did you
ever have the feeling that you couldn't stop yourself from doing
something?'' Bring up eating favorite foods as an example. ''You
know, maybe you had one scoop of ice cream and felt like you just
HAD to have another scoop, and if you took it, sometimes you felt
like you still needed another one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, addiction to cigarettes is a little like that. People
feel as though they can't stop smoking. They always need another
cigarette. The trouble is, this doesn't just cause a little upset
tummy, the way too much ice cream might. Cigarettes are very
unhealthy and can cause all kinds of illnesses, including ones that
kill people.''
 &UR; 9- and 10-year-olds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With a 9- or 10-year-old you can talk in more detail about
addiction. I like to tell kids that addiction actually means being
a slave. When you are addicted to a drug, you are controlled by the
drug. You need more and more of it.
</P>
<P>
   I let children know that tobacco is one of the toughest
addictions to break. Because it is legally available to adults and
socially accepted, many young people are very surprised to hear
this. They may have heard of cocaine, heroin or speed, and believed
that these were tougher addictions. Tobacco is in the same league
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your children if they have ever seen people ''climb the
walls'' because they needed a cigarette. You could talk about
public places, such as movie theaters where smokers charge to the
door to get their fix at the end of the show. Explain that these
people were uncomfortable because they couldn't smoke for just the
length of the movie _ less than two hours.
 &UR; 11 and 12-year-olds
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11 or 12, children are able to understand and
discuss the concepts of tolerance and withdrawal that underlie
addiction. For a drug to be physically addictive, it must create
both tolerance in a user and a withdrawal syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance means that a person needs more and more of a drug to
get the same effect. As people begin to use more tobacco, they may
worry about how much they smoke and feel as though they want to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Once addicted, however, it's not easy to pull out. When addicted
individuals stop using a habit-forming drug, such as tobacco, they
will experience a wide range of uncomfortable symptoms during the
withdrawal process.
</P>
<P>
   Children may have seen documentaries or fictional movies that
demonstrate this. They may have seen or heard about ''the shakes''
that occur when alcoholics quit drinking. You can explain that
withdrawal symptoms from tobacco are severe. They vary from person
to person, but typical ones include coughing, sweating, muscle
aches and cramps, nausea, headache, hypersensitivity to physical
stimuli, sleep disturbance and weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to illustrate tolerance is by referring to a thriller
or adventure movie that children have seen several times.
</P>
<P>
   For example: ''Do you remember the thrill you got the first time
you saw (whatever happens to be the current hit)? When you went
back the second time, did you get the same thrill? How about the
third time? Sometimes drugs are like thriller movies. People want
more of that same feeling, so they keep going back for more. But
they're never satisfied the way they were the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''With drugs, this reaction is called tolerance. A smoker needs
more and more tobacco to feel good when smoking. That's why they
may start by only occasionally smoking a single cigarette or two,
but eventually find themselves smoking a pack or more every day.''
 &UR; The teen years &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By the teen years, all of our tobacco prevention education
should be interactive. That is, it should involve a respectful
dialogue between parents and children. We need to share ideas,
express our thoughts and feelings, and listen to those of our
adolescent children.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange-of-information model is a disciplined way for
parents and teenagers to be rational, even though they are
discussing issues that are emotionally charged.
</P>
<P>
   The model has five parts:
</P>
<P>
   1. Children and parents agree to have a discussion about
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   2. Parents present their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   3. Children present their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   4. They discuss each other's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   5. Parents and children reach an understanding and make
agreements with one another.
</P>
<P>
   When children become adolescents, we can no longer get away with
simply laying down the law. We must involve them in a discussion.
If we discount their thinking, we will find ourselves in power
struggles. The dialogue will come to a grinding halt. When this
happens, we will no longer know what our children are thinking or
doing. We cannot help advance their thinking or influence their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another way that parents end the dialogue and lose their
influence is by listening as long as they like what they hear, but
then hitting the roof when they hear something they don't like.
Adolescents respond to this aggressiveness by hiding the truth.
They begin to say only what they believe their parents want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   The key to effectively influencing the behavior of adolescent
children is to use an educational approach: to create and maintain
dialogue. Adolescents benefit from the adult perspective. Parents
benefit by better understanding their children. Good discussions
increase mutual understanding and can lead to agreements when none
seemed possible. When agreements are made after a thorough
discussion, children feel a sense of ownership in the outcome and
are likely to abide by the terms they helped establish.
 &UR; Parents who are smokers &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Parents who smoke worry that it would be hypocritical to insist
that their children refrain from smoking. Although their children
may accuse them of hypocrisy and embarrass them, their own
discomfort is a secondary issue. It is a primary parenting
responsibility to call for a clear message that tobacco products
are unhealthy and children should not use them.
</P>
<P>
   If you are addicted to nicotine and regret that you smoke, you
can say this to your children. Let them understand what has
happened to you, how it happened and that you hope to spare them
from the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the best thing for all involved is for you to
overcome your own addiction. Sometimes people cannot make difficult
changes for themselves, but can for others. You could channel an
urge to care for your children into something that would be
positive for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Often people try to stop and fail several times before they
finally succeed. But many do succeed. The Great American Smokeout
is a good time to start.

THIS GEO-THERMAL HOUSE HAS INDIANA ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started when Barbara Turner visited her mother in Fort
Wayne, Ind., far removed from the house in Princeton, Mass. where
Barbara and her husband, William, lived.
</P>
<P>
   The Turners were thinking about building a new house on their 28
acres in Petersham, but had not gotten beyond the thinking stages.
</P>
<P>
   During her visit, Barbara and her mother went to a Parade of
Homes show. Curiously, a lot of the featured homes had geothermal
heating systems, which are essentially heat pumps supplied by water
circulated in very deep wells. These are a great improvement over
heat pumps that get their heat from the air, because the water they
take the heat from stays at 55 degrees all year long.
</P>
<P>
   The geo part of the name refers to the earth, where water
circulates deeply, staying at that 55-degree temperature. The
thermal part is the heat that is extracted from the water by the
heat pump.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara picked up the usual brochures as planning for the house
continued.
</P>
<P>
   William said, ``When we started to build I forgot about
geothermal, but then I found a well digger who digs regular water
wells as well as geothermal wells.'' He had originally thought of
propane gas, but found it was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The well digger put the Turners in touch with Energy Star Homes
of Westborough, a company with various utilities as sponsors, which
specify what goes into an Energy Star Home. The phone number is
800-628-8413.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Star Homes gave the Turners a list of builders and
geothermal companies. The Turners chose Albert Construction of
Lunenburg as the builder and Mark Meacham Inc. of Charlton to do
the geothermal work.
</P>
<P>
   What makes an Energy Star Home unique, and energy efficient, not
even counting the geothermal heating system?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing out of the ordinary, just heavy insulation and caulking
and weatherstripping until the house is so tight that any heat
generated inside will take a long, long time to escape. Windows are
Peachtree, double-glazed with low E glass, providing maximum
protection at a reasonable cost. Doors are also Peachtree (brand)
fiberglass (material), providing a stable, stainable surface.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is standard, with 6-inch walls with an R factor of
20, and enough attic floor insulation to provide an R factor of 35
to 41. An R factor is the resistance of a material against loss of
heat between a heated area and a cold area. The higher the number,
the higher the resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas are highly insulated, too, including the studded
basement walls, and rigid insulation under the concrete basement
slab. The house has 2,300 square feet of living space, not counting
the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the insulation is cellulose, but in the walls it is
unusual in that it is blown wet into spaces between studs, then a
vapor barrier is stapled to the studs and the final finish applied.
The wet insulation assures filling cavities completely with no air
pockets or other defects.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily insulated, tight house is very easily heated with
any system, but the geothermal heating system is the heart of the
house, and one that promises a 35 percent savings in heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The system itself cost $30,000, including the digging of the
wells, but the Turners received an $11,000 rebate, pretty good as
rebates go. So for $20,000 or so they got a state-of-the-art system
that takes its heat from the earth, an unending, totally renewable
source.
</P>
<P>
   First, two wells were dug 300 feet deep, then a closed-loop pipe
system was installed, 1,200 feet of polyethylene pipe going down
one well and up, and down and up the second well, eventually
leading to the heat pump.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipes in place, a claylike material is sunk into the
wells, surrounding the pipes firmly. This material is a good
transferer of heat, picking up heat from the earth and transferring
it to the water in the pipes, which is really an antifreeze
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The heat pump takes over, taking the heat from the water and
pumping heated air into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Water in the water heater is warmed by the heat pump;
electricity takes it to the proper temperature. The system has a
super-sensitive air filter and an automatic humidifier that William
says needs no maintenance, another plus for the house.
</P>
<P>
   Because the house is so tight, it needed an air-to-air heat
exchanger, one that exhausts house air and brings in fresh air,
transferring the heat of the exhaust air to the incoming air, with
little heat loss.
</P>
<P>
   With all this state-of-the-art equipment, what about the house
itself? Does it look like a space ship?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. It is traditional in style, with nice touches such
as 10-foot-high ceilings in the living room and dining room, and
fluted window and door casings highlighted by corner blocks. Shower
enclosures are acrylic for no maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has Corian counters and cherry cabinets, and the
family room has a fine-looking fireplace with marble facing and
granite hearth and mantel. The rear deck frame is pressure-treated,
the deck boards are Trex, a composite material that rarely needs
staining or other treatment. The mahogany railing is stained.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about that heat pump. The air coming out of the vents
felt cool. That's because it is not as warm as air from a standard
hot-air system, but it still warms the house, William said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the heating system has not been tested because of its
installation late last spring and the fact that it has really not
been very cold so far this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let you know next spring,'' said Barbara.

WHEN TIME PERFECTLY FITS THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you travel, do you ask this same question?
</P>
<P>
   What would it would be like to live here?
</P>
<P>
   I play with the idea of living everywhere I travel, but England
is particularly tempting because I already speak the language.
These last 10 days, crossing sheep pastures in Exmoor on foot, or
hiking across the moors in Dartmoor for six hours at a time, my
husband and I fell under a spell that was hard to break. The air in
Devon was unbelievably sweet, the vistas like paintings, all green
and geometrical and manicured. The couple who ran the
bed-and-breakfast where we stayed were so attuned to our unspoken
needs that they not only selected perfect places to explore, they
even lent us their dog as a walking companion.
</P>
<P>
   One rainy day, we climbed steep cliffs by the sea, made our way
through miles of high country covered with gorse and heather, and
followed a stream down through the woods to a small roadless
village that seemed not to have been altered in centuries. Cozy and
dry in our waterproof pants and jackets, we hadn't been bothered by
the precipitation at all. To our surprise, the rain felt warm and
sensual, enveloping us in a private Eden by clearing our path of
all but the hardiest hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Entering a tea room built in the 1600s, we sat in front of a
blazing fire. I had the ploughman's lunch, brown bread and cheddar
served with homemade chutney, while Jack had a cream tea, which
included scones, strawberry jam, and a big pot of clotted cream.
The dog, warmly welcomed by the management, slept under the table.
As we savored the food and the atmosphere, we wondered: What were
we doing in the States when we could retire to some similar spot in
England?
</P>
<P>
   We could purchase a cottage with a thatched roof and a walk-in
fireplace hundreds of years old. We could be friends with the
couple we'd met in Chagford, who'd seemed so very compatible and
open-hearted as we'd chatted over dinner in a local pub. We could
keep a few sheep and a pony and spend most of our days outdoors,
maybe open a bed-and-breakfast ourselves. It all seemed so
preferable to modern existence in America, so soothing, so
elemental. Isn't this what we wanted from life: rain steaming off
damp hair, legs aching from use, taste buds delightfully alert,
each other's company without a thousand distractions?
</P>
<P>
   This isn't England, I had to remind myself.
</P>
<P>
   This is being on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   I've pictured myself in light-filled, tile-floored houses in
Mexico, buying fruits and vegetables at an outdoor market for
lunch, swimming every afternoon in an invitingly warm ocean. I've
seen myself in Tuscan farmhouses, mastering Italian, reading under
the grape arbor in the sun, making pasta from scratch. My imaginary
English cottage partakes of the same perfection: time stretches
languorously in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   This is my definition of a wonderful vacation: whenever time
perfectly fits the soul. Whatever you do expands to fill the hours
exactly to the brim. At the end of each day, there are no regrets
about having rushed through experience without savoring it. In this
magical holiday kingdom, time is never empty or lonely or
insufficient. It is never purposeless or depressing or suffocating.
It flows like a river, carrying you along, and in its comforting
rhythms, curiosity, sensuality, and delight reawaken.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief moment, high on the moors, Jack and I thought
ourselves lost. We could see no houses and no path except the one
before us, heading to a town 15 miles away. As we tried to get our
bearings in the rain, I had this strange emotion halfway between
crying and laughing, which I tried to identify. I know, I murmured,
just before we caught sight of a slip of a track veering to the
right. What I'm feeling now is alive.
</P>
<P>
   Real life, I'm convinced, catches up with us, even if we flee.
Wherever we go, we bring ourselves along, with all our habitual
compulsions and uncertainties. I know I'm perfectly capable of
turning Mexico or Italy or England into hell on earth. Am I equally
capable of turning my life here into something that contains the
balm of vacation?
</P>
<P>
   I took a long walk this morning. I am sorting through the mail
at my own pace. In the last three days I have systematically put my
house in order. I am learning how to make time.
</P>
<P>
   When there is nowhere to run, there is nothing to do but master
the art of blooming where you're planted.

   A. Dip fine steel wool in paint thinner and rub the tile, not
too lightly but not too heavily. This will remove the spot but also
the tinted sealer, so you will have to reseal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a door in the foundation of my house, at the bottom of
my bulkhead stairs. I would like to put in a screen door in that
opening, which already has a door. It cannot open out because there
is not enough room at the bottom of the bulkhead stairs. Can I make
double doors that would open out?
</P>
<P>
   MAUREEN O'DOWD, Norwell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but you may have to make your own; I don't know of any
stock double screens that would fill a standard width door. But you
could make your own with sturdy wood frames and well-stretched
screening.
</P>
<P>
   Also there are rolling screens that you could buy. One is Mirage
Rolling Screen Door that rolls up sideways, sold by KSG Products of
Williamstown, N.J. Call 800-955-3667.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am building a house. What are the pros and cons about a
wood frame versus a steel frame; that is, one using steel studs?
What should the ``on center'' spacing be; that is, how far apart
should the studs be? I want the house to stand up to Boston winds.
How thick should the wall be? Is extra insulation worth it in walls
that have a lot of windows?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK CHASIN, Savin Hill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Steel studs are OK to use, even for outside walls (originally
they were designed for interior walls only). The only thing you
have to do with steel studded exterior walls is to put rigid foam
insulation on the inside of such walls, because the steel studs are
notorious losers of heat; that is, without the insulation the warm
air indoors will radiate right outdoors through those metal studs.
This will happen even if regular insulation is between the studs.
As for spacing, 16 inches or 24 inches is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Six inches is OK for wall thickness, although some people feel
that there should be more insulation in the walls than the 6 inches
of fiberglass that would fit in that space. As for a wall full of
windows, you might as well have the non-window parts of the walls
highly insulated because even the best of windows are heavy losers
of heat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I find wood bifold doors 90 inches high and 36
inches wide; that is, two doors, each 18 inches wide? All I can
find is doors 78 and 80 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   JOYCE TURNER, North Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. And I doubt if you will find any unless you have them made.
That would be very expensive; they are costly enough as is. But
here is what I suggest, and it is what the handyman did when he
built an extra tall closet. He reduced the opening to 80 inches
high, and build a shelf above the whole closet. You could do the
same, and put doors on the shelf as well. The handyman did not put
doors on that upper shelf, but he might. In fact, he built the
closet a year ago and has yet to put up the doors. Sh! Don't tell
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You wrote recently that someone put a lighted kerosene
lantern in a fireplace to keep it from smelling. The idea of the
lantern was to get the stagnant air going up the chimney instead of
down, which it was doing, bringing the odor of burnt wood into the
house. My question is, how long should the lantern be kept lit?
</P>
<P>
   M.J.N., Tewksbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. As long as it keeps the odor out of house. The reverse
chimney effect (air coming down the chimney) might stop as cold
weather kicks in, so you can probably turn off the lantern now. And
of course, turn it off if you use the fireplace. It's a good idea
to turn it off in winter because the damper must be kept open as
long as you keep the lantern lit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Raccoons are raiding my in-ground garbage can and having a
wonderful time at my expense. They seem to share the work in
opening the can. How can I deter them?
</P>
<P>
   M.G., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are various animal repellents you can spray on and
around the can, but that would work temporarily, if at all. First,
try sprinkling cayenne pepper flakes on the garbage and on the can.
Or, better yet, cayenne powder, but be careful with that powder
because it can cause allergic reactions if inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you may have to build a heavy duty steel cage around
the can to keep the varmints out. But you know they can open almost
anything, so the cage must be super-strong.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put in a new sidewalk of concrete, not asphalt. I
have heard of patterned concrete, done in the forms of stone,
brick, and other nice shapes. I have no idea of where to look. Do
you?
</P>
<P>
   JOE CALCIO, Holbrook, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yep, and that is why I filed the patterned concrete people in
my super electronic file. According to the companies' promotional
material, patterned concrete does look good. So, take your choice:
</P>
<P>
   Technokrete is one brand name for decorative concrete, in
Whitman, Mass., 781-447-9444, 800-236-1322.

CONSUMER ADVOCATES QUESTION HANCOCK'S PLAN FOR PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. sells
shares to the public sometime in February, executives from the
insurer plan to stand on the New York Stock Exchange podium with
home-run king Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The fabled slugger will hit whiffle balls onto the trading
floor, symbolizing the grand slam that Hancock's $2 billion initial
public offering is expected to make with investors.
</P>
<P>
   But many of Hancock's policyholders are likely to feel left out
of the game. As the nation's 13th-largest life insurer prepares to
convert from a mutual firm owned by policyholders to a Wall Street
giant owned by investors, as few as one in five policyholders
eligible to own stock in the new firm will actually do so,
according to some industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   One reason? Even though stock is the currency of choice in
today's hot investment environment, Hancock wants to compensate its
least profitable policyholders with cash instead of equity when it
reorganizes. In all, about 20 percent of Hancock's 2.9 million
eligible policyholders will own 70 percent of the new company, said
David Schiff, an industry analyst. Institutional investors, who
will buy Hancock stock for mutual and pension funds, will own 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Previous conversions by insurers have
</P>
<P>
   made stock, not cash, the dominant form of compensation. When
Worcester-based State Mutual converted to publicly traded Allmerica
Financial in 1995, it gave stock to 77 percent of policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Hancock, bucking that precedent, is requiring policyholders
who want stock to specify their preference in writing before the
end of the month. Eligible policyholders who want stock but do not
say so will automatically receive cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual,'' said Arthur Fliegelman, an analyst at Moody's
Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has consumer advocates, who say the process is murky
and ill-understood by ordinary policyholders, up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately 80 percent of Hancock's policyholders will have
traded away their equity interests without understanding the
ramifications of what they were doing,'' wrote Schiff, editor of
Schiff's Insurance Observer, an industry newsletter, in a document
to be presented to state industry regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Through a process called ``demutualization,'' Hancock will grant
eligible policyholders stock, cash, or enhanced policies in a new
holding company, with the compensation representing their share of
a company worth up to $14 billion. Hancock, which wants to become
publicly traded to raise cash to make acquisitions, compete better,
and retain top talent, will then issue stock to the investing
public. Hancock has 3.3 million policyholders overall, but 500,000
bought policies from subsidiaries and are not eligible for
compensation. All policies remain in force after the initial public
offering, or IPO, for which Hancock plans a roadshow in January.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates see problems. Hancock's revamp, like the
insurance industry as a whole, is devilishly complex. Consumer
advocates like Jason Adkins, a Boston lawyer, argue that the
working-class owners of small policies who are the heart of the
136-year-old company are unlikely to understand their interests and
rights. In an industry with arcane rules, Hancock has not done
enough to explain things to policyholders, who are the company's
nominal owners, Adkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Hancock. In mailings to policyholders, including
a two-page Q&AMP;A leaflet, a half-dozen large postcard-size
information cards, a premium ``stuffer,'' a ``special'' postcard,
and various Web-site postings, Hancock says it has kept customers
informed of its plans and their implications for policyholders'
rights, known as membership interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is to give people a choice between cash and
stock and to give them fair value,'' said a Hancock spokesman,
Stephen P. Burgay. In a unique twist, Hancock plans to calculate
cash payments to reflect a 20 percent premium on the IPO price.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement to be presented at a public hearing next
Wednesday in Boston on Hancock's reorganization, Schiff said
Hancock's mailings were ``coercive, deceptive, and misleading.''
Hancock, Schiff wrote, downplayed the fact that membership
interests entail a right to common stock. And Hancock has not
explained to ordinary policyholders the hefty tax implications of
receiving cash rather than equity. Schiff said Hancock should have
set stock, not cash, as the default compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's opinion appeared to be partly echoed by John Murphy, a
New York lawyer and an adviser to the Massachusetts Division of
Insurance, which must approve Hancock's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we require that the default form of compensation also
be Common Stock?'' Murphy wrote in a confidential memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Burgay said cash would allow policyholders to avoid the
``difficulty'' of dealing with small numbers of shares and the
``hassle'' of brokerage commissions should they later sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small policyholders typically prefer cash,'' Burgay said. But
in its reorganization plan, Hancock also notes another big reason
for pushing cash: fewer shareholders will result in a more
favorable valuation for the new company. In a hot market for IPOs,
some analysts think Hancock could become the biggest insurance IPO
ever, with stock that will rise in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   More so than most life insurers, Hancock has sold unusually
large numbers of small policies, known as ``nickle-and-dimes,'' to
working class people throughout America. Hancock has 4 million
small policies, typically burial policies worth less than $1,000.
Such ``industrials,'' as they are also known, are a costly,
bureaucratic hassle for the insurer, which wants to trim
administrative expenses and eliminate laborious processing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hancock, which has $131 billion in assets and a surplus
of $5.2 billion, is unable to locate 400,000 policyholders who have
moved, or 14 percent of its eligible customer base. (Surplus is a
standard measure of value for an insurer.) Months ago Hancock could
not locate twice that number. Allmerica lost track of only 3
percent of its customers, according to Adkins. With 20 percent of
Hancock's policyholder payments coming from Massachusetts, many of
the missing folk are state residents.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's reorganization plan must be approved by two-thirds of
eligible policyholders who vote, either in person, by proxy, or by
mail. Votes must be processed by Nov. 30, when the company will
hold a special meeting that policyholders can attend. Hancock
by-laws require a mere 10 policyholders to cast votes on the plan,
but the company has already received 800,000 ballots, according to
Burgay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been overwhelmingly positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics see other problems. Investment bank Morgan Stanley &AMP;
Co. has provided a ``fairness opinion'' of Hancock's plan. Yet the
bank is also Hancock's lead IPO underwriter, a role advocates see
as a conflict of interest, since it will earn the bank around $100
million in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the interests of policyholders, who want bigger
policy dividends, may be at odds with shareholders, who want higher
stock dividends, said Moody's Fliegelman.
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist, on-line investment bank Wit Capital Corp. is
lobbying regulators to let it distribute Hancock's IPO through the
Internet and to give each policyholder the right to buy up to 500
shares.

WEBB TO PERFORM HIS CLASSICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many listeners may not know the name Jimmy Webb, but they've
likely heard his songs. More than 200 artists have recorded Webb's
classic, ``MacArthur Park,'' including Richard Harris, Donna
Summer, Frank Sinatra, and even Weird Al Yankovic, who parodied it
under the name of ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Campbell scored big with Webb's ``By the Time I Get to
Phoenix'' and ``Wichita Lineman.'' Joe Cocker soared with ``The
Moon's a Harsh Mistress,'' the Fifth Dimension with ``Up Up and
Away,'' and, later, the Highwaymen (Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson,
Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson) with ``The Highwayman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma-bred Webb, who now lives in New York, is still
active, writing songs for the likes of Carly Simon, Linda Ronstadt,
and Michael Feinstein. He also released a well-received book on his
craft last year, ``Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb is the only artist to ever receive Grammy awards for music,
lyrics, and orchestration, though he's never been known as a
performer. But in recent years, he's finally come out from behind
the scenes to do some low-key touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to spin yarns and I want people to know that this isn't
a dreadfully serious show,'' says Webb. ``Usually, I can also bring
myself to wade through `MacArthur Park.' It's a chore sometimes,
but I like to think that this 30-year-old song shows no sign of
losing its vitality. Although I must say that the world seems
fairly divided into two camps _ those who loathe it and those who
give it too much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb wrote ``MacArthur Park'' in his teen-age years. ``For a
teenager to write something like that was probably pretentious, but
that's what I was after. Bones Howe, who managed ('60s hitmakers)
the Association, wanted a long classical piece for radio.
`MacArthur Park' was a sketch for a longer piece that never came
about.''
</P>
<P>
   So Webb went to England to play it for Harris, an actor who
recorded it as a lark. ``After playing a lot of songs for him, I
played the first few bars and the first line of `MacArthur Park'
and Richard said, `I'll have that one.' I guess I can blame the
whole thing on him, but his version is still my favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Webb is also on the board of directors of ASCAP,
where he's fighting to secure royalties for songwriters whose work
appears on the Internet. ``We need to be paid if our music is used
on the Internet,'' he says, ``though there's a certain group of
cowboys who think if it's on the Internet, it's public domain,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   At his shows this weekend, Webb will sing and perform solo on
piano. ``I'm not dead yet and I don't feel I'm a has-been,'' he
says with characteristic good humor. ``I like to think I offer a
viable alternative to some of the stuff that's out there.''

JOURNALISM REVIEW UPDATES LOOK, ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, the 38-year-old Columbia Journalism Review has
been the dowdy dowager of media criticism, out-slicked and
out-hustled by the newsier American Journalism Review and Steve
Brill's ambitious Content.
</P>
<P>
   But under the direction of new publisher and editorial director
David Laventhol (former publisher Joan Konner retired and ex-editor
Marshall Loeb moved on to CBS Market Watch), the November/December
issue of CJR is dramatically _ and impressively _ revamped.
</P>
<P>
   The contributors to Laventhol's redesigned rollout issue also
represent a who's who of big media: Jack Germond, Roone Arledge,
Gail Collins, Joe Klein, Jim Fallows, Judy Woodruff, E. J. Dionne,
and Elizabeth Drew, to name a few. There are clever touches like
letting former NBC News president Larry Grossman review the ``60
Minutes''-bashing movie ``The Insider,'' and having authors Anne
Bernays and Justin Kaplan analyze the new New York Times Manual of
Style and Usage.
</P>
<P>
   Laventhol half parries the question about whether the redesign
remedies CJR's stodgy reputation, saying only that ``the world is
changing and we are changing with it. . . . We wanted to get
multiple voices in the magazine, not just the voice of the Columbia
Journalism Review.''
</P>
<P>
   How good does the new CJR look? Asked for his opinion, American
Journalism Review editor Rem Rieder said, ``Let me think about that
for a couple of minutes.'' When he called back, he declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laventhol, a former Los Angeles Times publisher, is visiting his
old stomping grounds this week. Could he become the next ex-boss to
weigh in on the turmoil caused by the Times's decision to share
profits from the Oct. 10 Sunday magazine with the Staples Center,
the subject of that issue's coverage? Last week, former Times
publisher Otis Chandler created a stir with a letter to the staff
assailing top management.
</P>
<P>
   Laventhol's appearance in Los Angeles is merely a coincidence,
he says, the result of a long-scheduled Times-Mirror-CJR panel on
the digital future. But he adds, ``While I'm here, I'll be talking
to some of my old friends at the Times who were deeply involved in
this stuff.''
</P>

<P>
   She may be an unusual role model, but Nackey Loeb _ widow of
longtime Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader president and publisher
William Loeb _ is funding a new school for would-be journalists.
According to Holly Babin, director of the Nackey S. Loeb School of
Communications in Manchester, classes will most likely begin in
January and will initially cater primarily to high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The Loebs' Union Leader, however, was not exactly a bastion of
journalistic decorum, and was better known for its attack-dog brand
of conservative newspapering. (The paper tried to influence the
1998 elections, for example, by nastily outing a supposedly gay
Democratic state Senate candidate one week before the voters went
to the polls.)
</P>
<P>
   Babin says the New Hampshire paper's reputation really hasn't
created significant problems for the new school. ``It's only come
up with one I person I've interviewed as a (potential) teacher,''
she says.
</P>
<P>

   Call it the battle over the lifestyles of the rich and famous.
The upscale, Massachusetts-based Robb Report is suing the publisher
of the self-descriptive Millionaire Magazine for trademark
infringement and false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Report attorney Mark Young says Robert White, president of
the company that owns Millionaire, is ``unfairly riding on the
coattails of the success of the Robb Report,'' by suggesting an
affiliation with the magazine in his marketing material.
</P>
<P>
   White, who says he founded the Robb Report in 1967 before
selling it, calls the lawsuit ``frivolous'' and says ``the last
thing I would want is for anyone to think we have any connection
with the Robb Report.'' (According to White, the average net worth
of a Millionaire reader is a mind-boggling $9.9 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Young says White's role as Robb Report founder is ``up to
debate.'' But ``founder or not,'' he adds, ``he's unfairly trading
on our trademark.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who says the Internet revolution is threatening old media? Not
Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates, the media industry bankers who just
released their annual Communications Industry Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   According to that report, growing Internet use is saving
Americans so much time previously spent shopping and talking on the
phone that they will actually devote more attention to
``traditional media'' as well. (The report projects that the 74
hours spent on line annually by the average American in 1998 will
rise to 192 by 2003.)
</P>
<P>
   But beware the definition of ``traditional media.'' While
projections to 2003 see a rise in the use of video games, home
video, consumer books, recorded music, and TV watching, the time
spent reading consumer magazines and daily newspapers as well as
listening to radio will decline.

ROBERT KAPLAN PLAYS THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Some writers presume to be men of
letters,'' a character says in Don DeLillo's novel ``Great Jones
Street.'' ``I'm a man of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kaplan says amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about numbers with Kaplan, the author of ``The Nothing
That Is: A Natural History of Zero,'' is like talking about
religion with a missionary _ or, for that matter, missionaries with
a cannibal. His enthusiasm for mathematics would seem,
appropriately enough, infinite.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, 66, is an ebullient, animated talker. His squarish face
and lavish mustache give him the look of a merry hound dog, and
many are the trails he follows. He's as apt to quote a poem by
Shelley or Wallace Stevens as he is a theorem, but it's the
theorems that take pride of place. How could they not for a man who
sees numbers as Kaplan does?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematics is play. It's the greatest of games,'' he
declares. ``Mathematics is freedom! It's a creative art. It's the
greatest of the arts, not the least of the sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades now, as a teacher at local schools
and colleges, Kaplan has been winning converts to what Anne
Fadiman, the editor of The American Scholar, admiringly calls ``his
witty and slightly screwy attitude toward mathematics.'' Since
1994, he has made the focus of his teaching the Math Circle, an
innovative program with participants ranging in age from 5 to 60
that aims to make the study of mathematics (dare one say it?) fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people who teach mathematics are scared to
death of it,'' Kaplan sighs, ``and what they teach very well is
their fear.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites himself as a case in point. ``I came to (mathematics)
very slowly,'' he says. ``I had dreadful teachers. I thought
mathematics was arbitrary, cruel, heartless, boring, and
pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the son of a wealthy
Russian-born businessman who came to the United States after
fleeing Siberian exile. According to family lore, the elder Kaplan
and Joseph Stalin briefly shared a prison cell, following the
Revolution of 1905. (``Since my father was a Menshevik,'' Kaplan
explains, ``and Stalin a Bolshevik, they just glared at each other
from opposite sides of the room.'')
</P>
<P>
   A child prodigy, Kaplan was admitted to the University of
Chicago at 14, but his parents made him wait until he was 16 before
enrolling. Making up for lost time, he graduated after one year.
This was at the end of the Robert Maynard Hutchins era at Chicago,
and students got their degrees after passing a set of required
tests, regardless of how many classes they had taken. ``It was all
multiple choice,'' Kaplan shrugs. ``I didn't necessarily know the
answers, but it was easy to figure out through a process of
elimination which ones not to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Degree in hand, Kaplan now sought an education. He spent four
years auditing courses at Harvard, where he met his wife, Ellen. An
artist and educator, she provided the illustrations for Kaplan's
book and heads the mathematics department at the New Jewish High
School, in Waltham. Their son, Michael, 42, has a television
production company in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in Germany on a Fulbright Scholarship (hers), they
returned to Cambridge and have been here ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, still uninterested in math, enrolled in a graduate
program in Sanskrit at Harvard. ``My interest is philosophy,'' he
explains, ``and I don't trust translations, so I wanted to read the
philosophical works I was interested in in the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers are just as germane to philosophy, of course, nor do
they require translation, and Kaplan soon saw the mathematical
light. Encouraged by a friend, Barry C. Mazur, who is now Gerhard
Gade University Professor at Harvard, he switched his field to
philosophy and mathematics and there's been no stopping Kaplan
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes it as a challenge to teach mathematics to anyone,''
Mazur says of Kaplan, ``and I must say I yearn to do that, too, but
you have to have a real gift for it _ and he has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kaplan's gift is believing his subject owes as much to
the imagination as to logic. As Fadiman says of ``The Nothing That
Is,'' ``You don't read this book; you play it, as you would a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan is a man of considerable geniality, but on this matter he
is emphatic. ``You want people to come to grips with math the way
they come to grips with language: learning the grammar, not for the
sake of the grammar, but for the sake of the poetry that one writes
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Math Circle comes in. It began five years ago
with the Kaplans presiding over 29 students who met once a week for
an informal discussion of some math problem. Now there are 135
participants and 10 weekly meetings: Nine hourlong sessions and a
three-hour extravaganza on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers (one's almost tempted to call them MCs) now also
include two Harvard students and a recently minted MIT PhD, but
during a recent Math Circle meeting at Harvard's Science Center
it's Kaplan who's standing at the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rainy weekeday afternoon, ideal for video games or
television, but eight boys between 9 and 13 are happily involved in
trying to figure out the possible paths of a ball thrown against a
wall. Just as engrossed are three parents.
</P>
<P>
   Once that problem's solved, they'll move on to something more
abstract: What's the biggest parallelogram that can be drawn within
a given triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is half the area of the triangle, but this is
definitely a case where how an answer is arrived at matters more _
not to mention is far more enjoyable _ than actually getting the
answer. Kaplan sees to that. He plays a wonderfully energetic
straight man to his crew of young mathematical cutups: encouraging
them, drawing them out, a Pied Piper who gets his results from the
Socratic method rather than any wind instrument. It's hard to say
who's having more fun, Kaplan or the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Newman, whose 8-year-old, Alison, attends the session that
precedes this one, mentions that her daughter had a scheduling
conflict between soccer, piano, and the Math Circle. ``She gave up
piano,'' Newman says. The relationship between mathematics and
music is much celebrated (don't get Kaplan started on the subject
of Bach), but no one plays anything resembling scales at the Math
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've rarely seen such high-intensity enthusiasm, real ideas
being worked on,'' says Harvard mathematician Mazur, ``and such
young minds doing it. I don't see why it can't inspire Math Circles
elsewhere . . . though it takes a real genius of a teacher to pull
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   A genius of a teacher Kaplan may be, but a draftsman he's not.
This leaves him open to much cheerful abuse from his charges. At
one point, a boy named Isaac suggests Kaplan use a computer to draw
his lines ``because then they'll go straight.'' ``OK,'' Kaplan
tells him, ``but using the mind is even better.'' It's a sentence
no equation could improve upon.

``PHARAOHS OF THE SUN: AKHENATEN, NEFERTITI, TUTANKHAMEN'' 
Organized by Rita Freed for the MFA. 
At: Museum of Fine Arts through Feb. 6. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the Egyptian city of Amarna, the sun rises each
morning in a natural dip in the cliffs, momentarily cradled by
rocks. With each dawn, the sun appears to create the world anew.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it seemed, at least, to Akhenaten, the radical
pharaoh who was probably history's first monotheist and who, some
time around 1347 BC, ordered tens of thousands of his subjects to a
crescent-shaped plain in Middle Egypt, bordered by protective hills
on one side and the life-giving Nile on the other. There they were
to create a new city for a newly promoted deity _ the sun god, now
the only god, Aten.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years into his reign, Akhenaten died. His successors
abandoned Amarna. If you go to this bleak and desolate patch of
desert nowadays, you'll see almost nothing above foundation level.
If you go to the Museum of Fine Arts, though, and bring along your
imagination and an inquisitive mind, you can conjure up not just
the look of Amarna, but the life of its inhabitants. Scholars don't
know how many people Akhenaten forced to his new capital, but it's
obvious from the wealth of sculpture, painting, glass, ceramic, and
wooden objects that have survived the millennia at least in
fragmentary form, that hundreds of them, perhaps thousands, were
artists and artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Showcasing their vast output, the MFA's ``Pharaohs of the Sun:
Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen'' is a superb recreation of the
lost city. It's also a laudably ambitious exhibition. Amarna's
known art and artifacts were dispersed to the corners of the globe
during a century's worth of excavation, so the more than 250
objects in the MFA's Gund Gallery had to be gathered together from
more than three dozen public and private collections in Europe and
America _ and from Egyptian museums, too. Not everything left. The
technical level in the show ranges from fairly crude to
breathtaking. The best objects are both beautiful and revealing.
They tell you about the importance of music and dance in Amarna
culture, about trade with far-flung nations and intermarriage with
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Most exhibitions of Egyptian art go over familiar turf _
pyramids and mummies. ``Pharaohs'' is as fresh as the virgin
territory of Amarna was when Akhenaten's legions arrived. The
emphasis in most Egyptian shows is on death. In ``Pharaohs,'' it's
on life. The shabti statuettes that did the deceased's chores in
the afterlife, the canopic jars that held the mummified organs, are
in a small side room that is intentionally not the show's high
point.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the centerpiece of the exhibition is a huge tabletop
model of the 10-mile-long city. So recent is some of the
scholarship on which the show is based that, had the model been
made last year, it would have been missing all the backstage areas
_ the wine and beer-making facilities, the wheat and barley groves
_ that were only excavated in 1999. So far, they exist on no
published map.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To give tangible form to his radical religious revolution,
Akhenaten instituted a revolution in art. Some of it resonates with
modern tastes and ideas. No longer was the god represented as a
human. Aten was abstracted, depicted as a sun disc emanating rays
that end in little hand shapes. Democracy didn't enter the Amarna
picture, though. The rays shine only on the royals: Akhenaten; his
principle wife, Nefertiti; and their six daughters. The sculptural
abstraction of the god parallels the language of ``The Great Hymn
to Aten,'' the fullest statement of the new religion, carved in an
Amarna tomb. With the words ``and you are in my heart'' it states
for the first time in history the idea that god lies within the
individual soul.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of the MFA show, a team led by the museum's
Egyptian curator, Rita Freed, treat Akhenaten's brief reign as an
age of enlightenment; the chronological installation and the show's
design underscore that interpretation. The exhibition begins and
ends in darkened rooms where art from before the Amarna revolution
and from its aftermath is displayed. In the central room the lights
are turned up, the walls are pale and warm, and the city comes to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with a point of reference: the seated figure of
one of Akhenaten's predecessors, Thutmose III. He is sculpted in
the static, smiling, smooth, eternally youthful style that had
ruled Egyptian art for over a thousand years. Pharaohs didn't age,
at least not in art. Then comes a large, shadowy room devoted to
Amarna's origins, with a silhouette of the city's limestone cliffs
painted on the gallery walls to give a context for the objects,
most of which are also stone. Some depict Akhenaten's father,
Amenhotep III, who put the artistic revolution in motion and is
shown with the bulbous body that became even more pronounced in
figures of his son. Among the transitional works here is a charming
statuette of an upper-class woman. Its material _ warm wood as
opposed to the hard granite of much of the show _ and its size,
just a few inches high, add to its charm. The smiling woman looks
ready to chat; her pudgy figure points the way to the Amarna style.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent subject in Amarna art and the dominant
presence in this show is Akhenaten himself, depicted with
attenuated features and hooded eyes. His head looks like a horse's.
A relief of a real horse head in the show bears a
separated-at-birth resemblance to the pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   Akhenaten's expression is hypnotic: You can easily imagine
people obeying his commands. His body is bizarre, with bulging
thighs and a flabby midriff spilling over the top of his kilt. He
and Nefertiti sometimes have virtually the same shape: Sexual
ambiguity played a big part in Egyptian art. Akhenaten is also
shown as a sphinx, as Egyptian monarchs traditionally were.
</P>
<P>
   While the flab doesn't meet contemporary criteria for beauty,
and it's hard now to understand how the elongated skulls of the
royal princesses could be considered pleasing, many examples of
Amarna art seem startlingly modern. The heads of Nefertiti qualify.
The most famous one doesn't leave its home in the Egyptian Museum
in Berlin, but there are others in the MFA show, several with
supermodel good looks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What unifies the Amarna aesthetic _ in representations of people
and animals, in architecture, in urban planning _ is line. Longer
was better. In reliefs of royal hands and feet, the fingers and
toes are almost absurdly elongated. Horses stretch in arcing leaps.
The Great Temple was 2,500 feet long, a scale designed to impress.
Amarna was an early case of the planned city; its rectilinear
design made more sense than, say, Boston's maze. Cutting through
Amarna was the Royal Road, meant not only to connect temples and
palaces, but also to create a straight processional route and a
sense of excitement among the citizenry when they spied a royal
chariot in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Two reproduction columns in the show, based on a fragment
installed nearby, hint at the blaze of color of Amarna's heyday.
The columns' design of ducks bunched together like a flower bouquet
is enlivened by a palette of coral and copen blue. A
dollhouse-sized column in the shape of bundled papyrus, which
workers would have used as a model for making a full-sized,
functional version, offers a glimpse of the art-making process in
Amarna.
</P>
<P>
   There's more color in fragments of floor paintings from palaces,
gorgeous designs featuring marsh plants. The watery botanical life
was a psychological coolant in sun-baked palaces; to modern eyes,
the graceful, fanning, stylized plant imagery prefigures Art
Nouveau. There's still more color in faience tiles and tiny,
exquisite polychromed glass vessels in wavy scalloped patterns,
once filled with precious unguents and perfumes. Much has been made
of the 7-foot heads of Akhenaten in this show; equally riveting are
the tiniest objects, like the 2-inch tall creamy calcite vase
adorned with the image of a nude child poised on a lotus, a symbol
of rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the humblest objects here _ the world's oldest known
toilet seat, for instance _ are the easiest for contemporary
viewers to identify with. You can almost see a little foot slipping
into a child's sandal woven of reed, the flip-flop of its day. And
the miniature figures of forbidden gods, fierce little talismans,
suggest that Amarna's official religion may not have been the only
one in practice.
</P>
<P>
   In depictions of the Amarna royals, there is an informality and
affection previously unknown in Egyptian art. The princesses _
represented as miniature adults, according to the convention of the
times, and looking somewhat like the aliens in ``Men in Black'' _
scamper onto their parents' laps for a cuddle. They're shown either
nude or wearing the kind of pleated drapery that Fortuny would
recreate several millennia down the road, drapery so diaphanous
that in one relief a pubic triangle is clearly outlined.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most touching aspects of the show is the tenderness
between Akhenaten and Nefertiti, all the more valuable for not
being filtered through the sensibilities of later centuries. It's
not Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton doing ``Cleopatra.'' It's
not even Shakespeare. It's an authentic intimacy that speaks across
thousands of years, epitomized in a tiny carnelian carving of
Akhenaten and Nefertiti kissing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Akhenaten's death in 1336 BC, Tutankhamen, a young boy of
mysterious origins who had married one of the pharaoh's daughters,
rose to power. He, or those who controlled him, authorized the
abandonment of Amarna _ and the Amarna style. It didn't happen all
at once. The ``Pharaohs'' show offers statues of Amen, a god
Tutankhamen restored to prominence, in both the fleshy Amarna mode
and the crisper, hieratic, post-Amarna look. The last room of the
MFA exhibition stars a dazzling compromise between the two styles,
the huge white limestone statue of Maya, a high level
Tutankhamen-era civil servant, and his wife, Meryt. The monumental
block is installed on a diagonal _ breaking all the rules of museum
display _ subliminally reinforcing the idea of art turning a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   In this last room is also a vivid blue faience situla, an
Amarna-era ritual vessel that held milk to be sprinkled on the path
of a coffin en route to the tomb. This situla is in excellent
condition _ except for one cartouche that has been gouged out. It
contained the name of Akhenaten. Like Stalin's associates who fell
out of favor and were airbrushed out of photographs, Akhenaten was
erased from history. But those who hacked his name and his face
from sculpture all over Egypt succeeded only temporarily. Rita
Freed's ``Pharaohs of the Sun'' restores him to the light.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(After Boston, the exhibition travels to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Rijksmuseum
Van Oudheden, Leiden, the Netherlands.)

1930S GM BUS OFFERED A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Once, it cradled the future, rolling out of post-Depression
America and touring the United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Canada
with 11 other silver-and-red vehicles just like it, promise on
wheels, revealing the wonders of science and technology that
offered a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it sits gutted and rusty in a tight little hilltop
neighborhood in a small New Hampshire mill town, awaiting
restoration and a chance to tour again.
</P>
<P>
   For auto buffs, there is not much more exciting than an
extraordinary find in an unlikely place. And the General Motors
``Futurliner'' belonging to restaurateur-turned-carpenter Kendrick
Robbins is a rare find.
</P>
<P>
   Its roots are found in the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, where the
most popular display was GM's Science and Technology exhibit. It
was such a tantalizing glimpse into the future that GM decided to
take it on the road. So the Parade of Progress, using eight
van-like trucks, was launched on Feb. 11, 1936, in Lakeland, Fla.
As it grew in popularity, GM replaced the original vehicles with 12
Futurliners, built in 1939 at a cost of $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Built by the GMC Truck and Coach Division and GM Research
Laboratories Division, the Futurliners were 33 feet long, 8 feet
wide, 11 feet 4 inches high, and had a wheelbase of 248 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The driver sat in a ``cockpit'' that was reached by entering a
door on the front ride side of the Futurliner and climbing stairs
to a center-steering perch. The driver's eyes were 10 feet above
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in Fridigaire-cooled comfort, with power steering at his
command, he peered through a curved E-Z-Glass windshield that
surrounded him like a bubble. An Autronic Eye sensed the approach
of other vehicles and automatically dimmed the Futurliner's
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   A 302-cubic-inch, 145-horsepower gasoline engine, supplying 262
lb-ft. of torque powered the rumbling exhibit and a HydraMatic
transmission took care of shifting.
</P>
<P>
   The interior was upholstered in vinyl-coated fabric in lime and
hunter green.
</P>
<P>
   A gull-wing door 45 inches high and 16 feet long opened up,
while a similar door of the same length and 36 inches high opened
down to form a stage and reveal interior exhibition space. At
night, a 15-foot lighting tower rose from the roof to a height of
18 feet and its 36 fluorescent tubes, aided by two 250-watt
incandescent lamps at each end of this ``inverted canoe'' lighted
the area around the Futurliner.
</P>
<P>
   Each Futurliner had a purpose: lecture stage, a display of
modern power featuring the diesel engine, an animated diorama
called America at a Crossroads, the kitchen of tomorrow, the living
room of tomorrow, information, aviation, national defense,
scientific research, an album of motoring, the story of gasoline,
and the evolution of motor car coach craft.
</P>
<P>
   With a crew of about 60 _ ``most of whom are young college
graduates,'' GM literature of the day boasted _ the tour rumbled
from city to city. Some Futurliners were connected by awnings to
form an enclosed warren of exhibits. A feature of the parade was
the Aer-o-Dome, an exhibition tent holding 1,500 people supported
by ``airplane alloy girders'' and covered with ``aluminum
impregnated skin'' _ a huge and early free-standing dome tent.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were also lecturers, and the lecturers were also the
grounds crew that set up and took down the exhibit at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   They visited more than 250 cities and the exhibit was seen by 12
1/2 million people before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor shut down
the Parade of Progress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, GM decided to restart the parade and, keeping in mind
that progress now meant covering new gains such as jet propulsion,
radar and television, retrofitted the Futurliners. In stripping his
Futurliner for restoration, Robbins found the date Dec. 24, 1952 _
the day before he was born _ scrawled on its inner skin.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins found his Futurliner in a curious way, in a junkyard in
his small New Hampshire town. He owned a restaurant at the time and
was out looking for an antique auto he could use as a salad bar and
conversation piece. But he spotted the Futurliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Forget the salad bar,' '' he says. For $3,000, the
Futurliner was his.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has all the exterior parts and can do an authentic
exterior restoration. Inside, he will have to improvise, and he
wants a diesel engine for his Futurliner. His hope is that he can
one day put it on the road to tour again _ perhaps exhibiting
tires, automotive breakthroughs, automobilia.
</P>
<P>
   He visited a California man who restored a Futurliner _ an Art
Deco treatment that cost $200,000 _ so he knows it can be done.
He's talked with people who can bend new glass for the cockpit;
he's bought a welder; he's collected all the literature he can find
_ and there's not a lot _ on the Futurliner. He's discovered that
the adjustable driver's seat in his Futurliner is identical to a
radar man's seat he spotted in a World War II submarine on display
in Portsmouth _ perhaps a sign of the crossover of military and
industrial aims in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, heading into the restoration, is entering a time warp
woven with irony: recreating a past that once tried to foretell the
future. Bringing back a vehicle whose demise _ their rebirth lasted
only from 1953-56 when they were sold off and fell into disrepair
in junkyards _ was precipitated by one of the very modern wonders
the fleet had touted: television.
</P>
<P>
   For when you could display the wonders of the future on
television, who needed the Futurliner any longer?

2000 XTERRA: SUV WITH A RETRO LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days of ever-more-rapid introduction of new models and
types of cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs to fill ever-more-specific
niches, how long does it take before some manufacturer steps up and
goes retro in a class not really that old?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of SUVs, apparently not long. For that is what
Nissan has done with the 2000 Xterra. Remember when SUVs were
spartan, spunky, actually spent time in mud, snow, clambering over
rocks and got scratched by brush _ and were affordable by even
folks with modest incomes?
</P>
<P>
   I give you the Xterra, promoted as a Gen-X car, but nothing to
be scoffed at by anyone looking for the fun and affordability of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-sitting, angular box of an SUV, based on the Nissan
Frontier 4-by-4 truck platform. It comes in two- and
four-wheel-drive versions, with four- and six-cylinder engines.
Priced from the mid-$17,000s to the $25,000 range, it's formidable
competition for the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V. It's bigger
than either of them, will go where they won't go and, in fact, at
its highest price, ends up where similarly sized SUVs, like the
Toyota 4Runner, barely let you open a door.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are options you'll want. I tested the XE 4-by-4
(base model 4-by-4 at $21,499) but could not imagine it without the
powdercoated, rubber-treaded step-up rails (modern lingo for
running boards) and the signature powdercoated roof rack/gear bin.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting an Xterra without the latter would be like seeing a
snowboarder in baggy jeans, a hard-core mountain biker without
scabs, or a skateboarder without piercings.
</P>
<P>
   The rails, rack, and bin come as part of a utility package
($999) that also includes auxiliary 12-volt power ports, extra rear
tie clips, first aid kit, upgraded tires with fender moldings, rear
wiper, retractable cargo cover, tilting steering column, and
variable intermittent wipers.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to do serious off-roading, you'll need the sport
package ($799) that includes alloy wheels, fog lamps, a front tow
hook, and limited slip differential. You don't need everything in
either of the two packages, but some of the things you will not
want to do without.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can live without power door locks, power mirrors, a
leather-wrapped steering wheel and assorted other extras (power
package, $1,299), you'll bring it home nicely appointed at just
about $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll get is a sturdy, all-steel romper with body on frame
construction, engine and fuel tank skid plates underneath, that
will take you smoothly along the highway and bopping on offroad
trails.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you get bucket seats up front, a three-person,
50/50-split rear seat coated in water-resistant fabric that has an
industrial feel to it so you don't worry about dripping snowboards
or muddy mountain bike tires.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation and controls, like much of the interior, are
spartan: basics behind the wheel, climate up top in center dash,
audio below, and beneath that a small bin and 12-volt outlet.
</P>
<P>
   There are bins in all four doors and a deep center console;
pockets on the backs of the front seats and a small pocket on the
inside of the front passenger's seat _ a good spot for sunglasses
or cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The rear cargo area is ample, and since the rear seat cushions
are removable, it can be expanded into a deep, flat space. Outside
and inside, a lot can be hauled in the Xterra. There are optional
racks for skis, snowboards, kayaks, and bicycles. For the latter,
both interior and exterior racks are available, and you can carry
as many as six bikes.
</P>
<P>
   With such an obvious aim at the adventurous, it's no wonder
another Xterra option is a first-aid kit, complete with scissors,
bandages, ointments, and even two emergency blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Unless I just wanted the SUV look to tool around a suburban
neighborhood or downtown Boston, I'd stay away from the 4-cylinder
engine and go right for the V6. The former is 143 horsepower and
the latter 170 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   But for trips into ski country, or offroading, you'll want the
extra power. The XE V6 was good enough for highway passing, though
I'd certainly go with the 5-speed standard over the 4-speed
automatic just because the standard is more responsive at that
horsepower. If I pull out to pass, I want personal control of
shifting _ though I was struck in the Xterra by the long, long
floor-mounted shift, reminiscent of old trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But bear in mind, please, that this is not a car. It sits high,
and it transfers weight more radically than a low-slung car will.
Passing and cornering in the Xterra, I was acutely aware of weight
shifting transversely to the outside of my turns and diagonally to
the outside front tire. Drive this or any other SUV as if you're in
a standard car and you can get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Offroad, while the Xterra lacks the power of its larger ilk, it
makes up for it by being light. It nimbly climbed a steep, muddy
grade; worked its way in proper mincing fashion over large rocks;
held itself back nicely, using the engine, on steep downhill
stretches.
</P>
<P>
   It was stiff side-to-side and rocked stiffly front to back on
undulating terrain. It has double wishbone suspension up front,
good old dual leaf springs in the rear. ABS is standard on all
models, with discs up front and drums in the rear. Gas mileage _
the usual soccer games, commuting, fetching of morning newspapers _
was an acceptable 17 1/2 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --Rear door handles mounted high up and vertically on the back
edge of the door. Ever approach a vehicle, arms loaded with
packages or gear, and fumble to reach down and lift a handle you
cannot see? With these, you lean the load against the body near the
handle and flip it out toward you.
</P>
<P>
   --Cup holders. Five. Good sized. Not tucked away. Don't have to
search for them.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The parking brake. Pulls out from under the dash to the right
of the steering wheel. A real hassle to take off. Lots of twisting
and turning and maneuvering to get it fully disengaged (at least
that's what the parking brake light told me).

BRITISH PUBLICATION GETS SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I contact the publishers of Business Opportunities
Digest?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: The address for that work-at-home publication is Business
Opportunities Digest, Chartsearch Ltd., 28 Charles Square, London,
England N1 6HT.
</P>
<P>
   The British Advertising Standards Authority has investigated
several complaints against Chartsearch and the publication. In one
case, the group asked that a Digest ad be changed because
``advertisers had not substantiated that demand existed for
free-lance proofreaders.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a Daily Telegraph consumer action reporter helped a
reader get a long-delinquent refund on a Digest subscription.
``Dealing with Chartsearch is frustrating in that its `customer
service helpline' does not take calls,'' the Telegraph reported.
``Instead it requests the reader to write to an address that from
your experience one might presume has a warehouse full of identical
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the game Authors?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.Z.
</P>
<P>
   A: Authors, a variation of the children's card game Go Fish, has
been published by several different companies in the past 130
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet auction site eBay frequently lists used versions by
Parker Brothers, Whitman Publishing and the Fairchild Company.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Games Systems currently sells 17 different versions of
Authors, including Composers, Baseball Legends, Children's Authors
and Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   For ordering information, call (800) 544-2637 or visit the World
Wide Web site www.usgamesinc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an autograph of the '60s actress Valora Noland, but
don't know anything about her. What has she appeared in?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.G., N. Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Noland had an eight-year TV and movie career, according to
the Internet Movie Database.
</P>
<P>
   The actress appeared in two movies with Frankie Avalon and
Annette Funicello: ``Beach Party'' in 1963 and the sequel ``Muscle
Beach Party'' in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   She also had a role in the John Wayne movie ``The War Wagon''
and guest-starred on a 1968 episode of ``Star Trek,'' ``Patterns of
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Movie Database is published on the Web at
www.imdb.com.

   TEACHING-HOSPITALS (Washington) _ The White House and Congress
strike a deal to restore $12 billion in Medicare cuts, including
more funding for the nation's 800 teaching hospitals. The plan
would reallocate funds for educating medical residents so that
older institutions, many of them on the East Coast, would no longer
get larger federal subsidies than newer teaching hospitals, mainly
in the West and the Sunbelt. By JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN.

inevitable that a robotic pooch would come along. We love our real
pets and shower them with expensive accessories. But why not a hot
new Japanese invention _ a mechanical dog that walks, performs
stunts off a memory stick and blinks its eyes on cue? It won't
return your love, but, hey, you can't have everything. By MARIANNE

Shortly afterward, officials at a new command center here set up by

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Blame it on anything, even your dog
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 14, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my four children were growing up and one or more of them
unintentionally (I think) damaged something in the house, it always
was Brownie who got the blame. Brownie was a boxer dog we had, who
apparently was capable of leaving chocolate cookie stains on
bedsheets, toys askew in the living room, bubble gum stuck under
the kitchen chair and ceramic lamps shattered on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   During any of these incidents, with me giving it my best
I'm-mad-as-hell look, the children would tell me: ``Brownie did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Brownie. He was a scapegoat; he bore the blame for others.
</P>
<P>
   Few admit to doing anything wrong these days. It's always
someone or something else.
</P>
<P>
   When computers began to creep into our lives, it offered
potential for scapegoating. The payment of bills, the recording of
satisfied bills and any number of things are done by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus were computers linked to the Brownie Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the computer: ``Oh, the computer is down. Can you
call back in a day or two?'' Or: ``We're in the process of putting
in new computers and so we can't handle your complaint now.'' Or:
``No, I don't see it on the computer. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is getting to be old hat, so there is need for
a new, updated scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   We've got two of them: Y2K and solar flares.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a health physicist reported that the sun's 11-year
cycle will peak in March 2000, which could, the article said,
``expose travelers and flight crews to the equivalent of 20 chest
X-rays.'' It added that people who fly more than 75,000 miles
annually could face a 1 percent higher risk of dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the 20 percent higher risk to smokers, 35 percent
higher risk to people who don't exercise, an additional 15 percent
risk to those who eat fatty foods and 35 percent risk to people who
drink a quart or so of vodka every day and life cycles are in deep
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to have frequent fliers dispatched via solar flares,
an article this month alluded to those same flares. There was
nothing in it, however, about the flying public. Instead, this was
about the flares interrupting power grids, satellites, pagers and
just about everything but your mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves an opportunity for power companies, cellular phone
people, paging companies and the like to transfer blame for lack of
service from their everyday company goof-ups to the flaring object
93 million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But this will not affect us until March. Before then, we've got
Y2K to blame. The doomsday zealots think we won't have to worry
about March solar flares because we're all going poof on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is very real, somewhere. Our mails are flooded with notices
from the bank, the credit card company and others that they are
Y2K-complaint, yet so many of us are hiding under our beds on New
Year's Eve, along with the cash we've squirreled away just in case
the ATM machines start dispensing Mountain Dew.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers, facing 1 percent greater risk of getting
cancer, won't have to worry either. On Jan. 1, all the planes are
going to fall out of the sky. Or haven't you heard?
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K Syndrome, cousin to the Brownie Syndrome, has been
activated. Just this past week, my daughter received a notice that
she was overdue on a payment. Psst! The payment is not due until
March -- sometime around the solar flare crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   When she called the creditor to register her displeasure with a
premature dunning, the person on the other end told her it was a
Y2K problem and to just ignore the bill _ which also threatened to
turn her account over to a collection agency if she did not pay up
within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The course of human history often has been diverted through
scapegoating. In its worst form, civilizations can be annihilated
through scapegoating. It also can, and is, maneuvered to shirk
responsibility, credibility and sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be used even to slander your dog.

ROMANIAN DIRECTOR DEALS WITH HOLOCAUST THROUGH LAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY STONE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Radu Mihaileanu would rather talk about his film ``Train of
Life,'' a memorial to Jewish resilience in the face of adversity,
but it's difficult to avoid mentioning the shadow that has dogged
its appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Mihaileanu, 41, grew up in Romania, haunted by questions the
Holocaust raised. But he didn't ``feel gifted enough or strong
enough'' to make a film about the extermination camps, he said in a
recent interview. He thought there had been enough films about
death; he wanted to present ``the wonderful madness'' in a Jewish
community that was determined to survive.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to explore the ``disappearance of a big, big
civilization _ the shtetl civilization,'' the culture that
flourished in thousands of small Jewish villages in Eastern Europe
until it was wiped out in World War II. The film won the 1999
Sundance festival's audience award and Italy's version of the Oscar
_ the Donatello prize _ for best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   There is quiet, understated passion in this writer-director's
voice when he speaks about the shtetl life that died before he was
born. He felt that ``the only revenge against the barbarians''
would be to recreate a shtetl, faithful to the memories of his
writer father and a testament to his two sons _ and to other
children _ about the once-vibrant life of their forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people told me that the shtetl was dark and heavy and
very poor, but I didn't want to show that because it's not what I
received from my father and my grandmother. I learned about that
wonderful imperfect world from them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also inspired by the Yiddish tales of Sholom Aleichem and
Isaac Bashevis Singer, some of which he had performed in his
Romanian Yiddish theater years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of those tales, the director transformed a real
episode in the Moldavian village of Iassy into a boisterous fable.
In 1941, amid all the horror, Iassy suffered a double tragedy. The
only wartime pogrom against Jews was carried out by their Romanian
neighbors while the Nazis rounded up the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   They were told they would be transported to a camp, but were
herded into a ``train of death'' that went nowhere. They were
killed in the railway cars. Among the 8,000 people murdered at that
time, Mihaileanu's maternal uncle died in the pogrom, his father's
uncle on the train. Mihaileanu's parents escaped and fled to
Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Train of Life,'' the tables are turned. The main character,
Shlomo, the shtetl's wild fool, has a premonition about the coming
Holocaust and urges the village wise men to build a train, fake
their own deportation to the concentration camps, but head for
Palestine. In carrying out the plan, some of the Jews will have to
pretend to be Nazis, and therein lies the rub. Authority goes to
the head of the fake Nazi chief until other villagers stage a
revolt against him. They are led by a frustrated, love-lorn young
revolutionary who's busy organizing a Communist cell in the train.
</P>
<P>
   The director began to toy with the idea for his script in 1993.
He had moved to Paris and was receiving critical acclaim, if not
commercial success, for his first film, ``Betrayal,'' the wrenching
portrait of an emigre poet entrapped by Romania's secret police in
France. He finished the script for ``Train of Life'' in 1995 when
he finally found two French Jewish producers who weren't afraid to
finance a film that played with humor on the delicate subject of
the shoah (Hebrew for ``annihilation'').
</P>
<P>
   At the suggestion of his Italian co-producer, Mihaileanu sent
his script to Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni, proposing that
he play Shlomo. Benigni sent back word that he liked the script,
but was planning his own film. A year later, when Mihaileanu began
shooting ``Train of Life'' in Romania, he learned that Benigni had
finished ``Life is Beautiful'' in which a clown-like father creates
unlikely shenanigans to help his small son survive in a
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' Mihaileanu recalled thinking. ``I can't say if he
wrote his script before reading mine or afterwards. I will die
maybe with that question.''
</P>
<P>
   (In Italy, Benigni told Premiere magazine that he and his
scriptwriter had already conceived the plot for ``Life'' when he
received the ``Train'' script.)
</P>
<P>
   That was the beginning of the shadow that has plagued ``Train of
Life,'' although there is no resemblance between the two films
other than the use of humor. That in itself was enough to cause
constant comparisons between the two. An invitation to show ``Train
of Life'' at the 1998 Jerusalem Film Festival was withdrawn after
Miramax submitted ``Life is Beautiful.'' It won the festival's
``Jewish experience'' award. (``Train'' was shown there this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Mihaileanu had heard that Gilles Jacob, the Cannes
festival director, was opposed to any film using humor in relation
to the Holocaust, he submitted ``Train,'' but it was rejected. When
Miramax later presented ``Life,'' Jacob, in an unusual move,
proposed the insertion of a voice-over introduction explaining that
the presumably naturalistic film was a fairy tale. When that was
done, it was accepted and won Cannes' Grand Jury prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Train'' received a remarkable response at the Venice Film
Festival. But the death of Akira Kurosawa took precedence over any
other film coverage. Despite the absence of an advance review, an
audience of 800 gave ``Train'' a 10-minute standing ovation and 100
people demonstrated the next day, demanding that it be shown in
competition and given a second screening. The next time, 1,300
people packed the theater and the film won the critics' prize and
the audience award.
</P>
<P>
   In France, ``Train'' and ``Life'' triggered a month-long media
polemic about their comparative merits. Mihaileanu said he was
determined not to say anything negative about ``Life,'' fearing
falling into a trap which could only hurt Jews in general. But,
referring to the recent proliferation of wartime films, Mihaileanu
said cryptically, ``Some people are beginning to show shoah to
preserve its memory and others want Shoah to serve them.''

TRIAL OF THE CENTURY: WATCHING THIS MISCAST JOAN OF ARC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As anyone who has seen Luc Besson's garishly insane ``The Fifth
Element'' can attest, restraint is not exactly this director's
forte.
</P>
<P>
   So when news came that his next movie would be about Joan of
Arc, skepticism reared its ugly head; his style seemed too wild for
a movie about a saint, even one as mercurial as the 15th-century
French heroine. But Besson deserves the benefit of the doubt: He's
visually inventive, in love with explosions of color, and his
hallucinatory style could be made to fit the material.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, skepticism wins out, and the margin isn't even narrow.
Even if you doubted that Besson could make a good movie from this
material, it still won't prepare you for the mess that is ``The
Messenger,'' which seems destined to join the cinematic-disaster
ranks populated by movies like ``The Postman.'' At the core of its
meltdown is its lead actress, Milla Jovovich, the 23-year-old
sometimes model and one-time wife of Besson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miscast'' doesn't quite describe Jovovich; she has no idea
what to do with the part, playing the role not with mannerisms, but
with tics. She's all bulging eyes, trembling lips, shaky hands and
airy, stuttered line readings. This isn't a 15th-century warrior
saint; it's a 20th-century petulant sitcom actress. She's the first
Joan of Arc in cinematic history to look like she's afraid of
breaking a nail in battle.
</P>
<P>
   If Jovovich sinks the movie, Besson tosses it an anchor and
tells it to stay submerged. He starts promisingly, with an
8-year-old Joan (Jane Valentine, actually quite good) driving the
village priest to distraction with her constant need to confess,
then hearing voices and having visions in French fields filmed with
vibrant beauty. But when Joan witnesses a British soldier killing
her sister in one of the ugliest rape-murder scenes since 1973's
``Death Wish,'' providing her with her lifelong motivation to drive
the British from France, the movie starts to derail.
</P>
<P>
   Besson is fond of placing his speaking actors dead-center on the
screen, in close-ups so extreme that you can almost smell their
colognes. This appears to be an homage to the innovative 1928
silent ``The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' in which director Carl
Theodor Dreyer broke old rules of close-ups and shot composition to
tell his story. But Besson has state-of-the-art sound and
widescreen photography at his disposal, and the in-your-face style
soon becomes tiresome. And with Besson's gift for the extreme, it's
no surprise that he films the climactic burning at the stake in all
its charred-flesh glory.
</P>
<P>
   Along for the ride are John Malkovich _ it would have been worth
15 minutes inside his head just to see what he was thinking when he
took this on _ at his most fey and oily as France's duplicitous
King Charles VII, and a grizzled and grim Dustin Hoffman as _ are
you ready for this? _ ``The Conscience,'' who engages the
imprisoned Joan in endless debates over her violent actions. Only
Faye Dunaway, as Charles' mother-in-law, emerges unscathed, because
she performs with an air of benign bemusement, as if she realized
that the whole enterprise was a goof. It's like a miracle in
reverse; Besson has taken a wonder and turned it into a whine.

<P>
   POLITICS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ As the session trickles into
its final days, the Democrats are romping around highlighting every
piece of the unfinished agenda from gun control to the ``Patients'
Bill of Rights'' to prescription drugs. They've even unveiled a new
ad showing gravestones of issues. This all shows their feeling that
the longer Congress is here, the better it is for them, reminding
the public of why they should hate Republicans. This explains why
the Republicans in recent days have steadily been giving in to

   DEECEE-CITY-HALL (Washington) _ The once seedy D.C. City Hall,
which was splendidly refurbished by the federal government and was
about to be taken over by the EPA, has been spared at the last
minute. The step is a symbol of the city's success at gaining
self-respect in its foundling relationship with the Feds. The city

and Pennsylvania Ave. next to the Reagan Building, in hard times,
five years ago. But with economic turnaround, the city pleaded not

sweeping through Congress, Vice President Al Gore uses a Veterans'

defense spending while using the issue to sharpen differences with
Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.

   TECH-TALENT (San Francisco) _ With a booming economy, technology
companies are desperate to find qualified technical staff. A severe
shortage of engineers who design hardware and software and create
Web pages has led companies and their recruiters to try all sorts
of tricks. Recruiters are known to send e-mail to all the engineers
at a company, offering to better their existing salaries. Indeed,
salaries in specific, high-demand areas, like Web site programming
and development, have gone up 18-20 percent in the last year, said
Eric Campbell of Docent Inc., which makes software for corporate
training. ``We wind up six months after we hire an engineer having
to fight off offers for that same engineer for more money,'' he
said. ``It's become a very predatory environment.'' By Matt
Richtel.

   FED-WAGES (Washington) _ Frank Ciotola, a restaurant owner in
Columbus, Ohio, is paying dishwashers $8 an hour nowadays, up from
$6 two years ago, and is spending more money placing help-wanted
ads than he is promoting the restaurant itself. The nation's low
and declining unemployment rate _ 4.1 percent in October, the
lowest in almost 30 years _ has been great news for Ciotola's 75
employees and workers in most industries all over the country. But
the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility that
upward pressure on wages could generate inflation, seem to be the
biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they
debate whether to raise interest rates for a third time this year
when they meet on Tuesday. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ The Japanese government announces a new
economic stimulus package of $171.4 billion in spending, government
loan programs and the expected expenditures of local governments,
almost twice the amount that was expected just two weeks ago. The
size of the plan is testament to the government's determination to

   FEDBUD-SCHOOLS _ WASHINGTON _ Under a deal struck by the

as well. But federal spending per poor student under the Title I
anti-poverty program will dip slightly, and Clinton's drive for tax
subsidies for school districts that need more classrooms is dead.

Clinton's only stop in a Palestinian venue during her trip to the

wanted to avoid. At the awarding of a grant for early-childhood
clinics, Suha Arafat, wife of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, and two health officials said what they really need
to make their people healthy is a Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital. Clinton, a likely candidate for a New York Senate
seat, sparked controversy a year ago when she said thought
Palestinian state would help bring peace. As she has considered the
Senate race and tried to appeal to New York voters, she has backed
Israeli control of Jerusalem. She sat with a tight grin as she
listened to the speeches Thursday. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 20.

   SAN JUAN CHAMULA, Mexico _ Not far from the jungles of Chiapas,
where Zapatista rebels are clamoring for Indian rights, a holy war
over God, alcohol and candles is tearing apart this fervent
indigenous community where St. John the Baptist reigns supreme. It
is a war in which ancient Maya traditions are pitted against New
World religion, and where the combatants speak the same Tzotzil
language and have lived and worked together for generations. But
today emotions run high, and bullets are flying. Dozens of
evangelical families have been cast out of town, thrown out, as it
were, by so-called ``traditional'' Tzotzils to live as refugees in
government centers until it's safe to go back home. That time
hasn't come. In San Juan Chamula, a municipality of 100,000 named
after St. John, the friction has degenerated into accusations of
murder and rape from both sides, and many of the charges are true.
Whereas they once settled local disputes with fists and machetes,
powerful weapons now are in their hands. And where local squabbles
once stayed in their villages, they now are national and
international issues. Here, where statistics are tenuous and hard
to come by, there is a toll from a war of attrition, a war of
intolerance and misunderstanding that dates back three decades _
some say centuries _ and has in the past two years resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chamula more people have been sacrificed than in any of the
massacres that arouse the political and social attention of
Mexico,'' read a recent joint statement issued by the two national
and state evangelical organizations representing some 5,000
Protestant churches in Mexico, a predominantly Catholic nation of
100 million. ``Thirty-five thousand Christian Evangelicals have
been expelled from this municipality, more than 100 have been
killed, thousands of families have been injured,'' the statement
continued. Government officials, sensitive to Indian customs in a
volatile region where the specter of guerrilla violence is present,
have been at a loss over how to resolve it. ``This is like Northern
Ireland,'' said Juan Gallo, a former Chamula county judge and now a
celebrated painter. ``There is never an accord.'' At the root is
the belief by indigenous Catholics that Protestants threaten their
long-held rituals and traditions, which critics say are encouraged
by caciques, or local bosses, to enslave the Indian population in a
web of alcohol addiction and economic dependency. But others say it
is a last stand of the Mayas in a conquest that began 500 years ago
with the arrival of the Spaniards and continues to this day.
``These are the survivors of the conquest, the last remaining
villages. If they lose that, they have lost the conquest. They have
finally succumbed,'' said Duncan Earle, an anthropologist at the
University of Texas at El Paso. Just seven miles northwest of the
colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, San Juan Chamula is an
autonomous county with its own laws and traditions. It embodies one
of the main demands of the Zapatista insurgents who emerged from
the highlands of the state of Chiapas in 1994 _ autonomy for
indigenous communities.
</P>
<P>
   With 113 such communities in Chamula, a verdant area dotted with
cornfields and mountains, confronts the dilemma of how to maintain
its traditional culture while honoring the religious freedom
Mexico's constitution assures. The struggle for the hearts of
Chamula's Indians begins with its venerated patron saint inside the
green and blue 18th-century St. John the Baptist Church in the
city's main plaza. The church is Chamula's ceremonial center, where
the faithful come to be baptized by an Orthodox priest and to be
healed by shamans in a cloud of smoky incense and white candles.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a typical Sunday church crowd. The celebration of
Orthodox Mass was only introduced a year ago, very cautiously, so
as not to offend long-held indigenous practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very, very careful that we don't overstep our
bounds,'' said Father Carmelo, the pastor of St. John's. ``They
were finally convinced about Mass when we told them it was God's
day, and all the Church has to be a fiesta.'' But no telling,
really, how the Mayas interpret the holy Catholic day. ``Long ago
they learned very craftily how to appropriate Catholic symbols _
the church, the processions, the ceremonies, carnival _ they simply
put them to Mayan tasks,'' Earle said. ``If they revealed
themselves to be following their religion, they might not have
survived,'' added Earle, who has studied the Chamulan Mayas since
the 1970s. ``As long as nobody learned their language or asked too
closely what they were doing, they were left alone.'' On Sunday
mornings, when the sun filters through the glass panes of the
church, throngs of Tzotzil Indians kneel on beds of pine needles
that cover the floor. They pray in soft murmurs for health, a good
harvest or to dispel a curse. Instead of going to Western doctors,
the ``traditionals'' come to the church to be cured, a long process
that involves paying witch doctors, or curanderos. It also requires
the lighting of many candles and the drinking of colas, which cause
burping that dispels evil and sickness. Other ceremonies include
drinking a potent local brew called posh, a firewater usually
swallowed to the point of silly inebriation during special
ceremonies. Finding Chamula's Indians sprawled out on the church
plaza, unconscious from too much posh, is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   It is these faithful who call themselves traditionals and who
are fighting those who see evil in their ways and want to change
them. ``Alcohol is their drug, just like peyote is to the
Huichols,'' Earle said of another Mexican indigenous group. ``It is
used in rituals of communication ... If somebody has one, everyone
has to have one. There is no such thing as recreational or casual
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Protestants charge nothing traditional is in the beliefs,
that their rituals are modern-day habits local bosses encourage to
keep them in the lucrative business of candles, fireworks, cola
drinks and posh. ``We respect the proper customs, customs that
foment human rights, not customs that violate and enslave human
beings,'' said Arturo Farelas, president of the National Fraternity
of Christian Evangelical Churches of Mexico. ``They encourage the
drinking of alcohol from an early age; they encourage polygamy. Our
message breaks with immorality and corruption,'' Farelas said.
Carmelo concedes economics is a factor in Chamula authorities'
resistance to evangelism. He also acknowledges that Evangelicals
are recruiting Chamula's Indians using a more intimate touch. ``I
have to recognize that these smaller churches are there during
difficult moments, after a death or an illness. They talk to them
and tell them about another way of life,'' the priest said.  &QL;

   Pascual Diaz Lopez is Chamula's mayor and the highest authority
around _ the person who counsels followers on everything from
family feuds to financial budgets. Diaz has a different take on the
Evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Evangelicals are an enemy of the people because of their
behavior. They are a thorn for the traditional people of Chamula,''
he said. ``They talk about their rights, but they don't talk about
their duty.'' Diaz said evangelism's advance threatens the Chamulan
way of life, and that Evangelicals don't contribute to the
community, participate in school activities or respect the
indigenous authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Maya ways, the mayor represents the will of his people.
Without that, he has no authority. ``The way they enforce their
social order has been through religions,'' Earle said. ``When
someone in their community rejects the traditional religion, they
are rejecting their political system. It's what we would call
sedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Farelas estimates that 45 percent of Chiapas' 1.5 million people
have become evangelical in the past few years.

   In a twist of fate, some evangelical families are becoming
sympathetic to the Zapatista rebels, who for the most part are
supported by the Catholic Archdiocese of San Cristobal, headed by
controversial bishop Samuel Ruiz, who retired last week. Ruiz has
exerted an enormous influence in the many conflicts of Chiapas and
is one of the most commanding religious figures Mexico has ever
had. Soon after being named to the post 1960, Ruiz took up the
cause of impoverished Indian peasants oppressed by wealthy
landowners. He became known as the ``bishop of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see him as Zapatista rebel sympathizer, including
many of Chamula's traditionals who belong to the governing party.
Ironically, the region's Evangelicals sympathize with the bishop
because he stands for human rights.

   NIRELAND-TALKS (Belfast) _ The Irish Republican Army has
submitted a long-awaited message to peace negotiators, raising

now in its last days, might succeed in moving forward the
stalemated Northern Ireland peace agreement. By Warren Hoge.

<P>
   POLITICS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ As the session trickles into
its final days, the Democrats are romping around highlighting every
piece of the unfinished agenda from gun control to the ``Patients'
Bill of Rights'' to prescription drugs. They've even unveiled a new
ad showing gravestones of issues. This all shows their feeling that
the longer Congress is here, the better it is for them, reminding
the public of why they should hate Republicans. This explains why
the Republicans in recent days have steadily been giving in to
Clinton. By Alison Mitchell. (1200 words).

<P>
   DEECEE-CITY-HALL (Washington) _ The once seedy D.C. City Hall,
which was splendidly refurbished by the federal government and was
about to be taken over by the EPA, has been spared at the last
minute. The step is a symbol of the city's success at gaining
self-respect in its foundling relationship with the Feds. The city
had handed over the century-old building and its prime site at 13th
and Pennsylvania Ave. next to the Reagan Building, in hard times,
five years ago. But with economic turnaround, the city pleaded not
to surrender such a piece of heritage. By Francis X. Clines.

sweeping through Congress, Vice President Al Gore uses a Veterans'
Day speech to argue that the United States must reassert its role
as an international leader. Gore also was calling for increased
defense spending while using the issue to sharpen differences with
Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.

<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TALENT (San Francisco) _ With a booming economy, technology
companies are desperate to find qualified technical staff. A severe
shortage of engineers who design hardware and software and create
Web pages has led companies and their recruiters to try all sorts
of tricks. Recruiters are known to send e-mail to all the engineers
at a company, offering to better their existing salaries. Indeed,
salaries in specific, high-demand areas, like Web site programming
and development, have gone up 18-20 percent in the last year, said
Eric Campbell of Docent Inc., which makes software for corporate
training. ``We wind up six months after we hire an engineer having
to fight off offers for that same engineer for more money,'' he
said. ``It's become a very predatory environment.'' By Matt
Richtel.

<P>
   FED-WAGES (Washington) _ Frank Ciotola, a restaurant owner in
Columbus, Ohio, is paying dishwashers $8 an hour nowadays, up from
$6 two years ago, and is spending more money placing help-wanted
ads than he is promoting the restaurant itself. The nation's low
and declining unemployment rate _ 4.1 percent in October, the
lowest in almost 30 years _ has been great news for Ciotola's 75
employees and workers in most industries all over the country. But
the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility that
upward pressure on wages could generate inflation, seem to be the
biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they
debate whether to raise interest rates for a third time this year
when they meet on Tuesday. By Richard W. Stevenson.

economic stimulus package of $171.4 billion in spending, government
loan programs and the expected expenditures of local governments,
almost twice the amount that was expected just two weeks ago. The
size of the plan is testament to the government's determination to
sustain the nascent economic recovery here as well as to the waning

   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Plans by a Texas entrepreneur
to assemble huge rockets here and launch commercial satellites from
a nearby island have set off fireworks on this laid-back vacation
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas banker Andrew Beal's high-flying plans were stuck on the
ground this week in a Virgin Islands territorial court, where
opponents argued against a controversial land swap between Beal and
the Virgin Islands government.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the site Beal wants for his headquarters and
rocket assembly plant is rich in pre-Colombian ruins, and fronts an
environmentally sensitive bay and offshore coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our environment is critical to our economic future,'' said
attorney Ned Jacobs, who represents 20 islanders opposed to the
land deal that was approved last month by the islands' government.
``Beal wants to turn an area of great cultural and natural resource
value into an industrial setting, and people think that's a
horrible idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge has already temporarily blocked the deal, and is
expected to rule soon on a permanent injunction. Wade Gates, a
spokesman for Beal Aerospace Technologies, said the company would
appeal any adverse court rulings. He also defended the plans for
the site in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't destroy anything,'' he said. ``We would actually
preserve what's there, clean it up and provide improvements. After
we build our headquarters, people would still have access to the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal also faces opposition from environmentalists on Anguilla, a
British territory that owns tiny Sombrero Island, where he hopes to
build his launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he must convince potential customers _ largely
satellite telecommunications companies _ that a start-up company
can compete in the risky, expensive launch business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in the industry feel Beal still has a lot to
prove,'' said Craig Covault, senior editor of Aviation Week and
Space Technology. ``As a start-up, they're very impressive in their
engineering team and approach, but whether they can overcome the
technical and cost challenges remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket plant would bring an economic boost to the troubled
U.S. Virgin Islands, where the tourism-dependent economy is mired
in the doldrums and the government has wracked up a $1 billion
debt. Beal says he would bring 150 permanent jobs to the island of
55,000, with a $75 million initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   On tiny Anguilla, with a population of barely 12,000, the 200
full-time jobs would also be a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very small financial base and any type of
diversification is favorable,'' said Hubert Hughes, chief minister
of Anguilla. ``It would be stable, prolonged employment. Right now
we have only a fragile, one-crop industry called tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal is already developing his rocket, designing the engines at
a facility in Frisco, which employs about 200 people north of
Dallas, and test-firing at an old military base near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in real estate and banking, Beal seems an
unlikely rocket man. But he's reportedly something of a math
genius, and has offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who can solve a
complex problem he wrote. So far, nobody has solved ``Beal's
Conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his foray into the space business four years ago,
attracted by the boom in satellite communications and a backlog in
launch schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep it as simple as possible, with few moving
parts, so that it is reliable and inexpensive,'' Gates said of the
proposed booster.
</P>
<P>
   Beal chose the Caribbean for his launch site because it is near
the equator, where rockets can reach orbit with less fuel because
the earth's rotation helps catapult them into space. He was
attracted to the U.S. Virgin Islands because of tax incentives, and
because laws governing the space business strictly limit what types
of technologies are allowed off U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   While Beal has approvals for the facilities from both island
governments, he must still win approvals from both the British and
U.S. governments before he can proceed. As a back up, Beal has been
negotiating with Guyana on the South American coast for the launch
facility.
</P>
<P>
   At 236 feet tall and with a payload capacity of 40,000 pounds,
Beal's rocket would be one of the biggest in an increasingly
crowded field. Since NASA scaled back commercial satellite launches
following the Challenger disaster in 1986, private launch companies
have sprung up in Europe, Russia, Japan, China and India.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, the two U.S.
companies already launching commercial payloads from Cape Canaveral
in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big business worldwide with lots of competition,''
said Covault. ``I think Beal is very serious and is aware of the
challenges, but there are a lot of hurdles to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In the islands, Beal has plenty of support among top government
officials and business leaders. But his opponents are determined
and vocal.
</P>
<P>
   On Anguilla, local preservationists and the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds _ which boasts Queen Elizabeth among its
patrons _ say the launch pad would harm birds and lizards on the
tiny island. The only person living on Sombrero _ 38 miles from
Anguilla _ is a lighthouse keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sombrero is one of the more important sites in all of the
Caribbean for nesting seabirds,'' said the Royal Society's Jim
Stevenson. ``So many other islands have been built over that it
makes an island like this all that much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the company has conducted extensive environmental
studies on Sombrero, and believes the impact would be minimal. The
launch pad would use only about 10 percent of the island's 95
acres, and the company would help create nature preserves on other
nearby islands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Croix, opponents have circulated petitions and held
marches. The issue has dominated the local press, with radio talk
shows buzzing over the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the problem is that some people feel Beal is
arrogant and condescending,'' said talk show host Maria Heywood.
``People here are politically astute. They feel that giving away
this property for a few jobs isn't a fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jacobs said his group would drop their opposition if
Beal agrees to move to an existing industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates said the company feels it would just face new
opposition if it agreed to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``These debates about progress and preservation were going on
long before Beal arrived,'' he said. ``We're offering the kinds of
jobs and investment that will allow these people's children to stay
on the islands. Unfortunately, you have a small number of people
who appear to oppose almost anything.''

   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Plans by a Texas entrepreneur
to assemble huge rockets here and launch commercial satellites from
a nearby island have set off fireworks on this laid-back vacation
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas banker Andrew Beal's high-flying plans were stuck on the
ground this week in a Virgin Islands territorial court, where
opponents argued against a controversial land swap between Beal and
the Virgin Islands government.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the site Beal wants for his headquarters and
rocket assembly plant is rich in pre-Colombian ruins, and fronts an
environmentally sensitive bay and offshore coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our environment is critical to our economic future,'' said
attorney Ned Jacobs, who represents 20 islanders opposed to the
land deal that was approved last month by the islands' government.
``Beal wants to turn an area of great cultural and natural resource
value into an industrial setting, and people think that's a
horrible idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge has already temporarily blocked the deal, and is
expected to rule soon on a permanent injunction. Wade Gates, a
spokesman for Beal Aerospace Technologies, said the company would
appeal any adverse court rulings. He also defended the plans for
the site in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't destroy anything,'' he said. ``We would actually
preserve what's there, clean it up and provide improvements. After
we build our headquarters, people would still have access to the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal also faces opposition from environmentalists on Anguilla, a
British territory that owns tiny Sombrero Island, where he hopes to
build his launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he must convince potential customers _ largely
satellite telecommunications companies _ that a start-up company
can compete in the risky, expensive launch business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in the industry feel Beal still has a lot to
prove,'' said Craig Covault, senior editor of Aviation Week and
Space Technology. ``As a start-up, they're very impressive in their
engineering team and approach, but whether they can overcome the
technical and cost challenges remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket plant would bring an economic boost to the troubled
U.S. Virgin Islands, where the tourism-dependent economy is mired
in the doldrums and the government has wracked up a $1 billion
debt. Beal says he would bring 150 permanent jobs to the island of
55,000, with a $75 million initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   On tiny Anguilla, with a population of barely 12,000, the 200
full-time jobs would also be a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very small financial base and any type of
diversification is favorable,'' said Hubert Hughes, chief minister
of Anguilla. ``It would be stable, prolonged employment. Right now
we have only a fragile, one-crop industry called tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal is already developing his rocket, designing the engines at
a facility in Frisco, which employs about 200 people north of
Dallas, and test-firing at an old military base near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in real estate and banking, Beal seems an
unlikely rocket man. But he's reportedly something of a math
genius, and has offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who can solve a
complex problem he wrote. So far, nobody has solved ``Beal's
Conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his foray into the space business four years ago,
attracted by the boom in satellite communications and a backlog in
launch schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep it as simple as possible, with few moving
parts, so that it is reliable and inexpensive,'' Gates said of the
proposed booster.
</P>
<P>
   Beal chose the Caribbean for his launch site because it is near
the equator, where rockets can reach orbit with less fuel because
the earth's rotation helps catapult them into space. He was
attracted to the U.S. Virgin Islands because of tax incentives, and
because laws governing the space business strictly limit what types
of technologies are allowed off U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   While Beal has approvals for the facilities from both island
governments, he must still win approvals from both the British and
U.S. governments before he can proceed. As a back up, Beal has been
negotiating with Guyana on the South American coast for the launch
facility.
</P>
<P>
   At 236 feet tall and with a payload capacity of 40,000 pounds,
Beal's rocket would be one of the biggest in an increasingly
crowded field. Since NASA scaled back commercial satellite launches
following the Challenger disaster in 1986, private launch companies
have sprung up in Europe, Russia, Japan, China and India.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, the two U.S.
companies already launching commercial payloads from Cape Canaveral
in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big business worldwide with lots of competition,''
said Covault. ``I think Beal is very serious and is aware of the
challenges, but there are a lot of hurdles to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In the islands, Beal has plenty of support among top government
officials and business leaders. But his opponents are determined
and vocal.
</P>
<P>
   On Anguilla, local preservationists and the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds _ which boasts Queen Elizabeth among its
patrons _ say the launch pad would harm birds and lizards on the
tiny island. The only person living on Sombrero _ 38 miles from
Anguilla _ is a lighthouse keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sombrero is one of the more important sites in all of the
Caribbean for nesting seabirds,'' said the Royal Society's Jim
Stevenson. ``So many other islands have been built over that it
makes an island like this all that much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the company has conducted extensive environmental
studies on Sombrero, and believes the impact would be minimal. The
launch pad would use only about 10 percent of the island's 95
acres, and the company would help create nature preserves on other
nearby islands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Croix, opponents have circulated petitions and held
marches. The issue has dominated the local press, with radio talk
shows buzzing over the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the problem is that some people feel Beal is
arrogant and condescending,'' said talk show host Maria Heywood.
``People here are politically astute. They feel that giving away
this property for a few jobs isn't a fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jacobs said his group would drop their opposition if
Beal agrees to move to an existing industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates said the company feels it would just face new
opposition if it agreed to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``These debates about progress and preservation were going on
long before Beal arrived,'' he said. ``We're offering the kinds of
jobs and investment that will allow these people's children to stay
on the islands. Unfortunately, you have a small number of people
who appear to oppose almost anything.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Loopy knits, crocheted fringe, multicolor weaves,
and silky-soft pashmina.
</P>
<P>
   They're the newest purls of wisdom on the fashion front,
signaling a global-warming trend for knitwear. And not just
sweaters, but all those '70s favorites such as ponchos, capes,
shawls, stoles and ski caps.
</P>
<P>
   So ignore those millennium soothsayers who shout the praises of
futuristic fabrics that won't snag, tear or self-destruct, and
indulge in fashion's softer side, even if it is a little itchy.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are ready with numerous knits, from Christian
Lacroix's pricey multicolor knit dresses to Target's little acrylic
knit ski caps. However, the highest-profile styles of the season
are Max Azria of BCBG's sleeveless turtleneck sweater knitted with
plump yarn that's fattening even on a skinny model; Bette Paige's
body-conscious, feather-trimmed separates; and Donna Karan's
gossamer-light mohair sweater that is so much like a spider web
you'll need a Lycra top underneath for modesty's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the poncho, that flirty, impractical little coverup
that can be knitted, crocheted or worn long, as in Mondi's hooded-
blanket style. Even the alpine-inspired ski sweater with a
turtleneck by Ralph Lauren and Liz Claiborne is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the pashmina that packs the most panache in the world
of clicking needles.
</P>
<P>
   The word pashmina has become synonymous with a silky fringed
stole worn by umpteen celebs from Uma Thurman to Julia Roberts, but
actually it refers to the silky hairs on the underside of a certain
geographically located goat (think Indian and Pakistan), explains
Edith Eig, who teaches men and women how to knit the stoles at her
Studio City store called La Knitterie Parisienne.
</P>
<P>
   The French-born knitting maven has run her little shop for more
than 25 years, catering to the whims of crafty types. And this
year, the shop is jammin'.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are coming back to the old-fashioned quilting
bee, where people sit around and talk ... perhaps because families
have become fragmented over the past century,'' Eig said. ``And
besides, it's therapeutic, a bit like yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clients? ``They're teen-agers, young moms, movie stars and
fashion designers. Some will come in saying they want to learn how
to make a pashmina (stole), but it's really difficult since it
requires tiny needles and is very time consuming,'' says Eig.
</P>
<P>
   What's easy for beginners, she says, are ponchos and caps. But
in the end, it's determination that helps a knitter finish.
</P>
<P>
   Says Eig, ``I had a woman who was inspired because she wanted
that new bulky sweater with turned-back cuffs by Marc Jacobs but
didn't want to spend $1,500. So she made her own for less than
$350.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a young man who said he needed to learn how
to knit in a few hours so he could get a part in a new Banana
Republic commercial. And he did, thanks to Eig.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrity members of her unofficial knitting club include
Bob Mackie and his design team, and performers Shari Belafonte,
Brett Butler, Genie Francis, Laurie Metcalf and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's not one of Eig's students, Lily Mariye, who plays
Nurse Lily on TV's ``ER,'' is also a fan of knitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knitting is a great way to zone out and yet not take away from
what you need to focus on,'' says Mariye, who admits she originally
took up the hobby to help herself quit smoking, but found it was a
nice pastime while sitting for hours on the set of the television
show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mariye, ``I think the hand-crafted fashion trend is
cool, especially since I didn't grow up with it like baby boomers
did. My all-time favorite is a blue sweater, the first thing I
knitted all by myself ... without my mother's help. And I think
that's part of the popularity of the trend ... the idea that
someone compliments you not only for the style but the idea and the
workmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Although lots of men have started knitting since Rosie Greer
made it politically correct a few years ago, Mariye says she hasn't
been able to teach her husband, jazz saxophonist Boney James, the
fine art of knitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too impatient. He'd rather just go to the store and buy
one,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For those like him, 'tis the season. &QL;

BOOK PAYS TRIBUTE TO WOMEN VETERANS

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vickie Lewis' ``Side-By-Side: A Photographic History of American
Women in War'' (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, $29.95) offers a memorable
collection of paintings and pictures of American women at war _
from the time of the Revolution to the end of 1998, when Lt. Kendra
Williams became the first female fighter pilot to drop bombs on an
enemy in Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The book starts with a letter from Abigail Adams _ ``We posses a
spirit that will not be conquered. If our men are all drawn off and
we should be attacked, you would find a race of Amazons in
America.'' It ends with the words, ``By the end of the 1990s, it
was no longer a question of whether women could serve on the
battlefield, it was a question of whether they should. Although
this question is still being debated, what cannot be questioned are
the real experiences, sacrifices and contributions of the women who
have served.''
</P>
<P>
   In between the beginning and end of ``Side-By-Side'' is an
impressive collection of pictures of women loading and firing
artillery, nursing the wounded, working on tanks and planes,
marching under the Arc de Triomphe, jumping from helicopters and
fighting in a desert war.
</P>
<P>
   There is a picture of Mary Tepe, who crawled from one wounded
man to another to offer water from her canteen during the Battle of
Chancellorsville in the Civil War; a picture of nurses aboard the
USS Relief, a hospital ship off Cuba during the Spanish-American
War; and a photo of nurses tending the eyes of gas victims during
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II journal of Lillian Jan Dial reads, ``Nurses,
doctors and corpsmen are nearly dead with weariness and ill health
... in our double wards of 50 beds _ at times as high as eight are
lying dead, others in desperate condition and the aisle full of
stretchers to be admitted _ oh, I get so tense! I would to heaven
there were three of me!''
</P>
<P>
   The pictures from World War II are riveting _ beautiful, really
_ starting with a crew of women pilots (WASPs) walking away from a
B-17 on the tarmac. More than 1,000 women joined the WASPs, flying
60 million miles during the war, and 38 were killed. The war
started with 8,700 women serving as nurses in the Army and Navy. By
the end there were more than 80,000. At the peak of the war, 17,000
were serving overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Army Corps wound up with the most recruits during
Worl War II, including 6,520 African-Americans. There is a picture
of a black WAC unit in France in 1945, coupled with the words of
Janice Stovall Taylor: ``If we had fouled up, it would have been a
black mark against black women and women in general, but we didn't
foul up. We did our job.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some incredible photos in this section, from WACs
arriving in France, their leggings and uniforms spiffy, boots
spit-shined, to a band of nurses who survived the crash of a C-47
in Italy by walking 800 miles through enemy-held country. There are
also shots of women teaching Marines about the 50-caliber machine
gun, playing softball in the ruins of Verdun and being released
after three years in a Luzon prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   WAC Beatrice Hood Stroup is quoted as saying, ``It wasn't just
my brother's country, or my husband's country, it was my country as
well. And so this war wasn't just their war, it was my war, and I
needed to serve in it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are photos from Korea and Vietnam, where nurse Christine
McKinley Schneider served. ``I remember cutting off all his clothes
and the horror of taking one of his boots off and his foot still
being in the boot,'' she writes. ``He begged me not to leave. ...
`I promise I'll be right back.' I was right back, and he had died.
... And I never forgot that; I never again left anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The last section of ``Side-By- Side'' deals with women coming
closer and closer to combat, in Grenada, Panama and the Middle
East. There's a picture of an American nurse tending an Iraqi
soldier on a torn-up highway, a picture of a female military police
officer washing her hair as men shave on the other side of the
wall, and a picture of the funeral service for Sgt. Cheryl
LaBeau-O'Brien, who was killed in the crash of a Black Hawk
helicopter near the Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
   The last picture in ``Side-By-Side'' is the American flag being
held above the coffin of Maj. Marie T. Rossi, who was killed when
the Chinook helicopter she was piloting crashed in 1991. It is a
fitting photo to end the book, a reminder of the sacrifices
American women have made from the very first stirrings of this
country's independence to the modern-day military demands being
made upon, and being taken in stride, by women.

</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM)40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taketoshi Naito,
</P>
<P>
   Arata and Erika Oda.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda's quietly powerful look at
life, seen from the viewpoint of the dead. Newly deceased making
the jump to heaven are allowed to take only one memory. The film
includes non-actors recalling moments of their lives on-camera: A
listless day in an autumnal park. A secret tryst in a hotel room.
It's a very simple movie with a surprisingly complex emotional
undertow. (SM)1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere But Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short list come Academy
Awards time for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar
mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy, indomitable mom, brings
her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood to become a star. The
plot is negligible, but the performances are the point. (ERG) 1
hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who loses
his girl, Anne (Renee Zellweger), then finds he'll inherit $100
million if he marries within 24 hours. A clumsy remake of Buster
Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,'' it retains the
original's surreal image of thousands of potential brides chasing
the groom-to-be. (SM)1 hour, 41 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs,
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Meshell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   This intense, rawly unsettling film is based on the true story
of Teena Brandon, a 21-year-old woman who fiercely believed she was
a man. She cut her hair short, reversed her name and started
hanging out with some hard-drinking rednecks in rural Nebraska. The
movie, a bit unrelenting, a bit too low-budget
rough-around-the-edges, is still a remarkable achievement, and
Hilary Swank gives a stunning performance. (ERG) 1 hour, 54
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' R (profanity, violence and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese offers a savage, sorrowing look at a few days in
the life of a paramedic whose beat is Hell's Kitchen. As played by
Nicolas Cage, he's alcoholic, burnt-out and haunted by the spirits
of those he couldn't save. A kind-of romance with Patricia Arquette
doesn't work, but there's excellent work by John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore as Cage's various partners. (ERG) 2 hours,
1 minute. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' PG-13 (violence, thematic material,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith,
</P>
<P>
   David Morse and Lucas Black.
</P>
<P>
   An odd mix of civil rights drama and Southern Gothic comedy that
goes down just fine. The movie splits time between the wild
adventures of Lucille (Melanie Griffith), who breaks out of a small
Alabama town and heads west, and a graver story back home. Griffith
does her best work since ``Working Girl.'' Antonio Banderas'
direction throws off some sparks, even if it doesn't fully catch
fire. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino)2 hours, 5 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM)44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' R (violent anti-social behavior,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio release, the
Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it
as liking it. Either reaction is justifiable. The film, about a
pack of guys beating each other to bloody pulps, is violent,
nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor. But it's still
one of those rare films that creates an electrifying alternate
universe onscreen. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon get ``Happy.'' This sunny crowd-pleaser stars Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn as escaped convicts who hide out in a small
town by posing as a gay couple who stage beauty pageants for little
girls. A last-minute plot device is a bad idea, but by then the
picture has built up so much good will you can't help but go along.
The cast is excellent, especially William H. Macy as the sheriff.
(ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``House on Haunted Hill'' R (violence, gore, sexual images,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen and Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   A redo of the 1958 Vincent Price spookfest, it's a loud assault
on the senses and a (literal) bloody mess. But as a
meat-and-potatoes (or guts-and-eyeballs) scare machine, it has its
moments. Geoffrey Rush invites five strangers to spend the night in
a haunted house to win $1 million each. Then the gore begins. (SM)
1 hour, 55 minutes C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   More smoke than fire in this reality-based film about what
happened when former tobacco consultant Jeffrey Wigand (Russell
Crowe) agreed to tell his story on ``60 Minutes'' at the behest of
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Bergman gets the star
treatment (one senses a certain pandering to Pacino), but Wigand's
predicament is more riveting, with Crowe in an Oscar-worthy
performance. (ERG)2 hours, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Light It Up'' R (violent content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Usher Raymond,
</P>
<P>
   Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and Vanessa L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They should have burned the script. Atlanta's Usher Raymond
leads students from a horribly overcrowded high school in taking a
cop hostage and demanding a good education. Every moment of painful
injustice is rendered in slo-mo. Every cry of anguish
ever-so-slowly erupts from some kid's wrenched guts. It's about as
soapy a movie as you're likely to see. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 43
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles,
a rape, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
swordplay slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep
</P>
<P>
   and Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The Meryl Streep Show _ and what a show it is. Streep and
director Wes Craven (``Scream,'') have delivered a rarity: an
inspirational movie that is actually inspirational. The film
follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant kids,
confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in her
battle to teach violin to inner-city kids. It's a glorified TV
movie, but it's got Streep and that's all it needs. (ERG)2 hours, 3
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and manmade wonders. There is
ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and Redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Place
</P>
<P>
   Called Chiapas'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   An up-close look at a messy political situation. This earnest
and disturbing documentary is Canadian filmmaker Nettie Wild's
attempt to document the repercussions of the North American Free
Trade Agreement on the poorest of Mexico's poor: the Mayan Indians.
Her camera captures the chaos, but ultimately can't illuminate it.
(SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. B-

<P>
   ``Pokemon:
</P>
<P>
   The First Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino)1
hour, 29 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. Essentially,
it's a ``once upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature
and civilization. Boldly innovative (often savagely so) yet eerily
innocent, it's the sort of thing you simply have to see for
yourself. (ERG)2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A meandering mystery/drama/romance that never hits the right
groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin Scott Thomas a
congresswoman who discover their spouses, both killed in a plane
crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing romance never taps
beneath the surface. (SM)2 hours, 11 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino)51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his 1966 John Deere riding mower more than
300 miles to reconcile with his estranged brother (Harry Dean
Stanton). The movie is a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. A perfect
Thanksgiving movie. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite.
As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher,
Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear Shannon loves this character, but
she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness, whether
talking baby talk to her breasts, or fantasizing that a tree is her
lover. (SM)1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's
stolen Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again. (Jill
Vejnoska)41 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Two terrific performances enliven film about relationships and
role reversal
 &HT;    Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anywhere but Here'' is a nice enough movie. But it's a monster
of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon and Natalie
Portman deserve to make the short list in February for breathing
fresh air into an all-too-familiar mother-daughter act.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon plays brassy, indom-
</P>
<P>
   itable Adele August _ a sort of 1990s conflation of Auntie Mame
and Mama Rose. Adele has decided that Wisconsin isn't where her
14-year-old daughter, Ann (Portman), belongs. (Subtext: It's not
where Adele thinks she belongs.) So she buys a used gold Mercedes,
packs up her daughter, waves bye-bye to her second husband and
heads for Hollywood, where she's determined Ann will become a star.
</P>
<P>
   When Ann has the temerity to demur, Adele declares, with the
same breezy confidence she brings to lip-syncing to the Beach Boys:
``I've always known what's best for you, because I'm your mother
and that's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to live in Beverly Hills takes a job that pays a
little better. So the pair moves through a series of dumpy
apartments (shades of ``Slums of Beverly Hills'') as Ann slowly
realizes that the job of ``mother'' is really hers.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's plot is negligible _ mostly a series of squabbles,
confrontations and reconciliations as these two terrific actors
fearlessly explore the whole mother-daughter deal. But after a
point, their performances become the point. Sarandon's
self-centered obliviousness and manic-depressive ditsiness is a
potent portrait of perkiness at the end of its rope. Meanwhile,
Portman, who Sarandon insisted play this role, matches her more
experienced co-star scene for scene. We've seen her character
before, too _ the long-suffering daughter stuck with a
responsibility she doesn't seek. But Portman brings a clarity to
the part. It's a savvy balance of smart-mouthed teenager and
vulnerable little girl lost. In a strange way, she takes care of
us, the audience, as surely as Ann takes care of Adele.
</P>
<P>
   One final nod to director Wayne Wang, who gave us one of
cinema's great mother-daughter movies, ``The Joy Luck Club.''
Typically, the Sarandon role is played by someone who's, well, not
traditionally attractive. Such as Bette Midler or Cher. Casting the
ever-seductive Sarandon, even when she's doing her outrageous bit,
shows insight and even a kind of courage. Underneath its
traditional trappings, ``Anywhere but Here'' has more bite than
you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Directed by Wayne
Wang. Rated PG-13 for sex-related material. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A negligible plot saved by star talent.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar buzz: It's a twofer in acting-awards potential: Sarandon
for best actress, Portman for best supporting actress.

 &HT;    Let us pray for a few more laughs
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to ``Dogma,'' a controversial religious
spoof from the creator of the rollicking 1994 anti-establishment
comedy ``Clerks.'' It sure knows how to deliver a sermon in as dull
a manner as you'll ever hear from any pulpit in the land.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio, Miramax (the independent studio Lions Gate picked
it up).
</P>
<P>
   While the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion,
it does so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness that you
have to wonder what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' is packed with stars: Ben Affleck and gum-smacking
Matt Damon as renegade fallen angels; Alan Rickman as a sour
angelic messenger; bikini-clad Salma Hayak as a muse; Chris Rock as
a 14th apostle; and Linda Fiorentino as an abortion clinic worker
and ``chosen'' human. Janeane Garofolo shows up. So does George
Carlin. Not to mention a trio of in-line-skating teenage hellions
wielding killer hockey sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, the
film's writer-director), a millennial Bill and Ted. They always
show up in Smith's movies, be it ``Clerks,'' ``Chasing Amy'' or
``Mall Rats.''
</P>
<P>
   As the characters pile on, ``Dogma'' becomes a convoluted tale
bloated with endless expositions, often mind-numbing logic and
plenty of just plain old blah blah blah. Thankfully, sometimes it's
also funny.
</P>
<P>
   The movie kicks off with a wicked charge. Carlin, in full
Catholic regalia, stands in front of a New Jersey church espousing
a newfangled PR campaign to counter the bleak image instilled by
your standard-issue crucifix. It's ``Catholicism Wow!'' and
includes the unveiling of the ``Buddy Christ,'' a peppy image of a
smiling, winking Jesus, his right thumb perkily pointed up.
``Doesn't it pop?'' Carlin cracks.
</P>
<P>
   As banished angels, Affleck and Damon concoct a way to re-enter
heaven. But it comes with a price. Like snuffing out life as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other characters team up to stop them. Which leads
to a lot of sex jokes, scatalogical gross-outs, bashings of teendom
filmmaker John Hughes (``Sixteen Candles,'' ``The Breakfast
Club''), a few amusing revelations about organized religion and
some blunt verbal assaults on Catholicism. (Characters flatly
remind the audience of the church's inaction on both slavery and
the Holocaust.)
</P>
<P>
   Affleck and Damon do the best job of delivering Smith's wordy
material; they're clearly having fun. And when the payoff works _
as when Damon's angel talks a nun out of her calling _ ``Dogma'' is
sinfully funny. But like the worst seasons of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' most of the film's setups go nowhere or just fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Fiorentino's character becomes weirdly apropos.
``I'm confused,'' she says after another character's umpteenth
allocution. ``I can't take much more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino. Written
and directed by Kevin Smith. Rated R for strong profanity,
including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug
content.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours,
</P>
<P>
   5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Holy smoke.

 &HT;    Visually deft Joan of Arc story hobbled by an uncertain vision
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 600 years after she lived her fleeting but ferocious life
and died a scorching martyr's death, Joan of Arc remains an enigma,
catnip to filmmakers. Luc Besson's ``The Messenger: The Story of
Joan of Arc'' recasts the warrior maiden as an action hero embedded
in a flashy (but very 1990s) epic. She's the kind of fighter who
can yank out an arrow buried deep in her breast, then take a nice
nap.
</P>
<P>
   When Joan is leading her troops to victory against the British,
the movie has considerable visual oomph. But when the swordplay
slows and the characters talk, you realize that it doesn't know
what to make of this Maid of Orleans, or her story's mixture of
spiritual fervor, military maneuvers and political cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Besson's script, written with Andrew Birkin, can't decide
whether Joan (here called Jeanne, her French name) was a mystic
hard-wired to God, a neurotic teenager or a powermonger out for her
own glory. So we get a little of each. ``Messenger'' delivers a
confusing mytho-theology that hedges its bets between religious
vision and movie-of-the-week psychological motivation. The movie
invents the brutal rape and murder of Jeanne's beloved sister by a
soldier in order to underscore the girl's hatred of the British.
With typical lack of subtlety, young Jeanne screams, ``I just want
the British to burn in hell forever!''
</P>
<P>
   But we meet young Jeanne (Jane Valentine) before this, romping
through the countryside, high on her love of God. Lying dazed in a
field, she envisions blazing lights and figures in the sky, and a
silver sword appears like a seeming miracle in the grass beside
her.
</P>
<P>
   We skip ahead to Jeanne's famous confrontation with the dauphin,
Charles VII (John Malkovich) at Chinon. Picking him out in his
layman disguise in a crowded room, Jeanne (now played by Besson's
ex, Milla Jovovich) demands an army to repel the British invaders
and vows to see him crowned. The best of the movie follows: scenes
of battleand surprise reversals of fortune as Jeanne proves
herself up to her hype. We get your usual she's-just-a-girl
tensions, as she seizes command from the dauphin's half brother
Dunois (Tcheky Karyo), whose slow-burn bursts of exasperation give
the film some of its comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   The battle scenes revel in hacked-off heads and limbs, gougings
of all kinds, baths of boiling oil. But there's a point to the
carnage: the puzzle of a supposedly loving God who would instruct
Jeanne to unleash such bloodshed in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The movie returns often to this contradiction, trying to
reconcile the many faces of Jeanne. On the one hand, it suggests
that she was just an ignorant channeling her energies and anger
into a holy war that just happened to succeed. But the movie also
lets us see her psychedelic trances (which recall the peyote trips
from ``Altered States''), letting us believe, if we like, that she
was truly divinely inspired. While the filmmakers might claim that
their choices are an expression of Jeanne's historical ambiguity,
their refusal to take a point of view and stick to it ultimately
feels cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messenger'' slows to a fatal crawl in its last hour, when
Jeanne is betrayed, sold to the English and tried for heresy. These
scenes draw on the actual trial records, which let us get a sense
of the canny, disarming mind of the real Jeanne. But these bits are
interspersed with mystical appearances by a black-hooded Dustin
Hoffman, playing a character called the Conscience, who questions
Jeanne's motives in her jail cell. Vanishing into thin air, or
sliding into frame for scruffy close-ups, Hoffman seems like a
refugee from a Bergman film; he verges on becoming a pretentious
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the movie is full of intentional humor, most of it
provided by the royals. Malkovich fusses about the inadequacies of
his coronation outfit like a spoiled brat, and Faye Dunaway, as his
scheming mother-in-law, turns in a wry, grande dame performance.
(The cast of British, French and American actors sometimes gives
the film an uneasy Tower of Babel mixture of accents.)
</P>
<P>
   While the lanky, short-cropped Jovovich gives ``Boys Don't Cry''
star Hilary Swank some competition in the androgyny department, her
acting chops aren't up to the job. Especially in a film that asks
for a rich, ambiguous interpretation of its elusive heroine, the
model-turned-actress gives a feverish but surface performance. When
she shrieks, ``I am the drum on which God is beating out his
message,'' she seems more like a candidate for Prozac than a
national heroine. Like the movie she's in, her Jeanne is, pardon
the term, half-baked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman.
Rated R for graphic battle scenes, a rape and some language. At
metro theaters. 2 hours, 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A visually compelling epic that can't decide
whether its heroine is a saint or a psycho.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar buzz: Best bet is the technical nominations: costumes,
cinematography, production design.

STOLEN PAINTINGS TO BE RETURNED TO SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three 17th-century Dutch paintings that vanished
in a brazen Christmas Eve theft at the M.H. de Young Memorial
Museum 21 years ago have turned up at a New York auction house,
partially closing a chapter on one of the great mysteries to hit
the San Francisco art world.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, including one whose original status as a
Rembrandt is in some doubt, were left anonymously in a box last
week at the William Doyle Galleries in New York City, along with a
note explaining that they were stolen from the de Young museum in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Parker III, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco, announced the remarkable find Wednesday night, a day
after a museum curator flew to New York to confirm that the
paintings were in fact three of the four works that were stolen by
thieves who broke into the museum by dropping through a skylight.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth painting, Willem van de Velde's ``Harbor Scene,'' is
still missing, and the thieves have never been caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am somewhat relieved because it's been an embarrassing event
in the de Young's history,'' Parker said. But, he noted, all three
paintings were damaged significantly and are likely not worth their
original value, a combined $1.075 million.
</P>
<P>
   The de Young burglary shocked the art world not just because it
was the biggest theft in the history of the city's Fine Arts
Museums, but also because of the way it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves dropped from the skylight, removed the paintings and
escaped the same way, using a valuable 18th-century walnut chest as
a stepladder. The police believe the theft occurred sometime after
the museum closed. No alarms sounded and two guards in the museum
at the time noticed nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Harbor Scene,'' the thieves took Anthonie de
Lorme's ``Interior of the Church of Saint Lawrence, Rotterdam,''
Aert van der Neer's ``River Scene at Night,'' and ``Portrait of a
Rabbi,'' considered at the time a jewel of the city's art
collection because Rembrandt was thought to have painted it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $50,000 reward for the return of the art, the
whereabouts of the paintings remained a mystery until Nov. 2, when
they turned up in a box near the front desk of the New York auction
house, said Louis Webre, vice president for marketing at William
Doyle Galleries. At the time, the gallery was holding its weekly
open house for members of the public who wanted their art
appraised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic was enormous in the galleria,'' Webre said. ``No
one noticed that a box was dropped off until several hours later
when we got an anonymous phone call saying that there's a box in
front of you and it contains stolen paintings,'' Webre said.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials immediately called the police to check whether
the package was a bomb, Webre said. The police, opening the
package, discovered the stolen paintings. The investigation was
turned over to the FBI, which took possession of the artworks.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will return the paintings to the San Francisco museum
next week, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Museum curators plan to scrutinize ``Portrait of a Rabbi'' to
determine whether it is actually Rembrandt's work. At the time of
the theft, the painting was displayed as a Rembrandt and was valued
at about $1 million, but soon afterward doubts about it began
springing up. Leading Rembrandt scholars now question the
authenticity and suggest it may have been the product of one of the
artist's students, or even a mere copy of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rembrandt may not be as advertised,'' Parker acknowledged
Wednesday. ``This may not be the great art recovery of the century.
I think the doubt really came up at the time of the theft and
after.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was stolen, the portrait _ a 31-inch-by-251/2-inch oil
painting donated to the museum in 1947 _ was visibly damaged by an
apparent attempt to clean the surface, Parker said. An undamaged
Rembrandt painting could be worth upward of $20 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``River Scene at Night'' was the most severely damaged of the
three recovered paintings, having been split into three pieces.
``Interior of the Church of Saint Lawrence, Rotterdam,'' like
``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' suffered cleaning damage, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said museum officials will attempt to repair and restore the
works so that they can once again be put on public display.

FAKE DOCUMENTARIANS WITH A CLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Must be the year for fake documentaries. A few months after
``The Blair Witch Project'' comes ``Where's Marlowe?,'' a film
about private eyes. The difference is, this one's a comedy (note to
``Blair Witch'' detractors: An ``intentional'' comedy), and it has
no pretense about trying to seem real.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. (John Livingston) and Wilt (Mos Def) are a couple of
second-rate documentarians who decide to follow their magnum opus _
a three-hour film about New York's water system _ with a study of a
private investigator. Their subject: third-rate gumshoe Joe Boone
(played with self-deprecating humor by Miguel Ferrer), who's
flattered by the attention, even though his partner Murphy (John
Slattery) doesn't want anything to do with the film.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame Murph _ these P.I.'s attract two-bit cases,
such as a man who wants to prove that his dog didn't commit
indiscretions on a neighbor's lawn. But then Boone is hired to get
the goods on a cheating spouse, and in true detective-movie
tradition, there's more to the case than meets the eye. ``Where's
Marlowe?'' takes too long to get where it's going, and lingers too
long once it gets there, but at least it has a lot of amusing and
surprising stops along the way. And ``real'' director Daniel Pyne
(who wrote ``Doc Hollywood) and his co-writer John Mankiewicz
(''Red Heat'') pull off a neat trick: They convince you that the
filmmakers within the film have actually done much of the work.
That's more than you can say for ``Blair Witch.''

 &HT;    A royally fun foray into Magic Kingdom
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov.14.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ The mission: Plunge into the briar patch at Splash
Mountain, travel at the speed of light on Star Tours, elude
dangerous dinosaurs on Countdown to Extinction and course through
blood veins to attack a splinter in Body Wars.
</P>
<P>
   The place: Disney World's four major theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge: Do it all in only 3 1/2 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a job for one small-town Kentucky boy a couple of
weeks shy of 9 and his 30-something-with-no-kids aunt who had a
little unfinished business with the Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I had gone to Disney World as a child, only to leave after a
half day because my grandmother fell ill. That had been about
enough time to walk through Cinderella's castle and float through
It's a Small World. I wanted more. And I needed a partner.
</P>
<P>
   My nephew, Ramsey Walker, seemed the perfect accomplice. He had
never been to Disney World. So just two weeks before his ninth
birthday, we met in Nashville and flew to Orlando together to do
what many said couldn't be done _ see all four Disney parks in a
long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   We did it. In fact, we did more than we could possibly have
imagined as a result of two things: good planning and a major
stroke of luck.
</P>
<P>
   The luck? There were no lines. Really. We were there in early
October and the crowds were unusually light even for the
off-season. Only twice did we wait as long as 20 minutes. Many
times, we didn't wait at all.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't dumb luck; it was genius planning. I wanted to
avoid the summertime heat and the hellish waits those who'd gone
before had described.
</P>
<P>
   Fall was suggested in a couple of guidebooks I consulted. It's a
no-brainer _ school is in session. Ramsey is a good student who has
no problem keeping pace. Still, I didn't want him to miss more than
two days, so we arrived late Thursday night and departed late
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After doing research, it was clear that for a short stay, a
Disney resort would be a timesaver. They are close to the parks;
provide free, efficient transportation (buses, boats, monorail);
and allow guests to purchase ``length of stay passes,'' which give
access to all parks and allow park-hopping in a single day. Resort
gift shops and food courts also save time.
</P>
<P>
   And among the choices was the perfect place for an 8-year-old
sports fanatic _ Disney's All-Star Sports Resort. It's one of
Disney's three budget resorts (the latest one opened this year with
a movie theme), with nightly rates in the $85 range off-season. We
stayed in the Home Run Hotel theme area, which featured stadium
lights, three-story-high baseball bats adorning the balconies and a
pool shaped like a diamond. Goofy was on the mound in the middle,
``pitching'' out spurts of water like baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   I had studied up on other timesaving tips. We secured a rental
car for flexibility. We avoided the Magic Kingdom on Saturday. We
had a list of four to six priorities for each park.
</P>
<P>
   And we planned to take advantage of Disney's new ``fast-pass''
system for major attractions like Splash Mountain, which allows you
to get a ticket with an assigned time so you don't have to wait in
line.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, we didn't need fast passes, since waits were so
short, and we also didn't need priority-seating dining
reservations. They are recommended for table-service restaurants. I
decided we could live with fast food for three days if need be
(luckily, we had one sit-down meal each day but the last).
</P>
<P>
   The one dining reservation I did make was a breakfast featuring
visits with Disney characters. That's where our adventure began.
</P>
<P>
   DAY ONE _ MAGIC KINGDOM
</P>
<P>
   Our package deal included the character breakfast, and we chose
to dine with Winnie-the-Pooh and friends at the Wilderness Lodge.
But Ramsey seemed a little tentative when I told him we were having
breakfast with Pooh.
</P>
<P>
   He was worried he'd have to ``sit with Pooh and talk to him and
stuff for the whole meal,'' suggesting that such might be a mite
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   It was lavish _ starting with fresh-baked breads and smoothies
and ending with cappuccino crowned with whipped cream. While we
were eating, Pooh, Tigger and Eeyore stopped by for photo
opportunities. Ramsey declared it the ``best breakfast ever'' and
seemed relieved.
</P>
<P>
   From the lodge, we took a boat for a more scenic entrance to the
Magic Kingdom than a parking tram would allow. We strolled up Main
Street and took a right to Tomorrowland, where Ramsey found his
``second-favorite'' ride in the Magic Kingdom: Buzz Lightyear's
Space Ranger Spin.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being in a ``spaceship'' armed with a laser gun and
battling enemy Z, actually an army of wacky aliens stamped with Z's
for targets. With the controls, you can turn your ship to better
face targets. When you successfully hit, you score points. At the
end you find out if you are a mere recruit or a Space Ranger Cadet
Class I or above.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine your little soldier asking the inevitable _ can we do it
again? _ and actually being able to say yes because there's no
wait. That's pretty much how our day went.
</P>
<P>
   We twirled in the Mad Hatter's Tea Cups. We braved a cruise with
the Pirates of the Caribbean and experienced all the classics, from
It's a Small World to the Tiki Birds. And if we liked it, we did it
again.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the highlights.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best ride: Splash Mountain, a better-than-your-average log
ride with a Brer Rabbit theme. ``The 52-foot drop is awesome!''
Ramsey exclaimed. So awesome, we did it three times. Ultimately,
Ramsey declared Splash Mountain the best ride in all of Disney
World.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best memory maker: For Ramsey, it was ``getting to do a lot of
the rides a bunch.'' For me, it was the Main Street Electrical
Parade, which is staged after dark with gigantic floats wired with
550 miles of twinkling lights. It's something I had wanted to see
since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Favorite souvenir: Ramsey's is the Splash Mountain T-shirt.
Mine are the mouse ears. I made him buy a set with me and then pose
for a picture. He was mortified. ``I guess this is something you
have to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If we had to do it over again: We wouldn't miss the fireworks.
We hurried to catch a boat back to Wilderness Lodge (where our car
was parked). The fireworks had just begun and we thought maybe we
could see them from the boat. We couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ramsey's grade: A+
</P>
<P>
   DAY TWO _ DISNEY-MGM STUDIOS AND DISNEY BOARDWALK
</P>
<P>
   After a 14-hour Friday, getting started Saturday wasn't easy.
Still, the bus dropped us off at Disney-MGM Studios by 9:30, and in
moments we were on the Great Movie Ride, which took us through
classic movie scenes from ``The Wizard of Oz'' to ``Alien.'' But
herein lies the problem with MGM for an 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is all about a bunch of old movies I've never seen
before,'' Ramsey grumped when I pressed him for why he seemed so
unenthused.
</P>
<P>
   ```Indiana Jones' isn't an old movie,'' I protested while we
waited for the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular to begin.
</P>
<P>
   He responded by merely raising his eyebrows while I did the
math.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I said. ``Well, can't we just say older, not old?''
Which earned a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Doug! Live show and the Honey! I Shrunk the Kids Playground
earned kudos. But neither of us are thrill seekers, so we skipped
the Rock N' Roller Coaster and the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.
``What's the Twilight Zone anyway?'' Ramsey asked.
</P>
<P>
   We left the park just before 3 p.m., which gave us plenty of
time for swimming at the resort. We even enjoyed daiquiris (virgin,
of course) at the poolside bar. Early that evening, we strolled
along Disney's Boardwalk, an area of restaurants and nightclubs
designed to evoke the old-fashioned boardwalks along East Coast
beaches. There, we had dinner (chicken wings and barbecue
sandwiches) at the ESPN Cafe, Ramsey's top dining pick of the trip.
Then back to the hotel to write postcards and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Our report card on Disney-MGM Studios:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best ride: The Backlot Tour, specifically Catastrophe Canyon.
It's a set built to look like a desert canyon that catches tourists
by surprise when fires erupt and then tons of water come gushing
down the canyon walls. ``I thought it was coming straight toward us
and we were going to get swamped,'' said Ramsey, as he recovered
from the scare. I was torn between taking a picture of him or the
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Favorite attraction: Muppetvision 3-D, a delightful movie that
introduced Ramsey to the 3-D concept. Though this was 4-D, ``like
when the bubbles came floating by. I thought they were part of the
movie,'' Ramsey said. In fact, real bubbles had filled the theater.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  That wasn't so bad: As mentioned, we aren't real brave when it
comes to thrill rides. But I love the ``Star Wars'' movies. So we
ventured forth into Star Tours, a simulated space ship that jostled
us to delight, rather than fright.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If we had it to do over again: We'd sleep in, go later in the
day and stay for the Fantasmic laser show.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ramsey's grade: B-

 &HT;    Fireworks, parades start party at Disney World
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for the Sunday, Nov.14.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ For most of us, welcoming the new millennium will be a
one-night affair, whether decadent or down-home.
</P>
<P>
   But for the folks who never do anything less than over the top,
welcoming the new age is a 457-night affair. And it's already
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Disney World has new fireworks and lasers, cultural exhibits and
a gigantic puppet parade to celebrate the new millennium every day
until January 2001. Even Epcot's Spaceship Earth has been
transformed into one huge (257 feet tall) millennium icon, with the
attachment of Mickey Mouse's hand holding a wand that sprinkles
stars over a giant ``2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Epcot, in fact, is the center of the action. On the recent
weekend my 8-year-old nephew and I visited Disney World, the only
sign of Y2K mania at the other three theme parks was the ``2000''
T-shirts for sale. There will be more-flam-
</P>
<P>
   boyant-than-usual fireworks at all the parks on New Year's Eve,
along with special events including a B-52's and Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish concert at Pleasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   But Epcot doesn't delay the gratification. The moment you enter
the park, you see not only the gussied-up Spaceship Earth, but a
new sculpture garden around it with massive granite slabs. They are
a part of the ``Leave a Legacy'' project, a takeoff on the
buy-a-brick gimmick at many public spaces such as Centennial
Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Epcot guests can sit for a digital photo, which is then
emblazoned on steel tiles. The tiles are attached to the slabs
where they can be displayed for decades to come. My nephew, Ramsey
Walker, loved the idea, just sure his indulgent aunt would bring
him back one day to find our tile. So we shelled out the $38 for a
double portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Since our return, we've found the etched image on the Internet
(www.disney.go.com/livinglegacy) and received a transparency of it
in the mail with its location. We'll need it. The tile is only a
1-inch square and will join an estimated 750,000 others on display.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a Millennium Village, a pavilion built for the
15-month celebration to house exhibits from 35 countries. That's a
significant addition to 11 nations that have permanent exhibits
around Epcot's World Showcase Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   While the village exhibits are much smaller, there's plenty
worth experiencing. You can play golf, dance and even test your
world cultures knowledge in a little ``Jeopardy!''-like contest.
</P>
<P>
   But without a doubt the heart and soul of the millennium
observation are the parade and fireworks. Disney knows how to do
parades. In fact, after witnessing the Magical Moments and the Main
Street Electrical parades at the Magic Kingdom, I wondered what the
Mouse could possibly come up with next.
</P>
<P>
   The Tapestry of Nations is an altogether different experience,
though it adheres to a key Disney parade rule: Make things so big
that folks standing four-deep don't miss a detail. Many of the 120
puppets are 20 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   They were designed by artist Michael Curry, whose work includes
costumes for the Broadway production of ``The Lion King.'' The
colorful creatures, perched atop the heads of performers who
control their motions, represent the world's different regions.
</P>
<P>
   They move around the lagoon twice a day to the beat of more than
720 drums and a score that's primal and penetrating. It's hard to
stop rocking and chanting, even after the parade has moved on, even
though you really don't know what you are chanting. Something akin
to the war chant at the Braves game.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the evening parade, ``IllumiNations 2000:
Reflections of Earth'' begins on the lagoon, which serves as the
stage for the fireworks-and-laser drama. The opening number is a
seemingly impossible dance between water and flames, with fountain
spouts shooting up around huge towers of fire.
</P>
<P>
   My nephew asked how this can be. I could summon no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a 28-foot-diameter sphere representing the globe begins to
glide slowly across the lagoon. It is covered with video screens in
the shapes of the continents that flash rapid images of the people
and lands of the earth. All of this builds to the big finale in the
sky so dramatic you want to reach out and grab the hand next to
you, as if infected by the Disney jingle for its millennium
celebration: ``Come celebrate the future, hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that doesn't exactly work when the hand you are
trying to hold belongs to an 8-year-old boy who explains, ``That's
for little kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So I settle for a pat on the shoulder and a nod when he
exclaims, ``That was awesome.''
</P>

   ORLANDO:  &QR;  Ramsey's grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   DAY THREE, PART I _
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL KINGDOM
</P>
<P>
   The night before we had discussed how we would spend our
remaining day and a half. Plan A: Spend all day Sunday at Epcot and
Monday at Animal Kingdom. Plan B: Go to Animal Kingdom on Sunday
morning, take a break, and then go to Epcot late Sunday afternoon.
That would leave Monday open for whatever our hearts desired.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey opted for Plan B, so we started at Animal Kingdom at 9
a.m. Sunday, trekking to Africa to board a safari truck for a tour
through an expansive preserve, Ramsey snapping pictures of hippos,
giraffes, rhinos and elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Next, to Asia and the Kali River Rapids (you will get wet), and
then on to the other attractions on our short list. By noon,
everything was checked off, so we took a seat at the Rainforest
Cafe and happily devoured pasta and salads (after two days of fast
food, I had declared Sunday a ``french fry-free'' day). We both
agreed that Animal Kingdom was the most beautiful zoo we'd visited.
Though our tour was short, here are our highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best ride: Countdown to Extinction, which Ramsey declared
``exhilarating'' when we disembarked. It's a ride (with some
unexpected dips and roars) through the dinosaur kingdom, and not
all the specimens are friendly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some giggle, others squirm: It's Tough to Be a Bug is the most
delightful 4-D movie I've ever seen. (Of course, I had only seen my
first the day before.) When the bee stings, you feel it. When a
bug, uh, passes gas, you smell it. I couldn't stop giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, on the other hand, was one of the squirmers. ``I didn't
like it when the chair stung you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If we had it to do over again: Plan A was a better idea. It
would have given us more rest and more time at both parks. (Note to
self: Some decisions are best made without consulting an
8-year-old.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ramsey's grade: B
</P>
<P>
   DAY THREE, PART II _
</P>
<P>
   EPCOT'S FUTURE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   After a nap, we drove to Epcot around 4 p.m., decided to
concentrate on the Future World and take in the fireworks. We rode
through the Epcot icon, Spaceship Earth, a tour through the history
of communications that admittedly is more educational than
exciting. We didn't get bored, though. Next, we toured Innoventions
2000, a pathway of hands-on activities designed to introduce the
technologies of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We got our 4-D fix at Honey! I Shrunk the Audience (this time,
you feel mice _ we both said yuck!). From there, we cut across the
park to ride Body Wars, which simulates traveling through blood
vessels to ``attack'' a splinter caught in a finger. Like Star
Tours, it jostled and jiggled us, and we both were mesmerized by
the idea of being inside the body.
</P>
<P>
   Then we had our photo taken for the millennial Living Legacy
project (see front story) and claimed our spot near the lagoon to
see the Tapestry of Nations parade and the Illuminations 2000:
Reflections of Earth spectacle. Ramsey grew a little impatient
waiting for the laser and fireworks show. But once it began, he was
captivated. So was I.
</P>
<P>
   DAY FOUR _ EPCOT'S
</P>
<P>
   WORLD SHOWCASE
</P>
<P>
   I was sure Ramsey would want to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Instead, going against all odds and guidebook wisdom, he wanted
more Epcot. We hadn't seen much of the park's world showcase area,
so it was a nice choice. But first: ``Can we ride the monorail?''
</P>
<P>
   The World Showcase is even bigger now with the addition of the
Millennium Village, a pavilion of 35 nations built for the 15-month
celebration. Here, Ramsey defeated five adults in a world trivia
game.
</P>
<P>
   We escaped from the muggy, 90-degree heat to watch ``The
American Adventure,'' a movie with audio-animatronics, making
history come alive. Then we scurried around the lagoon, lingering
in Norway and Mexico, before dashing to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Our Epcot reflections. ...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best ride: Body Wars. ``It's just the idea of being inside the
body,'' explained Ramsey. ``It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Favorite attraction: Illuminations 2000: Reflections of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best memory maker: Ramsey picks the Living Legacy. ``It's
something that's there for others to see. It shows you were
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ramsey's grade: A
</P>
<P>
   FINAL REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   If we had it to do over again, we'd do it all over again.

<P>
   What began, at least officially, as a limited campaign to stamp
out terrorism and create a ``security zone'' around Chechnya, is
looking more and more like a full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   It has many parallels with, as well as differences from, the
first Chechen war, which ended in 1996. Both the parallels and the
differences are, to say the least, very disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   The main, tragic similarity is, of course, the incredible toll
on the people of Chechnya. While Russian officials are trying hard
to play down the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe, the
refugees tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   There are tens of thousands of them, shivering in makeshift
tents or living in overcrowded homes in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. The unluckier ones have died in air raids and missile
attacks, such as the one that killed and wounded hundreds of
civilians in Grozny's central market on Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But, whereas the first war was very unpopular among the Russian
public, this time it is different. In part, the Chechens themselves
are to blame for this lack of compassion. As Fiona Hill of the U.S.
human rights organization Freedom House recently pointed out,
``sympathy for them rapidly dissipated in the face of blatant
kidnappings, assassinations, murders and attacks on economic
targets in neighboring areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of Dagestan, to the east, this past summer, led by
the Islamic warlord Shamil Basayev, left the Russian government no
option but to respond with force _ this, at least, is the position
taken in favor of the bloody Russian assault.
</P>
<P>
   But what really infuriated Russian public opinion and made it
support the military campaign were the terrorist bombings in Moscow
and other Russian cities, which killed hundreds of people and were
widely, though so far without proof, attributed to ``Chechen
bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing public support for the war, which has resulted in a
sharp rise in the popularity of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin,
is disturbing. It is of course natural for any nation to rally in
support of its soldiers. But people seem to be too eager to swallow
the crude official propaganda, and the media too willing to play
along.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian generals, who still blame the media and the
politicians for their defeat in the first war, have seized upon the
initial popular support with a vengeance. This time, the generals
made it very clear that they will be in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, top officers, such as Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief
of the Russian general staff, and Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, commander
of the Western forces in Chechnya, have publicly and not too subtly
warned of possible mutiny and even civil war should their hard-line
campaign be thwarted by the political leadership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This, for the Russian military, which typically steers clear of
politics, is extremely unusual behavior, and it is the most
disturbing aspect of the war. If left unchecked, it could lead to a
political tragedy compounding the human tragedy that we are
witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   With Moscow's politics increasingly opaque under multiple layers
of intrigue, we will probably not know any time soon what prompted
President Boris N. Yeltsin to rush back to Moscow Nov. 3 from his
vacation on the Black Sea. But reports are rife that army generals
were threatening to resign in protest unless they were allowed to
fight the war their way, to an all-out victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to Moscow, Yeltsin has been characteristically
enigmatic. Allowing a situation like this to occur in the first
place was another of the many failures of his political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian politicians have appeared all too eager to jump on
the war bandwagon. The Communists and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
extreme nationalist group are the most vociferous supporters of the
war, but even among the younger generations, whose main agenda is
economic reform, few have dared to criticize the way the war is
being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   What little criticism there has been comes from former Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who says that he is against turning
the campaign into a full-scale war, and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader
of the Yabloko Party, a pro-Western advocate of reform, who has
called for a conditional cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even such expressions of common sense have been politically
costly: Primakov's popularity ratings have been declining, in part
because he is seen as insufficiently tough, and Yavlinsky's
initiative has been roundly criticized by politicians of various
stripes and, according to opinion polls, has little popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, it is hard to be optimistic. The war is set to
continue, although even a victory of the Russian army is likely to
be hollow. From the mountains in the south, Chechen fighters will
continue to launch raids and exhaust Russian troops, whose
casualties are now probably higher than admitted by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Any turn for the better would be most likely to result from a
reconsideration of the situation by the Russian people. There are
some signs that such rethinking may have started. The Russian press
is beginning to publish stories that run counter to the official
propaganda line. Opinion polls indicate that a growing percentage
of the people are having doubts about the war. Some observers
believe that support for it has peaked and will soon begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes reason will emerge to influence the course of events
and prevent the tragic situation in Chechnya from getting any
worse.

`FELICIA'S JOURNEY': WAY TOO TRUSTING OF KINDLY STRANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``Felicia's Journey'' was shown as part of this year's New York
Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 9. The film opens
Friday in Manhattan. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To call Atom Egoyan's surreally atmospheric screen adaptation of
William Trevor's novel ``Felicia's Journey'' a genre movie would be
a little like describing ``Moby-Dick'' as a fishing manual. It's
not that Trevor's insidious thriller about a lost Irish girl adrift
in England's industrial Midlands and the homicidal catering manager
who ``rescues'' her has epic pretensions. It's that Egoyan,
Canada's most gifted filmmaker, brilliantly bends this
Gothic-flavored fable to express his own tricky cinematic vision.
That vision, to put it a bit grandly, is the contemplation of human
fate in a universe that throws out tantalizing portents of meaning
and purpose while paradoxically appearing to be absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), a young woman who
travels across the Irish Sea in search of the man who impregnated
her, and Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), a stout, beady-eyed
bachelor whose head swirls with 50's pop kitsch, represents a
bizarre collision of two self-enclosed universes. Felicia's world,
which we glimpse in flashbacks, is a dreary working-class existence
redeemed by her schoolgirl passion and her naive faith in a lover
who departed without leaving an address.
</P>
<P>
   In her quest to find him, Felicia suggests a modern-day
equivalent of one of Thomas Hardy's solitary pilgrims traipsing
across a magnificently bleak industrial landscape. Ms. Cassidy
captures the character's youth and determination with a convincing
mixture of vulnerability, blankness and a kind of stubborn
radiance.
</P>
<P>
   Where Felicia's emotional world is defined by mournful Irish
ballads and by Kate Bush's throbbing recording of ``The Sensual
World,'' Hilditch surrounds himself with the syrup of Mantovani and
tinny sentimental ballads like ``My Special Angel,'' a song that
assumes a creepy resonance as the movie goes along. A fastidious
head chef in a factory, Hilditch returns each night to his large
empty house with its gigantic gadget-filled kitchen. Here, he
prepares elaborate gourmet meals under the videotaped supervision
of his dead mother, Gala (Arsinee Khanjian), who used to be the
host of a French cooking show and whose programs he reruns
obsessively while cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan directs these scenes for a slightly ghoulish, campy
comedy. The music is garishly tacky, and the cooking show a funny
parody of 50's-style ersatz French chic. In video flashbacks, we
see the chubby preadolescent Hilditch dragged onto the program by
his unflappably ebullient mother, who dispatches him on minor
chores (which he invariably muffs) and feeds him morsels (which
make him gag). Here and elsewhere, we have the feeling of being
toyed with in the same way Alfred Hitchcock delighted in tweaking
film audiences with little pranks.
</P>
<P>
   As Hilditch, Hoskins, who has specialized in crude, ruddy-faced
blokes, reins in his bluster to give a remarkably restrained and
compassionate portrayal of a repressed middle-aged mama's boy with
a streak of psychopathic violence. When he first encounters Felicia
in a chance meeting in his small green car, he initially appears to
be a good Samaritan helping out a woman in distress. But even here,
there are subtle warning signals: the character is a little too
intent, a little too carefully spoken.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, like the book, teases us by withholding information.
It isn't for a while that we learn that Felicia is not only
lovelorn but also pregnant. Although we suspect that Hilditch may
be up to no good, his violent history is leaked only gradually.
Videotaped fragments (they're either memories or actual tapes, the
movie doesn't say) of conversations in his green car with grateful
young women he has befriended and helped begin punctuating his
thoughts. As their gratitude shades into terror, it becomes clear
that they are his murder victims. But the movie never shows his
actual crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the story threatens to turn into a predictable
cat-and-mouse game in which Hilditch lures the innocent Felicia
into a lethal trap, the movie throws in a Bible-thumping
missionary, Miss Calligary (Claire Benedict), who shelters Felicia
after she has been robbed. At first Miss Calligary appears to be a
stock movie caricature of an obnoxious religious proselytizer. But
in the film's transcendent final scenes, she appears as a vehicle
of fate, another rescuer whose disturbing mixture of the crazy and
the benign mirrors that of Hilditch.
</P>
<P>
   In exploring notions of fate, chance, coincidence and timing in
people's lives, ``Felicia's Journey'' shares many of the same
preoccupations as ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' Egoyan's 1997
masterpiece, which examined the reactions of a tightly knit
community to a tragic school bus accident that took the lives of
many of the town's children. Burrowing into the town's grieving
soul, ``The Sweet Hereafter'' posed deep, anguished questions about
blame and liability, faith and causality in human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' is a smaller film, restricted by its genre
and by the limitations of its two main characters. Neither the
tight-lipped Felicia, who is locked in her own romantic dreams, nor
Hilditch (who may not even remember his crimes) is emotionally
accessible in conventional screen terms. That's one reason the
movie occasionally loses its grip and appears to be an immensely
clever exercise in genre expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But once viewed, ``Felicia's Journey,'' like most of Egoyan's
mature work, is hard to forget. Visually, and in its soundtrack of
overlapping voices, the film sustains a mood of heightened
consciousness, implying a world of surreal, only half-discernible
connections in which weather, music, landscape, media and the
chance encounters of strangers all suggest an enticing if slightly
ominous sense of a grand design.

THE TINSELTOWN TICKET: HOLLYWOOD GETS SET FOR ELECTION 2000

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. The
very thought of losing is hateful to America,'' George C. Scott in
``Patton'' (l970). 
 -0- 
 &HT;    Al Gore has a Hollywood crisis on his hands.
 &HT;    When even Barbra Streisand, staunchest of the Bill Clinton
diehards, wavers on whom she'll back in the 2000 presidential
election, the vice president is clearly on shaky ground.
 &HT;    The ambivalence of true-blue Hollywood liberals such as
Streisand is only one symptom of movieland's severe case of
self-inflicted schizophrenia.
 &HT;    Streisand hasn't faltered in her support of Clinton _ ``History
will show he's been a great president, but he has human flaws and
possibly bad judgment,'' she has said _ but she isn't ready to
endorse Gore, the president's anointed heir.
 &HT;    ``I just want to find out more about Bradley before I totally
commit,'' she says.
 &HT;    Not that former Sen. Bill Bradley (D.-N.J.), the former
basketball star for the New York Knicks, is any stranger to
Hollywood. Earlier this year Harrison Ford _ who played an American
president in ``Air Force One'' (1997) _ came out for Bradley,
joining other prominent supporters such as producer Norman Lear,
Disney boss Michael Eisner, uberagent Michael Ovitz and actresses
Goldie Hawn and Sally Field.
 &HT;    But most of the entertainment cognoscenti still appear
undecided. Some, in fact, are hedging their bets by donating to two
or more candidates.
 &HT;    The influential Eisner, for example, may be a longtime Bradley
friend, but he's also sent a check to Gov. George W. Bush
(R.-Texas). Outgoing Warner Bros. chief Terry Semel has sent the
maximum $1,000 each to Gore, Bush and Bradley. Dreamworks SKG
co-founder David Geffen has donated to Gore, but also to Sen. John
McCain (R.-Ariz.)
 &HT;    ``Multiple giving is a sign of one's desire to cover one's
bets,'' says Dwight Morris, president of the nonpartisan Campaign
Study group of Centerville, Va. ``No matter who wins, you have
access to the White House in case you need to talk to someone.''
 &HT;    But it's always like that at the start of a race, says Mike
Medavoy, the Phoenix Pictures honcho who was Clinton's point man in
Hollywood and is now spearheading Gore's campaign there.
 &HT;    ``When Clinton first came out, I tried to get a lot of people to
support him,'' Medavoy recalls. ``I wasn't successful early on _ I
had a really hard time, in part because the majority of people in
this town were supporting Bob Kerrey, and in part because nobody
knew him. And then there was this `Are we getting another Carter?'
 &HT;    ``It was an uphill battle,'' Medavoy says ``It wasn't until
after New Hampshire that I started to get people really interested,
only after Clinton demonstrated he could win. So far this season,
nobody's demonstrated anything.''
 &HT;    Hollywood loves a winner, he says, and so far no one has emerged
as a clear favorite.
 &HT;    Hollywood's fascination with Washington goes back a long way, of
course. John F. Kennedy capitalized on his Hollywood connections,
with his brother-in-law Peter Lawford roping in Marilyn Monroe,
Frank Sinatra and other stars to push Kennedy's candidacy. On the
Republican side, Hollywood veteran Ronald Reagan had a natural
fellowship with the older, more conservative frequenters of
Chasen's and the Bel Air Country Club.
 &HT;    But the days when Hollywood automatically rolled out the red
carpet for the most liberal Democrat running are long gone.
 &HT;    ``I don't think it's a vanishing breed,'' Medavoy says. ``But
for some reason it's become less important. Traditional definitions
of liberal and conservative are less delineated than they were _ I
think the majority of people are really in the middle.
 &HT;    ``I, for example, am fiscally conservative and in most cases
liberal in my social attitudes.''
 &HT;    The wild card in the current race is the rumored Democratic
candidacy of one of Hollywood's own, longtime liberal activist
Warren Beatty.
 &HT;    When the idea of the star of ``Bulworth'' (l997) going for the
White House was first floated during August's silly season, it was
taken unexpectedly seriously. Still, it was hard to believe that
the actor would really expose himself to the chaos of a political
campaign _ to say nothing, as New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd
pointed out, of the terrible lighting!
 &HT;    Beatty himself has long denied interest in running for any
office.
 &HT;    ``I never wanted to play Don Quixote,'' he has said.
 &HT;    Still, Streisand isn't discounting a Beatty candidacy.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if he's really running,'' she says. ``He'd be
better than Ronald Reagan.''
 &HT;    Beatty's pal Peter Fonda is leaning toward Bradley _ ``I know
he's the champion of representative democracy,'' he says _ but he
can see Beatty as a potential candidate.
 &HT;    ``Warren can be a very effective political person,'' Fonda says.
``He knows how to speak very well, and he's quite capable of making
issues count. I don't think he wants to be president, but I think
he wants to bring out issues that are important.''
 &HT;    Veteran publicist and liberal activist Pat Kingsley is stunned
at how seriously a Beatty candidacy has been treated.
 &HT;    ``The vast majority of the media wrote about it very
seriously,'' she says. ``I don't think they felt it was a joke. He
wouldn't be the first actor to be president.''
 &HT;    Others are less convinced.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure he's laughing his head off,'' Medavoy adds. ``If he
isn't, then I am.''
 &HT;    If there's one issue that could bring Hollywood out for Gore,
it's probably environmentalism. Hollywood is a hotbed of
eco-activists, and Gore has been advocating strong environmental
policies since long before he first ran for the presidency.
 &HT;    Neil Patrick Harris, television's ``Doogie Howser,'' is backing
Gore for that very reason.
 &HT;    ``I'm a big Gore fan,'' he says. ``I've been a fan of his
environmental stance and his educational stuff.''
 &HT;    Aaron Sorkin, creator of television's ``The West Wing'' and
``Sports Night'' and screenwriter of ``A Few Good Men'' (1992) and
``The American President'' (l996), is also going with Gore.
 &HT;    ``I don't have the problem others do with his stiffness,''
Sorkin says. ``I find it charming. I don't want a guy who's good at
a party. But, on the other hand, Bill Bradley is such a respectable
guy you have to listen to him when he speaks.''
 &HT;    Needless to say, the conservative side of Hollywood is in the
Bush camp. ``Law and Order'' creator Dick Wolf, for example, is
backing the Republican frontrunner.
 &HT;    ``This is all easy for me,'' he says. ``I went to Andover with
George from the time I was 13. I know he's very smart. I think he's
a better alternative than Al Gore _ and that's coming from an
independent.''
 &HT;    McCain _ whose personal story is the sort of war-hero epic that
Hollywood loves by reflex _ also has his supporters in filmdom.
 &HT;    Not that some observers care much. They feel that, in the
post-Clinton era, the Hollywood-Washington power axis may have
played itself out.
 &HT;    That may be true, Medavoy says, but the ability of Hollywood
stars to capture the spotlight isn't to be sneered at.
 &HT;    ``It's presumptuous to say it really matters whom Hollywood
supports,'' Medavoy says. ``Who cares? But it's a way to get ink
and media exposure.
 &HT;    ``That's why people like you write about the subject.''

`THE MESSENGER': JOAN, MEDIEVAL WARRIOR PRINCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Hundred Years War'' feels twice that long in ``The
Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc,'' Luc Besson's shrill,
overheated portrait of the teenage warrior, cross-dresser and
martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Saving France from English clutches this time is Milla Jovovich,
bringing hearty cries of ``C'mon! C'mon!'' to a story usually
associated with spirituality and magnificent understatement. Though
Ms. Jovovich's performance dominates the film, she remains
pedestrian and underwhelming, with leadership abilities that are
noticeably dubious. As presented here, the real miracle about Joan
of Arc is that France's favorite dish is not fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Revealing much about her approach to the role, Ms. Jovovich has
said of Joan: ``I think if I met her I'd probably just give her a
big hug. She's a little girl who went through a lot.'' Beyond the
obvious, much of what she goes through here comes from being put
through the wringer by Besson.
</P>
<P>
   Working in English, and speaking the universal language of ugly,
blood-spurting battle scenes, this sensation-prone French filmmaker
delivers jarring, hand-held carnage interspersed with religious
visions straight out of music video. Here's a case where ``Don't
shoot `The Messenger''' would have been sound advice.
</P>
<P>
   The film's main revelation is that the Middle Ages may have been
much more frenetic and lurid than previously imagined. Though the
pace is tedious, nothing happens slowly. Even as a child, Joan is
seen as maniacally happy, skipping through fields so gaily that she
scares the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Her story has barely begun before she envisions rampaging
wolves, roiling clouds and other broad forms of foreboding.
Besson's idea of foreshadowing is having little Joan watch her
sister be murdered and raped (in that order) by a man who stabs
her, then jokes about his taste for women with swords.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, written by Andrew Birkin and Besson, takes on
the double duty of explaining the complexities of France's struggle
with England and handing out straight lines to the minor
characters. (``I can't believe zey are zending a woman.'' ``I
wonder what color dress she'll be wearing.'' ``Joan, don't you
think you should take some time to think about this?'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Joan develops haltingly into a warrior. Her lines.
Come out. Like this. Or, as she declares after yet another grisly
free-for-all on the battlefield: ``I've seen. Enough blood. But if
you want more. I can't stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's main attempts at authenticity involve covering
everyone but the courtiers in layers of grime, and lovingly
replicating medieval weapons, from catapults to battering rams to
an assortment of cruel-looking clubs. And its attempts at
psychological complexity call for a weakly ``Lawrence of
Arabia''-like suggestion that Joan secretly enjoyed some of that
warfare and hero-worship more than she acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Among the kitschy apparitions made flesh here is a shrouded,
bearded Dustin Hoffman as the adult version of Joan's conscience.
Hoffman appears briefly to discuss Joan's motives and mission with
her, providing psychological services not otherwise available
during medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding marquee value to a film with an otherwise huge,
scruffy cast is John Malkovich as Charles VII, the French Dauphin,
who sports the ubiquitously bad haircut imposed on the male cast
(and Joan), and plays yet another paragon of scheming decadence.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Dunaway plays his mother-in-law in headgear that would have
fit as nicely with Besson's science-fiction whopper, ``The Fifth
Element,'' as it does here. The Turkish actor Tcheky Karyo, as the
king's half brother, is one of the few supporting players who
successfully shows signs of life.
</P>
<P>

`AFTERSHOCK': MORE DIZZYING THAN EXCITING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of people would pay big bucks to see New York City get
blown apart. But you can watch the big event free if you don't mind
settling for a fake catastrophe in a fake New York. That's what
you'll get on Sunday and Tuesday nights in the CBS mini-epic
``Aftershock: Earthquake in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   This film, more often dizzying than exciting, is as fragmented
as a temblor-wracked tenement. It keeps sprinkling you with shards
of six or eight intermingled subplots, tossed in around the
mandatory special effects and the even more mandatory commercial
breaks. But as you sift through the rubble, you keep finding signs
of life: hints of heartfelt drama, flashes of compelling
characters, echoes of true connection. ``Aftershock,'' which
strains so hard to show off its big moments, comes alive only in
some of its small ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens and the soundtrack blares Frank Sinatra's
rendition of you-know-what, the city that doesn't sleep is waking
up to the most rosy-fingered dawn this side of Olympus. Yes, those
panoramas really are Manhattan, but the film's New York feels wrong
from the start: a static, orderly, clean place filled exclusively
with well-dressed, attractive, plastic-and-polyester citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In a twinkling you must get to know a whole bunch of them.
There's the dapper, larger-than-life mayor (Charles S. Dutton); his
salt-of-the-earth mother (Cicely Tyson), and his daughter, the
beautiful public defender (Lisa Nicole Carson, who seems to have
wandered in, character intact, from ``Ally McBeal''). There's the
angry-but-dedicated fire chief (Tom Skerritt), the plucky-immigrant
cabdriver (Frederick Weller) and the angelic ballerina (Jennifer
Garner). There's the guilt-ridden young mother (Sharon Lawrence),
who can't forgive herself for the auto accident that left her son
(Michael Suchanek) with a limp.
</P>
<P>
   They are all living their not-especially-interesting lives when
... kapowie! Things fall. Cars crash. People scream. The scenes in
the subway are quite effective, and Sunday's installment ends with
a cliffhanger that's nifty, both dramatically and visually. But the
tumbling Statue of Liberty looks like something from a teen-ager's
home video.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a committee-wrought script based on a novel by the
local New York City news anchor Chuck Scarborough, the director
Mikael Salomon keeps things moving briskly. But even under the dust
and the few hints of blood, his city dwellers are still the
best-coiffed and least-rumpled disaster victims you are ever likely
to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it over?'' asks the ballerina, who has survived the quake
under the care of the plucky cabdriver. Well, yes, it's over.
Except for those not unexpected aftershocks. There will also be
time for this pair to fall in love. ``I remember times like this,''
he says cryptically. ``From before. To survive is good. But it is
not enough. You understand what I say?'' She says she does. You'll
have your doubts.
</P>
<P>
   As the city tries to cope with the widespread death (never
shown; too messy), the actors try to cope with their assignments.
Ms. Lawrence gets to rise above the destruction on a rope (don't
ask), but she can't rise above her portion of the script. Ms.
Tyson, who must be getting tired of all these flinty-matriarch
roles, shows why she always gets the call.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton and Skerritt manage some skillful scenes together as the
crisis makes the chief a little less angry and the mayor a little
closer to life size. These two craggy lions help bring the entire
exercise closer to life size. Their scenes provide a strong
argument for letting television drama do what it does best: focus
on the details of human interaction. Theatrical films, with their
big screens and bigger budgets, are better suited for leveling
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if simulated destruction proves a November sweeps winner
here, CBS' competitors will have to go it one better. Why stop at
simulation? Why not demolish a real city in prime time? Even now,
someone at Fox must be researching the required city permits.

`ANYWHERE BUT HERE': AND MOM, ANOTHER THING: WHEN WILL YOU GROW
UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The mother and daughter in Mona Simpson's widely praised novel
``Anywhere but Here'' spend an awful lot of time driving around and
going out for conciliatory ice cream cones after they fight. That
would not bode well for a movie version, but the film happens to
have a knowing, well-distilled screenplay by Alvin Sargent and the
same incisive, affectionate direction that Wayne Wang brought to
``The Joy Luck Club.'' Wang once again works splendidly with
actresses, and boy, does he have a lot to work with this time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pleasure, if not a surprise, to find Susan Sarandon so
show-stopping in the role of Adele August, the mother and nemesis
of the story's adolescent heroine, Ann. Adele is flamboyant and
outrageous in ways that could have been as painful for an audience
as they are for 14-year-old Ann, but Ms. Sarandon makes her
enormously funny and appealing, too. It is Adele's idea to uproot
her daughter from family and friends in the Midwest and head for
Beverly Hills, where she has big ambitions but no prospects.
``You're gonna die one day too, Mom, just like the rest of us,''
Ann remarks acidly before the two leave Bay City, Wis. ``But not in
this town,'' Adele blithely replies.
</P>
<P>
   On the page, Adele leaves her daughter feeling resentful as she
monopolizes much of the limelight. But Ann is played here by
Natalie Portman, and as for Ms. Portman's fading into the woodwork,
not a chance. Proving her mettle in a fully formed dramatic role,
looking stronger and more serious than she has before, and more
beautiful without the lampshade headgear of ``The Phantom Menace,''
Ms. Portman does a terrific job of holding her own in the film's
battle of wills. From its very first scene, in which Adele bops to
the Beach Boys while driving cross-country in a gold Mercedes that
she can't afford, while Ann glowers beneath her baseball cap from
the other side of the car, it's clear that these two are a
formidable match.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal rather than eventful, ``Anywhere but Here'' finds
plenty of dramatic interest in Ann and Adele's tug of war, and in
their efforts to invent a new life. Like the father played by Alan
Arkin in ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' a film that covered similar
territory, Adele makes a fearless con artist in a perfect place for
such artifice. She's someone who can haughtily turn down a suite at
the Beverly Hills Hotel before checking into a motel, and Ann is
dragged along with her on every last roller-coaster ride. Adele's
faith in her own star quality has its pathos, but it's also a grand
feat of imagination, and the film appreciates that. As outfitted
with cheerful brazenness by Betsy Heimann, whose costume credits
include ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Get Shorty,'' Adele is a walking
tribute to her own imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The film works best at fathoming what a mother-daughter
relationship is like when the daughter is the grown-up, and when
the mother's manic excesses threaten to sink them both. At the same
time, it does a touching job of explaining what holds them
together. Sometimes it's reluctant camaraderie, as when Ann takes a
look at her new Beverly Hills High School classmates and exclaims:
``They look like they're going to the beach!'' (``The intelligent
girls are inside,'' Adele reassures her.) Sometimes it's pure bile,
as in a scene that finds Ann cruelly impersonating her mother.
Mostly it's a hard-won compromise that deepens as the film unfolds.
``You never were a small-town girl, were you?,'' Adele finally
remarks. ``Thanks for knowing that, Mom,'' Ann answers.

`OXYGEN': HOUDINI TURNS KIDNAPPER AND THE BATTLE OF WITS BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as ``Oxygen'' sticks literally to its guns, then this
little thriller about a race to save a woman snatched from a
Manhattan street in broad daylight and buried alive by a kidnapper
has its merits.
</P>
<P>
   But the more the film focuses on the psychological cat-and-mouse
game between its heroine, who is a troubled police detective, and
its villain, a megalomaniac who fancies himself a new Houdini, the
more it loses momentum and its claims to credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a cast of good actors, led by Maura Tierney as the
detective, Adrien Brody as her adversary, Laila Robbins as the
terriified kidnap victim and James Naughton as her wealthy,
impatient husband bear watching even as the tension and suspense
leak out of ``Oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Richard Shepard, ``Oxygen'' does a
better job of making sense of Brody as Harry than it does of Ms.
Tierney as Madeline Foster. Harry is one of those all-too-familiar
New Yorkers who occasionally rise out of obscurity to commit crimes
that make all sorts of sense to them but can strike others only as
bizarre and deranged.
</P>
<P>
   As one half of a troubled marriage, to a police captain (Terry
Kinney) who is her commander, Madeline also makes a certain amount
of sense. But the masochistic extramarital sexual relationship of
the tough, dedicated, extremely competent Madeline with a
relentless sadist who burns her arms with cigarettes is so
underwritten that it suggests cinematic convenience rather than
psychological truth.
</P>
<P>
   After Harry's effort to pick up a million-dollar ransom from the
victim's husband at Houdini's grave site apparently goes awry and
he is arrested, Madeline's dark side _ visible when he notices her
burns as he is being interrogated _ attracts him to her.
</P>
<P>
   And after he toys with various police officers, escapes from his
handcuffs and plays a joke on the stereotypically stiff FBI agents
brought into the case by the victim's husband, the end game of
``Oxygen'' is played out between the escape artist and Madeline
Foster.
</P>
<P>
   With its many outdoor settings, the film has sufficient air. But
the character of Madeline could use more light.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   `Oxygen' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). The film includes kidnapping, murder,
sadomasochistic behavior, shootings and an understandable amount of

`DOGMA': COOL DUDES IN A COSMOLOGICAL MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``Dogma'' was shown as part of this year's New York Film
Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which
appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 4. The film opens Friday in
Manhattan. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more irrelevant to Kevin Smith's audacious
``Dogma'' than ticking off a list of its cheerful outrages against
hidebound Roman Catholicism. Yes, Smith enjoys shock value, but
this time he makes it mercilessly funny and places it in the
context of an obviously devout, enlightened parable.
</P>
<P>
   Given this filmmaker's special vernacular, a wild hybrid of
comic books, off-the-wall rhetoric and unexpected intellectual
heft, his ability to bushwhack audiences with serious thought has
never seemed more worthwhile. With ``Dogma'' Smith makes a big,
gutsy leap into questions of faith and religion. He miraculously
emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: ``Dogma'' is a hot potato. Corporate
thinking, which Smith satirizes with images of a highly profitable
golden calf in Mickey Mouse pants, has already forced the film's
distribution from Miramax (a Disney subsidiary) to the more
independent Lion's Gate. But no whiff of controversy can diminish
the exhilarating, freewheeling way in which Smith kicks up a
religious debate of equal interest to theologians and surfers.
Sharply satirical yet gratifyingly cynicism-free, ``Dogma''
honestly embraces the outlook summed up by one of its characters:
``I have issues with anyone who treats faith as a burden instead of
a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Smith concocts a cosmological challenge. He
imagines two cool-dude angels, Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and
Ben Affleck), who have been banished from heaven to Wisconsin for
so long that they've come up with a dangerous plan. It seems that
Cardinal Glick, played by George Carlin (whose irreverence is cited
by Smith as an inspiration), is rededicating a church in Red Bank,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the Cardinal's plan to reawaken organized
Catholicism with a peppy public relations campaign in which new
images of ``the buddy Christ'' will wink and give a thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ''Dogma,'' which suggests that Smith might have
been as shrewd a lawyer as he is a filmmaker, is that the church
rededication will allow the banished angels to re-enter heaven,
thus proving God fallible and, by extension, negating all
existence. Understanding the fine points of this plan is not
essential to finding the movie extremely funny.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who came up with this idea back in his ``Clerks'' days at
the Quik-Stop but has since given it the brighter gloss of
``Chasing Amy,'' then piles on an array of characters struggling
over the fate of all existence. And lets the chips fall where they
may.
</P>
<P>
   The film's real center is a heroine named Bethany, apparently
first written as an ingenue and made a lot more interesting by the
world-weary presence of Linda Fiorentino. ``I think God is dead,''
says Bethany, who works at an abortion clinic and tithes part of
her salary from Planned Parenthood to the church. ``The sign of a
good Catholic,'' sighs Janeane Garofalo, as one of her co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The film soon surrounds Bethany with creations like Metatron
(Alan Rickman), an angel who delivers God's messages with a
suitably English accent, and the inevitable Jay and Silent Bob
(Jason Mewes, who ought to bottle his character, and Smith
himself). Jay explains, with characteristic four-letter candor,
that he and Bob thought an abortion clinic would be a good place to
meet loose women.
</P>
<P>
   From Chris Rock as a 13th Apostle who literally falls out of the
sky, to Salma Hayek as a stripper-muse who claims credit for all of
the top 20 highest-grossing movies except ``Home Alone,'' to Jason
Lee as a fallen angel who cites central air-conditioning as the
most exquisite sin, ``Dogma'' abounds with nuttily triumphant
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   It also has its undue excesses, like an excrement monster whose
antics add nothing to the ambience. And although Smith's strong
suit remains clever conversation, he lets this story build toward
more action than it can handle, particularly when angel wings get
caught in a shootout. Nonetheless, whenever the film goes out onto
a limb, as in that explosive finale, it has an impressive way of
redeeming itself with strong convictions and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   The actors here, particularly Ms. Fiorentino, Affleck and Damon,
bring great, understandable enthusiasm to Smith's smart talk and
wild imaginings. And well they should. ``Verbal trampoline'' is a
phrase Affleck has used to describe Smith's material, and ``Dogma''
illustrates that thought excitingly. When even a movie's opening
disclaimer brings down the house, expect some very high leaps
indeed.

 &HT;    A DWINDLING MINORITY: IRANIAN JEWS UNNERVED BY ARRESTS
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 14 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The Jews of Iran are one step closer to leaving
their homeland of more than 2,500 years.
</P>
<P>
   They were stunned in March, when Iranian police in the southern
city of Shiraz arrested 13 Jews and seven Muslims. Police accused
them of spying for the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Those jailed include a 16-year-old boy, four religious school
teachers and a lay leader who performs Jewish ritual circumcisions.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to cautious but prosperous lives, Iranian Jews now
wonder if the rules have changed. Many consider joining relatives
in North America, Europe or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Jew in Iran has a plan. They just don't know when,''
said one member of the Jewish community in Tehran recently. He
asked, as most do now, not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   But, a daughter of one of those arrested wrote a poem in August
in an Iranian Jewish magazine pleading for help from the Islamic
country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In it, she
described the dilemma for Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, who have devoted our lives to Iran, could we leave this
country, take our hearts away from it?'' wrote Sahar Puyan Rad, a
high school student. ``We've been planted here. Iran is our garden
. . . but our days are now filled with sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we are two religions, still we've got one heart, one
God, one homeland then therefore one leader,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Iranian Jews regularly pray for Khamenei and other
Iranian leaders. It is one of the ways through the centuries that
they have woven Persia, now Iran, into their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's 50 synagogues are decorated in Persian
carpets. Worshippers remove their shoes before praying _ as do
their Muslim countrymen. The city of Hamadan is home to the
5th-Century tomb of Jewish Queen Esther.
</P>
<P>
   Jews here weathered the birth of Israel, which saw the expulsion
of Jews from many Muslim countries. They survived the radicalism of
the 1979 Islamic Revolution, though more than half of them fled.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Turkey, Iran remains the only Middle
Eastern Muslim country with a sizable Jewish population _ numbering
about 30,000 in a country of about 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Jewish community here, mindful of maintaining
good relations with Iranian officials, assert that anti-Semitism is
no worse in Iran than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, one acknowledges that the Shiraz arrests in March may
push emigration this year to about 900 from some 600 in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe a crisis has occurred in the Jewish community.
But it will calm down,'' says Haroun Yashayaei, leader of the
Tehran Jewish Association and a prominent Iranian film producer.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, he acknowledges the arrests caused a ``little
panic.'' But he blames that on foreign media and diplomats he
claims want to stir up anti-Iranian feelings.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an outcry. Joined by Jewish groups throughout the
world, diplomats from the United States to Israel to Russia have
expressed concern about the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, at the request of American Jewish
leaders, has said that he may visit Iran to win the Jews' release.
</P>
<P>
   They all search for delicate ways of pressuring a country that
is anti-Israel, stridently independent and undergoing its own
struggle over calls for democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders worry that a hard-line faction in the government had
the Jews arrested in order to generate anti-Western sentiment
within Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly concerned that these members of the Jewish
minority may have been singled out for persecution to make a
political point, as a gambit in what is widely described as a
struggle within Iran's leadership, rather than to serve justice,''
wrote Human Rights Watch in a letter to the head of the Iranian
judiciary in September.
</P>
<P>
   Concern peaked months ago, when a high-ranking Iranian court
official promised executions for those arrested. The judge later
lost his job _ though it is unclear why _ and reform-oriented
President Mohammad Khatami has promised fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   However, Khatami does not control the courts and is second in
power behind Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei. It appears that the
trials may be held in secret Revolutionary Courts.
</P>
<P>
   There are differing reports as to whether the defendants have
been able to meet with lawyers. Family members say that, as
Orthodox Jews, they have refused to eat non-Kosher jail food,
limiting themselves to bread and water.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the reason for the arrests is rampant within
Iran's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   One story is that they found the Jews with Hebrew videotapes
about religious themes and mistook them for something sinister.
Another theory is that some members of the group may have been
caught sending e-mails or letters to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And, some speculate that other Jews may have been trying to
settle a score in some internal dispute by alleging crimes to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are disconcertingly sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows about the case. Because of that, we are
worried,'' said Parves Ahobim, 52, a Jewish merchant in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those arrested are well-known leaders within the
Jewish community. Said a Tehran Jew, asking not to be identified:
``We don't know about the case, but we know they are not spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews have always been quick to point out that Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic revolution, stated that Jews
and Christians should be allowed to live peacefully in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community publishes a booklet of Khomeini's sayings
about the Jews. When a celebration was held this summer to mark
what would have been his 100th birthday, 27 buses of Jews showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Shiraz case prompted the huge attendance as a show
of loyalty to Iran and solidarity within the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Under Khomeini's dictate, Jews in Iran were given a seat in
parliament, as were a few Christian denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But, minority religions have run into problems under the Islamic
regime. The Bahai's, practitioners of an offshoot of Islam, have
been especially persecuted with arrests and hundreds have been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press, 17 Jews have been executed in
the last 20 years. But, human rights groups in most cases have been
unable to determine if the past arrests were based on religious
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims get lighter sentences for crimes against against
non-Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jews have some small liberties. They are allowed to drink
alcohol while Muslims, at least in theory, are not. Men and women
can mix at their weddings, while they are not supposed to in Muslim
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Jews trade scant information about the 13 of their faith
in jail, those allowances are overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken away some of us and hurt our hearts by doing
this. The backs of the women have been bowed because their husbands
are gone,'' high school poet Rad writes. ``The soil of Iran is part
of our lives and we do our best for Iran.''

WARS, BRIDES AND VIOLINISTS IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCESS MONONOKE
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes,
Gillian Anderson, John De Mita, John Di Maggio, Jada Pinkett Smith,
Billy Bob Thornton &QL; 
Directed by Hayao Miyazaki
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 135 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Sumptuous animation is the strength of Miyazaki's sprawling
tale, set during the Muromachi period in Japan (1392-1573).
Otherwise, one needs to look sharp to keep up with all the
machinations revolving around Ashataki, a young champion of
humankind. Infected by a devil in the shape of a wild boar,
Ashitaka is sent to the forest to track demonic forces and cleanse
himself of his contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In the bargain he is thrust into the job of middleman among
warring forces of man, animal and nature. At the crux is the
running battle between an iron mining settlement ruled by the
crafty Princess Eboshi and animals of the woodlands as represented
by giant white wolves and young San, aka Princess Mononoke, who is
part human and part wolf.
</P>
<P>
   A third presence is the forest itself, whose spirit is an elk by
day and a diaphanous divinity by night. Then, to add to an already
crowded complement of characters, a phalanx of boars rumbles around
organizing for a final and futile charge against the humans in the
mining town, which is defended by a troop of feisty former
prostitutes and further besieged by an army of opportunistic
samurai.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the problem lies with Princess Eboshi, who determines
to expand her mining operations under the forest and has developed
rifles and mortars to more than level the playing field against her
larger adversaries. With conflicts escalating, Ashitaka and San try
to separate antagonists and ward off destruction.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The fighting _ people vs. animal, people vs. people,
people vs. the forest spirit _ is constant and often bloody and
gruesome. When possessed by his demonic powers, even Ashataki
shoots arrows that decapitate his targets and, despite the splendid
scenery, nothing stays peaceful for long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 Obviously the film isn't a cartoon. It would confuse,
bore and occasionally frighten them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10 One problem for young children is that the film is so
long and complicated. Just when matters appear to be at the point
of resolution, the situation rewinds itself at least a couple of
times for more bouts of hostilities that, late in a 135-minute
film, seem to go on forever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13 Shown at the New York Film Festival, the film is of a
high artistic order, which certainly doesn't exclude young
audiences. But there is that impatience factor.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC OF THE HEART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Gloria Estefan, Angela Bassett, Jane
Leeves, Cloris Leachman, Kieran Culkin, Charlie Hofheimer, Josh
Pais &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Wes Craven &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 110 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The violin instructor Ruth Guaspari (Ms. Streep) stops class to
take a question from one of her dozen students at a grade school in
East Harlem. The girl wonders why Ruth is so nice all of a sudden.
When Ruth replies that she's trying to lighten up, the student
objects. ``I already have nice teachers,'' she says. Ruth relents
and turns testy. The whole class titters and gets back to sawing
away on their instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Left by her husband, Ruth lands in the big city with her two
young sons and takes a job teaching the violin in a special music
program. Some students balk but her high standards, directness and
prodding humor are infectious, and a spring concert for parents and
student body is a success.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Ruth is by no means without problems but
seems to be something of a Teflon woman. A relationship with a
writer (Quinn) falls apart, but other things matter more. Her son's
emotional problems easily straighten out with a little attention.
</P>
<P>
   City strains _ a drive-by shooting here, a mugging there, a
gifted student possibly headed for Juilliard whose dreams are
derailed by parental abuse _ are dealt with but are never much more
than part of the urban backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years pass and Ruth grows venerable, as does a program that
gives an experience of lifelong value to hundreds of students. That
being the case, one can all but absolutely predict the first
activity that will be cut when a budget crunch arises. To raise
money and save the class, Ruth rallies her supporters, gets some
good press and lands a student concert at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Stern is charmed and wants to take part, and so do Itzhak
Perlman and other star soloists. Yes, though they have already
gotten to Carnegie Hall, everybody still practices. And, yes, this
is that Wes Craven, on break for an uplifting tale far from the
screamer-slasher genre.

   After a long preamble to explain how young males like to run
free to satisfy their sexual urges without the threat of
commitment, the story finally gets to what we don't know already
but could easily have predicted: Jimmy ( O'Donnell) may love Anne
(Ms. Zellweger), but he can't bring himself to propose in any way
that suggests to her that he would like to get married.
</P>
<P>
   That's awkward, but it gets serious when Jimmy's grandfather's
will stipulates that he has to marry by his 30th birthday if he is
to inherit $100 million. Jimmy turns 30 tomorrow. Anne doesn't
respond to his instant reproposal, delivered with a little
desperation this time but no more sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do any of innumerable former girlfriends who are perfectly
capable of resisting the money, not to mention the requirement that
they must have children with him.
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend puts an ad in the classifieds. Hundreds of women
volunteer, and wearing wedding dresses they chase Jimmy through the
streets in a great white swarm. Better take one last stab at
rounding up Anne.

   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' is not the insufferable,
for-fans-only flick that it easily could have been. Rather, it's a
stylishly animated, humor-laced movie that not only sheds some
light on what a Pikachu is, but also presents the typical good vs.
evil story in a somewhat atypical way.
</P>
<P>
   Letting parents in on what exactly their kids are talking about
when they say ``Gotta catch 'em all,'' the movie opens with a crash
course in Pokemon jargon. A trio of trainers _ main characters
Misty, Brock and scruffy leader Ash _ are having a picnic when
another trainer challenges Ash to a duel. Pokemon duels do not
involve contact, so instead, Ash and his opponent whip out silver
balls that unleash oddly shaped,
once-wild-but-now-tamed-and-trained creatures with magical powers.
These weird-looking animalites _ the Pokemon _ are the ones who
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Ash, Misty and Brock are eventually invited to a Pokemon
showdown being thrown, unbeknownst to them, by the evil Mewtwo, a
laboratory-made Pokemon crafted in the image of Pokemonarch Mew,
the Yoda of Pokemon. The invite is to lure Pokemon and their
trainers to a desolate island where Mewtwo unleashes an army of
wicked Pokeclones like himself, starting a clone vs. the-real-thing
war.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of hot topics and issues are subtly yet stylishly covered
here, from racism to slavery. As a result, the movie is
overwhelmingly emotional _ violent in some parts, crushingly sad in
others.
</P>
<P>
   You may do as much laughing as crying: Cute jokes and
tongue-in-cheek humor are scattered throughout. Even more
impressive, ``Pokemon'' never once has to resort to shallow
bathroom humor to entertain its pubescent audience.

`EDWARD M. KENNEDY: A BIOGRAPHY': THE PUBLIC SERVANT BEHIND THE
PUBLIC KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT DALLEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1968, after Robert Kennedy's assassination had deprived the
nation of his likely election to the presidency, Democratic Party
leaders urged his 36-year-old brother, Sen. Ted Kennedy, to run in
his place. They assured him that the nomination was his for the
asking. Kennedy refused: ``How could I conscientiously combat
allegations by Nixon ... that I was too young, that I had no record
in public life strong enough to recommend me for the high office of
president, that perhaps I was trying to trade on my brothers'
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's self-denying response in 1968, among many
considerations in deciding not to run, stand in stark contrast to
current assumptions about running for president. A want of
political experience as an officeholder, elected or appointed, is
no deterrent to becoming a candidate. Celebrity _ whether as a
wealthy businessman, a media personality or the scion of a famous
family _ is an acceptable credential for a White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   As Adam Clymer, Washington correspondent for The New York Times,
demonstrates in this first-rate biography, Kennedy has consistently
put public ideals above personal ambition during his 37 years as a
U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer's book is not a hagiography; Kennedy's personal flaws are
on full display. But unlike so many other recent political
biographies, Clymer's volume focuses not on sex or scandal but on
politics. His publisher, Clymer reports, ``bought the book at a
time when other publishers were asking why a Kennedy book would not
be about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans interested in substantive public questions have been
rewarded with a biography that reconstructs Kennedy's role in the
many major domestic and foreign policy issues that have been
central to his political career. This is not to imply that we are
in the presence of some dry political chronicle devoid of the
personal tragedies that have punctuated Ted Kennedy's life. The
suffering he endured through the murders of his brothers and the
illness of a son who lost a leg to cancer are sensitively covered.
The author also deals forthrightly with the senator's failed
marriage and the Chappaquiddick scandal.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Clymer's discussion of the personal apart from recent
biographical exposes is the link he makes between the private and
the public. Some JFK biographers, for example, have explained their
emphasis on his womanizing by asserting that it jeopardized his
presidency; his impeachment was only a newspaper story away, they
argue. But as Clymer convincingly demonstrates, journalists in the
1960s published little or nothing about politicians' sex lives.
``Even the supermarket tabloids did not print stories about
politicians' affairs in the '60s,'' Clymer writes. When Senator
Kennedy became drunk on a plane ride home from Alaska, the
reporters with him did not publish stories about it.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer states that he believes that Chappaquiddick _ with the
death of Mary Jo Kopechne on Martha's Vineyard in 1969 in a car
accident caused by Senator Kennedy's carelessness _ changed the way
in which journalists write about politicians' private lives. The
accident raised questions about the senator's character and put him
under a journalistic spotlight. Whether it was only or even
principally Chappaquiddick that altered journalistic standards is
debatable. Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson's ``credibility gap,'' Watergate
and other numerous instances of secret government actions were
probably more important contributors to the shift in journalistic
mores.
</P>
<P>
   But Chappaquiddick was of crucial importance in Ted Kennedy's
political career. It was a decisive element in the defeat of his
presidential ambitions in 1979-80. Consequently it receives
Clymer's close scrutiny, not for the sake of salacious details that
might titillate readers but rather because it was of such
importance in Senator Kennedy's public life and the life of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer argues that despite never gaining the presidency, Senator
Kennedy has been a major political force as an heir to the idealism
John and Robert called forth and as the unflinching leader of New
Deal liberalism. He writes that Senator Kennedy ``deserves
recognition not just as the leading senator of his time, but as one
of the greats in its history.'' His accomplishments have included
advances in civil rights, voting rights, health legislation
promoting cancer research, health maintenance organizations, access
to prescription drugs, portable health insurance, expanded health
coverage for children, greater equality for the disabled, better
treatment of women in the workplace, greater justice for American
Indians, programs to combat hunger, the 18-year-old vote and
abolition of the poll tax.
</P>
<P>
   But his achievements are not simply the stuff of doctrinaire
liberalism. ``There was nothing `liberal' about denying bail to
dangerous criminals or ending parole in the federal system'' or
airline deregulation, Clymer writes. And his almost unnoticed role
in foreign affairs has carried forward the tradition of ideals over
narrow self-interest _ an America intent on alleviating suffering
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer invokes the authority of Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the West
Virginia Democrat and the Senate's most knowledgeable historian,
who describes Kennedy's ``timeless talent for accommodation'' as
likely to have made him ``a leader, an outstanding senator, at any
period in the nation's history.'' Effective compromises with
Republican senators has been a key to his success.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer's book is not only a tribute to Kennedy's exceptionalism
as a senator but also a reminder that politics in America counts in
assuring the national well-being. It is a fine counter to the
cynicism and indifference that have recently reduced voter
participation in elections and discouraged too many of the
country's best and brightest from taking up the challenge of a
political life.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spalding Gray's captivating new monologue ``Morning,
Noon and Night'' is absolute confirmation of the liberating power
of devotion to a child. Gray may have gained renown for his
obsessive contemplation of his own navel, but during 95 lovestruck
minutes at the Vivian Beaumont Theater he begins to shed his myriad
neuroses as if they were the strands of a suffocating chrysalis.
</P>
<P>
   What struggles to emerge in their place is a newfound sense of
purpose, an abiding patience and a depth of compassion, triggered
by, of all things, the pitter-patter of little feet. No one seems
more surprised at the transformation than this gifted storyteller
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He narrates the tale of his everyday encounters with Cheerios on
the kitchen floor and a search for ``The Nutty Professor'' at the
video store and Tickle Me Elmo in the conjugal bed with the same
ironic detachment he has brought to darker stories. If anything,
this funny monologue is more focused, more relaxed; as a result
it's a more charming work, one that feels almost effortless in its
humor and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Morning, Noon and Night'' Gray sings a hymn of praise to
the psychically centering properties of responsibility. Real
adulthood _ for that is what parenthood often seems to confer _
becomes him. Some people shrivel under the pressures of child care,
but Gray, no doubt supported greatly by his partner, Kathie Russo,
sees it for what it truly can be, an unlocking of another chamber
in the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage there appears to be a new bounce in his step. He even
rises from his seat, and with a boom box perched on his shoulder,
he dances to the strains of ``Chumbawamba.''
</P>
<P>
   Has this master of New York angst, author of ``Monster in a
Box,'' ``Gray's Anatomy'' and ``Swimming to Cambodia,'' gone all
squishy on us? Hardly: ``Morning, Noon and Night,'' which runs on
Sundays and Mondays at the Beaumont, is unscathed by
sentimentality. And it discourses meaningfully on such patented
Gray matters as death and chance and passing gas in public.
</P>
<P>
   As a stay-at-home dad, Gray has simply discovered the additional
intellectual challenge of getting inside the head of a
kindergartener. Children are relentlessness incarnate, and it is
the urgency of their needs and whims and questions and complaints
that casts a spell over him. In other words, in the world of
diapers and training wheels, Gray has met his match.
</P>
<P>
   The title is descriptive on several levels. Although ``Morning,
Noon and Night'' concerns itself with one day in the household over
which Gray and Ms. Russo preside in Sag Harbor, on the East End of
Long Island, it also has to do with the cycles of life _ the
rhythms of the comings and goings, the changes and constants in the
landscape, the routines of meals and baths and trips downtown for
ice cream _ that give order to the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Gray relates the monologue in his accustomed style, that is,
while seated at an oblong table with a glass of water and a copy of
the script, to which he only occasionally refers. It is apt that
the show begins with a recording of a snippet from ``Morning
Edition'' on National Public Radio, and that Gray embroiders the
tale with the stack of cassettes he slides into a tape player,
because his presentation always makes for compelling audio.
</P>
<P>
   The autumn day in 1997 that he explores is thoroughly ordinary;
the major exertions are a trip to the yard to mow the lawn, a
bicycle ride into town and a tussle with the children over a pot of
lamb stew. Yet he uses these humdrum events to get at some deeper
truths about the Meaning Of It All.
</P>
<P>
   And what he learns is that he can almost tolerate the idea of an
indifferent, incalculable cosmos as long as he share it with
Forrest, who ponders these same truths with the guileless dismay of
an innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest is Gray's older son, 5 years old at the time of the
story, and one of the three children who are the nexus of the
narrative. The others are his stepdaughter, Marissa, who is a few
years older than Forrest, and the baby, Theo, born, Gray tells us,
in Southampton Hospital on the night that TWA Flight 800 crashed
off the Long Island coast.
</P>
<P>
   The children are not merely paraded for us proudly, as if the
storyteller were showing off photos from his wallet. They are
revealed as vivid and particular human beings who happen to live
under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa is a fifth-grade drama queen, given to world-weary
summations. Forrest is an earnest philosopher who wants to know how
flies celebrate. And Theo, well, Theo's still a mere bundle of
bodily functions and squirmy demands.
</P>
<P>
   They are really just Everykids, and yet they accomplish the near
impossible; they take Gray out of himself. And it's a relief for
the rest of us, because Gray is not just a self-centered diarist
but an excellent observer of social behavior. And what he absorbs
in the fragrant air of the South Fork _ OK, it is a bit annoying
that the ``country'' he moves to is the Hamptons _ has the feel of
something grandly worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day he's exhausted, ``and I haven't even gone
to work.'' Oh, sure he has. In the raising of young ones, it's Gray
who's grown up.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: BERLIN'S BRIEF DAWN, BEFORE THE DARKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture,
1890-1918,'' a show that opens Sunday at the Jewish Museum, should
be a required course in every New Yorker's education. Without an
appreciation of the German capital's past, New York City's history
remains incomprehensible. Its glass skyscrapers, its cosmopolitan
tradition, its appetite for novelty and change spring partly from
seeds that were planted a century ago in Berlin's swampy soil.
Civics class doesn't come better than this deeply intelligent
homage to our cultural forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by a guest curator, Emily Bilski, ``Berlin
Metropolis'' covers a relatively brief period. It recounts a
chapter in the history of cosmopolitanism, the forging of cultural
ties between sophisticated Berliners and their counterparts in
other European cities. Though the show highlights the part played
by Jews, the story it tells could be the story of all outsiders who
gravitate toward cities in search of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Many museumgoers are familiar with the art of the Weimar
Republic, the democratic interlude between World War I and the
Third Reich. ``Berlin Metropolis'' covers the years when modernism
took root. The founding of new galleries, publishing houses and
theaters; the display of advanced art from France and Italy; the
rich street life of newspapers, cafes and shop windows: these
developments remade a backwater Prussian town into the capital of
open minds.
</P>
<P>
   Here the very image of the modern city would be defined. To
reconstruct that image, Ms. Bilski has assembled more than 200
paintings, stage designs, sheet-music covers, gallery catalogs,
photographs, sculptures and other objects in an installation of
great sensitivity designed by Joel Sanders, a New York architect.
In addition to works produced by Berlin's artists and collected by
the city's affluent patrons, the exhibition includes paintings by
Boccioni, Munch, Kandinsky and other European artists.
Presentations of their work in Berlin helped spark the new
cosmopolis into being.
</P>
<P>
   The show starts with an enlarged panoramic photograph of
Alexanderplatz, a center of Jewish life. Proceeding through the
galleries is like watching the city turn inside out. From posters
that enlivened the streets of Berlin we proceed to galleries,
cafes, cabarets and to the private salons where the modern spirit
was nurtured behind the Wilhelmine facades. And we witness the
strengthening of links between Berlin and other cities throughout
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the show's entrance we're greeted by the artistic
equivalent of the Wilhelmine facade: two paintings that represent
the imperial court's preferred academic style.
</P>
<P>
   One is a portrait of Kaiser Wilhelm II himself, painted by Vilma
Parlaghy in 1895. Mustache bristling, an eagle flapping atop his
helmet, a sword glinting at his side, the kaiser poses for an
inadvertent study in the hysteria of hereditary power overtaken by
cultural change. Excuse me, sir, but there appears to be an eagle
sitting on your head.
</P>
<P>
   The second painting, by Anton von Werner, is a genre scene of a
family banquet, executed in an inert classical style: the dead
exhuming the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The kaiser had opinions about art. They were conservative but
not satanic. He believed that all those angels and eagles really
could uplift the public's spirit and strengthen its moral fiber. To
us, his view may appear moralistic rather than moral. But the idea
that art has a political dimension isn't alien to our time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grunewald Lake,'' the painting that mobilized Berliners into
opposing the imperial style, is not included in the show. Walter
Leistikov, the artist who painted it, is represented by a similar
example of his work, an 1898 landscape, ``Lake in the Mark
Brandenburg.'' The picture is hardly a fierce explosion in a
shingle factory (the explosions would come later) but an
impressionistic view of water and trees. The year it was painted,
however, members of the Royal Academy of Art refused to accept
``Grunewald Lake'' for its annual salon. In response, 65 artists
and patrons formed the Berlin Secession, the first of several
organizations dedicated to promoting modern work.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after similar organizations in Vienna and Munich, the
Berlin Secession became part of cosmopolitanism's connective
tissue. Though the secession movement became linked to Jugendstil,
the German version of Art Nouveau, the Berlin group did not sponsor
any particular aesthetic. Nor did it harbor a political agenda.
(The work of Kathe Kollwitz, represented here by two drawings, is
an exception.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bilski says, however, that the promotion of modern art was
far more politically charged in Berlin than in other European
cities. In this Prussian city of the royal household, the
opposition to the new was more intense. And it was the opponents
who stood to gain by politicizing modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism was a pronounced strain in that opposition.
Throughout the period, Jews were restricted from entering many
spheres of public life. They held no positions at court, could not
serve in the military, the justice system or the government
bureaucracy and were only rarely hired by the universities. They
werealready a counterculture before modern art entered the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   But the rise of cosmopolitanism extended Jewish participation
deeply into the secular sphere. The counterculture became the
culture, period. It lived up to the ideal of Bildung, the idea that
life is an ongoing education. But cosmopolitanism also lent itself
to exploitation by those for whom terms like internationalism and
alien art became racist code words.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The heart of ``Berlin Metropolis'' is devoted to the work of
Herwarth Walden, an artistic impresario and publisher of Der Sturm,
an avant-garde journal. Founded in 1910, the journal quickly became
Berlin's leading medium for the dissemination of modern art and
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Walden opened a gallery of the same name and, in
a series of exhibitions, offered Berliners a look at the most
advanced art in Europe. At the Jewish Museum, we get to see the
impact of this work on Expressionism, Germany's major contribution
to the modernism of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Thus on one wall we see Giacomo Balla's 1912 painting ``Dynamism
of a Dog on a Leash,'' shown at Der Sturm that same year, while
around the corner hangs a group of drawings by the Berlin artist
Ludwig Meidner. In Balla's and Meidner's work there is the same
nervous energy, the same reliance on urban imagery to capture the
anxiety of changing times.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly indebted to Futurism, Meidner's drawings also
reflect the view of visiting French artists who convinced their
Berlin counterparts that a soft, French Impressionist style could
not effectively render the dynamism of the German capital. Windows
flashing by, streets observed from the vantage point of trains
whooshing along the city's viaducts: these were the images
Berliners ought to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakob Steinhardt's 1913 painting ``The City,'' those windows
and streets are haunted by the shadows of the damned and the
doomed: carousers, prostitutes, sociopaths. This is the dark side
of cosmopolitan glamour: restlessness, isolation, sweat-box
apartments, screams in the night.
</P>
<P>
   These images are more than renderings. They are steps toward the
invention of a new view of urban life. Fast travel, fast talk,
moving pictures, streetscapes where fashion and advertising have
begun to displace architecture: these had already created an
environment of accelerating stimulation. The imperial city, the
industrial city and the informational city converged upon one
another like a pileup on the historical time line. Artists tried to
make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, an art show can't reproduce the cafes and cabarets
where much of the liveliest art unfolded. Nor can it recreate the
impact of newspapers during that era. There were more than 100
papers in turn-of-the-century Berlin. People read them as daily
guides to the new metropolis. A few images in the show illustrate
that papers and cafes were part of a whole. Offering more than
coffee and news, they helped to shape a new kind of social space, a
psychological mingling of private and social spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Given the revolutionary temper of the art on view, the museum's
presentation is surprisingly understated. The restraint adds
enormously to the show's power. We bring a lot of baggage to it. We
know the fate of Berlin's Jews. We can scarcely think of them
without envisioning Kristallnacht and other, worse horrors that lay
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin Metropolis'' doesn't let these memories slip away
entirely, but neither does it press them up against the face. You
can lose yourself in the strengths of modern art, pull back to
admire the entire cosmopolitan picture and then reframe the picture
within the context of the Holocaust to come. The result is a
measured immersion in empathy, a plunge into awe, apprehension and
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of loss extends beyond that Berlin to the New York of
the present day. ``Berlin Metropolis'' gives us a glimpse at a city
that was once poised to become the cultural capital of the 20th
century. On leaving the show, we step into the city that eventually
claimed that role. But New York's flame, too, has been guttering in
recent years. The city has been coasting on a reputation it earned
in the postwar decades. Nearly as much time separates us from the
Seagram Building as divides the Seagram Building from ``The City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin Metropolis'' ends with a quiet coda: a grainy newspaper
photograph of Max Lieberman, the founding president of the Berlin
Secession, now an old man. Lieberman is shown leaving a polling
station in 1932. Behind him is the poster to end all posters: a
placard created for Hitler's campaign in the 1932 elections. You
can make out only part of the little corporal's name. But the
glimpse suffices to create the haunting sensation that Berlin's
political life has receded into the blurry background of modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918'' opens
on Sunday and remains at the Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd
Street, (212) 423-3200, through April 23. On Sunday from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. the museum is sponsoring a symposium, ``No Place for
Cosmopolitans?'' The fee is $22; $20 for students and the elderly.

PAPERS SHOW STATE PANEL AGGRESSIVELY SOUGHT COMMUNISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Newly released documents on purported
subversives and communists show that anger and fear were persistent
themes throughout hearings held by a California legislative
committee between 1941 and 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was a harbinger of the Un-American Activities
Committee in the House of Representatives, the panel that destroyed
lives and careers in its search for communists during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The California committee went after union leaders, the mayor of
San Francisco, Hollywood screenwriters and producers,
Italian-American organizations suspected of supporting fascism, the
Klu Klux Klan, Japanese-Americans and, as the 1960s progressed,
more and more university students.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, known formally as the Joint and Senate
Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, kept track of
where people went, which newspapers and magazines they received,
their friends and where they worked. They questioned the
allegiances of extraordinary people, such as actor Paul Robeson and
songwriter Ira Gershwin, and they went after ordinary people, such
as Alice Hamburg of Berkeley, a member of the PTA and a mother of
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you recall the license number of your automobile?'' a
committee member asked Hamburg in 1951. The committee already knew,
of course, because Hamburg was spotted attending a reception hosted
by the East Bay Council for Arts, Sciences and Professions, which
the committee suspected of subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Robeson, a suspected communist, attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 20,000 Californians were spied upon and
investigated by the committee, which was formed in 1939 and
continued until it was abolished in 1971. Although hundreds of
documents, notes and transcripts remain sealed, more than 8,000
pages of testimony from public hearings were released Wednesday in
response to a lawsuit by the California First Amendment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reveal that no segment of American life was unaffected by
this, that no sphere of life was immune from scrutiny,'' State
Archivist Walter Gray said. ``It wasn't just entertainers and
intellectuals called before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was doctors and union leaders and teachers and shipyard
workers and a wide cross section of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every witness was hostile. On May 25, 1942, Assemblyman Jack
B. Tenney of Inglewood and his panel sat unquestioningly through a
presentation by Carmelo Zito, publisher of an anti-fascist
newspaper in San Francisco called Il Corriere del Popolo. Zito
explained how every other prominent person of Italian descent was a
fascist.
</P>
<P>
   When an Italian school director said Zito's accusations were
false, Tenney responded: ``Why was it necessary to teach (the
students) about a foreign country if they were American citizens?''
Because, said the director, their parents wanted them to learn
about their ancestral culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the Japanese say too,'' Tenney replied darkly,
nearly six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Zito also said he repeatedly saw San Francisco Mayor Angelo
Rossi giving fascist salutes at gatherings. An angry Rossi later
testified before the committee, saying people often would ask him
to wave toward a crowd and then photograph him with his hand in the
air, as if he were giving the salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only perfection I have ever asserted,'' Rossi told the
committee, ``is the perfection of my loyalty to my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Even given the hysterical mood of the time, some testimony
bordered on bizarre. The committee spent a great deal of time in
May 1942 investigating a scam racket called Mankind United, run by
a charismatic leader named Arthur L. Bell. In 1943, Bell was
convicted of sedition for promoting fascism and ``posing as a
quasi-religious group to perpetrate a hoax and fraud of gigantic
proportions,'' according to the U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee met in Fresno a year before Bell's
conviction, Mankind United member Chester C. Cook was questioned at
length by Tenney:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cook, have you any information at all, directly or
indirectly, about several mysterious mechanisms that have been
developed by the research department of Mankind United ... which
are alleged to be so powerful they can immediately halt the actual
war?''
</P>
<P>
   Cook responded that he didn't know of any mechanisms, but ``I
understand there might be inventions or might be forces or
vibrations or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Assemblyman Hugh M. Burns popped in: ``Mr. Cook, do you
know anything about the hidden race of little men with metallic
heads that are supposed to play a part in the final accomplishment
of Mankind United's goal?
</P>
<P>
   Cook replied: ``Now, I think that's a hot dream.''

 &HT;    AIR FORCE STILL BUYING MILLIONS OF UNNEEDED PARTS, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time when some military aircraft have been
grounded for lack of critical spare parts, a new government report
says the Air Force is continuing to buy $384 million worth of other
parts and gear that are no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   Excess jet engine rotors and blades as well as disc brakes were
among the hundreds of items piling up in storage, the U.S. General
Accounting Office said this week in its latest of a series of
scathing reports on mismanagement of the Pentagon's vast
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that the Air
Force keeps such poor track of its equipment that it has no
accurate count of its own surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Air Force tried to save money by canceling an
order for three data entry keyboards that were no longer needed.
But the thrift effort was foiled after officials discovered that
the three keyboards, costing more than $162,000 each, had been
delivered a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A second such case involved thermal insulation tiles specially
made for the high-tech B-2 bomber. Purchasing officials tried to
cancel an order for seven of the tiles, which cost $5,400 apiece,
because the Air Force now uses an updated type of tile. As it
turned out, the outmoded tiles had been delivered the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correcting these problems would made more funds available
where needs are not being met,'' concluded the GAO. The report
urges the Air Force to reform its tracking system, speed up
cancellations of unnecessary purchases, reduce inventory
requirements for some items and reuse more parts from weapons
systems that are no longer part of the active fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms got a mixed review at the Defense Department, which
agreed on the need to reform record keeping but rejected the call
for reducing stockpile requirements or reusing old parts more
often.

 &HT;    MATCHING FUNDS PUT GORE AHEAD IN THE DEMOCRATIC MONEY RACE

   WASHINGTON _ Former basketball star Bill Bradley hopes to widen
his campaign money lead over Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic
presidental rival, in a giant sports celebrity fund-raiser at New
York's Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But that much-ballyhooed cash advantage is somewhat illusory. So
far, Gore is eligible to receive considerably more matching federal
matching money on Jan. 1, just one month before New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   If that cash advantage materializes, it will give Gore a big
advantage in next year's compressed campaign season, when
candidates must spend heavily on advertising to deliver their
message in big states coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sept. 30, the vice president was eligible for an
estimated $9.2 million from the Federal Election Commission (FEC),
and campaign aides calculate that the final figure will be between
$13 million and $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, was eligible for only an estimated
$5.8 million in federal funds as of Sept. 30. His campaign did not
respond last week to a request for estimates of the final tally.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.4 million difference in eligible matching funds more than
wipes out Bradley's $379,461 lead in cash on hand in FEC reports
filed at the end of the year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates reported having about $10 million, even though
Bradley had raised millions less.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that Gore outspent Bradley by nearly $6 million
through September. While he was paying top dollar to a legion of
advisers, he was also building campaign organizations in California
and the South, where Bradley has only recently begun to organize.
</P>
<P>
   The release of those figures prompted a spate of news accounts
about Gore's high-priced campaign, culminating in the vice
president trimming his staff, cutting salaries and moving his
headquarters from Washington to cheaper digs in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But even as aides carried out these cost-saving measures, they
were looking forward to a financial windfall next year.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning of his presidential campaign, Gore has
targeted smaller donors in order to maximize his eligibility for a
cash infusion from the FEC in the critical weeks before the
presidential voting begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a real commitment to raising our money from small
donors,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``We're working within
the system and doing the kind of things the system was set up to
promote.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the campaign finance reforms spawned by the Watergate
scandal, candidates for president who abide by spending limits
receive matching funds from the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   The government matches up to $250 per contribution. Thus, four
$250 contributions are worth $1,000 in matching funds while a
$1,000 contribution, the maximum allowed from any individual,
yields only $250.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the
Republican nomination, has opted not to operate within the FEC
guidelines. His contributions have exceeded $50 million so far,
shattering all records. One of Bush's GOP opponents, millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, is also forgoing matching funds in a
largely self-financed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Big donors constituted 76.3 percent of Gore's givers during the
first three quarters of 1999, compared to 73.8 percent of
Bradley's. But Gore also has a larger percentage of small donors
than Bradley: 13.4 percent gave the vice president $200 or less,
while only 7 percent of Bradley's contributors fell into that
category.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not begin targeting small donors until last summer,
but did so successfully, nearly doubling the amount of federal
matching funds for which he was eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significant increase in the number of small donors ... is
a testament to the increase in support we are seeing at the grass
roots level,'' said Bradley campaign chairman Douglas Berman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fund-raising event at Madison Square, while largely
geared toward big donors, has also been designed to maximize
federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   One thousand dollars buys courtside seats and entrance to a
``VIP'' reception with such sports legends as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Bob Cousey, Julius Irving, Bill Russell, Joe Namath and John
McEnroe. ``MVP'' seats go for $500. But there are also $250
``All-Star'' tickets and $100 ``Fan'' seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's lead in qualifying for federal matching funds was a
key element in the campaign's successful pitch to organized labor
leaders in winning the AFL-CIO endorsement this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane dismissed suggestions that Gore's campaign is strapped
for cash to contest the compressed primary schedule. Sixteen states
have primaries, caucuses or conventions scheduled on March 7,
including New York, California, Ohio, Massachusetts and Georgia.
That will essentially require the candidates to run national
campaigns in the weeks following New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore campaign is going to have enough money to carry its
message forward,'' Lehane said. Including the anticipated federal
matching funds, the Gore campaign can raise only about $3 more
million in the final quarter of 1999 to hit the $40 million ceiling
the FEC has placed on presidential primary spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign is still nearly $15 million short of the
$40 million cap, not including any donations in the final quarter
that might be eligible for matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the campaign is on target to raise ``what we
believe we need to raise for a competitive campaign,'' said Bradley
spokesperson Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bradley's surprising fund-raising prowess has been one
of the key factors in his strong challenge to the vice president.
His early fund-raising success was ``a sign of credibility,'' said
Don Simon of Common Cause, a campaign watchdog group.

 &HT;    PALESTINIANS PUT MRS. CLINTON IN STATEHOOD HOT-SEAT
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton only
scheduled one Palestinian stop compared to eight in Israel during
her two-day trip here. But, Palestinians Thursday used it give her
an earful on the sensitive subject of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   She sat with a tight grin as three speakers, including the wife
of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, reminded her of
controversial comments she made last year endorsing the idea of
Palestinian statehood. It is an issue that has cast a shadow over
Clinton's likely bid for a U.S. Senate seat from New York next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton was headed for her next stop in Jordan
Thursday night, Israeli press were reporting bitter rebukes from
Israeli leaders at the Palestinian statements and speculating on
the trip's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it was a successful visit, she'll only know
next November,'' said one television report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and her aides have stressed that she was visiting Israel
as the first lady, as she has to many other countries, not as a
candidate. She and daughter Chelsea came here aboard a military
airplane and the trip is paid for by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The statehood issue came up when Clinton came to this West Bank
Palestinian city to mark the award of a $3.8 million U.S. grant to
a health program for mothers and babies.
</P>
<P>
   Before about 100 invited guests, Clinton was hosted by Suha
Arafat, wife of the Palestinian leader, who railed against the
Israeli spread of cancer-causing toxic chemicals and use of tear
gas by ``Israeli occupational forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat called for an independent state before presenting Clinton
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Clinton told a video-conference of Arab, Israeli and
other youth that she thought peace would be easier to obtain if the
Palestinians had their own state.
</P>
<P>
   Though that opinion is common among Israelis, it prompted
criticism from Jewish groups in the United States and appeared to
present an obstacle to winning key Jewish support in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a step further than U.S. policy, which states that
statehood should be worked out under the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later stated that she believes Jerusalem should remain
the undivided capital of Israel. This pleased many pro-Israel
Americans but disappointed Palestinians, who want Israel to share
the city. It also is a step further than U.S. policy, which has not
recognized the disputed city as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ramallah meeting, Clinton stayed on broad themes of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say, on behalf of the President and the
administration, that you can count on the United States and the
strong U.S.-Palestinian relationship as you move forward on the
path to peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She invited other speakers to tell her about Palestinian health
needs and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jihad Mashal, a director of one of the groups receiving the
grant, told Clinton that real development cannot occur until the
Palestinians had a state of their own with Jerusalem as the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the next time you visit us, we will host you in our
homeland of Palestine in our capital city of Jerusalem,'' he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Riad Zanoun expanded on the help Palestinians
have received from the United States, including the work of staff
from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, who helped stem a cholera epidemic here four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton, our First Lady and great lady, I want to remind
you the words you told Palestinian and Israeli youth,'' he said.
``You told them the path to a just and real peace is the
establishment of a state for the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanoun told reporters later that Palestinians want Clinton to
``stick to her original words.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not follow the speakers. An aide later said she had
no reaction other than standing by the comments she had made in her
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a
statement saying the Palestinians should save their posturing for
negotiations. One Israeli leader called Arafat's comments on
Israeli pollution ``groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Ramallah was followed by a trip to the
Western Wall, the sacred Jewish site in Jerusalem's historic Old
City.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton's stands on Palestine, she was greeted warmly
in the women's area for prayer at the Wall. The first lady and
Chelsea placed notes with prayers between the giant stones, as is
the custom, and posed for pictures amid a circle of security guards
and curious fellow worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons also visited Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial museum
for the 6 million Jews killed by Nazis in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a solemn ceremony amid the black stones of a memorial hall,
the first lady placed a wreath. She also signed the guest book,
writing: ``May God bless Israel and the Jewish people and may we
always remember _ and never forget _ that all of us must work for
peace.''

SHORT ITEMS ON WHAT IS NEW IN HOME VIDEOS

<P>
   Videodiscs Make Inroads
</P>
<P>
   With the release last week of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' digital
videodiscs made headway in a vital genre: the Steven Spielberg
movie. Though the director never said so, it was thought that he
was holding his films from DVD until it was clear that the format
would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg films are about as important to DVD as Disney
classics, and on this disc, which has behind-the-scenes clips and
other features, he does not contribute a director's commentary but
he does talk at the end of the film about the Normandy invasion and
about the National D-Day Museum, which is scheduled to open in New
Orleans in June.
</P>
<P>
   And so DVD proceeds, albeit between widely divergent indicators.
``The fastest-growing home entertainment product in history,'' read
a statement last month from the disc industry's DVD Video Group,
which said that almost four million players are expected to be in
use by the end of the year. On the other hand, research by the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association shows that 40
percent of Americans have never heard of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the growing number of players is leading to a sharp
increase in the discs available. ``We're currently seeing release
weeks with 130 new titles,'' said Guido Henkel, editor of DVD
Review, an online guide (www.dvdreview.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago it wasn't hard keeping track of them, but these
days so many independent companies are putting them out.'' The flow
from the major studios is holding steady, he said, with studios
that have supported DVD from the start releasing more films than
other studios that haven't been so enthusiastic about the format.
</P>
<P>
   Many more films are coming from larger independent companies
like Fox Lorber (Francois Truffaut's ``400 Blows'' is among the new
releases) and Anchor Bay (Werner Herzog's ``Fitzcarraldo''). But,
Henkel said, many very small distributors are contributing as
little as one film a year. ``They have classics or older films they
have leased from somewhere, from Spain or Russia,'' he said. DVD,
he added, is also attracting many direct-to-video movies.
</P>
<P>
   His site lists roughly 6,000 titles. About 1,800 of them are
sexually oriented films, a category that is flourishing on DVD as
it did on tape in the early days of video. But in their own
relatively modest way categories like documentaries, music and the
performing and fine arts are growing, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the special-interest areas there is less activity, but for at
least one company that means opportunity. David Goodman, president
of DVD International, a distributor in Mountain Lakes, N.J., said
that his company has sold 150,000 copies of a disc called ``Video
Essentials,'' which does nothing more (or less) than instruct
people on how to tune their television sets to get the maximum
performance from DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Other DVD International titles include ``More Tales of the
City,'' the Armistead Maupin television series, and ``Tender Loving
Care,'' an interactive mystery movie with clues and multiple
endings that plays like a video game. But Goodman also favors a
category he calls video wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   An example is ``Aquaria,'' a disc with tropical fish swimming
around in exotic settings. For 15 hours. ``You're not expected to
sit and watch it,'' he said. ``It's just expected to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Dr. Evil (Mike Myers, left) from destroying
Washington with a laser beam, that international man of mystery
(Myers) goes time-tripping to 1969 and teams with the agent
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). But Evil counters by stealing
Austin's ``mojo'' (loosely defined as that material that makes
Austin Austin) in, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``a
crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy that deserves its place
alongside Bill, Ted, Wayne, Garth, Ace, Mary and the Waterboy in
the Smart-Stupid Hall of Fame.'' &QL;

   Tea With Mussolini
</P>
<P>
   A diva derby unfolds in Florence, where a tight-knit group of
Englishwomen have set up their lives in the years immediately
before World War II. Mad about art and a life that has become a
hardly movable tea party, Lady Hester (Dame Maggie Smith), Arabella
(Dame Judi Dench) and Mary (Joan Plowright) are suddenly confronted
with the rise of fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Moving in and out of Franco Zeffirelli's film are Elsa (Cher), a
rich American and former Ziegfeld girl; Georgie (Lily Tomlin), a
lesbian and suntanned archaeologist, and Luca (Baird Wallace), a
teenager partly reared by Mary who proves a solid ally when the
women are uprooted. ``If `Tea With Mussolini' isn't believable for
a second, on its own glamorous terms it isn't half-bad'' (Holden).

   What prompted the eminent anthropologist and primatologist Ethan
Powell (Anthony Hopkins) to go wild and club two park rangers to
death? Learning the answer to that could propel the ambitious
psychiatrist Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to professional
renown, and so the pair settle down to a game of let's find out in
the bowels of the dank Harmony Bay Correctional Facility. ``In the
end, Powell and Caulder emerge the wiser; moviegoers, despite the
efforts of the stars, somewhat the poorer'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).

   The Loss of Sexual Innocence

<P>
   Mike Figgis' visually exquisite, intensely personal meditation
on the story of Adam and Eve begins with the pair (Femi Ogunbanjo
and Hanne Klintoe) examining their anatomical differences like
playful children before turning lustful after gorging on pulpy red
fruit from the tree of knowledge. Interwoven with this version of
the biblical tale are scenes from the life of a filmmaker named Nic
(Julian Sands) and other subplots and erotic encounters; some
sizzle and some fizzle in a film in which the ``strands of this
elliptical allegory aren't pulled tight enough'' (Holden).

<P>
   HOBEX: ``Back in the 90's'' (Slash/London Records).
</P>
<P>
   Few listeners will first hear Hobex the way this critic did: in
an enjoyably squalid bar in Columbia, S.C., in 1996, on the rowdy
college circuit below the Mason-Dixon line. Playing to drunken
fraternity boys, the Chapel Hill-based trio of alternative-pop
veterans delivered oven-fried soul far better than it should have
been. Since that night I've wondered whether a band so fine in its
context could go beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Hobex's major-label debut captures the delight of that
happenstance discovery. It's an easy album, suiting a group whose
name is used around Raleigh to mean ``enjoying the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not worrying about the risks of being a white guy playing
rhythm-and-blues, the singer, guitarist and songwriter Greg
Humphreys succeeds by letting pleasure steer his sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ware on bass and Steve Hill on drums match the casual chops
of Humphreys, sliding through songs that honor Al Green and Alex
Chilton. Horns and backup singers thicken the gravy. Humphreys can
fly solo, too, as he proves on ``It Pains Me,'' a blues that surely
has them slow dancing in dives from here to Gainesville, and
perhaps in New York, too.

 &HT;    Time with Morris Day
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 14.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What makes Morris Day tick?
</P>
<P>
   Staying busy: The performer whose outgoing personality made his
funk band the Time a double-platinum success 15 years ago hasn't
slowed down much. ``I'm doing gigs four months out of the year,''
said Day, who moved from Los Angeles to north Fulton County three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His family: Day and his wife, Judith, recently welcomed their
third son, Cameron, into the world. Their sons Derran, 10, and
Evan, 12, are active in sports and music.
</P>
<P>
   Time: You'd expect him to know what he likes when it comes to
watches. But we wanted to know more about Day's views on a favorite
topic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your favorite time of day?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd say dusk. That's the best ... seeing that transition from
day to night. I like twilight. It kind of marks the winding-down
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the best time of your life?
</P>
<P>
   A: The time (my wife and I) just went through. Witnessing the
birth of my three sons has been, by far, the highlight. It's
excitement. It's pride. It's witnessing one of the true miracles in
life. To be there when it actually happens and see them take their
first breath and all that is pretty deep.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you wish you had more time for?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never have enough time to just sit back and enjoy. The
leisure time's not there. There's not enough time for the good
times, kicking back, vacationing, being a gentleman of leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What takes up too much of your time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Airplanes and negative people. The time I spend traveling
outweighs the time I actually spend performing. If there was a way
that could be narrowed down, life would be better. And I have a
philosophy that I spread every time I have a mass of people's
attention: I always say there's no time for negativity. Whatever
you do in life, whatever your work equates to, either enjoy it or
don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you the type of person who's always early, often late or
totally punctual?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm always fashionably on time. That means I'm there when I
feel like I need to be there. That might be early or late by
somebody else's standards, and more than likely late by others'
standards. ... It's fashionably on time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much time have you spent on this earth?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm under 50 and over 20, somewhere nicely situated between
those numbers. It's more of a frame of mind, and I feel much
younger than the number would reflect. So why put it out there for
everybody to dwell on?

 &HT;    Entertainer Morris Day on the watch for wristwear
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 14.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Somewhere, at some party this New Year's Eve, Morris
Day is gonna scream ``What time is it?'' with Nostradaman urgency,
and everyone within hearing distance will take it as a signal to
dance.
</P>
<P>
   So, who better than the front man for that evergreen funk group
the Time to help the men who give a da-yum about how they look pick
the appropriate timepiece to consult 'round midnight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as concerned with time as the band's name might make
you think,'' Day said recently from a room at Northside Hospital,
where his wife, Judith, had just delivered their third child.
``But, believe me, when the time comes I handle my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on the day Day took us watch-shopping in Atlanta, he
arrived roughly three minutes late. But only because the chauffeur
of his stretch Suburban, Tim Jefferson, had his hands full
navigating the 20-foot vehicle through midday traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody bring me a mirror: Day's black-and-white spectator
shoes matched the paint job of his ride. His red silk suit,
however, didn't always coordinate with all the watches he tried on.
His critiques of timepieces went accordingly: The dressier the
better. Though reserved (shy even) in private, the man's got a
public image to uphold. Doing so successfully ever since his
group's best-selling album ``Ice Cream Castle'' came out in 1984 is
what kept the autograph-seekers coming as we toured Lenox Square
Mall and Phipps Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   1. FRANK AND EARNEST: The $10,210 Frank Muller-designed watch at
the Versace boutique was ``sharp,'' Day said; ``I'm feeling it with
a black suit and a black T-shirt.'' But its cost took him aback:
``At that price, I guess the diamonds are implied.''
</P>
<P>
   2. GOLD STANDARD: At Cartier, Day tried on the diamond-encrusted
Tank Frances watch (``$26,900 ... is that all?'') and commented,
``It certainly complements my pinkie ring. ... We're definitely in
dressy territory here.''
</P>
<P>
   3. TANK TOPS: Day thought Cartier's limited-edition Tank
Basculante watch with blue alligator straps ($4,700) was ``very
classy. This is something I'd wear with a nice sports jacket and an
open-collared shirt ... sort of pimp-style ... and I'd wear my blue
gator shoes to match the band.''
</P>
<P>
   4. OFF THE CUFF: Because he was wearing a French-cuffed shirt,
Day had to try on Tateossian's functional clock cuff links ($188)
at Neiman Marcus for size. ``The more you accessorize, the dressier
you look,'' he explained. ``I'd go a little redundant and still
wear a watch with them.''
</P>
<P>
   5. G-WHIZ: ``Even though the stripes go well with the suit, this
one's just not me,'' Day remarked after trying on Gucci's
canvas-strapped watch with the big ``G'' face ($898) at Neiman
Marcus. ``I could see someone like Lenny Kravitz wearing this.''
</P>
<P>
   6. HIP CHECK: ``If I was doing something like camping _ which I
don't normally do _ this one would come in handy,'' Day said of the
clip-on digital pocket watch ($45) he tried at the Guess store.
``I'd give it as a gift. You can't beat the price. Somebody would
think you spent $150 to $200 for this.''

 &HT;    Authors pen girls' guide to looking really `Swell'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 14.
 &HT;    By Goutami Hyma Mikkilineni
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a word for the sort of girl who looks as comfortable
dressed for a ballroom setting as she does in some seedy bar. It's
``swell.'' Or so say womenswear designer Cynthia Rowley and New
York Times style editor Ilene Rosenzweig, who've penned ``Swell: A
Girl's Guide to the Good Life'' (Warner Books, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   Staunch proponents of ``girl power'' _ typified by the
now-defunct Spice Girls, HBO's ``Sex and the City'' series and the
best-selling ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' _ the co-authors share tips
and anecdotes for living as if you haven't a care. Don't have a
clear sense of personal style? Refer to the way you dressed as an
adolescent, they advise. Find some jelly beans in a flavor you
crave at the bottom of your purse? Take inspiration from them to
devise your spring wardrobe's color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tailor your clothing to your body, not the other way around,''
Rowley and Rosenzweig write. ``If you have a power bootay, and the
confidence to match, make a clingy skirt your deadliest weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides sharing such secrets as how to enhance your bust line
with tape and paint your lips so they're irresistibly kissable,
``Swell'' also offers guidance on dating, socializing, hostessing
and dieting (``say yes to dessert'').
</P>
<P>
   The book may strike women with responsibilities _ such as work,
marriage and/or children _ as too frivolous to take seriously. But
it might make a good gift. And friends may want to purchase it the
``swell'' girl way: dividing the cost and sharing it.

 &HT;    VETERANS GATHER AT FUTURE SITE OF WWII MEMORIAL
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are dying at a rate of 1,000 a day, these
grandfathers who survived Normandy and Iwo Jima and the other epic
battles of World War II, and some spoke sadly Thursday about old
comrades who would never see the shrine to their heroism and
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame it didn't happen 20 or 30 years ago,'' said
Fred Boswell, a World War II veteran from Ozark, Ala., as he walked
toward the planned site of the National World War II Memorial. ``So
many more of us would have been able to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   So why has it taken over half a century to memoralize the 16
million Americans who served in the war that many historians regard
as the defining event of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we just didn't want to pat ourselves on the back,''
said Boswell, 76.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering where ground will be broken in a year the World
War II Memorial was among several Veterans Day events around the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony across the Potomac River in Arlington National
Cemetary, President Clinton saluted the last World War II veteran
still on active duty. Capt. Earl Fox, a Coast Guard doctor who
served in the Navy during World War II, is set to retire next week
at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   ''Captain, on behalf of a grateful nation, we say thank you for
your service,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On this gray, chilly day, the president recalled that ``we
celebrate Veterans Day on the anniversary of the armistice ending
World War I, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.''
</P>
<P>
   That was to have been the war to end all wars. But, of course,
it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days and years that have followed, men and women forged
from the same mettle in every branch of our military have built on
those sacrifices and stood for the cause of freedom, from World War
II, to Korea, to Vietnam, to Kuwait City, to Kosovo,'' said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting peace would be the best legacy for those who fought
America's wars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than two months we'll be able to say the conflict and
bloodshed that took so many American lives came from another
century,'' the president said. ``So we gather today for the last
time in this century to dedicate ourselves to being good stewards
of the sacrifice of the veterans of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the Arlington ceremony was Army Command
Sgt. Maj. Ronald Bedford who was on the final day of a 10-week walk
to raise support for the World War II Memorial. After Clinton's
speech, Beford continued a journey that began at Fort Rucker, Ala.,
and ended at the planned site of the memorial -- on the Mall
between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only walked in the shadow a generation -- those who fought
and those who served on the homefront in World War II,'' said
Bedford. Among those, he said, was ``my hero, my dad'' -- James E.
Beford, a World War II vet.
</P>
<P>
   Most World War II veterans are now in their 70s and 80s and
their ranks are dwindling fast. Of the 16 million Americans who
served in uniform during the war, fewer than 7 million remain
alive. More than 400,000 were killed in the war. The Department of
Veterans Affairs estimates the death rate now at slightly more than
1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Clinton signed legislation authorizing the World War II
Memorial. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who was wounded in World War II, is
heading a campaign to raise $100 million in private donations for
the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the home stretch,'' Dole said Thursday. ``A year from
today, we'll be breaking ground. Three years from today, we'll be
dedicating the World War II memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   America's World War II generation grew up during the Depression,
defeated Hitler, Mussolini and imperialist Japan, then built up a
postwar economic superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II Memorial will be ``a long-overdue tribute to
America's greatest generation,'' said Bob Patrick, a member of the
American Battle Monuments Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Boswell began the walk with Bedford in Alabama on the 54th
anniversary V-J Day, which marked the surrender of Japan and the
end of the war. An Air Force veteran, he came up to Washington to
walk the final miles on Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing is that 1,000 of us die every day,'' he said.
``By the time we get (the memorial) finished in two years, another
three quarters of a million will be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   ``My hero, my dad'' James E. Bedford, a World War II veteran.
</P>
<P>
   walk began on the 54th anniversary of V-J Day, the day that
Japan surrendered and the war ended.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among connoisseurs of 18th-century European
furniture, the gold standard has always been French pieces,
especially one-of-a-kind works signed by the top cabinetmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``French furniture remains the best, always,'' said Brigitte
Saby, a Paris decorator.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Victoria, a top Manhattan dealer in French furniture, said:
``There are a lot of signed pieces; a unique signed piece is a
different thing. That's where the value is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the French Revolution and two world wars, a lot of
superlative 18th-century French furniture survives, and references
to the best pieces can often be found in 200-year-old inventories
of furniture commissioned or acquired by the crown. With proper
detective work, experts like Patrick Leperlier of Christie's France
can trace a piece from the cabinetmaker's hands to its designated
palace to its current owner.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next month, Christie's and Sotheby's are auctioning
some prime 18th-century French pieces. Sotheby's starts the ball
rolling in Friday's French furniture sale.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Anne Getty of San Francisco have consigned a Louis
XVI ormolu-mounted black lacquer secretary and commode (circa 1785)
attributed to Bernard Molitor (1755-1833), a German-born furniture
maker who worked in Paris. The secretary is a secretaire a
abattant, a writing cabinet that stands against the wall and
resembles a cupboard when the fall-front is closed. This one has a
Japanese lacquer panel showing a basket of flowers on its fall
front. The cupboard doors beneath have lacquer panels with delicate
mountain landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The matching chest of drawers is known as a commode a vantaux, a
chest with doors that hide the drawers behind them. The door panels
depict flowers and birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``French furniture makers and dealers put in open orders for
Japanese or Chinese lacquer panels; they came on ships as
ballast,'' said Phillips Hathaway, senior vice president for French
and Continental furniture at Sotheby's New York.
</P>
<P>
   Molitor was one of the few furniture makers who worked for both
the French monarchy and Napoleon's empire. He did not often stamp
his work _ he would not have been required to sign any work done
for the monarchy _ so attributions must be based on stylistic
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway said the secretaire and commode were typical of
Molitor's work ``in the severe, straight lines of the cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The two pieces are estimated to sell for a combined $800,000 to
$1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another lot in the sale, No. 314, is an unusual flat- and
leather-topped Louis XIV writing table, or bureau plat.
</P>
<P>
   Made around 1710, the desk has flared cabriole legs with
scrolled acanthus mounts of ormolu, or gilded bronze, attributed to
Andre-Charles Boulle (1642-1732).
</P>
<P>
   Boulle is considered the first great French-born cabinetmaker.
Before his time, foreigners from the Netherlands or Italy generally
held the French court's eye _ and pocketbook. Boulle was a master
at creating sumptuous, monumental furniture, and he won several
commissions for Louis XIV's palaces, including Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   The writing desk is almost entirely covered in engraved brass
marquetry, known as Boulle marquetry though the maker did not
invent it. What he did was perfect a 16th-century Italian
technique, which involved gluing together sheets of brass and
tortoise shell, then cutting away the top layer so designs pop out
against the dark underlayer.
</P>
<P>
   This desk has cutouts of brass cornflowers and whimsical foliate
tracery.
</P>
<P>
   Boulle was widely copied in the 19th century, but nothing is
comparable in value to the real thing. The estimate is $1.5 million
to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's has two fall sales with important French furniture.
The first, in New York on Thursday, includes pieces from the
estates of Sybil Harrington, the Texas philanthropist who financed
many productions at the Metropolitan Opera, and R. Thornton Wilson,
a descendant of John Jacob Astor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the offerings are two Boulle desks circa 1690 with Boulle
brass and red tortoise shell inlay as well as a rare Boulle
brass-inlaid ebony and tortoise-shell regulateur, a clock
considered so accurate that it can be used to set other timepieces.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's catalog says the regulateur may have been
commissioned around 1710 by Louis XIV's cousin, Prince Henri-Jules
de Bourbon-Conde, for the Palais du Petit Luxembourg in Paris. It
has a marquetry case similar to drawings by Boulle. The clock's
front has an ormolu Saturn-mask mount and brass inlay with foliage
and scrollwork.
</P>
<P>
   On offer in another Christie's fall sale, to be held in Monaco
on Dec. 11, is the collection of Akram Ojjeh, who was a Paris-based
Syrian businessman and an adviser to Saudi kings. Some of Ojjeh's
furniture will be on view Saturday through Monday at Christie's New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The show-stopper is a Louis XVI ebony and boulle- marquetry
commode decorated with colorful Italian stone mosaic panels and
elegant brass mounts.
</P>
<P>
   The central panel is framed with a garland of fruits fashioned
from semiprecious stones. The commode is stamped with two great
names in French furniture: Martin Carlin and Adam Weisweiler, both
from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin had settled in Paris by 1759 and was one of Louis XVI's
most accomplished craftsmen. Weisweiler established himself in
Paris about 1778 and made furniture for Parisian dealers like
Dominique Daguerre, who then sold it to such clients as Marie
Antoinette and the future George IV of England.
</P>
<P>
   The Parisian dealer Maurice Segoura, who sold the commode to
Ojjeh in 1983, said he considered the commode the most important
piece of French furniture made in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cator, a director at Christie's, said, ``It's a rare
combination to have Boulle marquetry with pietra dura plaques, but
it was the fashion of the time to take things off of Louis XIV
furniture and reuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the commode was probably one of the three such pieces
sold at Christie's in 1791 after the French Revolution, adding that
the other two belong to the Queen of England.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is $2.5 to $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another top lot is a magnificent Louis XVI sycamore commode
stamped by Jean-Francois Leleu. The unique piece has been owned by
several famous collectors. It has flared sides and marquetry inlays
of amaranth, rosewood and satinwood. The marquetry depicts acanthus
leaves (echoed in the bronze drawer pulls) and vines with grapes, a
motif picked up in the ormolu frieze on the apron.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is estimated to sell for $2 million to $2.8 million.

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Museum for Modernism
</P>
<P>
   All the pieces are in place for a new museum to open on Fifth
Avenue at 86th Street next fall. The institution has the lavish
Louis XIII-style building at 1048 Fifth Avenue; a name, the Neue
Galerie New York, and a mission, to show German and Austrian fine
and decorative art, with an emphasis on works from the first half
of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   There are also co-directors: Renee Price, who was the director
of the former Sabarsky Gallery in New York, and Gerwald Sonnberger,
director of the Museum of Modern Art in Passau, Germany, and a
co-founder of the Egon Schiele Center in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's president is well known to the art world: Ronald S.
Lauder, the cosmetic magnate who is also the chairman of the Museum
of Modern Art in Manhattan and one of the leading American
collectors of German and Austrian art.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a museum like this anywhere,'' Lauder said. ``This
will give the public an in-depth look at an important period in
modern art.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the museum was developed by Lauder and Serge
Sabarsky, an art dealer who was a leading authority on German and
Austrian Expressionism until his death in 1996. Sabarsky and
Lauder, who met in 1967, talked for years about starting such a
museum. In 1994 the Serge Sabarsky Foundation and Lauder bought the
five-story brick-and-limestone building, built in 1914, for $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Carrere &AMP; Hastings, the architects of the New York
Public Library, the museum was once a mansion that had more
recently belonged to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.
Annabelle Selldorf, an architect who has designed several Manhattan
galleries, is to renovate the building, which has been designated a
city landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's name indicates its twin allegiances: to New York
City and to the Central European culture on which its exhibitions
will be based. The museum plans to print all walls labels,
brochures and catalogs in English and German. Its hours will be
Fridays through Mondays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. with $10 admission.
</P>
<P>
   On view will be works from Sabarsky's estate and from the
museum's collection. The estate will lend the museum its collection
and will give its works to the museum over time, said Lauder, who
is also buying works for the museum. Last month at Sotheby's in
London he bought an Otto Dix portrait for the museum because it did
not have one.
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans to hang two special exhibitions a year. The
first is called ``A Selection of Works From the Neue Galerie New
York'' and will feature works by Klimt, Schiele, Kandinsky and Klee
as well as decorative arts from the Wiener Werkstatte and the
Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder, who has been chairman of the Museum of Modern Art since
1995, has a large collection of Austrian and German art that he is
planning to make available to the new museum. He said that his
alliances with the two institutions would help both, and that the
museums could work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collection is already the finest of its kind,'' Lauder
said of the Neue Galerie's works. ``Many of these things have never
been seen by the public before.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Larger Format &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big changes are in store for the International Center of
Photography. It has sold its building, a city landmark at Fifth
Avenue and 94th Street, where it has galleries, a school and
offices, and plans to expand its 10-year-old branch at 43rd Street
and the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The center is also starting an $11 million capital campaign
pegged to its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been struggling for a great many years with the issue of
space,'' said Willis Hartshorn, the director. ``Our Fifth Avenue
building, with its landmark status, has a limited footprint. We
could renovate it but we wouldn't get much more space.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to name the buyer of the Fifth Avenue building or
the price. The institution will be allowed to stay in the building
for two more years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Its $5 million expansion in midtown will be designed by Gwathmey
Siegel &AMP; Associates, the Manhattan architects who oversaw the
expansion of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The project will
provide an additional 14,500 square feet by moving ground-floor
storage and offices to the 12th and 14th floors.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation of the ground floor will add a cafe, which has
been lacking, and a bigger bookshop. The expanded 43rd Street space
will be larger than the combined public spaces of the center's
current Midtown location and its Fifth Avenue building. The midtown
space will close on Sunday and is expected to reopen in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our collection has doubled from 25,000 works to 50,000,''
Hartshorn said. ``We needed more storage space to accommodate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the center's expansion, the midtown space will not
house the school, which needs larger quarters to meet its growing
enrollment. A new home is being sought.
</P>
<P>
   The capital campaign has raised $8.2 million of the $11 million
sought. About $5 million will go toward the expansion and the rest
to increase the center's $1.6 million endowment.
</P>
<P>
   A New Space
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hunt, executive director of Visual AIDS in New York for
the last two years, will become director of Artists Space, the
nonprofit SoHo institution, in January.
</P>
<P>
   She replaces Claudia Gould, who left in September to become
director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia.

<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Miami (7-1) vs. Buffalo (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo won the first meeting, 23-18, back in early October at
Miami, but since the Dolphins have proved to be road ruffians. They
have beaten Denver, Indianapolis, New England and Oakland in road
games _ no NFL team can match that. Too, Miami is fresh from a
shutout victory over talented Tennessee, owns the league's
top-ranked rush defense (80 yards allowed per game), has not
allowed a rushing touchdown this season, is 3-0 with backup
quarterback Damon Huard as the starter and is watching cornerback
Sam Madison produce a pro-bowl season. Buffalo, however, often
produces in big home games. Its fans will arrive with its usual
Miami chant of ``Squish the Fish.'' No Bills opponent gets their
fans more aroused than Miami. Same goes for the Bills, who win in
the end with tough running from Antowain Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (1-8) vs. Pittsburgh (5-3) _ The Browns were shiny and
new and opened their new stadium on the season's first day by
hosting Pittsburgh. It was a glorious affair _ until the game
started. Pittsburgh whacked them, 43-0, rushing for 217 yards,
keeping the ball for nearly 48 minutes and limiting the Browns to
40 yards of total offense. It was ugly for Cleveland. And now it is
payback time. Problem is, there is little the Browns can do for
revenge. They remain outmanned in this matchup and since that
initial Pittsburgh beating have won only one game. Pittsburgh moves
to a 6-3 record and then travels to Tennessee next week for a
pivotal divisional battle.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 30-10.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (6-2) vs. Cincinnati (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been shut out, even in pee wee,'' said Steve McNair
after he and the Titans offense was smothered by Miami, 17-0.
``Their defense is very physical. They guess a lot and they guessed
right. Their cornerbacks are quick and their pass rush never stops.
We helped them some with turnovers, but they earned the game. They
are on a roll right now.'' So are the Bengals _ straight downhill.
McNair and the Titans offense will find the Bengals defense much
more obliging.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 23-9.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (3-5) vs. St. Louis (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Rams unbeaten at home, they have also outscored
opponents there by a stunning total score of 138-40. The Rams
started fast this season, jumping on teams and making games nearly
over by halftime. Its last two opponents, Tennessee and Detroit,
turned the tables, slowed down the Rams and made them play from
behind. Carolina can't do that. The Rams are quicker, faster and
more explosive than the Panthers. Carolina has won three straight
at the Rams but that was against the old Rams. The new ones went
6-0, then 0-2, and now start another winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 29-17.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (5-4) vs. Chicago (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Walter Payton picked me up because I can't jump that
high,'' said Bear Bryan Robinson after blocking a Green Bay field
goal attempt that preserved Chicago's emotional victory. ``I just
got my hand on that leather and it felt so good. This one meant
something to all of us. It was special. It's for you, Walter.''
Now, back to earth for the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 24-16.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (3-5) vs. New Orleans (1-7)
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are in deep trouble, a sub-.500 team at this stage in
the season, which is a remarkable, unlikely and unfamiliar spot for
them. It's the Saints to the rescue. The 49ers have beaten them in
seven consecutive games. They won 28-21 over New Orleans earlier
this season. They roasted them 31-0 last year at the New Orleans
Superdome. Of course, that victory was with Steve Young at
quarterback. Even without him, with Jeff Garcia (96 of 178 for
1,014 yards, 3 touchdowns, 6 interceptions) San Francisco still
owns the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 26-23.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (5-3) vs. Philadelphia (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was humiliated, 33-7, at Carolina last week.
Washington lost a game at home to Buffalo that continued their
yo-yo season. These divisional rivals have split their two-game
series in each of the past three seasons. The one features the
NFC's No-2 rusher Duce Staley (742 yards) against the NFC's No-3
rusher Stephen Davis (729). Staley has been one of Philadelphia's
few shining spots. The game will turn, however, on the arm of
Washington's Brad Johnson. No Eagle quarterback can match him.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (6-2) vs. Giants (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will stare across the field and see that this is the
way an offense is supposed to look. The Colts offense is soaring
and Peyton Manning directs it with cool and efficiency. He has
passed for 2,282 yards and receiver Marvin Harrison has caught 58
of his passes for 887 yards. Rookie back Edgerrin James (3.8 yards
per carry) has performed in magnificent fashion. The Giants will
require a career game from quarterback Kent Graham. It can count on
its defense to at least contain Manning and Co. On all fronts, this
should be a break-out game for the Giants, especially with two
weeks to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 23-21.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (5-3) vs. Tampa Bay (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   This game will be full of ferocious hits and points will be a
precious few. The numbers say their is little chance Tampa Bay will
win because it turns the ball over too much against a team that
protects it well. But go with the Bucs because with the season half
complete, they know this game could indicate exactly where they are
headed _ and they are a playoff team. They also have a defense led
by Warren Sapp that will win it with big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (3-5) vs. Jacksonville (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   Errict Rhett has given Baltimore a nifty ground game. He has
rushed 152 times for 658 yards, averaged 4.3 yards per carry and
scored 4 rushing touchdowns. This Tampa Bay outcast finds the
running good with Baltimore and joined with new quarterback Tony
Banks and a defense that is swift and possess punch, the Ravens are
primed to be a second-half surprise team. For this game, however,
on the road at Jacksonville is too much. Jacksonville is clicking.
It is healthy and dominant at home, where in its last 27 games it
owns a 23-4 record. Jacksonville travels to Baltimore in fewer than
three weeks. The Ravens can win that one. Not this one.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 19-10.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (4-4) vs. Oakland (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have roamed back toward the middle of the pack after
fast starts. San Diego is known for its tough run defense but it
tackles a quarterback (Rich Gannon) who scrambles for big plays.
Gannon has rushed for 204 yards, second only to Buffalo's Doug
Flutie (347). The Raiders have won four of the last five meetings
with late surges and physical play. It is a trend that continues.
Watch the Raiders secondary, which has 13 interceptions; that is
third-best in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (6-2) vs. Arizona (2-6)
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of game that used to kill the Lions. After a
big victory, they would often travel to play a losing, horrible
team and simply melt. This bunch of Lions looks different, though.
They have strung together enough big victories against Seattle,
Green Bay, Minnesota, Tampa Bay and St. Louis to taste success.
They enjoy it. Especially in a year where they were considered
lucky to win five games. They would have to completely fold to lose
to Arizona. It simply isn't in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 27-13.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (4-4) vs. Dallas (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Two reeling teams meet, both after suffering two-game losing
streaks. Green Bay lost to Seattle and Chicago. Dallas lost to
Indianapolis and Minnesota. Both Green Bay losses were at home.
Both Dallas losses were on the road. Both teams need a break and
both will battle to create one. There is rich history between them
dating back to the old NFL championship games of the late 1960s to
recent playoff scraps. Dallas enters injured but wins this game on
production derived from heart, desire and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 22-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Denver (3-6) vs. Seattle (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Denver hopes to dampen the Seattle offense, which has averaged
30 points in its last three games. It plans to do that with a
menacing pass rush _ the Broncos own 29 sacks, second league-wide
only to Jacksonville's 35. Seattle, though, has balance. John Kitna
has thrown 12 touchdown passes and only 4 interceptions. Ricky
Watters is averaging 3.6 yards per carry. Receiver Derrick Mayes
has caught 34 passes and in his last four games three touchdowns.
Seattle plays a little defense, too. It leads the league with 24
takeaways and 19 interceptions. Cornerback Shawn Springs is a joy
to watch _ see his energy, blanket coverage and tricky return
skills. See Seattle continue to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jets (2-6) vs. New England (6-2) )
</P>
<P>
   These teams met in their season openers and left as opposites,
evident in their records. It was a Jets nightmare at Giants Stadium
against the Patriots when Vinny Testaverde injured his Achilles
Tendon and was lost for the season. The Jets still managed to make
it a game, losing on a last-seconds field goal, 30-28. It will not
be that close this time. The Patriots enter off a bye with two
weeks to prepare. They will be the fresher, faster and more
efficient team. Look out for Patriots receiver Terry Glenn (18.1
average yards per catch) and end Willie McGinest (6 sacks).
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 26-14.

JEFF GORDON LOSES PIT CREW TO DALE JARRETT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their names are Barry Muse, Mike Trower, Kevin Gilman, Jeff
Knight and Darren Jolly. Odds are you've never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon knows them, though, since they make up most of his
over-the-wall pit crew.
</P>
<P>
   But only for two more races.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ray Evernham, who was Gordon's crew chief, they are moving
on. And while they may not leave as big a hole as Evernham, this is
another major blow to Gordon, who must completely rebuild the
Rainbow Warriors for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have been with Gordon almost from the start, when
Evernham, always the innovator looking for an edge, broke with
tradition and decided that pit crews should be made up of
specialists who do nothing but come in on Sunday and pit the car.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, pit crews were made up of mechanics and
others who worked in the race shop during the week and did double
duty on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Evernham refined the procedure, making his pit
crew coordinator, Andy Papathanassiou, pit crew coach and relieving
him of his other duties so he could concentrate on getting Gordon's
pit crew in top shape for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, there were changes in the group, but the
objective never changed. Whoever pitted Gordon's car concentrated
on doing that and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   And Muse, the jackman; Trower, the front tire changer; Gilman,
the rear tire changer, and tire carriers Knight and Jolly will
continue doing their jobs, only starting next year, they will be
taking care of Dale Jarrett's car instead of Gordon's.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that left Gordon stunned, they defected.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Jarrett's pit crew comprised primarily of team
members who also work in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that came to us, an opportunity, months
ago,'' Jarrett said, explaining that Gordon's guys had sought him
out, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in no way a slap in the face to any of our guys,''
Jarrett continued. ``They've done a fantastic job or we wouldn't be
in the position we're in. They've done a terrific job for four
years now, but what we're doing, as we told them, we're trying to
make their lives a little bit easier,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Since they all have other jobs with the team, none of Jarrett's
crewmen will be out of work. And if they really want to continue
what they're doing, there's a pretty good Chevy that needs some
help.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Amid abundant sunshine, another day of unseasonable warmth will
cover the eastern Rockies and western Plains as high pressure
extending from the surface to 20,000 feet holds steady over the
interior West. It will be especially warm over the western Dakotas
and Front Range where air flowing from the west of the Rockies is
heated by compression. A few locations across this region will
exceed 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and warm conditions will also cover an expansive area from
Texas to the interior Southeast. Breezes from the east, however,
will direct limited Atlantic moisture to the Southeast and southern
Middle Atlantic coasts, causing clouds, especially near the Outer
Banks of North Carolina and the southeast Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn clear and cold along the Northeast Seaboard.
The afternoon will remain chilly from New York City to Maine as
cirrus clouds dim the afternoon sun, heralding the approach of a
jet stream disturbance from Ontario. As the disturbance crosses New
England tonight, a narrow strip of snow may whiten the ground north
of Boston overnight.
</P>
<P>
   A moist flow of air from the Pacific will spread a swath of rain
into the Northwest. The rain will be heavy for a time over western
Washington and Oregon, especially across the west slopes of the
Cascades where the air is further moistened upon ascending the
mountains. Snow will occur in the highest elevations, mainly above
pass level. Elsewhere, mostly sunny and warm weather will persist
over southern California and the Southwestern States.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: THE SKY IS FALLING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A citizen of Seattle anxiously reported a funnel cloud to local
authorities Wednesday afternoon, but the sighting later proved to
be false. Such spurious reports of funnels occur from time to time
in the Pacific Northwest. Untrained observers can sometimes mistake
the darkened silhouette of a shaft of heavy rain beneath the base
of a cloud for a funnel. At other times, a flotsam of ragged, dark
clouds that seemingly float and circulate beneath the bases of
large clouds can lend the impression of a funnel. But these `scud'
clouds are merely debris and pose no danger.

NEW FACE ENTERS THE FRAY AS QB FOR 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ To the question, ``Why Steve Stenstrom?''
comes the answer, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   That's how bad it is for the San Francisco 49ers. They gave Jeff
Garcia 5 1/2 games to prove himself as quarterback and he responded
with a 1-4 record that includes four straight defeats. So now the
team turns to Stenstrom, a man who posted a 1-6 record in seven
starts with the talent-bereft Chicago Bears last season.
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom becomes the first Stanford man to start at quarterback
for the 49ers since Jim Plunkett in 1977. Stenstrom, 28, gets his
opportunity Sunday in New Orleans against the 1-7 Saints.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the move Wednesday, coach Steve Mariucci said,
``We need to get our passing game going. This has nothing to do
with the confidence I have in Jeff. It's probably good for him to
sit back and regroup. Let's see where it takes us. Steve has a
chance to be productive in this offense. ... He has been in the
West Coast offense in college. He has been with it as a pro. He
gives you some experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since quarterback Steve Young experienced his most recent
concussion Sept. 27 at Arizona, the 49ers have been lacking at the
most important position in football. Garcia's performances tailed
off since his first start Oct. 3 against Tennessee (21 of 33, 243
yards, 2 touchdowns), to the point where he failed to lead the
offense to a single touchdown in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not Stenstrom?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed in our quarterback play, because we
were all so hopeful following the early games with Jeff Garcia,''
general manager Bill Walsh said. ``He had such good games we
thought we can keep right on going, then it regressed something
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the halfway point in the season, the 49ers have a woeful
passing offense that's ranked 24th in the league. It's produced but
six touchdown passes in eight games, none since Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three players around the league have more receptions than
San Francisco's leader, Jerry Rice, who has 32. Rice's average gain
per catch, 9.3 yards, is a career low. J.J. Stokes (16 receptions)
is in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   It's hoped that Stenstrom, a tad bigger than Garcia and more
versed in this offensive system, can help the 49ers produce yards
and points by being less skittish and more decisive in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an accurate thrower,'' Mariucci said. ``The
decision-making ability is important in this offense. We've been
trying to find the right combination. After four losses, you look
at the passing game and you take a look at another quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom played three years under Walsh in his second tour of
duty at Stanford, then spent the first four years of his pro career
with the Chicago Bears. He completed 123 of 214 passes for 1,359
yards and four touchdowns, with eight interceptions from 1995-98.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth-quarter action last week in the rain and wind at
Candlestick, Stenstrom was 5-of-15 for 54 yards against Pittsburgh.
He was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Stenstrom said. ``It's been my goal all along.
I wanted to come somewhere where I could get on the field. I'm
thankful for the chance. What I consider a strength is my knowledge
of the system, my background in it. I don't expect there'll be a
lag in coming in and making the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom knows he'll be expected to get the offense moving
Sunday in the Superdome, which can be a loud place to play for a
visiting team if the Saints actually show signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel that same frustrating desire to get things turned
around,'' he said. ``I share equally in that. I'm glad I have a
chance to have an impact now. ... We have the talent to make a lot
of things happen. The key for me is not to have the ball stay in my
hands too long. I have to get it to the guys who can make things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who will provide protection for Stenstrom along the
offensive line were largely indifferent to the change at
quarterback. But they recognize the need for a switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Steve comes in and handles himself well and we run well and
block well, we have a good chance of winning the game,'' left guard
Ray Brown said. ``We've had a lot of missed opportunities. We can't
afford to miss out on them and win. We're not that good yet.''

ART REVIEW: UPDATE ON BERLIN SINCE THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see BERLIN-EXHIBIT)  
 (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last New York roundup of contemporary art from
the eternally under-construction city of Berlin was at the Museum
of Modern Art in 1987; it was all about neo-Expressionist painting.
Now comes an update titled ``Children of Berlin: Cultural
Developments 1989-1999'' at PS 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long
Island City, Queens, and there isn't a painting in sight.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of other things, though, by some 50 artists in
their 20s and 30s who claim the city as at least a part-time home.
Video, sculpture and installation predominate, often combined.
Architecture, theater and fashion are very much in the picture, as
is the floating world of club culture.
</P>
<P>
   Artists like Rainer Fetting and Salome painted club life in the
1980s. But the new art has just absorbed it into its system
atmospherically, like secondhand smoke. (The interior of a hip,
peripatetic music bar called Cookie's has been recreated in PS 1
for the occasion.)
</P>
<P>
   The big, raw, dysfunctional but oddly delicate group show that
results has its share of confusion (some insider references require
translation; a few low-tech pieces still had bugs to be worked out
at last look). But confusion, fueled by wit and energy, can be a
tonic, and that's the general feeling here.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Alanna Heiss, executive director of PS 1, and Klaus
Biesenbach, a PS 1 senior curator and Berlin art entrepreneur, the
show is mostly about the city itself since the wall came down a
decade ago. The event produced a huge collective high but offered
few immediate prospects for art. Berlin was still a long hike from
the rest of Europe. It had no solid gallery infrastructure or
collecting base.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s things started to change. Galleries and
alternative spaces set up shop. Young artists came to visit and
stayed. In 1998 the city put together a Biennale, drawn largely
from emerging local talent, and it was a success. On the other hand
this year's international art fair was reportedly something of a
flop, reinforcing old views of the city as a cultural Siberia. No
wonder cockiness and uncertainty alternate in the PS 1 show.
</P>
<P>
   An unsettled, irritable mood comes across here and there. In a
piece by Olafur Eliasson, an active electric fan suspended by a
cable makes threateningly erratic, self-propelled sweeps around the
show's first gallery. A passive-aggressive installation by Monica
Bonvicini (it's both hostile and fun) requires the viewer to walk
between facing industrial fans generating gale-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Kahrs' video of an actress smeared with Cindy
Shermanesque gunk and repeatedly screaming an unprintable line from
a Quentin Tarantino film is also geared to assault mode. And
violence turns abstract in Natascha Sadr-Haghighian's ``Cut,'' in
which projections of moving razor blades seem to be slicing the
gallery walls.
</P>
<P>
   An urban version of slicing and dicing is evident in the show's
architectural images. Stefan Rethfeld's slide display and an aerial
video by David Lamelas record the city's countless abandoned
buildings and demolition sites. Other photos illustrate projects by
young architects like Eike Becker and Sauerbruch &AMP; Hutton. The best
urban renewal idea comes from Raumlabor-Berlin and the inventive
Jan Liesegang, who have settled on treehouses, just the thing for a
country obsessed with environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Public feeling about the city's mushrooming crop of high rises
is mixed. Some people see them as flimsy, facade-oriented,
provisional structures, marking space until better or different
ideas come along. And an aesthetic of insubstantiality, with the
ambivalence it implies, runs through the show.
</P>
<P>
   It is embodied, for example, in a boxy sculpture by Manfred
Pernice. Based on an existing Berlin building, the piece has an
unbroken facade of particleboard on one side but exposes an
armature of wooden supports on the other. ( Pernice is one of a
handful of strong artists in the show who have made New York solo
debuts at Anton Kern Gallery in Soho.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Thomas Demand's photograph of a ransacked,
paper-strewn office, or what looks like one. The room in the
picture is, again, a kind of sculptural contrivance; the artist
built it, life size, by hand from cardboard and glue, then took the
photograph. But it is based on a real place, the East Berlin
headquarters of the former East German secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's political tensions were the raw material of 1980s
painting, and politics still finds a place, if somewhat removed, as
in Bert Neumann's assemblage of photographs taken in Belgrade and
Roland Brus' installation of objects gathered from prison inmates,
including religious icons, family photos and pornographic
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that both Neumann and Brus have ties to the
city's radical Volksbuehne or People's Theater, as does polymath
artist Christoph Schlingensief, who is a key figure here. A
playwright, filmmaker, performance artist, television talk show
host and political candidate (he ran for chancellor), he has
devoted his career to dissing the powers that be and taking art to
the street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At PS 1 he is represented by an installation incorporating pup
tents, metal fencing, the score of Wagner's ``Ring'' cycle and
films, including scenes he shot in Albanian refugee camps and his
own gross-out versions of modern German history. The piece, part of
a traveling project, is OK, but it is clearly the remains of more
dynamically interactive things. Its main function here is to frame
the films, though the artist's most celebrated work in that medium
will be screened separately Jan. 2 at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The 120 Days of Bottrop,'' it is a hilarious
celebrity-roast-style narrative homage to filmmaker Rainer Werner
Fassbinder, cast with Fassbinder's twitchy, now not-so-young
actors. Several German politicians appear, thanks to
Schlingensief's handy way with news clips, and the director is seen
as a big, sulky, sacrilegious baby in diapers and a crown of
thorns, though the twist is that his role is played by the German
actor Martin Wuttke.
</P>
<P>
   Few artists can rise to Schlingensief's pitch of inspired
dementia, though John Bock comes close. His specialty _ and it is
special _ is performance work, riotously improvisational and
uncannily disciplined, in which he manipulates objects and
materials on the spot into costumes and fetishistic sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Like Schlingensief, he is by far most effective when seen live
or on video, though even his trace elements have interest. At PS 1,
they include a Fiat hatchback loaded in front with potatoes and
fitted in the rear with a spiraling, tentlike processional canopy
of sheets and blankets through which one approaches a grungy
mock-Beuysian shrine of clothes, sculptures, aspirin bottles and
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Bock, in his turn, sets the febrile pace for the still-younger
artists, like those in the collective called the Honey-Suckle
Company. They have been awarded a room to themselves, and its
great, a combination of through-the-looking-glass Constructivist
playground and aesthetic recycling plant packed with abstract
sculptures, sculptural fashions and fashionable music played
superloud.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high-volume intensity, though, their art feels
unheavy, recreational, self-amused, and this is true of much else
in the show: Heike Baranwosky's dreamy laser projections of a
woodland landscape, Carsten Hoeller's usable three-story-tall
plastic slide; the design work of Bless, Juergen Frisch and John de
Maya (who claims a preference for ``refined flamenco style''), and
a peppy video by Daniel Pflumm advertising a continuously morphing
generic product whose brand name is always ``New.''
</P>
<P>
   And does everything in ``Children of Berlin'' feel new? No. A
lot of the work has a vaguely off-the-rack, seen-before,
Euro-American look. And there is a surprisingly parochial sense of
homogeneity, as if a larger multicultural world had yet to find its
way to Berlin or be invited. (Maybe that's one reason the city's
conservative politicians are said to be amenable to supporting
local art.)
</P>
<P>
   But overall the dashed-off style makes a welcome contrast to New
York's present enchantment with marketable objects, including
paintings. At least a few of the young artists are stars on the
rise. And sheer energy carries the day. It may not last forever or
even for long, but it does the trick for this fun, snappy show.

 &HT;    Letterbox format giving TV ads a cinematic edge
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You fall asleep in front of the TV, then wake up to see an
anguished auteur's outtake from the Sundance Film Festival. What
channel is this?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. It's just a commercial. A commercial in a visual format _
with heavy black or colored borders across the top and bottom of
the screen _ once mainly associated with movie-screen-proportioned
films on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The ``letterbox'' format is the latest rage in TV advertising.
Agencies and directors hope it lends a dramatic, movielike feel to
their commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are using the form to sell everything from pizza
(Pizza Hut) to shampoo (Clairol) to groceries (Publix) to computers
(IBM) to wireless phones (Motorola) to brokerage services (Merrill
Lynch) to radio shows (96rock morning show).
</P>
<P>
   IBM started it all in 1996, using borders of its trademark blue.
``We just wanted them to look different, something unusual,'' says
Chris Wall, executive creative director at IBM's ad agency, Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather, New York.
</P>
<P>
   Since '96, however, the format has become anything but unusual.
Now it's common to see several letterbox spots in a row. The
technique has caught on as crazily as hand-held, shaky
``monkey-cam'' commercials did a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   New York agency McCann-Erickson recently began running a
commercial for Agilent Technologies using the format. Director Tony
Scott, who directed such feature films as ``Top Gun'' and ``Enemy
of the State,'' insisted on the format, says McCann group creative
director Dave Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it would give the commercial a more cinematic,
romantic and _ I hate to say this _ `European' feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agilent commercial shows people coming in and out of the
picture, doing things such as throwing coins in a fountain. It may
feel European, but it was shot in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based ad agency WestWayne varied the format in a
commercial for Publix Super Markets that aired last summer. In the
spot, a woman talks in sign language, while her words appear as
subtitles in the border.
</P>
<P>
   Another letterbox ad, for 96rock ``Regular Guys'' morning DJs
Eric Von Haessler and Larry Wachs, opens in a hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs' sickly father is imploring him to do the single thing
that might give Dad the will to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just do a funny show for me,'' gasps the old man.
</P>
<P>
   The next scene, framed like something out of a Fellini film, is
at the old man's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Haessler, comforting Wachs, ``I thought it was
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Haessler, who helped brainstorm the spot, says that the
commercial's Atlanta director, Tony Quin, wanted the spot to look
like a movie promo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to stand out from other commercials for other
radio stations,'' he says. ``It was either that, or something like
going into the studio and doing a commercial with a bunch of
monkeys, and us jumping out of a pile of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's art.

 &HT;    Spirit infuses reverent telling of `Mary'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After seeing what NBC did to ``Noah's Ark,'' one trembles at the
prospect of a movie about the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   But fortunately, ``Mary, Mother of Jesus'' is a reverent and
respectful treatment; it's literal, straight-faced and
straight-laced, and utterly irony-free. Given that the biblical
record is a bit sketchy, the invented dramatic scenes feel
plausible and appropriate, and there is a strong emotional
through-line that should appeal even to non-Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with the Annunciation, when an angel vists Mary
and tells her she will bear a child by the Holy Spirit. In
Bethlehem, she and Joseph are visited by both the shepherds and the
wise men (different Gospels have one or the other, not both).
</P>
<P>
   The film moves a bit slowly for a while, then kicks into a
higher dramatic gear when Jesus begins his ministry at age 30.
Christian Bale (``Velvet Goldmine'') has a mesmerizing intensity as
Jesus, and Mary watches his growing fame, and inevitable fate, with
a mix of love, devotion (to both her son and God's plan) and dread.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first movie completely from Mary's point of view, so
scenes at which she was not present, such as the Last Supper, are
omitted. That may make it incomplete as the story of Christ, but
that's not the story here. Although there is a strong Catholic tilt
_ Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her son Bobby Shriver executive
produced _ it is by no means idolatrous of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Pernilla August is having quite a year. She played young Annakin
Skywalker's mom in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,''
and now she's the mother of the adult Jesus, while young Melinda
Kinnaman is the mother of baby Jesus. It's a role with a great deal
of passivity, in which the point is that she is restraining what
she wants for a higher purpose, and it's hard to imagine it played
better.
</P>
<P>
   There are the usual problems that biblical movies have. No one
looks remotely Semitic (August is Swedish), and British accents
come and go (Jesus at 12 has a British accent but loses it at 30).
And everyone rides around on donkeys on dirt roads, but their
tunics are always spotless.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strangest thing about ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' is
its timing: smack in the middle of sweeps. Although television
caters to religion more than it used to (``Touched by an Angel''),
sweeps are usually devoted more to Mammon than to God. While NBC
deserves a nod for high-minded scheduling, the network was also
trying to beat movies about Jesus that are coming later this season
on ABC and CBS. So maybe worldliness, in the form of concern over
ratings, played a little role.
</P>

 &HT;    `Partridge Family' gets on bus again
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The smiley-face days of the early 1970s weren't quite as hip for
teenagers as we now like to think. If you were there, admit it:
Most of us who hit puberty in the Me Decade weren't spending Friday
nights exploring free love in VW vans or reading Betty Friedan's
``The Feminine Mystique,'' as our revisionist, middle-aged memories
would like to think. We were stuck in our parents' suburban station
wagons, desperately waiting by the Princess phone for a date, and
watching hours of bad TV. Really bad TV.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this totally insipid, two-hour movie about the making
of the hit television show ``The Partridge Family'' is as shallow
and satisfying as the blue glow of an old console television set.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening credits of Mama Partridge wiggling her tail out
of a cartoon egg to the family's psychedelic bus with ``Nervous
Mother Driving,'' the made-for-TV biopic meticulously re-creates
the popular, polyester TV show that numbed our minds from September
1970 to August 1974. Narrated by the real-life Danny Bonaduce, who
played smarmy Danny Partridge, it dishes out all the ``come on, get
happy!'' hits as well as plenty of behind-the-scenes dirt. The
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keith wigs out: Talk about a dilemma. With his shaggy hair and
groovy puka-shell necklace, David Cassidy is portrayed as a '70s
pop-star stud who wanted to be taken seriously as a musician.
Curiously, he never seems to figure out that he is fronting a
fictitious band not unlike the Archies. He sulks. He brings his
stoner friends on the set, who laugh at him. He smokes pot in his
trailer, and poses nude for Rolling Stone (whose black-and-white
cover shot cropped just at the crotch is almost perfectly
replicated here). His most frequent line: ``Don't call me Keith!!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Love-struck Laurie: Wooden Susan Dey (Laurie Partridge)
apparently had a major crush on Cassidy, and finally succumbs to
his charms. He ruins it by telling her she's his ``best friend.''
Not cool, Keith.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Devilish Danny: Long before he became notorious as an
excessive ex-child star, Bonaduce (Danny Partridge) was peeping
into Dey's dressing room, smoking cigarettes and getting whacked in
the face fairly regularly by his jealous dad. Shawn Pyfrom, who
plays Bonaduce, is dead-on as the smart-aleck Danny, down to the
perfect re-creation of that weird side flip in his orange hair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  That kid on drums: Remember that one season he was a nerdy
little brown-haired boy, then the next he was cherubic and blond?
The cast was thrilled when the original Chris Partridge (Jeremy
Gelbwaks), portrayed as a leg-biting monster badly in need of
Ritalin, left the show and moved back to the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The girl who never talked: We weren't wrong. Suzanne Crough
(Tracy Partridge) really, really, really couldn't keep a beat with
that tambourine. One of the major strategies of the Partridge
producers was to keep the camera off her.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost embarrassing how much of this stuff is familiar.
Keith's tight-fitting, polyester shirts. Laurie's lifeless
lip-syncing. Mama Partridge's I'm-with-it velvet tunic.
Rubber-faced Reuben Kincaid's bad one-liners. But ``Come on Get
Happy: The Partridge Family Story'' doesn't posture to be profound,
or accomplish anything more than did the original show. Rather, it
unapolo-
</P>
<P>
   getically celebrates a time when television was naive, and so
were we.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on Get Happy:
</P>
<P>
   The Partridge Family Story''

WOODSON EXPECTED TO GET SHOT AT OFFENSE AGAINST SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Either Charles Woodson is putting up a smoke
screen with the density of some morning fog on the San Francisco
Bay, or Raiders fans might see their silver-and-black dreams come
true when Oakland hosts San Diego on Sunday at the Coliseum:
Charles Woodson playing offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Woodson said, ``I think it's the real deal.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the idea of the former Heisman Trophy winner as wide
receiver doesn't tear apart the team first.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday at team headquarters, a tour of the principals
involved in the drama revealed the different motivations behind
each character's plight: You had the grouchy but grudging coach,
Jon Gruden, reminding everyone that Woodson, his star cornerback,
won't play unless Gruden says so, then saying sardonically: ``The
way I hear it, he might just run out there and be on the field
anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   You had the hard-core realist quarterback, Rich Gannon, tossing
cold water on the flames, and reminding everyone that he, in fact,
is the one who throws the ball, saying defiantly: ``I don't know if
it's realistic. ... We really feel our best chance of winning is
with the guys that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   You had the big-play receiver Tim Brown, endorsing the idea of
another big-play money man at wideout, and almost leaving his
receiving comrades in the dust with the vote for Woodson, saying:
``I think it'd be good for us. ... He's a guy who can truly help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   And you had Woodson himself, the 23-year-old do-everything
talent who chose to tell reporters after the morning practice that
his NFL offensive debut is all but a go. He told of how he met in
Gruden's office the Monday after the Oct. 31 loss to Miami for
their first, ``serious'' discussion about playing offense and how
the meeting was a turning point. He told of how he has practiced as
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   He told of how he primarily needs to work on his timing with
Gannon, how he only expects to play a limited amount of plays, how
he won't be a decoy and how excited he is.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he spilled the beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gruden) expects me to make big plays,'' Woodson said.
``That's what I want to do. Go out there and do whatever I can do
to get the crowd excited, get the ball ... he doesn't want me to go
out there and just be a decoy. I'm going out there to get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   It may very well be their understanding. Just understand that
Gruden doesn't want anybody privy to any understandings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some plays for him,'' Gruden said. ``If there's a time
and a place, and we decide to do it, we'll do it ... There is a
chance. We're equipped to do that. But I wouldn't say anything
other than that. I'm not going to make a big issue about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. The issue is already masterfully large, and despite
Gruden's public pleas to the contrary, he is privately delighted
that San Diego must now worry about a defensive game plan that has
to consider Woodson, whether or not Woodson plays on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no NFL film of Woodson on offense, so the Chargers
can't study weaknesses or tendencies or know what in the world
Woodson would do if he played.
</P>
<P>
   There is only the unknown, and it could be out there as soon as
this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very talented guy to worry about,'' Raiders defensive
coordinator Willie Shaw said, barely hiding his smile. ``They have
to take Charles Woodson's ability into account. They've got to
spend more time burning the midnight oil to figure things out. Do
they bring another guy in to defend him? What do they do? He's a
bit of an unknown commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Chargers coach Mike Riley on a conference call Wednesday,
``We certainly are aware and would be aware of Woodson coming into
the game on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown thinks he knows something about Woodson, and it's a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played against guys for 12 years now, and I don't think
I've ever played against a guy, besides Deion, who, once he gets
the ball in his hands, is a better runner than defender,'' Brown
said. ``Charles is definitely that kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to go out and be a distraction to everybody
else,'' Woodson said. ``Everybody wonders how many balls I'm going
to get. ... It's about winning. If I can add something different to
the offense and to the team, then hey! If I've got to get the
balls, I've got to get the balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   No. That would be San Diego's job now.

FEDS SETTING UP COMMAND POST TO MONITOR GLOBAL Y2K GLITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use Sunday, Nov. 14) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the year 2000 approaches, the eyes of the world
will focus on New Zealand, which at 7 a.m. EST on Dec. 31 becomes
the first sizable country to move into the new era.
</P>
<P>
   Poised at a command center that the U.S. government is
assembling here will be officials who will be tracking any
computer-related glitches that may develop on the two-island, South
Pacific nation and elsewhere as the world turns and clocks begin
striking midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication of any year 2000 computer-related problems
could come from Wellington, New Zealand's capital, and Auckland,
its biggest city. The State Department, which is charged with
monitoring international Y2K developments, will report to the
command center how New Zealanders are faring.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, officials at the center will pass along that
information at their first news briefing, according to Brian R.
Kilgallen, the center's public information chief. Updates will be
provided after Australia moves into the New Year at 9 a.m. EST and
then as the rest of the world follows suit.
</P>
<P>
   The command post, called the Information Coordination Center,
will begin 24-hour monitoring Dec. 28 and run through the first few
days in January. It will be staffed by about 200 people from
various government agencies who have been assigned to track any
Y2K-computer failures that may be reported by federal, state and
local governments and about 25 key private industries such as
electric and gas utilities, telecommunications firms, banks and
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments will report any Y2K glitches to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will relay the
information to the center on a regular basis. The 25 industry
groups will also inform the command post directly on whether they
are experiencing computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   If computers that run everything from Automated Teller Machines
to telephones aren't fixed by Jan. 1, they may misinterpret the
year 2000 as 1900 and fail.
</P>
<P>
   Government and private industry officials have said almost 99
percent of the nation's critical computer systems have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the extraordinary efforts that have been made to
prepare systems for the year 2000, it is unlikely that there will
be major national failures in the United States related to the date
change,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the White House's Y2K
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Koskinen said, there are no guarantees that problems
won't crop up, which is why he helped develop the command center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps no organization has a greater need for such
information than the federal government,'' he said. ``Our goal is
to get as much information as we can from everywhere and provide it
to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The command center, located two blocks west of the White House,
will also have backup electric power generators in case the
Washington, D.C., power grid fails.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing Y2K updates to the public, the command center
will be funneling the same information to other federal agencies
and to state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said states have asked for regular updates on the
status of the National Weather Service, the U.S. Postal Service,
the National Crime Information Center and on airline and other
transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to guard against any potential Y2K problems, Koskinen
recommended that people:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a three-day supply of food and water, just as they would
be asked to do in preparation for a winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refill prescription medicines when there is a five- to
seven-day supply remaining _ as is normally recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a flashlight, batteries, a battery-powered radio and a
first-aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep copies of bank statements, credit card receipts, bills
and prescription medicine information beginning now and for a few
months after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Withdraw only as much cash as they normally would for any
holiday weekend. Withdrawing large amounts of cash may invite
theft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep their automobile gas tank above half full as is normally
recommended in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use telephones and the Internet only as necessary on Jan. 1.
Testing the phone to see if it works can jam circuits and cause
delays like the ones during high-volume-usage periods such as
Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Additional information can be obtained from the Y2K Council on
the Internet at www.y2k.gov or by calling 1-888-USA-4-Y2K.

By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The birth of New York takes 10 hours; its utter destruction, a
mere four. And the lives of Christ and his Holy Mother can be
covered in a brisk 120 minutes. That's the story of tonight's major
TV events.
</P>
<P>
   Holiest things first. One of the eternal verities of Hollywood
religious epics is that, in attempting not to offend the faithful,
productions tend to be so reverent that virtually all life is
squeezed out of them. Testifying to that edict this evening: The
NBC telefilm ``Mary, Mother of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone here speaks in clipped European, largely British,
accents. Though this lends absolutely no historical accuracy to the
proceedings, it does somehow seem rather pious. Pernilla August _
who recently also managed Darth Vader's virgin birth ``Star Wars:
Episode 1'' (but more impressively, has appeared in some Ingmar
Bergman productions) _ is a good choice for the role of Mary, as
she has a presence that fairly radiates wisdom, piety and
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mother of Jesus,'' Mary (played in her youth by a
too-contemporary Melinda Kinnaman) is a fiercely devout yet
independent spirit. She upbraids the Romans for their oppression of
the Jews, rescues an elderly woman from stampeding Roman horses
and, in an act that her son will mimic with more success,
reprimands a mob stoning an adulterer.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's weirdest scene, when Mary confesses to her fiance
Joseph (David Threlfall) that she's pregnant with the Holy Spirit's
baby, he spits out, ``You're dead to me!'' Who'd have guessed that
Joseph could channel Sinatra? Strange and mysterious ways, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And they only get more curious with the subtly homophobic
portrayals of the villains, Herod and Pontius Pilate, and the
whitewashing of Mary Magdalene's character. What may prove to be
the most mysterious aspect is the casting of Jesus, who's played by
Christian Bale, the guy who next assumes the title role in next
year's film incarnation of Bret Easton Ellis' repugno-fest,
``American Psycho.'' Perpetuating the string of oddities: Executive
producers are Bobby Shriver and his mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver,
giving us reverential icons before and behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Mary becomes her son's most fervent supporter, even relating to
him the parable of the Good Samaritan, which he later, of course,
will pass off as his own. The film basically hits a lot of the
usual high points we get in the standard-issue Jesus biopic _ born
in a stable, amazed temple elders at the age of 12, turned water
into wine, was crucified and rose again. Most of this is rendered
in a dispassionate fashion, except the most unpleasant parts _ the
crucifixion and John the Baptist's beheading _ which are fairly
wrenchingly depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, focusing on Mary misfires as a narrative gambit,
since by the end of the film she's clearly just a supporting player
in her son's story; by focusing on her, the filmmakers end up
missing a lot of the big emotional moments. Retitle ``Schindler's
List'' ``Schindler's Mom'' and you see the problem. ``Mary, Mother
of Jesus'' is a typically bloodless religious production _ the
faithful, I would guess, know and understand that the Bible in fact
has gritty stories that took place in a pretty unpalatable era. So
who exactly is being served when a filmmaker tries to sugarcoat
them? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Undertakings don't get much more mammoth than ``New York: A
Documentary Film,'' from Ric Burns, the co-writer and co-producer
of his brother Ken's career-defining documentary, ``The Civil War''
(Ric also previously directed his own works, including the
excellent ``The Donner Party''). A 12-hour epic _ 10 hours will be
shown tonight through Thursday; the final two-hour chapter will be
presented early in the year 2000 _ it offers a painstaking history
of New York. But, as is so often true in Burns brothers
documentaries, the subject serves as a suitable metaphor for
America in general.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode, ``The Country and the City,'' examines 200
years in two hours, from the discovery of the Hudson River and New
York's natural harbor to the colonization by the Dutch, who even
early on discover that the city lures a melting pot of cultures and
ethnicities. It also points out that two key elements in making New
York what it is today were devised by DeWitt Clinton, a visionary
10-term mayor and three-term governor. Clinton created the traffic
grid that defines the city to this day when but a fraction of the
projected populace had taken up residence there, as well as the
Erie Canal, which connected New York with the Midwest in an
unprecedented fashion, ensuring its place as the nation's economic
center. One wishes more time had been devoted to Clinton's
character and foresight.
</P>
<P>
   The second episode, ``Order and Disorder,'' focuses on the
city's early economic disparities, as well as the creation of
Central Park and how the city affected and was affected by one of
Burns' pet topics, the Civil War, which forced New York's most
virulent riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine and Shadow,'' the third installment, also pursues
social inequities, with a focus on Tammany Hall and the scandalous
Boss Tweed, who robbed New York of $50 million in 19th-century
dollars. ``The Power and the People,'' which includes a powerful
examination of the Triangle Garment factory fire and the labor
reforms that followed, as well as a glance at skyscraper fever,
likewise explicates the financial biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmopolis,'' the fifth episode, seems to perk up
significantly because it's the first to feature copious amounts of
fascinating archival footage, largely from the Jazz Age of the
'20s. In fact, it does move faster, simply because it's not beating
the same economic-disparities drum. Even the title sets itself
apart from the other episodes in that it's not focusing on
contrasts or opposites. New York in the '20s, as presented by
Burns, seems a more lively place in general because everyone from
Uptown to Harlem seems to have had a go-to attitude. Moreover, the
complaints of the era _ that the media overload seemed overwhelming
to the period and the stock market was built more on dreams than
economic realities _ proves the adage that the more things change,
the more they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a grievous mistake not to include the sixth episode
along with the rest. We'll have to wait until next year for ``Ford
to City: Drop Dead,'' the infamous blackout, Rudy Giuliani's
tough-love resurrection of the Big Apple and the Disneyfication of
Times Square, as well as the emergence of the Yankees as the Team
of the Century. But it's a fair measure of the effectiveness of
Burns' efforts that after 10 hours, we're still hungry for hours 11
and 12.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's obvious that Burns could have trimmed this
material down two or three hours. Many of his interviewees simply
compete to see who can be the most poetic or moony over Manhattan,
and there's an awful lot of repetition. Phrases such as ``It's a
critical moment in the city's history'' or ``The city had changed
forever'' and superlatives like ``biggest,'' ``best,'' ``most,''
``worst'' or whatever-est occur with alarming frequency, often
without hard facts to back up the high-falutin' statements.
</P>
<P>
   But there's such a wealth of fascinating information so solidly,
if sometimes stolidly, delivered that by the documentary's end,
you're convinced the city deserves such grandiose treatment. The
music, composed and compiled by Brian Keane, is a constant
pleasure, and visually, Burns has found every conceivable camera
angle that conveys New York's gorgeous scale.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has issued a fat, handsome, 550-page book as a companion
to his film (which you can use to follow the documentary and suss
out a spate of niggling, minor inconsistencies). Lest you believe
that overkill, consider _ Mike Wallace, perhaps the documentary's
most colorful, authoritative interviewee (but not the ``60
Minutes'' correspondent), co-authored a Pulitzer Prize-winning
book, ``Gotham,'' that spans a towering 1,200 pages and doesn't
even reach the 20th century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Aftershock: Earthquake in New York'' follows the usual
disaster flick template. Lots of stars (Charles S. Dutton as the
mayor, Cicely Tyson as his mother, ``Ally McBeal's'' Lisa Nicole
Carson as his daughter, Sharon Lawrence as an overprotective
mother, Tom Skerritt as the fire chief, Jennifer Garner as a
struggling ballerina, Frederick Weller as a Russian cab driver, Ray
J as a semi-repentant troublemaker). Lots of subplots (including a
murderer on the loose, love in bloom and two instances of parents
rescuing their own children at school).
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, spectacular scenes of devastation. But no matter
how awful it gets _ Carson is stranded on the subway tracks and is
almost drowned by a water leak _ her makeup and hair remain
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects and production design create a convincing
tableau of ruin, and _ almost disappointingly _ the dialogue is
competently rendered, largely lacking the kind of howler lines that
make disaster movies such a hoot. But there's nothing here any real
disaster-flick aficionado hasn't sat through before. Even my
6-year-old was unimpressed: After watching the spectacle of New
York's decimation, she called to the screen, ``You ruined New York!
Someone's going to have to pay big!'' It's unlikely those
responsible for this disaster went to such expense and effort just
so kids could hone their heckling skills, but that does appear to
be ``Aftershock's'' chief strength.

   `Real Thing' Returns. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real Thing,'' Tom Stoppard's shimmering exploration of
love and betrayal, is confirmed for Broadway in the spring. The
play, which finished a critically acclaimed run last summer at the
Donmar Warehouse in London, will open on the West End in January,
before transferring to the Belasco Theater in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The production is to include at least four actors from the
Donmar version in principal roles, including Stephen Dillane and
Jennifer Ehle as Henry and Annie, an English playwright and his
lover, roles played by Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close during the
play's 1984 Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dillane and Ms. Ehle received immaculate reviews in London,
as did David Leveaux, the director, who also staged last year's
Broadway revival of ``Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard said the Donmar production had a more intimate feel
from the play's showier incarnation on Broadway. ``The Donmar is
more on the scale of an Off Broadway house,'' he said, speaking
from London, ``and I think this production took its characteristics
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Dillane's performance, which Stoppard said had
``such integrity as to scare the life out of an author.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Broadway insiders may be surprised that the Belasco will
house the production as ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' which
completes its run at Playwrights Horizon on Nov. 28, had been
widely rumored to be in line for the theater.
</P>
<P>
   But officials for that show say the Belasco is still a strong
possibility, as ``The Dead'' would likely play only a limited run.
Martin Sherman's play, ``Rose,'' has also been mentioned for the
theater, burt now looks unlikely to land there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Razzle-Dazzle, Indeed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who ever said crime doesn't pay?
</P>
<P>
   Not Fran and Barry Weissler, the producers of ``Chicago,'' who
announced this week that the gross proceeds of that Broadway
production has passed $100 million. Weissler declined to say what
the profits were, but a calculation of the gross minus the show's
running costs (about $350,000 a week), royalty payments and other
costs puts the figure at $30 million to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does put you in awe,'' Weissler said, ``You put it in
motion, and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million milestone comes almost three years to the day
after the revival opened at the Richard Rodgers Theater and
continues the musical's rags-to-riches story line. ``Chicago,''
about a pair of sassy femmes fatales in booze-'em-and-lose-'em
Chi-town, opened in 1975 with direction by Bob Fosse and reviews
from the house of bland. While it had a healthy run then, but the
aura of also-ran always hung over the show.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996 ``Chicago'' was revived at the Encores series at
City Center _ with 10 days of rehearsal and a $350,000 budget _ and
scored big with critics. The Weisslers picked up the show, and
after opening to starry reviews at the Rodgers, moved it to the
Shubert, where it currently plays. And plays. And plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago'' also spawned an American touring company, a Las
Vegas company and five international productions, with three more
on the way. Worldwide proceeds stand at $334 million, Weissler
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bewildering,'' he said. ```Chicago' has become an
industry.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those Characters &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly have a few things in
common. Both are successful actors, both are in their early 30s,
and both have earned that peculiar label ``character actor,'' a
double-edged moniker that implies talent without leading-man looks.
</P>
<P>
   But starting on Feb. 15 Hoffman and Reilly will be center stage,
playing dueling brothers in the revival of Sam Shepard's ``True
West.'' The play, under the direction of Matthew Warchus, will play
at the Circle in the Square.
</P>
<P>
   The two actors have worked together before, appearing in the
films ``Boogie Nights,'' ``Hard Eight,'' and the forthcoming
``Magnolia,'' all directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. So in the case
of ``True West,'' it's not surprising that Reilly was instrumental
in getting Hoffman on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``John called me and said he had met the director and had a
really good talk,'' Hoffman said. ``So I started listening a little
more intently.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was even more effusive about his audition and
recommendation. ``I read some scenes for Matthew, and at one point
I remember smashing a glass against the wall,'' he said. ``I guess
I made an impression.'' He continued, ``And then Matthew asked me
who should play my brother, and the first name out of my mouth was
Phil Hoffman.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men cut their teeth in the theater. Hoffman, a graduate of
New York University, played in several Off Broadway productions,
including ``The Skriker'' at the Public Theater and ``Shopping and
...'' at the New York Theater Workshop. Reilly, meanwhile, worked
in Chicago with the Steppenwolf Company and made his Broadway debut
in that company's production of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This time both men's names will be listed above the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something about me and Phil that people can
relate to,'' Reilly said with a laugh. ``And you know, beauty can
be its own prison.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tragic Voices &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the show ``Charlie Victor Romeo'' has proved to be
tragically keen. The piece, playing at the tiny Collective
Unconscious theater in Manhattan, is made up of six vignettes, each
drawn from the transcripts from cockpit voice recorders during
airliners' crashes and close calls. The title comes from the
aviation code for the CVRs.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened on Oct. 21. On Oct. 31, hours after its sixth
performance ended, EgyptAir Flight 990 disappeared from radar and
crashed into the Atlantic, killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Berger, one of the piece's directors, said ``C.V.R.'' was
inspired in part by his own experiences working as a television
technician covering the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800. ``I had some
glimpse what it was like,'' he said, ``to see the humanizing effect
of tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   With 11 actors recreating the transcripts and a chillingly
realistic sound design, ``Charlie Victor Romeo'' runs Thursdays
through Saturdays through Dec. 11, with no performances over
Thanksgiving weekend. Information: (212) 254-5277. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Henry Rollins, former front man of the punk band Black Flag
and a Grammy winner for his spoken-word performances, will offer an
``evening of manic stream of conscious diatribes'' at the Westbeth
Theater Center from Dec. 7 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Rees and Laura Linney have joined the cast of the
forthcoming Roundabout Theater Company production of ``Uncle
Vanya'' at the Selwyn Theater, currently undergoing a $17 million
renovation. ``Vanya,'' which is to be the Selwyn's inaugural show,
will star Sir Derek Jacobi in the title role and is to open on
April 13.

 &HT;    Playful imagination of Atlanta folk artist shines in U.S. tour
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 14.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLATNA _ It might seem odd to compare Nellie Mae Rowe to Cupid.
</P>
<P>
   The late Vinings artist possessed, by all accounts, the kind of
powerful spirit not associated with a cherub. Yet her paintings and
the environment she created around her house, now torn down,
bespoke an uninhibited playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, her work and her residence left visitors from
around the world smitten. Between 1973 and 1975 alone, more than
800 visitors signed her guest register. Passers-by intrigued by her
topiary animals and collectors on a pilgrimage enjoyed her outdoor
decorations, her ``companions'' _ dolls created from discarded
chewing gum _ and the richly hued and patterned paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety of her vivid flights of imagination are conquering more
hearts in ``The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe: Ninety-Nine and a Half
Won't Do.'' This retrospective exhibition, organized by the Museum
of American Folk Art, opened in New York and visited Washington. It
will end its tour in Dallas. But for the next three months, the
exhibit, opening Saturday, will grace the High Museum of Art's
downtown gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the homecoming, we talked to a few of the folks who
knew Nellie when. Robert Koontz was 17 when he and a friend
happened upon her little house on Paces Ferry Road in 1967. Rowe,
who died in 1982 at 82, invited them in. The interior was as
strange to them as the exterior. The walls were covered floor to
ceiling with drawings. Koontz, now a clinical psychologist,
introduced himself to a man in a chair before he realized it was a
lifelike and life-size doll dressed like a sailor. She fixed them
Spam for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She impressed me as a fairy-tale person, like a beneficent
grandma in a hut deep in the woods,'' said Koontz. ``She was
someone who operated outside conventions of time and space. It was
magical. I left feeling like I'd had some sort of big experience. I
felt lucky, privileged, confused. I felt more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to his regret now, he never went back. Nevertheless, Koontz
said she made an enormous impression on him. That experience may
have contributed to his involvement with outsider art and his
efforts to spend time with the artists he collects.
</P>
<P>
   It was love at first sight for Xenia Zed, who was a young artist
when she met Rowe in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie was every bit as strong and vibrant and present as her
work,'' said the artist/arts administrator and former editor of the
contemporary art magazine Art Papers. ``She filled up the whole
room with her presence. She had a deep, beautiful voice. I can
still hear the intonations. Then there was the art. It was a
perfect exemplification of her personality, almost like a DNA
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from formalist-oriented graduate school, Zed keyed into
Rowe's use of color and space. But she was also taken by the
artist's joie de vivre, and she found the whole idea of self-taught
artists eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that expressionism existed in nature,'' she said.
``It didn't necessarily evolve from other art. It made me think
about the significance of visual art.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Alexander, who would become Rowe's indefatigable dealer
and champion, warmed up a bit more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw her work was in `Missing Pieces' at the
Atlanta History Center in 1976,'' said Alexander, who divides her
time between Atlanta and New York. ``There was one line drawing. At
that time, I was more impressed with Mattie Lou O'Kelley and
intrigued that here was a whole group of artists I didn't know
about. The show drew me to folk art.''
</P>
<P>
   A year or so later, Alexander saw one of Rowe's dolls in an
exhibition at Nexus Contemporary Art Center. She was curious enough
to ask curator Janie Geiser about her. Geiser, a puppetry artist
now living in New York, suggested she visit the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, I didn't even know where Vinings was, but off I
went,'' Alexander recalled. ``Nellie was in the garden, and we just
hit it off right away. She was such a powerful personality, very
spiritual. There was an ancientness about her. She was such a
wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the work _ the all-over energy, the color. It was so
alive and original. After meeting her, I began to look for gallery
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander founded the first Atlanta gallery devoted to outsider
art. For the four years it was open (1978-82), the renovated
bungalow on East Paces Ferry Road was a magnet for anyone curious
about self-taught art. Although she showed the work of a number of
artists, Rowe's was front and center, and Alexander has worked
doggedly since then to bring Rowe to the world's attention. This
exhibition is a big step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still devoted to Nellie,'' said Alexander, ``but she's
public property now.''

 &HT;    Out-of-print Morris memoir to be brought back
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Mississippi author Willie Morris died this
summer, critics almost unanimously agreed that his best book was
his 1967 childhood memoir, ``North Toward Home.'' Unfortunately,
the book has been out of print for years. But now the University
Press of Mississippi is issuing a hardcover edition on Nov. 29,
which would have been Morris' 65th birthday. And in April the
University Press is publishing ``Remembering Willie,'' a collection
of tributes from William Styron, David Halberstam, Bill Clinton and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Morris' last book, ``My Cat Spit McGee,'' will be
published by Random House this month, and the film version of
1995's ``My Dog Skip'' opens in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary event: Atlanta Writers in Concert has become as much
of a holiday tradition as Christmas tree lightings. This year's
concert, which benefits the Atlanta Community Food Bank, is
dedicated to the late Celestine Sibley. Writers scheduled to
participate in readings and performances include novelists Terry
Kay and Charles McNair; granddaughter Sibley Fleming, author of
``The Celestine Sibley Sampler''; poet Memye Curtis Tucker; and
Atlanta Journal-Constitution gardening columnist Lee May. The
concert will be Dec. 6 at the 14th Street Playhouse in Midtown.
Admission is 15 pounds of nonperishable food per person. 14th and
Juniper streets. 404-892-3333, Ext. 254.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  French fantasy: In a bidding war with nearly every other
Hollywood studio, Stephen Spielberg's DreamWorks paid $2 million
for the movie rights to a first novel by a French architect. What
is surprising, reports Publishers Weekly, is that the manuscript
has not been translated completely into English. Author Marc Levy's
Paris editor Susanna Lea distributed a synopsis of the novel in
English. Basically, the plot of ``If Only It Were True'' revolves
around a man who discovers a beautiful woman in his apartment. The
catch? She's visible only to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More reprints: There's good news for fans of Daphne du
Maurier, author of ``Rebecca'' and ``Jamaica Inn.'' The University
of Pennsylvania Press will reissue two of her out-of-print novels,
``The House on the Strand'' and ``The Scapegoat,'' on Valentine's
Day. The books will be released at the same time as the critical
study ``Daphne du Maurier: Haunted Heiress'' by Nina Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended reading: If you agree with Oprah Winfrey's
literary taste, pick up a copy of A. Manette Ansay's ``Vinegar
Hill'' (Avon, $13), the talk show host's November book club
selection. Set in a small Wisconsin town, the novel deals with
family cruelties and one woman's struggle to overcome her past.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't share Oprah's taste, you may want to read one of
the top vote-getters recommended by more than 1,000 independent
booksellers nationwide. Choices for November-December include
``Ahab's Wife,'' a female view of ``Moby-Dick'' by Sena Jeter
Naslund, ``Fall of the Year,'' a kind of Faulkner saga set in New
England by Howard Frank Mosher, and ``Then Sings My Soul,'' a novel
of domestic abuse and revenge by Georgia writer Sonny Sammons.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Authors at work: If you've ever wondered what writers look
like in their natural habitat, check out the photography exhibit by
Jill Krementz at the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum. The
exhibit includes images of Tennessee Williams, Eudora Welty, Toni
Morrison and Stephen King. A reception 7-9 tonight kicks off the
exhibit, which runs through January. 999 Peachtree St. N.E.
404-249-7012, Ext. 15.

`NEW YORK': AN OVERLY LANGUID PACE AND FAMILIAR STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York is a city defined by its chaos, its glittering promise
that life here will never be dull. In recent decades alone, a
visitor might have bumped into Holly Golightly, Travis Bickle,
Jerry Seinfeld (or their prototypes). Such mind-spinning
differences suggest that 10 hours might not be enough to cover more
than 300 years of the city's unwieldy history.
</P>
<P>
   For Ric Burns' elephantine ``New York: A Documentary Film,'' 10
hours is too much. The word that best describes this series _
becalmed _ is the polite and orderly opposite of what New York has
always stood for. Until the glorious fifth episode, which bursts on
screen with all the slick energy of the Jazz Age, this series is
often too plodding and repetitious to capture the dynamism of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The problems come from the series' languid pace and familiar
style (developed in ``The Civil War,'' for which Ric Burns was
co-producer and co-writer, with his brother, Ken, as director). The
archival black-and-white photographs, the nearly whispered
voice-overs, the inspirational tone have become so commonplace that
a scene popped up on television the other day that seemed
unmistakably to be a promo for the series: the camera panned over
1930s black-and-white photographs of men constructing a skyscraper,
while a subdued voice lauded their integrity and spirit. It turned
out to be a commercial for New York Life, the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   When the Burns style has penetrated that far into popular
culture, it has lost its ability to surprise, and rejuvenating the
approach requires a fresher eye than this series usually displays.
(Five episodes will be shown in two-hour installments, Sunday
through Thursday on PBS, with two additional hours coming in the
spring.)
</P>
<P>
   What the series does share is New York's crazy ambition, and
given those aspirations even partial success can be spectacular.
Horrifying facts leap out: in 1741, 13 slaves were burned at the
stake in New York because white men feared a rebellion. ``New
York'' has period drawings to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Moving chronologically, the series picks up speed with each
episode, as drawings give way to photographs and at long last
movies. In Episode 5, film from the late 1920s shows a biplane
doing a loop-the-loop over skyscrapers while a man balanced on top
holds a movie camera. It is an entrancing vision that soars with
the excitement and boundless possibilities that have drawn so many
people to the city. ``New York'' offers much to enjoy and just as
much to slog through before that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its large doses of sentiment, the series comes with a
valuable, hard-nosed thesis: unlike cities founded on ideals like
religious freedom, New York has always been about money. Brendan
Gill, one of the on-camera commentators, states this with
refreshing bluntness at the start: ``New York City was founded by
the Dutch. The Dutch didn't give a damn about anything but making
money.'' (Gill, the New Yorker writer, died two years ago, and his
presence is a reminder that this series has been a seven-year
project.)
</P>
<P>
   ``New York'' is especially good at describing the ethnic and
class tensions that beset the city from the start, when the Dutch
merchants scorned the few Sephardic Jews who immigrated to New
York. And its consistent theme connects even the city's noblest
ideas _ social justice, artistic expression _ with commerce. As
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan says of New York's social
expansiveness, ``It is exactly that money-crazy, driving,
commercial culture that made political democracy seem perfectly
sensible.''
</P>
<P>
   The rich got richer, penniless immigrants flooded in, and the
distance between them created urgent questions. As the narrator
puts it, ``Would it be possible to lose the gap between rich and
poor in New York City and unite the dreams of capitalism and
democracy?''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the early episodes, the voices expressing these
ideas threaten to overwhelm the visuals, so it's good that their
comments are so lucid and intriguing. The most astute commentators
include the historian Kenneth T. Jackson, the architect Robert A.M.
Stern and above all Mike Wallace, who must be tired of hearing
himself identified as not the television reporter. The co-author of
the history ``Gotham,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize, this Mike
Wallace provides lively descriptions of several centuries of the
city's daily life. And he makes a case for New York as a place that
came to believe ``social justice is a commensurate good with the
accumulation of private property.'' Though the series accepts that
premise too breezily, it doesn't back away from showing the
sickening conditions in which immigrants lived.
</P>
<P>
   The series also has two guiding literary voices: Walt Whitman,
with his optimistic vision of an all-inclusive nation of brothers,
and the melancholy F. Scott Fitzgerald, who charted the rise and
fall of the country's evanescent dreams. Whitman's writing is read
by Spalding Gray, and for once the gentle tone that all Burns
readers adopt seems a revelation, breathing new life into words
usually declaimed with bombastic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers were not so shrewd in choosing a series narrator.
David Ogden Stiers' solemn, inflated manner makes every utterance
sound biblical. That does compound damage when he is speaking the
sometimes overripe prose. Of the draft riots that broke out in
1863, when men were first conscripted into the Army, Stiers says,
``Marauding mobs of infuriated immigrants rampaged up and down the
island.'' He goes on to note, giving absolutely equal weight to
each, that the mob rampaged through ``the Harlem Temperance Room,
the Madgalen Asylum for aged prostitutes, Brooks Brothers on Fifth
Avenue.'' (And just what was that rest home for aged prostitutes, a
civilized proposition if ever one existed?)
</P>
<P>
   Stiers even sounds self-important when the script calls for wit,
as it does when he notes that historians disagree about whether the
Indian name ``Manna-hata'' meant ``Island of Hills'' or ``Place of
General Inebriation.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he drones on, many gripping set pieces leap out, making
the series a major argument in favor of fast-forwarding. In one
quick sequence in Episode 3, about the Gilded Age, picture after
picture of new public buildings accumulate: the 42nd Street
Library, the American Museum of Natural History, the Washington
Square Arch, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. With this visual
litany the series briefly attains the Whitmanesque quality it
aspires to. Something as simple as brisker editing would have
provided more such moments. The words of an anonymous curator help
bring this inanimate stone to life: ``The rage of Wall Street is to
convert all baser things to gold, but ours is the higher ambition,
to convert your useless gold into things of living beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is crammed with images of buildings going up and of
twinkling aerial views of the city and skyline. Yet there are so
many more buildings than personalities here that at times New York
seems like a ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   One exceptionally moving sequence concerns the 1911 fire in the
Triangle Shirtwaist factory, in which 146 people died, mostly young
female immigrants. The fire doors had been locked, reportedly to
keep out labor organizers; the fire escape collapsed; women held
hands and leaped to their deaths. The incredible photographs
include one of corpses in open coffins lined up on a pier for
identification. It is here, near the end of Episode 4, that the
pace picks up, the visual sources become richer, the series begins
to fulfill its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the historian, says that near the turn of the 20th
century there were in New York ``more Italians than in Naples, more
Irish than in Dublin, more Greeks than in Athens.'' By the 1920s,
Al Smith was an immigrant's dream, traveling from the Lower East
Side and a near-total lack of education to become the Democratic
candidate for president in 1928. The treasury of moving images and
sound in Episode 5 makes an enormous difference. Here is first-hand
evidence to support the idea that Smith's landslide loss to Herbert
Hoover was partly because his New York personality seemed foreign
to the rest of the country: we hear him pronouncing ``world'' as
``woild.'' We also hear him singing his theme song, ``The Sidewalks
of New York,'' in a priceless clip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by the 1920s American culture had become modern and
easier for us to identify with, altered by advertising, radio,
music. Here are glimpses of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington
playing in Harlem in their youth. Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue''
is heard in the background. Though music only becomes central in
this episode, throughout the series the choices are effective,
especially the piercingly beautiful theme by Brian Keane called,
appropriately, ``City of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Robert Sean Leonard reads Fitzgerald's words from
``The Great Gatsby,'' connecting America's story with that of the
Dutch sailors who first encountered New York, coming ``face to face
for the last time in history with something commensurate with his
capacity for wonder.'' The wonder of New York, this series argues,
represents the wonder of America itself. The novelist Caleb Carr
points out that the cliche ``Whatever happens in New York happens
in the rest of the country 10 years later'' has largely been true.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, in the age of instant information, the time lag is
more likely to be 10 days or 10 minutes. Because this part of the
series ends in 1931, the spring episode is left to question New
York's role in the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
   Already the series has raised a sidelight question about the
future of television, though, as it exposes a widening gulf between
the styles of PBS and of the MTV generation. Stunning though ``New
York'' often is, its indulgent length and pace tests the patience
of even its most serious-minded viewers. It's as if the filmmakers
failed to recognize that the days are long gone when a stately
television style seemed like a virtue.

 &HT;    Time-pressed Atlantans are feasting on the relief they get by
letting someone else cook the mega-meal
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Thanksgiving Day, Beverly Kempton will host more
than 40 friends and family at her Lawrenceville, Ga., home.
</P>
<P>
   But is she following the advice offered by most newspaper and
magazine food writers, including (just yesterday) moi? Is she
feverishly buying turkey, baking pies, cooking casseroles and
simmering stock for gravy?
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Will she rise at dawn Thanksgiving morning to lovingly make
homemade rolls and roast the birds?
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she'll work at her customer service job for Mercury Air
until 4 p.m. on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Kempton will do what a third of Americans will do this
Thanksgiving. She'll serve a dinner someone else made.
</P>
<P>
   In this age when drive-thru has become a way of life _ not
merely a lane in the parking lot at McDonald's _ more Americans are
opting out of the kitchen. A National Restaurant Association survey
estimates that 34 percent of folks include at least one takeout
item in their Thanksgiving feast. The young are more likely to do
so than seniors. Nearly half in the 18-24 age group relied on some
takeout, compared with only 20 percent of those 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Kempton plans to pick up turkey, gravy, dressing, rolls and pies
at her local grocery store. She will complete the menu with her
favorites, such as sweet potato casserole and fresh green salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cooked the whole meal before, but as time went by and
life got hectic, I decided to pick up the turkey at Kroger a couple
of years ago,'' said Kempton, 49. ``It was good, and I got to enjoy
my company.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think the Pilgrims had to send ``four men fowling'' to
get their birds, according to a firsthand account of the
17th-century meal by settler Edward Winslow. Not only did they have
to hunt the birds, but then clean and prepare them _ without ovens,
roasting pans or basters.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Khutorsky, 23, plans to put in her Thanksgiving order at
eatZi's Market and Bakery in Atlanta. Her whole family is coming to
her Midtown apartment from Miami. But most of her kitchen items
will be in boxes, because she's moving back to Miami that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have cooked the whole meal anyway. This is my first
time of being in charge of it, and I can't tackle that,'' she said.
``Even my mother has ordered a roasted turkey from the grocery
store.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes as no surprise to Robert Shepherd, deli merchandiser
for Atlanta-area Kroger stores. ``In these modern times, younger
people do not know how to cook an entire Thanksgiving meal, much
less have time to prepare one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Balzer, who tracks national eating patterns, says the
trend extends from the young to all kinds of families too pressed
for time to do much daily cooking. That leaves them unprepared for
a meal like Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are cooking less, they are eating more fast food and
takeout, and when they do prepare food at home, it's assembly _ not
cooking,'' said Balzer, who works for NPD Marketing, a broad-based
group in New York and Chicago. ``They also prepare one dish without
all the side dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bird may be the centerpiece, but everyone expects the
Thanksgiving buffet to be blanketed with sweet potatoes, green bean
casserole, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and gravy and
dressing. Pulling that off so that everything arrives to the table
piping hot at the same time is a challenge even for the most
experienced cooks, much less the no-time novices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it hasn't sent people to restaurants in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that hasn't changed in the 20 years we've been
tracking eating trends is that 90 percent or more of people will
eat a traditional Thanksgiving meal in a home rather than a
restaurant,'' said Balzer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the trend toward takeout, most people still like to
cook at least some of the meal. Both the National Turkey Federation
and the Grocery Manufacturers of America estimate only 6 percent
rely on takeout foods for the whole meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this time-starved consumer world, this is the one time
of the year where tradition holds and people will do some
cooking,'' said Sherrie Rosenblatt, spokeswoman for the NTF.
</P>
<P>
   But the likelihood of a few dishes prepared in a professional
kitchen appearing on the Thanksgiving buffet is good, starting with
the turkey. And while hosts like Kempton and Khutorsky say they are
honest about the food coming from the market rather than their
kitchen, some may not always be.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa McCue, spokeswoman for the GMA, said that last year she
found a box in the garage of her mother's home. Inside, she
discovered a fully cooked turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her about it, and she confessed that she had purchased
the turkey at a local supermarket and had done that for the last
couple of years,'' McCue said. ``But she was passing everything off
as a truly home-cooked meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the Honeybaked Ham Co., which also offers turkey, has
seen an 18 percent increase in Thanksgiving business each of the
past five years, said spokeswoman Joann Harold. Business is so
brisk the day before Thanksgiving that attendants direct parking
and lines.
</P>
<P>
   Popeye's Chicken &AMP; Biscuits sold 3,000 Cajun deep-fried turkeys
in the Atlanta area last year, a 50 percent increase from the
previous year (which was the test year), said spokesman Scott
Hudler. Cajun fried turkeys are heavily seasoned, then dropped
whole into large deep fryers, producing birds that are uncommonly
juicy.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores sell both individual items and full meals, and
most major chains say they see greater demand each year. Harris
Teeter, for example, has seen a 14 percent increase each of the
past three Thanksgivings, said spokeswoman Sonia Elam.
</P>
<P>
   The Piccadilly cafeteria on North Druid Hills Road sold 50 bulk
Thanksgiving meals last year, and associate manager Trent Sitzman
said early orders are on track to surpass that number this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller restaurants have gotten in on the action. Murphy's,
a neighborhood cafe in Virginia-Highland, began offering a gourmet
Thanksgiving meal-to-go 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with 10 orders, and now we max out at 40, which is
all my ovens will handle. I have to turn people away,'' said owner
Tom Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brian Thorton, 29, ordered the Murphy's meal. He
entertained 12 in his Stockbridge home, providing butternut squash
soup, a pear and walnut salad, turkey, dressing and sides, and he's
already put in his order for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than cooking and having a whole mess to clean
up,'' said Thorton, a manager for Coosemans produce company. ``And
I get to watch football.''
</P>

FALLEN IDOLS: TV SHOWS WALLOW IN MESSY LIVES OF FORMER CHILD STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gary Coleman wobbled onto the oval set of ``Politically
Incorrect'' and climbed up into the chair, his feet dangling, his
teeth showing, his eyes as large as bowling balls, you knew this
was going to be a hilarious zinger of a discussion _ or maybe just
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is a high-profile representative of the one minority
group we're still allowed to blithely stereotype as social
malcontents on the verge of self-annihilation, and host Bill Maher
could hardly keep his eagerness in check during the episode, which
will air Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He spit out a stinging opening monologue in which he
characterized former child stars as forgotten has-beens, people
whose future wouldn't have been as bleak had they happened upon
drugs as the addiction of choice rather than fame.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the scattered laughter, my feeling is that the
studio audience was torn, not knowing whether to chuckle about the
cliches surrounding child stars gone bad, or to acknowledge
something as humorless as the fatal drug overdose of Dana Plato,
Coleman's one-time co-star.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who spent eight years as the fluffy-cheeked Arnold on
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' Danny Bonaduce (''The Partridge Family'')
Barry Williams (''The Brady Bunch'') and Lisa Whelchel (''The Facts
of Life'') were hardly snug in their seats before Maher asked
whether his remarks were upsetting enough to jump-start a lively
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was thinking of getting a hit man for you,'' Coleman
quickly concedes. Bonaduce then cracks to Coleman: ``Just call
Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently even troubled former child stars feel comfortable
dissing other troubled child stars; Bonaduce, now one of those
shameless pop radio know-it-alls, even makes a living at it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Coleman chose not to defend Todd Bridges, who played his
older brother, Willis, on ``Strokes'' and has since built quite the
rap sheet, involving, among other police run-ins, gun-toting, crack
possession, the killing of a crack dealer (he was acquitted) and
ramming his car into a friend's vehicle (probation, community
service).
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically Correct'' is television's most chronically
hit-or-miss late-night entertainment program because it relies so
heavily upon the cross-referencing verbal fisticuffs of its guests.
Having four people agree on, say, abortion or Bill Clinton or
school vouchers puts viewers in snoozeville. Head-butting guests
are what creates hot debate _ and the crassness that makes the show
watchable.
</P>
<P>
   But the show's producers were at least on the ball in piecing
together this bunch, taking advantage of what is turning into
something of a mini-trend: the behind-the-scenes messes of '70s
icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment Tonight'' has been devoting its Saturday nights
to dredging up celebrity-filled morsels about ``what really
happened'' on shows like ``Three's Company'' and ``Charlie's
Angels.'' VH-1 delivers the same nostalgia-laced-with-scandal with
``Behind the Music.'' And ABC is promising ``things you didn't
know'' when it airs ``Come On Get Happy: The Partridge Family
Story'' Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   My theory behind the bum rush is the evolution of Bio TV,
particularly A&AMP;E's ``Biography;'' that series has been such a
success that the cable network now airs segments daily. What always
unnerved me about ``Biography'' was its uncompelling point of view
_ it merely delivers connect-the-dots storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   It was a matter of time before the genre expanded and was pumped
with contemporary cynicism. We want and need interpretation, to
better satisfy a public conditioned to want the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   On ``PI,'' Maher did make the point that not all child stars go
wrong, bringing up Jodie Foster and Ron Howard (others include
Kellie Martin of ``ER,'' Malcolm-Jamal Warner of ``Malcolm &AMP;
Eddie'' and Sarah Michelle Gellar'' of ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer''). But as a group, child actors seem unable to properly
socialize, too often veering into violence, promiscuity, immorality
or drug dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was the most vocal of the guests, often coming off as
angry and bitter, particularly when he talked about parental
pressure (he sued his parents and former manager, claiming they had
mishandled his earnings) and how parents want to be the stars
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Coleman says, ``you have these parents who aren't
good parents. They don't know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   When serious, Bonaduce makes good, honest points; Williams
serves as the voice of reason; and Whelchel probably wondered what
she'd stumbled into.
</P>
<P>
   She often looked at the others, particularly Coleman, with
amused pity, telling them that she hasn't spent much time looking
back. Shortly after the series wrapped, she married a minister and
had three kids. She's been raising a family and living a life she
finds quite satisfying. ``Is (leaving a show) the end of your
life,'' she says, ``or the beginning?''
</P>
<P>
   Maher smiled. Bonaduce laughed. Coleman just looked straight
ahead.

   GINGRICH-DIVORCE _ Newt Gingrich's refusal to answer all of his
estranged wife's questions about his finances and love-life could
cost him thousands of dollars. Divorce lawyers for the Gingriches
argued over the questions in Cobb Superior Court Thursday during a
motions hearing, the couple's first since the former U.S. House
speaker filed for divorce in July. The two-hour hearing, which
Gingrich skipped, was spiced with the same tediously contentious
tone that has marked the case for the past three months. ``I really
believe Mr. Gingrich is trifling with the court, '' said John
Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney. (Stanford, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DIVORCE-SOUTH _ Divorce rates in four Bible Belt states _
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama _ are now roughly 50
percent above the national average. Experts blame low income, young
marriages and a religious fundamentalism that offers few guidelines
for struggling couples. Some lawmakers have declared a ``marital
emergency.'' Ga. is in the top 20, as is most of the Southern
states. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   VET-WOMANFLYER _ This veteran's story is not set on a
battlefield, nor on foreign soil. Not a shot was fired. No one got
a medal. But it is a story of courage as certain and admirable as
any, and of service to a country in desperate need. It's about a
woman who flew America's war planes. (Palm Beach Post). 60.
</P>
<P>
   ENGINEERS _ DAYTON _ The financial crisis of the historic
Engineer's Club, which once had Orville and Wilbur Wright as
members, has worsened and the club has placed a 25 percent
assessment on all members. The club _ which has drained its cash
reserves and lost nearly $250,000 in the last four years _ has
missed payroll and had its uniforms confiscated for missing rent
payments on them. ``We have cash flow problems that take us close
to the edge of financial disaster,'' a letter to members states.
(Kline, Dayton Daily News). 15.
</P>
<P>
   LADYBIRD _AUSTIN, Texas _ Former first lady Lady Bird Johnson
was in fair condition at Seton Medical Center Thursday after
fainting at her home. Liz Carpenter, her former White House
spokeswoman, said Mrs. Johnson, 86, ``has periodic fainting
spells'' and was taken to Seton as a precaution. She will be held
overnight. (Davenport, Austin American-Statesman)

   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   COVERDELL _ Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell is acting as George
Bush's ``point man'' in the Senate, keeping Bush informed about
actions in Washington and his fellow Senators informed about Bush.
That task grew testy during Bush's recent criticism of
congressional Republicans. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN _ John McCain made the most of Veterans' Day in New
Hampshire, which is not surprising. In the Granite State and in
South Carolina _ the state with the highest per captia
concentration of veterans _ McCain is running on his military as
well as his Senate record. But how is it playing? (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   GOPPOLL _ Rival John McCain pulls even with George W. Bush in
New Hampshire in a new poll that raises questions about Bush's
strategy to ride a wave of inevitability to the GOP presidential
nomination. The poll says the Texas governor's favorability rating
has dropped 15 points in the past month. (Heath, Austin

   MILITARY-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ At a time when some aircraft have
been grounded for lack spare parts, the Air Force continues to
order other inventory that it no longer needs. A new study by the
U.S. General Accounting Office says that $384 million worth of
unneeded items, including disc brakes, engine rotors, and computer
keyboards, were still being bought. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   FEDBUD-SCHOOLS _ WASHINGTON _ Under a deal struck by the
Democratic president and Republican-controlled Congress, public
schools will get a 10 percent increase next year in their funds for
hiring new teachers for the early grades. The program for grades
1-to-3 was expanded to cover lowering class size in kindergartens
as well. But federal spending per poor student under the Title I
anti-poverty program will dip slightly, and Clinton's drive for tax
subsidies for school districts that need more classrooms is dead.

   ISRAEL-HILLARY _ RAMALLAH, West Bank _ First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's only stop in a Palestinian venue during her trip to the
Middle East Thursday gave her an earful of a subject she probably
wanted to avoid. At the awarding of a grant for early-childhood
clinics, Suha Arafat, wife of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, and two health officials said what they really need
to make their people healthy is a Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital. Clinton, a likely candidate for a New York Senate
seat, sparked controversy a year ago when she said thought
Palestinian state would help bring peace. As she has considered the
Senate race and tried to appeal to New York voters, she has backed
Israeli control of Jerusalem. She sat with a tight grin as she
listened to the speeches Thursday. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 20.

   UNDATED _ As anyone who has seen Luc Besson's garishly insane
``The Fifth Element'' can attest, restraint is not exactly this
director's forte. So when news came that his next movie would be
about Joan of Arc, skepticism reared its ugly head; his style
seemed too wild for a movie about a saint, even one as mercurial as
the 15th-century French heroine. But Besson deserves the benefit of
the doubt: He's visually inventive, in love with explosions of
color, and his hallucinatory style could be made to fit the

AUTHORS EXAMINE ALAN GREENSPAN AND HIS INFLUENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a superstar known by one name, like Madonna or Pavarotti,
constantly chased by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He is powerful, some say second only to the president of the
United States. He influential businesses and markets, more so than
Bill Gates or Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not a movie star or rock musician or political or
corporate leader. He's an economist, a bespectacled bank official
with a crammed, overflowing briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alan Greenspan affects nearly every corner of this complex,
constantly changing world, according to two authors. He has for 13
years, and if he gains his predicted reappointment as chairman of
the U.S. Federal Reserve System next year, he will remain in the
hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   How Greenspan made the Fed chairmanship such a pinnacle of power
and how he influences world markets are explored in ``The Greenspan
Effect: Words That Move the World's Markets'' (McGraw Hill, 273
pages, $18.95).
</P>
<P>
   Consultants and bestselling authors David B. Sicilia and Jeffrey
L. Cruikshank are the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The two have done their homework on this fascinating economist,
producing a lively read despite the profound dullness of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Sicilia and Cruikshank stay away from technical jargon and
charts and often discuss the issues using Greenspan's own words.
Much of their research is from 3,500 pages of Greenspan's
three-times-a-week speeches to students, industry groups and other
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   What results is perhaps one of the most intimate pictures yet of
a man trying very hard to control his own limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that control is necessary given that any sneeze from
Greenspan seems to send world markets into hysterics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our subject has become a megacelebrity: known, respected,
feared, scrutinized, consulted, and quoted throughout the world,''
Sicilia and Cruikshank write. ``Alan Greenspan has emerged as one
of the most influential actors on the world economic stage.''
</P>
<P>
   How has he done this? Under his leadership, changes in the
Federal Reserve's discount rate _ the interest it charges on loans
to member banks _ at key moments in the past 13 years coincide with
a period in which the U.S. economy has enjoyed its longest
uninterrupted growth. His tweaking has brought order to our
economy, even when the rest of the world is in chaos, the authors
write.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the past two years, when a whopping 40 percent of the
world's economies collapsed. Many believed that the United States
would catch some of the downward spiral by default.
</P>
<P>
   But Sicilia and Cruikshank write: ``Greenspan was determined to
prevent that from happening. He worked feverishly with officials at
the Fed and the U.S. Treasury to throw up the best possible
defenses on the beaches and keep the U.S. economy as robust as
possible. Again, the strategy worked magnificently. In early 1999
the U.S. economy was expanding at a blistering 5 percent annual
growth rate, with unemployment at a 28-year low.''
</P>
<P>
   But controlling the Fed rate is only part of Greenspan's bag of
tricks, the authors write. His methodology for determining economic
soundness is unusual, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He begins with nitty-gritty data _ on inventory levels,
product delivery times, and the like _ and crunches numbers until
he sees the contours of larger patterns beginning to emerge,'' they
write. ``As a friend once commented with only slight exaggeration,
Greenspan is the `kind of person who knew how many thousand
flathead bolts were used in a 1964 Chevrolet, and what it would do
to the national economy if you took out three of them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's career is spelled out to readers in this informative
and interesting read.

DALE EARNHARDT JR. WANTS TO BE HIS OWN SELF
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Kyle Petty, it meant long hair and earrings at a time when
no one had ever seen them in a NASCAR garage.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. will be more subtle, but there is no question
that he, like Petty before him, wants to forge his own identity.
</P>
<P>
   When he began his racing career, the one thing Kyle Petty didn't
want to be known as was Richard Petty's son, and he went to great
lengths to separate himself from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty was jeans and boots and rodeo-sized belt buckles
and a cowboy hat. Kyle Petty was wild music and the hair and the
earrings and just about anything else his father wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was understandable. How would you like to be Babe
Ruth's son and play baseball?
</P>
<P>
   While it may not be quite the same, Earnhardt Jr. is in a
similar situation as he prepares to compete full time for the first
time in Winston Cup next year.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Dale Earnhardt, is the Richard Petty of his era, and
the younger Earnhardt's arrival on the stock car scene is one of
the most anticipated happenings in the sport in some time.
</P>
<P>
   Having just turned 25 and with two Busch series championships
behind him, Earnhardt Jr., or ``Little E'' as he is called, seems
to be more pragmatic about what is going on around him. He is
perhaps better able to put things in perspective than Kyle Petty
was at a similar point in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   He accepts that he will be closely associated with his dad, but
at the same time and like Kyle Petty before him, Earnhardt is
adamant about becoming his own man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's possible if you're successful,'' Earnhardt Jr.
said. ``If you're not successful it's very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just go on and take it one day at a time and do the best
you can. Creating your own identity will take care of itself,''
Earnhardt Jr. said. ``It's not something you do. It's not an
activity or something you focus on. It's something that just
happens by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always going to be an Earnhardt, but I sure want people to
know that as much as I love my dad, we have differences. That's
only natural. We don't like the same kind of music, and there's a
lot of other things, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I end up being pretty successful at this and am a
successful race car driver for many years to come, people are going
to find that out and that'll be cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. said he liked Nirvana and Pearl Jam and other
alternative rock and that he is also a big Elvis Presley fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a lot of rock 'n' roll and soul music and disco, and a
lot of rap. Dad just listens to country. I think he needs to spread
out a little more than that,'' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt is close to the members of a Charlotte
area rock band, Bridge, and has sat in with them on the drums.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kyle Petty was a talented singer and guitar player
who had his own band for a number of years and probably could have
made a good living as a musician.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has no thoughts of doing anything like that, just as
Petty put down his guitar to concentrate on racing.
</P>
<P>
   But while Petty tended to follow his own path early in his
career, Earnhardt Jr. figures to feed off his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever get to a point where your dad tells you
that you're right,'' Earnhardt Jr. said.``As long as you live,
you're always going to think you know more than he does, and he's
always going to tell you that you don't. That's something I don't
think you ever grow out of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's done so much for the sport, and he's in a position
now where I'd be a fool to think I knew more than he did,'' he
said. ``If there's a person whose respect I want to earn out there,
it's his.''

PETS ENRICH OUR LIVES
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Nov. 18)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm reading in front of the fire, and our 12-year-old German
shepherd is on the rug by my feet, sleeping lightly, chest moving
up and down. It is as familiar to me as my own breathing, this
companionship of dog and book.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our pets are senior citizens, nearing the final years of
their brief spans of life. I joke with friends that we're going to
have a mass die-off soon, but my fear is that we really will and
that my family's fragile, pet-loving hearts won't be able to take
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bud, our cockatiel, is 14, adopted during my junior year of
college when my dormitory director moved in with her boyfriend and
his cat. He never learned to talk, but he can wolf whistle like a
pro and does some opera singing when I coax him.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, Mercury and Saturn, are 13, the ``kittens'' of a
tortoise-shell stray Jim found behind a Dumpster on midnight patrol
in Ybor City. Equinox, a stellar feline, was our beloved first cat
as a couple, but she died young after tangling with a water
moccasin, so we were happy to have her progeny. Mercury and Saturn
have remained inseparable, grooming and sleeping curled into each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Callie, a calico adopted in Gainesville when I was a grad
student at the University of Florida, was a mismatch from the
start. I chose her because she looked like Equinox but was unaware
that she was, at best, operating on very low brainpower. A
beautiful cat even at 11, she has never caught on to washing
herself, and she drools when you pet her (not conducive to becoming
a lap cat.)
</P>
<P>
   But she's hung around through two moves now, despite Saturn and
Mercury's utter and enduring disdain for her. So, due to my
philosophy that once you choose a pet, it is yours forever more, we
feed her and brush her and give her a warm place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Star, our shepherd, is the protective old girl of the house, and
still has a bark that can knock the socks off a UPS deliveryman.
She's the granddaughter of a Tampa K-9 who rode in police
helicopters to crime scenes. Intelligent and serene, she has been
madly in love with my husband since the day he chose her from the
litter because she fell asleep on his foot.
</P>
<P>
   When she was an outdoor dog, she would walk around the house
until she found a window she could see Jim through and then gaze at
him for hours as he worked or ate or watched TV. Star, like John
Updike's dog made famous in his free verse, ``knows no nonhuman
word for love.''
</P>
<P>
   We also have two 3-year-old dogs, taken on during the insanity
of my last maternity leave with the misguided postpartum notion
that I could take care of a newborn and two puppies at the same
time. A German shepherd and a black lab mix, they accompany me on
my nightly walks but live outdoors. They worship Star as the Wise
One who Lives in the House with the Humans.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn sleeps with our son Adam on cold nights. Our daughter
Sarah whispers her secrets to Star every morning. Our house has
never been broken into. Bud wolf-whistles at me even on bad hair
days.
</P>
<P>
   I hope our pets know, in their animal way, of the comfort
they've given. I say that my children have learned to be more
gentle and giving because we have pets. But the truth is, we all
have.

CEZANNE ART REVIEW: JUST ENOUGH COLOR IN A WORLD OF WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The watercolors of Paul Cezanne rank high among the
wonders of Western European art. For this reason, the chance of
seeing 46 of them at the Acquavella Galleries is not to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about Cezanne's watercolors is not so
much what he did as what he didn't need to do. He never manipulated
the medium. The white of the paper was an equal partner, not a
dance floor on which Cezanne would come on like Nijinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There are landscapes in the Acquavella show _ among them ``The
Bellevue House on the Hill'' (1885-1890) and ``The Mill at the Pont
des Trois Sautets'' (1890-94) _ in which Cezanne almost seems to
stand aside while the paper does its full share.
</P>
<P>
   He does not spell out the wooded hillside that leads up to the
Bellevue House, but the house itself rides high and steadily. We
can read it floor by floor and sense just how much of a climb it
would be to get there.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing ``clever'' about what Cezanne does, here or
anywhere else. He just leaves it to us to marry the extensive
untouched white of the paper with his own perfectly judged touches
of color, here and there.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Mill House,'' we know from a photograph taken around
1934 by the Cezanne scholar John Rewald that this was a dreary
place in scruffy country. But the artist once again let the white
of the paper do much of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The mill house, as he showed it, is light enough to dance in the
air, almost. The everyday industrial chimney shoots upward toward
the sky, changing color as it tops the tree line. The image as a
whole has balance, form and proportion. This is a white world,
flecked with yellow and green. Maybe it was never like this (the
mill no longer exists), but he makes us feel that this was a place
to treasure. He shows us how to look, but he also shows us where to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Cezanne was the only man who could paint a rose without
describing it and leave us convinced that we have seen it. He did
this in the ``Rose in Greenery'' in the present show. The greenery
is an upward oval of pale green leaves, nuanced with blue and
purple.
</P>
<P>
   We never see the rose, but we know that it is there because of
the touches of pale pink that surround a white center. We do not
see it, but we smell it.
</P>
<P>
   The show also has a magnificent wall of still lifes, some of the
grandest of the artist's evocations of rocks, a very fine group of
single-figure portraits and some views of the countryside around
Aix-en-Provence (including Mont Sainte-Victoire).
</P>
<P>
   There is also an affectionate little ``Game of Love'' in which
men and women carry on like puppies. But Cezanne's erotic interests
could come out even where they are least expected, as for instance
in the ``Two Melons'' (circa 1885). What are those two melons
doing, one asks oneself, if not making love?
</P>
<P>
   For the colossal sensuality that Cezanne usually kept private,
the great drawings of the rocks above the Chateau Noir are the
place to look, no matter how indirectly he showed his feelings.
There are two such drawings in this show. Rocks are rocks, and we
don't usually think of them as having feelings. But in their tender
conjunctions, an undeclared love has its place.
</P>
<P>
   Something that we may never see again on a single wall is the
group of eight still lifes that all date from 1900 until 1906 (the
year of Cezanne's death).
</P>
<P>
   So far from leaving things out, in these complex constructions,
he continually raised the stakes against himself, as in the ``Still
Life With Apples and Inkpot'' (1902-06).
</P>
<P>
   The great intruder in this watercolor is the massive inkpot.
Everything else echoes the red and the gold of the apples.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the red and gold present in the apples, on the
surface of the table and on the walls, but they also give
themselves an encore in that, as Rewald said, ``the contours of
some objects have been repeated so often that they almost seem to
be vibrating.'' As for the inkpot, it has something weighty to add
that is all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Rewald, in agreement with his longtime colleague Lawrence
Gowing, went on to say that ``those strange staccato outlines that
Gowing aptly called `vibrating edges' somehow integrate themselves
perfectly into the sea of washes which surrounds them, so that _
whether this was intended or not _ they pulsate in unison.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this astonishing wall, Cezanne takes his repertory
company of household objects _ bottles, a decanter, a skull, a
patterned rug, a spirit stove, seasonal fruits and kitchen
essentials _ and he makes them do something new every time. Never
do they look like the last work of a dying man.
</P>
<P>
   As William Rubin reminds us in his foreword to the show, Cezanne
wrote to his dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1903: ``I am working
doggedly, for I perceive the Promised Land. Shall I be like the
great Hebrew leader, or shall I be able to enter it?''
</P>
<P>
   We see that Promised Land of painting in these watercolors, even
if he did not.
</P>
<P>
   This wonderful show is a benefit for the department of
ophthalmology of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia
University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Cezanne's watercolors are at Acquavella Galleries, the gallery
prefers this name especially with the Cezanne Contemporary Art,
Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300, through Nov. 24.

WEB SITE HAS CAR SHOPPERS CLICKING MOUSES, NOT KICKING TIRES 
</HEADLINE>

 By JENNIFER MERRITT   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ When it comes to cars, Robert Bowden knows a
thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   He's driven more than 1,000 of them in the last decade,
reviewing their performance for newspapers and now for his own Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealers fear his sometimes scathing prose and consumers use
his weekly reviews like a handbook, netting the Sarasota
grandfather 260,000 hits on his Web site each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write about the good things, but I focus on the things that
are wrong because the auto magazines don't,'' Bowden said. ``On the
Internet, you can tell the truth. And when you've driven all these
cars, you have a basis for comparison the consumer doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Car Place, at www.thecarplace.com, was launched in June 1995
as an Internet site designed to tell consumers the truth about
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who was a newspaper reporter and editor for more than 30
years and was online editor for Time Warner's cable modem
operation, Road Runner, reviews a new car every week for the Car
Place. Bowden began reviewing cars when he worked as The Tampa
Tribune's auto editor for nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, 58, rarely drives his own classic 1970 Plymouth
Roadrunner. Instead, he usually drives a car delivered to him by an
automaker for a week and writes his reviews based on everything
from comfort and speed to reliability and value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is opinion, but I give you a point to start,'' Bowden said.
``I'm trying to provide real help to the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Each car is rated on a scale of one to four James Deans. One
James Dean signals a car that's at the bottom of the barrel, while
four James Deans is ``'bout as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the Car Place got fewer than 50 hits each
week. But after Yahoo! and Netscape named the fledgling Web site a
favorite, the number of hits quickly grew to nearly 50,000, he
said, and now he gets more than a quarter of a million hits per
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted was eyeballs, not fame or money,'' Bowden
said. ``When I have an audience big enough, I will change Detroit.
We're going to help make better cars, and that's what drives me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Bowden becomes the exclusive auto reviewer for
carprices.com, a Web site that explains the car buying and
selection process to consumers. In late November, Bowden will
become the reviewer for Campus Pipeline, an Internet portal in use
at more than 500 colleges nationwide, Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   With Campus Pipeline, Bowden's reviews could reach up to 3.7
million college students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing reviews and maintaining the Car Place on
the Internet, Bowden is creative director at Mind Magic, a Sarasota
company that operates the Family Network, a Web site geared toward
children.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden updates www.thecarplace.com and writes his reviews on
Saturdays, he said.

   &UR; A Departure for Ang Lee &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Ang Lee was getting a little tired of doing what
seemed to him to be the same kinds of movies, even though their
settings were so wildly different: modern-day Taiwan in ``The
Wedding Banquet'' (1993), Jane Austen's England in ``Sense and
Sensibility'' (1995) and 1970s suburban Connecticut in ``The Ice
Storm'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``I did five family dramas in a row,'' Lee said. ``I did nothing
but family drama. I wanted to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did the obvious thing for a Taiwanese-born,
Connecticut-living director of eclectic tastes. He decided to make
a big action film set during the American Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something more macho, you know, and I wanted to
make a war movie,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague recommended making a film based on ``Ride With the
Devil,'' a book that she'd read several years ago, about young
friends fighting as bushwackers in rural Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a book that came out and there was some interest in it
about 10 years ago, then it kind of got lost and nobody made the
movie, so she tracked it down for me,'' Lee said. ``It turned out
it had been out of print for eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   The story turned out to be exactly what Lee wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a pre-western, with images that I didn't think
I'd ever seen before on film, about these young flamboyant men,
some of them aristocratic, riding their horses in the woods,'' he
said. ``And the main characters were outsiders, not entirely
trusted by the group, which I could very much identify with, being
myself an outsider in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he tried hard to make the film as authentic as
possible, something that has always been a particular passion for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's a good thing, because if it's bogus, you
look bogus,'' Lee said. ``The nature of cinema is photography, it's
realism. It's not like the stage or painting or music. It has the
least chance of being abstract, so realism is the most effective,
to bring the audience into the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is to be released in New York and Los Angeles on Nov.
24, and then in more cities on Dec. 10. It stars Tobey Maguire and
Skeet Ulrich as Missouri pals who take to the woods to fight for
the Confederacy, and the country singer Jewel as the young woman
they both come to love. There are big action scenes, wide vistas,
macho banter. But it's also, at one level, a family drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess I can't help it,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Directorial Debut &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sally Field, wearing blue jeans and an intensely focused gaze,
watched through the monitors as several dozen fancifully dressed
women _ including Minnie Driver in an abbreviated Indian maiden's
costume, complete with feathered headdress _ pranced and sang
across the stage of the Shubert Theater in Century City one recent
afternoon. Ms. Field, a two-time Oscar-winning actress, was
directing Ms. Driver in ``Beautiful,'' which is to be Ms. Field's
debut as a theatrical film director, though she has already done
some praised work on television _ ``The Christmas Tree'' in 1996,
starring Julie Harris, and episode 11 of the Tom Hanks-produced
``From the Earth to the Moon,'' the part about the astronauts'
wives, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Field said she got the itch to direct during the several
years she was on the board of the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say, you've got to try this,'' she said. ``I
guess it was sort of drifting around my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a tough, difficult working-class woman, played
by Ms. Driver, who is obsessed with winning a major beauty pageant,
even to the extent of neglecting her own family and her own deeper
emotional needs. The sequence Ms. Field was shooting was a musical
number from the pageant that climaxes the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the Miss American Miss pageant, not the Miss
America pageant,'' said Kate Driver, Minnie's sister and partner in
Two Drivers Productions, which got the project going. ``And it is
supposed to be taking place in Long Beach, not in Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers are emphatic on this point, as they do not have
the rights to use the term Miss America pageant for the film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Field said she was not drawn to the film by its setting in
the beauty pageant world, but by the character played by Ms. Driver
and by the working-class setting not so far removed from her own
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comedy, but it's really a character study,'' Ms. Field
said. ``This woman is driven out of anger. She is not nice. She
does not feel the need to be sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actress who has struggled with the Hollywood tendency to
present women who are either saints or whores, Ms. Field said she
was eager that her first film would be about a woman who was more
complex and, perhaps, more demanding on audiences than the plastic
female caricatures they are often given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful'' is to be released next spring by Destination
Films.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver said she met with Ms. Field at the urging of the
Creative Artists Agency, which represents them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the whole CAA-meet-our-directors-first thing,'' Ms.
Driver said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said there was little doubt that Ms. Field would be
perfect as director as soon as they sat down and talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a woman in mind to do it, because I thought the story
would be helped by that, and Sally seemed to really understand the
story and the character immediately,'' Ms. Driver said. ``And it's
really been great. I really came to trust her choices. The way she
speaks about acting is really the way I feel about acting, so
simple and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Field said that working on the project had been fun for her,
too, and that she hoped to direct more films, but also intended to
continue acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that I think I'm finding at this point in my
career that a lot of the things I'm being offered are like, hey, I
did this already,'' Ms. Field said. ``With directing, it's
energizing, it's exciting, but it's also very hard and
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Golf Cart Required &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wick was tooling around the Columbia front lot in his golf
cart, peering into the open hangar doors of the studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great to do this,'' he said. ``I love going around
the lot, seeing what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wick's Red Wagon Productions is housed on Columbia's Culver City
lot, where it finds itself coincidentally responsible for a
substantial chunk of the studio's holiday offerings. Wick is a
producer of both ``Girl, Interrupted,'' starring Winona Ryder as a
troubled young woman who is sent by her parents to a hospital for
the mentally ill (James Mangold directs), and ``Stuart Little,'' a
part-live, part-animated adaptation of the E.B. White classic
starring Geena Davis (Rob Minkoff directs). Both are due out in
December.
</P>
<P>
   He is also involved in post-production on his next film, Ridley
Scott's ``Gladiator,'' an epic set in ancient Rome starring Russell
Crowe, scheduled for release next May. And he is in the final weeks
of the shooting of ``The Hollow Man,'' an invisible-man thriller
starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue that Paul Verhoeven is
directing on the Columbia lot, which is due out next July. It's to
that set that Wick is heading in his golf cart, but he can't resist
poking his nose into the other soundstages he passes on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of crazy, as you can imagine, with all of these
films in the works,'' he said, slowing down to pass an open studio
door that seemed to look into a dark woods somewhere in the
Northeast, with a Victorian house nestled in the moonlight. ``Hey,
what's this?''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped the cart and chatted up one of the nearby craftsmen.
It was the set of Robert Zemeckis' new film, `What Lies Beneath,''
starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to be Vermont,'' Wick reported. ``This is great,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wick led the way through the labyrinthine ``Hollow Man''
set, meant to be a super-secret underground laboratory where
Bacon's character, who has turned himself invisible, is hunting
down his co-workers and killing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing, isn't it?'' Wick said. ``It just twists
around. I think this is the main laboratory.'' He opened the door.
No, it was a storage closet. ``Hmmm,'' he said, ``It's around here
somewhere.'' Bright orange exit signs were posted at almost every
intersection. ``We had to do that, because people were getting lost
in here,'' Wick said.
</P>
<P>
   Verhoeven and Bacon were shooting a scene in which the invisible
man ( Bacon was in a blue costume that would be rendered barely
visible in the smoky room by special effects) was about to
perforate a co-worker with a crowbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great, isn't it?'' Wick said as he watched one take,
then another, fake blood spilling across the floor. ``Let's go see
what else is going on.''

LEADERS IN THREE STATES TAKE STEPS TO CUT DIVORCE RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has become the first leading public
or religious leader in America to declare a ''marital emergency''
in his state and to call for a ''50 percent cut in the divorce
rate'' beginning in the state and across the country by the year
2010.
 &HT;    How? He has proposed that a ''new Community Marriage Policy'' be
established in ''all communities of Arkansas.''
 &HT;    ``There is a limit to what a government can do. Government
cannot pass laws to change the hearts of men and women, but it can
encourage churches, synagogues and people of faith to unite
together to help people prepare for marriage,'' he said to hundreds
of pastors and lay leaders who gathered to attend a Governor's
Conference on the Family Oct. 23.
 &HT;    In Wisconsin a proposal by Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen became
law last week that will hire a person in state government to work
with the clergy and civic leaders in developing Community Marriage
Policies across Wisconsin. It was the first such position in
America.
 &HT;    ''We spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year in our
state dealing with the fallout of failed marriages and broken
homes,'' said Jensen. ''It just makes common sense that we make an
investment on the front end to strengthen marriages around our
state.''
 &HT;    In Louisiana, another state-wide initiative to create Community
Marriage Policies came from the Louisiana Family Forum, a nonprofit
group affiliated with Focus on the Family. It organized clergy in
Baton Rouge and Alexandria to sign a CMP last week and gathered two
clergy groups in Shreveport to consider a similar step to cut the
divorce rate.
 &HT;    A rabbi joined Protestant pastors and Catholic priests in
Alexandria, for example, signing the Central Louisiana Community
Marriage Agreement which pledges an end to quickie weddings, by
requiring ''a minimum of four months of marriage preparation'' that
includes ''a minimum of four premarital counseling sessions
utilizing the scriptures, a premarital inventory and intensive
education.''
 &HT;    They also pledged to ''train mature married couples to serve as
mentors to those who are engaged, newlywed or experience marriage
difficulties.'' Among those to be recruited to help troubled
marriages are Mentor Couples ''whose own marriages were once in
trouble.''
 &HT;    In fairness, I must disclose a personal interest in these
developments. Each of these leaders asked my wife and I to speak
about how Community Marriage Policies are bringing down divorce
rates in dozens of cities. We have helped the clergy of 116 cities
adopt these reforms and have been in awe of the results, which are
not wholly explicable.
 &HT;    Nationally, there has only been a 1.3 percent decline in the
number of divorces nationally from 1,179,000 divorces in 1979 to
1,163,000 in 1997. But with a CMP in a two-county corner of
Northwest Arkansas, they fell 6 percent in one year, saving 150
marriages and 7 percent in Eau Claire in two years.
 &HT;    In Kansas City, Kansas and two suburban counties, divorces fell
from 1,530 in 1995 to 1,001 in 1997, a remarkable 35 percent plunge
in two years.
 &HT;    Most astonishing is El Paso, which had 5,126 divorces in 1996
when clergy adopted a Community Marriage Policy (CMP) in September
of that year. There were 5,009 the next year, a big drop to 4,041
in 1998 and if the pattern of the first eight months of 1999 holds
up, there will be only 1,919 divorces this year according to the
county clerk's office. ''That is a 63 percent drop. I am
incredulous,'' said Barney Field, Director of El Paso for Jesus.
 &HT;    The CMP is only partly responsible for that enormous plunge in
divorces. Field convinced the El Paso Times to publish the entire
New Testament, in daily segments through 1997, so that a person
could read each segment in five minutes, during a ''Year of the
Bible.'' In 1998, ''The Year of the Family,'' the paper published a
daily story featuring a key family value such as honesty.
 &HT;    These steps have transformed the culture in El Paso from
selfishness - which destroys marriages - to selflessness, which
builds them.
 &HT;    It is proof that Huckabee's dream of cutting the divorce rate in
half is realistic. In fact, Bishop Kevin Mannoia, president of the
conservative National Association of Evangelicals, attended the
50th anniversary meeting of the liberal National Council of
Churches of Christ in Cleveland this week and challenged them and
Roman Catholics to join in making marriage such a priority that the
nation's divorce rate would drop by 50 percent, saving 600,000
marriages a year by 2010.
 &HT;    It is achievable. If only one-third of America's 300,000
churches trained 10 Mentor Couples each, there would be one million
Mentor Couples who could easily save 600,000 marriages.
 &HT;    This is a goal that America's Christian churches might pledge to
work toward at an American Marriage Summit to be held next year, in
honor of the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus, who said,
''What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.''

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Matthew Shepard murder case is finally over. More than a
year ago, the Wyoming college student was the victim of a brutal
gay bashing -- kidnapped, beaten, and left to die tied to a fence
post.
 &HT;    One of his two attackers, Russell Henderson, entered a plea of
guilty to murder and was sentenced last spring. The second, Aaron
McKinney, was convicted of the same last week.
 &HT;    At McKinney's sentencing, the victim's father, Dennis Shepard,
did not demand the penalty for his son's killer. Instead, he asked
for life imprisonment:
 &HT;    ``I would like nothing better than to see you die, Mr. McKinney.
However, this is the time to begin the healing process, to show
mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy -- Mr. McKinney, I'm
going to grant you life, as hard as it is for me to do so, because
of Matthew -- I give you life in the memory of one who no longer
lives.''
 &HT;    With those astonishing words, part of his longer statement to
the court, Dennis Shepard aligned himself with one of the most
politically unpopular issues in the United States -- opposition to
the death penalty. He put a human face, that of a grieving parent,
on an ``issue.'' That face is one of mercy.
 &HT;    Several years ago, a rather conservative theologian friend
surprised me by stating, ``If Jesus came today, he'd be a black
lesbian.'' Not intended as an insult, he was making a point. As a
Jew in the ancient Roman world, Jesus belonged to a marginal and
disliked group. He was an outsider who sided with outsiders. If he
had been born in our world, where would we find him? Surely, as my
acquaintance speculated, with gay and lesbian persons.
 &HT;    And there he is: Matthew Shepard -- hanging broken on a stake --
witnessing to the suffering of innocent persons in a society
riddled with hatred, prejudice, and violence. He does not seek
retribution, no ``eye for an eye.'' Instead, we hear what may have
been his last words: ``Father, forgive them. They know not what
they do.''
 &HT;    Or there she is: Cassie Bernall. An awkward teen-age girl with a
bullet through her head. ``Do you believe in God?'' her killer
asked. ``Yes.'' She lay dead on the floor of a school in Littleton,
Colorado.
 &HT;    ``There's the whole question of revenge,'' writes her mother,
``It's normal, I think, to want to bite back, whether through
filing a lawsuit or by other means. But in the case of Cassie's
murderers, we could never go after their families. They lost
children too, and it would be cruel to act as if their grief were
any less than our own.''
 &HT;    It is an odd, and perhaps providential, coincidence that two
Jesus-like figures should come into public view at the same time.
Matthew and Cassie were very different; one a gay Episcopalian and
the other a Bible-believing, born-again Christian. In a political
culture war, they would be combatants on different sides. The
progressive versus the traditionalist. Liberal versus conservative.
 &HT;    But these murdered children are forever paired as innocents
struck down by hate. And they are joined by the witness of merciful
parents struggling in grief yet willing to do what seems humanly
impossible -- forgive the murderers. Not cheap, facile forgiveness.
Not forgiveness offered in haste. Tough, painful, undeserved mercy.
 &HT;    Matthew and Cassie were not on different sides. They were both
on God's side. Martyrs, victims made victorious through, as Matthew
Shepard's father said, ``Good coming out of evil.''
 &HT;    Good? Matthew and Cassie point to our real enemies: hatred, fear
and intolerance.
 &HT;    Too often Jesus -- and religion in general -- is used as a
weapon of hate, fear and intolerance. Matthew and Cassie embody the
real Jesus. For Christians, Jesus is the one who, undeserving of
death, nevertheless died. The murdered child of God, suffering
without purpose. ``Father, forgive them. They know not what they
do.''
 &HT;    And God forgave. God forgave, forgave, and forgave more. God
opened heaven's gates and let in all the suffering outsiders --
thieves, tax collectors, prostitutes, gentiles, murderers.
 &HT;    Mercy. God knew what it meant to have mercy. God the Father lost
his only son as the Mother held him in her arms. Jesus, Buddha,
faith, spirituality, religion -- Christian, Jewish, Muslim,
whatever name it is called -- is not hate. It is love. Love that
can embrace in mercy, however painful, the murderer of a child.
 &HT;    As a nation, as parents, we stand united in our grief for
children -- united in love, acceptance and tolerance.
 &HT;    No culture warrior, no hate-monger politician, no radical
preaching fear can divide us. We have Matthew and Cassie, a gay
Christian man and a born-again girl, as our witnesses.
 &HT;    Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy.

PENTAGON ASKS CLINTON TO REOPEN VIEQUES BOMBING RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Pentagon leaders urged President Clinton
Thursday to immediately reopen an embattled target range in Puerto
Rico to allow final combat training by an aircraft carrier battle
group headed for the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, backed by Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig, Chief of Naval Operations Jay L. Johnson and Marine
Commandant James L. Jones Jr., made the appeal to the president at
a White House meeting after fruitless efforts to open negotiations
with Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Aguilar, the spokesman for Rossello, called the Pentagon
recommendation an intermediate step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the secretary made those recommendations does
not mean necessarily that the president is going to follow them,''
Aguilar said in a telephone interview from San Juan. ``This is just
one step. The final decision is the hands of the commander-in-chief
_ and that is the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says it needs to resume target practice on the island
of Vieques to enable a Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the
aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to begin four to six
weeks of combat rehearsals in early December.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet is scheduled to head to the Persian Gulf on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the defense secretary and leaders from the Navy and Marine
Corps sought resumption of target practice after concluding that
Puerto Rico's political leaders will not negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we have an issue with the Eisenhower battle group that
we need to resolve,'' the Defense Department official said. ``We
have an immediate concern about our ability to fully train that
battle group for deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Pentagon and Navy have not found
alternatives to training on Vieques, which is 8 miles east of the
main island of Puerto Rico. In preparation for overseas
deployments, carrier-based warplanes rocket, bomb and strafe a
899-acre seaside target range and surface warships fire 5-inch guns
at land targets on the island as Marines storm ashore nearby.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Clinton emerged from the meeting convinced that
combat training remains essential to ``safeguarding the readiness
of our armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added: ``The president understands the requirements
to prepare our forces to step out to protect America's national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will ``make every effort to find a balanced approach''
when he makes his decision, the White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had no public comment on the meeting. But he underscored
the need for combat training during remarks at Arlington National
Cemetery to commemorate Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   America's leaders bear a ``solemn obligation to preserve the
peace'' by preparing Americans to be ``the world's leading force
for peace and freedom,'' he said. ``It means we must keep the
commitment I have had since the moment I took the oath of office _
that our men and women in uniform will remain the best trained,
best equipped, best prepared in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The target range, including the live-fire impact area and an
adjacent 11,000-acre buffer zone to protect the island's 9,300
civilian residents, has been closed since April 19.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine pilot flying an FA-18C Hornet mistakenly targeted a
hilltop observation post and dropped two 500 pound bombs. The
attack killed David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, a Puerto Rican security
guard working for the Navy, and injured four other civilian
employees on the range.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials appealed to Clinton after emergency talks on
Nov. 1 failed to find a compromise. Rossello has refused to
negotiate any deal that includes resumption of the live-fire
training.
</P>
<P>
   The senior defense official said Thursday that Pentagon
officials do not expect to follow the White House meeting with a
formal recommendation to the president. Cohen left from the
Veterans Day ceremonies for a weeklong trip to Brazil, Argentina
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still must decide whether to order resumption of combat
training on Vieques. Puerto Rico's political leaders, First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, former Sen. Bill
Bradley and Hispanic lawmakers in Congress are urging him to close
the bombing range.

 &HT;    FEDERAL EDUCATION SPENDING TO RISE 6 PERCENT
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal spending on education will increase by 6
percent under a compromise confirmed Thursday by President Clinton
and key Republican leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the higher spending won't lead to startling changes in
priorities. While Clinton successfully defended virtually all
existing education programs against attacks by Republicans, he
failed to convince them to try some new approaches, such as
school-bond subsidies that could have led to the construction of
6,000 additional classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed early this year that the Education Department's
$33.5 billion budget be raised to $34.7 billion. Last week, he
vetoed a Republican bill that raised the total to $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The figure finally rose above $35.5 billion in closed-door
negotiations between representatives of the administration and
Congress this week.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to act next week on a bill that includes
the education funds, as well as funding for the Labor Department
and the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $500 million added during this week's private
negotiations between congressional leaders and Clinton's aides
fulfilled Clinton's top priority: continuing to concentrate federal
education aid on the poor. The extra money was earmarked for
Clinton's class-size reduction program, Title I anti-poverty aid to
schools, and subsidies for after-school programs for struggling
students whose parents don't earn enough to pay for tutors or
private day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress agreed to continue supporting our efforts to hire
100,000 new, highly qualified teachers (over seven years) to reduce
class size in the early grades,'' Clinton stressed Thursday in the
Oval Office. Joining him to praise the settlement were three
first-grade teachers, Education Secretary Richard Riley and
Clinton's chief negotiator in the class-size dispute, White House
aide Bruce Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' said Michelle Erickson, who teaches 15
first-graders at Barrett Elementary School in Alexandria, Va. ``The
kids we teach come from low-income families, and at that age, they
really need the kind of individual attention you can give in a
small class.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans obtained two concessions: All new teachers hired
under the program must be licensed, and any district can spend up
to 25 percent of its class-size money to retrain existing teachers,
rather than to hire new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, districts had to obtain a waiver from the Department
of Education in order to spend more than 15 percent of its
class-size money on retraining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that our principles of quality and flexibility are
the basis for the agreement,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,
chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee. Though he
wasn't at the Oval Office announcement, Goodling was praised by
Clinton for his role in finding a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators from the White House, Senate and House all
agreed to expand the scope of the class-size program, currently
targeted at grades one through three, so that it will cover
kindergarten as well.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans got nowhere with their suggestion of a
change in wording that would have shifted some funds from schools
in poor neighborhoods into schools in middle-class neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won more than the Republicans in the battle over how
much to spend on his class-size program, which received $1.2
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year Clinton asked for $1.4 billion, House Republicans
offered to eliminate the program and Senate Republicans suggested
$1.2 billion. They compromised on about $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough to keep us on track for 100,000 teachers six
years from now,'' Secretary Riley said.

A WITNESS TO HISTORY, FROM WAR'S GENERALS TO POVERTY'S VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Best known for his photograph of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur confidently treading water in the Philippines in 1945,
Carl Mydans has been a storyteller with a camera since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   At 92, Mydans has slowed down. Instead of traveling almost every
day from his home in Larchmont, N.Y., to his office at Time
magazine, where he is a contract photographer, he now does it about
twice a week. But he has never stopped taking photographs. Even
when he doesn't have a camera with him, he says, he is taking
photographs in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   During his long photographic career, Mydans has essentially
worked at two places. In 1935, he joined Dorothea Lange, Arthur
Rothstein and Walker Evans in documenting the stark effects of the
Great Depression for a government agency. In late 1936, Mydans
became a staff photographer at Henry Luce's publishing empire,
first at Life shortly after its inaugural issue, then at Time,
after Life ceased publication as a weekly in 1972, then again at
Life when it resumed publication as a monthly in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three of Mydans' images, mostly from the '30s through the
'50s and a number of which have never before published or
exhibited, are on display at the SoHo Triad Fine Arts gallery in
Manhattan. In many ways the quintessential Life photographer,
Mydans covered a wide range of subjects, from domestic poverty to
foreign wars, from natural disasters to elegiac street scenes, from
men and women at work to children facing a world not of their
making, from golden promises to dashed hopes. More often than not,
his pictures revealed a photojournalist with a sure eye for
composition and a restrained, slightly subversive, sense of
historical drama.
</P>
<P>
   Take that photograph of MacArthur making his triumphal landing
on a beach in the Philippines. Instead of stepping from his boat
onto a prepared pontoon walkway and then onto dry ground, the
media-savvy general clearly wanted a more heroic stage, Mydans has
suggested in notes about this picture.
</P>
<P>
   The only press photographer aboard the general's command ship,
Mydans was waiting on the pontoons when the boat MacArthur was in
was quickly reversed before it headed for the beach. Mydans raced
over to catch the general as he and his entourage stepped off the
boat's ramp into knee-deep water, framed on either side by hulking
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Joining MacArthur on his water walk are somber military men,
while the general, in his signature aviator sunglasses, appears
resolutely oblivious to the camera. Some of his men, hanging back
in the landing craft so their general can take center stage, seem
to be grinning knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Mydans' picture of the Japanese surrender on board the
battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945, is also
contradictory. This image attests to order, ceremony and civility _
everything that the war just ended was not. The men neatly
assembled to witness the surrender form an inverted ``V,'' with the
Japanese gathered in a small formation toward the apex. A member of
the Japanese military high command bends to sign the surrender
document. But behind him is a Japanese government official in
formal top hat and tails, his hands cockily placed on his hips.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers have variously shown the face of war, but one of
the most devastatingly universal is in this show. With her head
thrown back in grief, leveled buildings behind her, the subject of
``Woman Mourning in the Ruins Near Bengbu During the China Wars''
(1949) looks as though she could have lived anywhere in the world
in any century, forever raging against the cruelties of war.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in his photographs of people and places at peace,
Mydans seems happily entranced by the simply beautiful, like the
straw hats with broad brims lined up on a sidewalk in Lanzhou,
China, in 1941. This is an image of textural contrasts, the
malleable straw hats against an old wood wall against the hard
stone ground and the bricks in the wall behind the seated hat
seller with the furrowed brow.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Working Men in Hold of Grain Ship, New York'' (1940),
Mydans took something quite humdrum and turned it into a boldly
modernist study of shadows and light.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the title, ``Unloading Rice at Kobe, Japan''
(1949), the five men working in various stages of undress in the
picture could well have been choreographed dancers. Standing
knee-deep in rice resembling a sandy beach and with artfully placed
dark cloths in the background, the men bail cratefuls of the grain
into a big metal container, their movements cleanly balletic.
</P>
<P>
   And who would have thought that a picture taken in 1940 of a
modernized copper plate-lined kitchen in a 70-room manor in Sweden
could be so delightfully surreal? Here, in what some might describe
as a maniacally tidy kitchen, rows of copper plates and copper pots
and lids are lined up in graduated sizes as though they were
oversized precious stones. In keeping with her surroundings, a
woman in attendance wears a chef's hat and a white coat.
</P>
<P>
   Mydans extends his surrealistic eye to landscapes as well. In
``Yellow River Front, Gansu Province, China'' (1941) terraced
hillsides reaching far into the horizon are echoed in the layers of
clouds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The show's most haunting image, though, is not of war or peace
but of the Great Depression. Among Mydans' photographs of children
in this exhibition are two taken in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   One shows the young daughter of migrant workers near
Raymondville, Texas, blissfully unaware of the rags on her body and
smiling innocently at the camera. The other is a close-up of an
impoverished boy sitting on a bed in the oil boom town of Freer,
Texas. In this portrait, which has the compressed power of an old
master, the child has one hand on a bed railing whose paint has
mostly peeled away and wears on his face the bleak look of someone
many years older.

 &HT;    Knight's quest: End diabetes, for Mom's sake
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If Gladys Knight hadn't grown up on
grits, ``Midnight Train to Georgia'' would've been ``Midnight Plane
to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the song originally went,'' says the Atlanta
native, referring to the 1973 ballad she's best known for. ``And I
said uh-uh, I'm not satisfied. We were playing along the East Coast
and in the South then, and we rode the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the guys together (songwriter Jim Weatherly and the
Pips), and I said, `This just doesn't ring true. We're from
GEOR-gia, honey!'''
</P>
<P>
   So, in fact, am I. Gleeful to learn that I'm a fellow ``peach,''
Gladys squeezes my hands as if we go way back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Knight has ventured to Miami from Las Vegas, where she's
lived since the late '70s, to promote a statewide diabetes
blindness-prevention program for the Florida Optometric Association
Charities.
</P>
<P>
   November is American Diabetes Month, and Knight's mom,
Elizabeth, was blinded by the disease before she died in '97. The
singer also has established a diabetes research fund in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother didn't believe in idle minds or being still or
staying in bed all day. Even when I was an adult in the
entertainment business, working almost all night, she wouldn't
stand for me sleeping past 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, 55, has been in the entertainment business since she
belted out Nat King Cole's ``Too Young'' on Ted Mack's ``The
Original Amateur Hour'' and nabbed the $2,000 first prize. She was
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a big ol' trophy,'' she recalls with a wide smile. ``It
was bigger than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight's teeth, like her eyes, are sparkling. And there's a
definite radiance about her. Maybe it's the bright yellow
turtleneck under her black St. John Knits pantsuit. Or maybe it's
the 40-some pounds she's dropped. Or maybe, come to think of it,
it's the man she's dropped (third husband Les Brown, whom she
divorced in '97).
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully though, the answer is ... none of the above. The best
thing that's ever happened to her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a Mormon,'' she replies without pause. ``I'm happier
than I've ever been in my life because I've found the gospel and
the fullness of it. All along, it was right under my nose. I was
born to get to this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Maria Knight was one of four kids born to Merald Knight,
a postal worker, and his wife, Elizabeth, who held a slew of jobs,
including making pens at Scripto and nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a toddler, young Gladys sang with the Mount Mariah
Baptist Church choir. Then she and older brother Merald Jr.
(''Bubba''), sister Brenda, and cousins William and Elenor Guest
did a show for the family at Bubba's 10th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin James ``Pip'' Woods later suggested the kids go pro and
lent them his nickname. They did supper-club gigs during the week
and church on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of kin came and went, the Pips' membership
finally gelled in '60: Gladys, Bubba, William and cousin Edward
Patten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never planned to be the front man,'' Knight says. ``But in
1961, we got hoodwinked by a local promoter and ended up having the
same song, `Every Beat of My Heart,' on three record labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``One version was No. 2 on the charts, the other No. 3. To make
clear which was which, we had one version by The Pips, the other by
Gladys Knight and the Pips.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the quartet's success _ cemented when the group signed
with Motown in '66 _ Knight never yearned to be a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about it. I guess you'd say I wanted to be of
service, like when my mom was a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She taught me how to make a bed, and let me tell you, I can
make a bed with you in it!''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Gladys insists on tackling that task each morning.
No room service for her.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's first two marriages produced three kids: James, who
died in his sleep last summer at 36 (cause of death unknown);
Kenya, 35; and Shanga, 22.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kenya _ executive administrator of Knight's corporate
empire _ who led her mom to Mormonism two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling my daughter how frustrated I was. How I knew
about fire and brimstone and Abraham and Noah, but how I wanted
something more out of life. And she said, 'Oh mom, you've got to
talk to the missionaries. Of course there's more!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up one day, and I weighed 200 pounds. I'd just gotten
so out of whack. But when I came to this church, a lot of things
fell into place. I realized that this is my body temple. I wanted
to walk the walk that I talked.''
</P>
<P>
   For real.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a size 10 (``and going down''), walks an hour each
morning and follows with about 30 minutes of weight training. And
she's ditched breads and sweets with the occasional exception of
pound cake, her weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gladys Knight and the Pips disbanded in '89 to pursue
solo ventures (after 55 soul, pop and R&AMP;B tunes that hit the
charts), Knight didn't give up on her career.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she persevered alone _ with old faves such as ``I Heard
It Through the Grapevine,'' ``Imagination'' and ``If I Were Your
Woman'' _ and audiences still cheered. This fall, she released a
gospel album titled ``Many Different Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, by the way, is a huge fan and has asked Knight to
perform at Mar-a-Lago on New Year's Eve. She'll be there, brood in
tow, including 11 grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   On her right hand, Gladys sports a gold signet-style ring with
the letters CTR in diamonds. It's not overbearing, just noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands for Choose The Right,'' she explains. ``It's a
program and a philosophy about spiritual daily living. About doing
the right thing for you and your fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her right thing, she says, is raising diabetes
awareness. And that means another reporter in her hotel suite in
five minutes. But we talk for 15 more.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one of us wants to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself as some sort of diva,'' she says,
waving away the notion that she's a legend along with her pals
Patti LaBelle and Dionne Warwick
</P>
<P>
   ``After a certain age, I realized that my talent was a gift from
above. Something I was called to do that I love doing. You can't
get any more blessed than that.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like many of their human counterparts,
Ernie and Bert found clothes that they liked and stuck with them.
For decades. Problem is, it may not be the best look for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie has a wide face and a squat body. Why, then, does he
insist on wearing a horizontally striped shirt?
</P>
<P>
   Bert's a beanpole, yet clings to his skinny vertical stripes.
</P>
<P>
   (The reason for these questionable choices, according to David
Borgenicht's ``Sesame Street Unpaved'': Ernie's stripes lend him a
relaxed air, while Bert's stripes make him appear more uptight.)
</P>
<P>
   Guys, we think you always look ducky, but with a little
guidance, you could stop traffic on your famous thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the 30th anniversary of ``Sesame Street's'' first
broadcast, and, in celebration, we invited fashion-design majors at
the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale to give these lifelong buddies
long-overdue makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   Neghie Thervil makes Bert an offer he can't refuse: a dark,
single-breasted pinstripe suit. ``For the new year, Bert and Ernie
could use a little dressing up,'' the 19-year-old said. She chose
subdued fall colors for Ernie's ensemble, topping a mauve shirt
with a monogrammed sweater vest.
</P>
<P>
   AT THE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Who knew Bert and Ernie had such cute legs? Monica Tovar, 28,
put Ernie in surfer shorts and Bert in a guayabera shirt. ``I chose
this design because we are in Florida, where the inspiration is the
ocean,'' Tovar said. Check out Ernie's trendy footwear: Tevas!
Perfect for jumping in puddles with Rubber Duckie.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Bassetti, 43, abandoned the red, oranges and yellows that
Ernie and Bert have long worn for hues that provided a sharper
contrast with their yellow and orange skin. But both Muppets retain
the turtlenecks that they feel so comfortable in, topped by
overalls for Bert (with deep pockets for collecting his beloved
bottle caps!) and a cozy letter sweater for Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE STUDIO
</P>
<P>
   Newly fashion-conscious, Bert and Ernie don this fall's hottest
fabric _ denim. Bert's dark denim jeans include a side pocket for
cell phone, and Ernie's jeans end with a small cuff. Who else would
Sarah Snowden update? ``Considering that not many of the `Sesame
Street' characters sport clothing ... there really aren't too many
characters to make over. However, I would suggest new haircuts for
Maria and Bob!''
</P>
<P>
   CASUAL FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   Ernie and Bert retain their tried-and-true turtlenecks but top
them with vests for this modern, grown-up look by Marie Lafrance.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE WEEKEND
</P>
<P>
   An alphabet-print shirt on Ernie and an ABC tie on Bert will
help kids learn their letters, says Mayte Vidal.
</P>
<P>
   MUPPET MINUTIAE
</P>
<P>
   Want the inside scoop on ``Sesame Street'' and its cast of foam
characters? In ``Sesame Street Unpaved'' (Hyperion, $24.95), author
David Borgenicht recalls favorite songs, reprints beloved scripts
and uncovers the following facts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ernie's birthday is Jan. 28, and Bert's is July 26.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ernie and Bert share the basement apartment of 123 Sesame St.
Gordon, Susan and Miles live on the first floor, and Luis, Maria
and Gabriela live on the second floor. Oscar's trash can is right
out front.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muppet eyes are made from Wacky Stacks, a short-lived toy from
the 1970s that worked something like a Russian nesting doll _ a
ball inside a ball inside a ball. ``Sesame Street'' uses about 220
pairs of eyes and 180 foam-rubber noses per season.
</P>
<P>
   _ It takes two Muppeteers to operate Ernie. The ``voice'' of the
Muppet puts his right hand in Ernie's mouth and his left hand in
Ernie's left hand. The second Muppeteer uses his right hand to
manipulate Ernie's right arm. (Steve Whitmire has performed Ernie
since Jim Henson's death in 1991, and Frank Oz supplies the voice
of Bert.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sesame Street'' has been broadcast in more than 140
countries around the world. Some air the original American version,
while others create new shows in their own languages. Here's what
Ernie and Bert are called in other countries: Anees and Bader
(Kuwait), Epi and Blas (Spain), Arik and Bentz (Israel), Edi and
Budu (Turkey), and Yenik and Vlas (Russia).

 &HT;    Woman pilot reaches boundless heights
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This veteran's story is not set on a
battlefield, nor on foreign soil. Not a shot was fired. No one got
a medal. But it is a story of courage as certain and admirable as
any, and of service to a country in desperate need.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a woman who flew America's war planes.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 months during World War II, Teresa ``Jamesy'' James and
her comrades at the Women's Auxiliary Service Pilots ferried
fighter planes, trainers and bombers from factories to airfields to
ports across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The planes were shipped to Europe or the Pacific. The pilots
quickly found they had no place in a man's Army.
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy and her pals bivouacked in the corners of dank hangars,
behind oily tarps hung from beams. They flew in the worst weather
with no radios, often alone for days on end. They flew planes
they'd never seen before, and some they prayed no one would have to
fly again.
</P>
<P>
   The danger was real: Thirty-eight of the women died in crashes.
The Army gave them no flags or funerals. The survivors had to pass
the helmet until they'd chipped in enough to send the body home.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'd go back up in the air. They kept flying until male
pilots started to come home from Europe in late 1944. Then
suddenly, with planes still waiting for them on the field, the
WASPS were dismissed. They got the Army's thanks, but no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Although they'd worn Army uniforms, flown Army planes and taken
orders from Army officers, they were told they had no right to call
themselves veterans.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 30 years to set that right.
</P>
<P>
   AN AVIATION ARCHIVE AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   The old sea captain's house in Lake Worth that Jamesy's parents
bought in the 1950s is rock solid but a bit narrow, a bit too much
like a lighthouse _ or the cockpit of an old fighter plane that
never leaves the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel hemmed in when I'm sitting here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes don't help. They're filled with photos, books and news
clippings about fliers, particularly women. Particularly WASPS.
Jamesy has an aviation archive sprawled across the front porch and
winding its way out to the living room and into her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just dig in and see what's interesting,'' she offers, but none
of it is as interesting as the story Jamesy tells of a florist's
daughter from Pittsburgh who became a most unlikely pilot when she
was still a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the spirit of adventure that propelled her. It was her
first glimpse of a pilot named Bill who touched down one day in
1934 in a gleaming silver biplane in the grassy airfield where
Jamesy spent Sunday mornings with her brother and his pilot pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out stepped this handsome pilot _ Oh, God _ to die for!'' she
says. ``I was nuts about the guy, but he barely batted an eye at
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy was terrified of flying.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, she saw a plane go down in flames and she saw
the bodies pulled from the smoldering wreck. Then her brother
crashed and nearly died. ``I thought he was crazy to fly again
after that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she was crazy enough about Bill to accept his invitation to
a fly-in picnic. Her knees knocked every moment in the air.
</P>
<P>
   They kept knocking for weeks, through flight after flight, until
Bill flew off without her to take a temporary job in Chicago.
Jamesy thought she was safely aground, until Harry Fogle started
needling her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Why don't you learn how to fly and surprise Bill
when he comes back?' I thought about that and decided I'd give it a
try,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   JAMESY THE `GIRL STUNT PILOT'
</P>
<P>
   Once she was at the controls of Harry's brand-new OX5 Travelair,
Jamesy's knees stopped knocking. She not only learned to soar, she
learned to spin, loop and slip her way back to the ground. Harry
and some of the other boys were stunt pilots, making good money at
weekend air shows, and Teresa soon joined them.
</P>
<P>
   She dazzled the audience in her debut by spinning 12 1/2 times
as she dropped swiftly toward earth. She went home with $50 in
appearance money and a big grin. ``When I showed my mother how much
money I made, she said, 'Stay with it!''' Jamesy says. ``She really
encouraged me.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa James, ``Girl Stunt Pilot,'' and Harry Fogle, ``The
Flying Iceman,'' became a regular double feature at air shows
throughout the region. She perfected her routine until the spins
reached 26 1/2 _ spectacular no matter what the pilot's gender _ as
the plane plunged from 11,000 feet to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became well-known through the whole East Coast as The Crazy
One in the blue airplane and the white helmet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy forgot about Bill and went on to get her commercial
license, giving thrill rides to passengers and later flying a mail
route. She also became a flight instructor. The end of the
Depression, and the beginning of the war, brought a boom of student
pilots in the early 1940s. Many were aspiring Air Corps cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flying with them from sunup to sundown,'' Jamesy says.
She taught hundreds of men, and fell in love with one of them.
Jamesy married George ``Dink'' Martin in June 1942. By then, he was
in the Air Corps. Jamesy, never one to sit idly at home, got her
chance to help the war effort three months after the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The Army sent a telegram to every woman in the country who held
a commercial pilot's license _ a grand total of 80 _ inviting them
to join the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Service, the WASPS'
precursor. Jamesy was one of 25 women who jumped at the chance. She
took a train to Wilmington, Del., for flight testing. She doesn't
remember the fare, but she does remember that the Army wouldn't
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That base was a mudhole,'' she recalls. ``One runway. No
facilities at all for women. They moved some men out of the
bachelor officers' quarters to make room for us. It had plenty of
urinals, but only one stall.''
</P>
<P>
   PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy easily passed tests administered by men with far less air
time. She earned a spot at $250 a month, plus $6.50 a day for
expenses. A month later, she took off on the group's first
long-distance solo mission. She flew a PT-19, a single-seater used
to train combat pilots, from Maryland to California. ``I'd never
been past Chicago,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was given a map showing the location of Army airfields along
the way. She landed at a few; other times, she touched down
wherever she could, sometimes straining car gasoline through
cheesecloth when she couldn't find aviation fuel and praying that
it wouldn't clog the carburetor. The flight took five days. Some
that followed were even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew where we'd end up spending the night,'' she
says. ``You'd be so tired, but then you'd get thrown out of a
restaurant for wearing slacks. We slept in flea-bag hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Safely setting down anywhere was sometimes miraculous
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd fly planes that came right off the assembly line without
being flight tested,'' Jamesy says. ``But the worst were the ones
that were already war-weary.''
</P>
<P>
   Her most harrowing flight was from South Carolina to Maryland in
a battered A-25 attack bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I babied that thing,'' she says. ``Oh _ oh _ did I have
trouble with that airplane. I couldn't get the gear up. The
bomb-bay doors wouldn't close. Then the last 50 miles, fumes were
filling the cockpit. I had to fly with the hatch open.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy immediately reported that this plane was in no shape for
combat. The officer in charge wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was a class 26 airplane,'' she says. ``I didn't
know what that meant. He said its only use was to be dragged into a
field and used for target practice. I couldn't believe they'd do
that to me. That really just about did me in.''
</P>
<P>
   BAD NEWS FROM NORMANDY
</P>
<P>
   Despite such backhanded treatment, the women fliers did their
job so well that the Army wanted more of them. The commercial
license requirement was dropped and women with much less experience
were recruited until there were more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers rose, so did military politics and male
resentment. Sabotage was suspected in several fatal crashes _ sugar
was found in the fuel tanks _ but no one can say for sure because
the investigations were quickly dropped. Jamesy's archive traces a
nasty struggle for control of the WASPS that derailed any chance of
making them members of the Army Air Corps. (She calls the official,
sanitized history of the group ``a bunch of who shot Nellie.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dink, meanwhile, had become a flight instructor for B-17 bomber
crews, a job that ensured he'd remain stateside and safe from enemy
fire _ until he volunteered to join the Normandy invasion. He was
shot down early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the telegram June 22, 1944,'' Jamesy says. ``It said he
was missing. I was sure that somehow he survived.''
</P>
<P>
   She saw a grainy newspaper photo of American airmen captured by
the Germans. She was certain Dink was one of them. ``People asked
me many times over the years why I didn't get married again,'' she
says. ``I told them: `Dink's coming home.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1984 before she learned what really happened, when she
went to France for a reunion. She found people who remembered the
crash, and the dying pilot. In Joinville le Pont, George ``Dink''
Martin was a hero. ``A piece of his landing gear was still in the
mayor's office,'' she said through tears. ``The people gave a big
party for me, in his honor. It was so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy was still scrambling to find out everything she could
about Dink's last flight when the WASPS were disbanded. She took
the train back to Pittsburgh. ``I went back to my family's florist
shop and made the wedding bouquets again,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy's return was not quite that docile: The archive yields a
letter rejecting her application to join the Chinese Air Force in
the war against Japan. She finally got back up in the air after the
war as a private instructor. A few years later, her country decided
she was too valuable to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   JOINS AIR FORCE AS MAJOR
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Air Force became an independent service, Jamesy
was invited to join. She chose the reserves rather than active
duty, recalling the discomfort of living on base. She was awarded
the permanent rank of major, serving from 1950 until her retirement
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, President Carter signed a bill granting the WASPS
full recognition and veterans benefits. Jamesy had lent calls and
letters to the cause, but she's still angry about the years that
went by before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was retroactive,'' she says. ``Those 38 girls who were
killed got nothing. It's a disgrace to the United States that we
had to pay to get their bodies home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the original 25 women war pilots are still living. They
had a reunion last June in Birmingham, Ala. They did everything
you'd expect, ``a lot of yakking, a lot of crazy talk about this
and that.''
</P>
<P>
   And they flew airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy Batson just finished restoring a Super Cub, like the
ones we used to ferry,'' Jamesy says. ``She said, `Jamesy, let's
fly out to see my daughter in California.' I said no thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   Jamesy still flies locally every few weeks, at an age she'd
rather ignore than yak about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tell anyone how old I am,'' she says. ``If I do, they
won't want to fly with me anymore.''

</P>
<P>
   CAR-MONEY _ The catch phrase in the movie Jerry McGuire was,
``Show me the money.'' That must be the way Bill France Jr. and
Bruton Smith feel today after NASCAR's new TV deal. France and
Smith have long been two major forces in the sport, but their
slices of NASCAR's pie just got larger. The revenue split _ 65
percent to track owners, 25 percent to drivers, 10 percent to
NASCAR _ is expected to remain the same. So France, founder and
owner of International Speedway Corporation, and Smith, founder and
owner of Speedway Motorsports Inc. and Atlanta Motor Speedway, will
continue to have a stranglehold on the sport. They control 16 of
the 21 tracks where Winston Cup raced during the 1999 season. And
France, who has acquired three tracks since stepping down as NASCAR
CEO last year, has two new tracks under construction. We examine
the financial end of the deal and explain what it means. (Levine,

They agree on most issues, but there's one where they are miles
apart - the length of Holyfield's career. Thomas would like
Holyfield to retire within the next year while the 37-year-old
Holyfield wants to keep fighting as long as he feels fit.
Retirement is inevitable for Holyfield, but how long will he
continue to fight before officially calling it quits? (Bunn,

   FBC-UGA-BELL _ ATHENS, Ga. _ Kendrell Bell is the unlikeliest of
defensive stars for the Bulldogs. He was not recruited by Georgia
while playing fullback at Laney High School in Augusta and was
brought to the Bulldogs' attention only after two phenomenal
seasons as a linebacker at Middle Georgia College. Georgia had not
planned to sign a linebacker _ it has a glut of players at the
position _ but did so after seeing Bell's feats on videotape. As a
result of injuries and attrition, Bell was thrust into a starting
role and has become Georgia's big-play player on defense. Entering
Saturday's game against Auburn, he has 42 tackles, 4 sacks, 3
interceptions, 10 QB pressures, 3 caused fumbles and 3 blocked
kicks. Not surprisingly, Georgia's coaches are gushing about him.

A POOCH FOR OUR TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a wow, complete with the bow.
</P>
<P>
   In a prosperous, consumer-based society that has embraced pet
rocks, Furbies and Teletubbies, it was probably inevitable that a
mechanized metal barking pooch would come along to capture our
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Called AIBOs, or artificial intelligence robots, the
computerized dogs were first released by Sony on the Internet in
June. They sold out in 20 minutes in Japan and four days in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The company made second-generation robotic puppies available
last week on its Web site for $2,500 apiece and immediately drew
more than 130,000 orders in Japan. Figures for orders from the
United States are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge from the initial excitement, the response will be
huge here, too. Sony, which had created only limited numbers of its
doggie brain child, is so stunned it is considering expanding
production since the current worldwide supply is exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   In America, we are hooked on real pets. They are our children,
our best friends, our cuddly companions.
</P>
<P>
   We spoil our dogs and cats with special food and shower them
with expensive accessories. Even fish and gerbils get designer
living quarters, with hand-blown glass bowls and hand-turned
exercise wheels. For Christmas, Neiman Marcus is advertising a
metal four-poster dog bed with a bone-shaped pillow for a mere
$950. There's also a faux pearl necklace for cats for $85, sterling
silver necklaces for dogs at $185 and dog paw pomade for $15.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan last week, two charity benefits featured dog models
showing off canine couture, from bejeweled doggy sweaters to fancy
rain gear. These objects are not cheap, and there are dog spas, dog
gyms, doggy day care and doggy Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cats also get special beds, bowls, toys, litter pans and even a
scrapbook for photographs and fur samples to remember Fluffy by.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 U.S. News &AMP; World Report survey, Americans
owned 68 million cats and 56 million dogs, 16 percent of them in
the same households.
</P>
<P>
   So why would we want a robotic imitation when we can have the
live article, wagging its tail and licking us or purring like crazy
in our laps? To say nothing of the economics of having one arrive
free from the local animal shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow hugging a cold metal object, even one that can blink its
eyes and walk, doesn't rate very high on the affection meter. And
it can't hunt, scare off burglars or snuggle up in bed on a cold
night.
</P>
<P>
   But the silly robot is really kind of cute. If I ever get my
hands on one, Charlie, my adorable but rebellious bichon, may be in
trouble the next time he goes after that harmless poodle next door.
</P>
<P>
   The robot doesn't need walking and won't poop on the rug, get
fleas, need veterinarian care or dig its claws into you in what is
supposed to be friendly play.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't shed. No food is required. It provides lots more
action to watch than that of a fish, a pet rock or a Furbie.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a technological wonder, even if it does keep bumping
into walls. It's the wave of the future, an intelligent, programmed
computer of the sort that makes us humans wonder how long we can
pretend to control them instead of the reverse. This faux dog has
more bells and whistles per inch than a space satellite.
</P>
<P>
   By pressing the right buttons, AIBO can be made to bark, play
with a ball, trot along beside its owner, sit down, blink its eyes
and look alert to human commands without obeying them. Actually,
that's mostly what Charlie does too.
</P>
<P>
   The robot even begs (oh, give dog-owners a break) and wags its
tail.
</P>
<P>
   The doggy runs on lithium-ion batteries and contains a small
color camera, heat- and touch-sensors, an infrared range finder, a
stereo microphone, eight megabytes of memory and a microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has cleverly sold the robot as a sort of Cabbage Patch
doll, with a madeup family background and imaginary human traits.
If we can be made to feel warm and fuzzy about some object, we will
do foolish things.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Science magazine made the ABIO a grand prize winner in
its November ``Best of What's New'' issue, citing it as not only
cute and lovable but a robotic servant that will fetch the phone
for you when it rings.
</P>
<P>
   The basic question, of course, is whether you want to pay $2,500
for a virtual pet experience or answer the phone yourself. With or
without an arf.

United Nations. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-BASKETBALL (Washington) _ For one of the most
recognizable sports stars of his generation, basketball was a
subject of great ambivalence to Bill Bradley. When he left the game
to enter politics he paid it no further attention. Now, in his
presidential race, basketball is the very first way many people
connect with him. ``It's his base and it's a huge asset,'' said his
friend Carl Wagner. ``They know him from the game, and in the game
he was highly respected.'' By Melinda Henneberger and Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-ECON (Jena, Germany) _ There is much economic despair in
the former East Germany, but something else has happened: Parts of
the east have become magnets for entrepreneuers and high-technology
start-up companies. In Jena, a small city that is unreachable by
train or plane, the renaissance is striking. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   RECOVERED-REMBRANDT (New York) _ A Rembrandt painting stolen
from a San Francisco museum is left at an Upper East Side gallery,
apparently by someone who dropped it off when the gallery was
offering free appraisals of artwork. The painting, called
``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' was stolen during the late 1970s by
burglars who lowered themselves down through a skylight. Federal
officials were trying to determine the authenticity of the work,
which was returned with two other stolen works by lesser-known
artists. By John Kifner.

is a rising tide of anti-biotech ``hysteria.'' By David Barboza.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN MOVIE,' featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed
by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny,
not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker
who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Smith
so affectingly reveals, Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the
balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything
indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill
struggle and finds Borchardt often describing success and
prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile, his own life is eloquently
presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American
Dream (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,' starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener,
Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to
the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a
stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a
technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder
workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.'' Cusack plays a
discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Malkovich's
mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill
after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on
and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BACHELOR,' starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Gary Sinyor (PG-13, 90 minutes). This crude, frantic
yuppie farce stars O'Donnell as a selfish, marriage-shy bachelor
who botches his proposal to his sweetheart (Ms. Zellweger) days
before his grandfather dies, leaving him $100 million on condition
he marry before his 30th birthday. That gives him 27 hours either
to win back his true love or find another wife. After running
through his ex-girlfriends, he finds himself besieged by a horde of
prospective brides chasing him through the streets of San
Francisco. Based on a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, the movie lands a
few satiric thrusts at the money-mad workaholic '90s (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE BONE COLLECTOR,' starring Denzel Washington and Angelina
Jolie. Directed by Phillip Noyce (R, 118 minutes). One of the
year's most gruesome movies, the ingenious but preposterous
whodunit stars Washington as a quadriplegic forensic detective
tracking down a serial killer who plays cat and mouse with him by
leaving elaborate clues at the crime scenes. Ms. Jolie is the
police officer (and former model) whom he instructs by cell phone
on how to gather evidence. Crammed with the usual manipulative
jolts, this urban creepshow at least succeeds in sustaining an
atmosphere of menace, and Washington's and Ms. Jolie's star
chemistry smolders without the two exchanging so much as a kiss
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,' starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia
Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly.
Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile
film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop
garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently
hellish ambience for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But
Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his ``Taxi Driver'' days,
and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more
contemplative than it looks. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance
as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a
major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is
1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL,' starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs and
Peter Gallagher. Directed by William Malone (R, 115 minutes). If
the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is
truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do no
better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to the
nearest theater showing this film and strike fearlessly until its
feeble pulse beats no more. This is a sorry reincarnation of the
1950s William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire,
played by Vincent Price, offered five strangers $10,000 each to
spend the night in a spooky old mansion. In the new version, the
ante for survival has been raised to $1 million apiece. Even
allowing for inflation in the 40 years since the original opened,
the reward in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, according to the
Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. But some things have not
become devalued over the years _ words like junk, for example.
``Hill'' was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959. And it is
still junk (Lawrence Van Gelder).

</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER,' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher
Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mann directs
this taut thriller, about the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand, with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates
why, in the corporate climate of the '90s, truth-telling is a
riskier business than it was circa ``All the President's Men.''
While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for
``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LIMEY,' starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the
quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome
throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Stamp, in a
stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early
career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his
daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Fonda's slick Hollywood
hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Soderbergh
resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's ``Point
Blank'' as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from
every conceivable perspective (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `MUSIC OF THE HEART,' starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela
Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110
minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down
Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story
of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single
mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt,
no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth
performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational
enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her
proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other
violin stars. Not a bad reason for Craven to have sidelined the
claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PRINCESS MONONOKE,' with the voices of Billy Crudup, Claire
Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao
Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes). A landmark feat of Japanese
animation from the acknowledged master of the genre. This
complicated, exotically beautiful epic features gods and demons
locked in battle for the future of the forest, and its visions are
breathtakingly rendered. But it is the film's stirring use of
nature, myth and Japanese history that makes it so special. Worth
seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day
and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The
image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is
ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels
and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is
gratifyingly understated (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STORY OF US,' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Rob Reiner (R, 90 minutes). The first unofficial Jack
Lemmon comedy for the baby boom generation. As an ode to the ups
and downs of middle-aged marriage, this arthritic suburban story is
enough to make single people want to file for divorce. Willis makes
iffy casting in the role of a sensitive father and husband, while
Ms. Pfeiffer is not well served by a role that makes her scream so
hard that her neck turns red. Together, with the help of noisy
friends and acquaintances, these two run through the long history
of a marriage with the help of a criminal set of wigs and
hairpieces. Small talk turns to matters like home repair jobs and
prostate trouble (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY,' starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy
Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least
likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Lynch
rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound
like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a
riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking,
deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall.
And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).

   `THREE KINGS,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
The prodigiously talented writer-director of ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster'' has made a much more
ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf
war film has a ``Catch-22'' absurdist edge, but it also has an
oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera
tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American
soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured
gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in
Iraq. There are many clever touches, but there's something tamely
conventional at the film's core (Maslin).

   MARGARET MEAD FILM AND VIDEO FESTIVAL. Religious movements,
persecution of ethnic minorities, cinema verite and body marks are
the four principal themes that will be explored in more than 60
films in the 23rd annual Margaret Mead festival, beginning Friday
at the American Museum of Natural History. The opening attraction,
presented at 7 p.m. in the museum's main auditorium, is ``A Married
Couple,'' Allan King's 1969 cinema-verite examination of the
complexity and fragility of modern marriage. In connection with
``Body Art: Marks of Identity,'' a coming museum exhibition, five
festival programs will investigate how people and communities use
the human body as an expression of aesthetic, political and social
practices. Admission to the festival, through Nov. 20 at the
museum, Central Park West at 79th Street, is $8 a program: $28 for
4 programs or $65 for 10; for museum members, students and people
62 or older, the price is $7; $24 for 4 programs or $55 for 10.
Admission to opening- night screening and reception: $35.
Information: (212) 769-5305; tickets, (212) 769-5200 (Van Gelder).

 &HT;    GOP manipulating minimum wage
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    By Joe Geshwiler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Question: When is a minimum wage increase not exactly
a minimum wage increase?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: When Republicans in Congress manipulate this worthy
cause as a cover for excessive tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   That's no exaggeration. Just the amount of paper the Senate
Republicans devoted to low-wage vs. high-income benefits in their
so-called minimum-wage measure passed earlier this week ought to be
a tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   Two pages of the 114-page measure dealt with a dollar wage hike
to $6.15 an hour phased in over three years; the other 112 pages
gave away the store _ tax subsidies that would add up to $75
billion over the next decade. One problem with the $75 billion
reduction in revenue is that it will require to-the-bone-and-beyond
spending cuts for domestic programs that are already mandated to be
whacked over the next decade by 10 percent, allowing for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   An even more objectionable feature of the GOP measure is the
gross imbalance of its tax breaks. Citizens for Tax Justice found
that Americans with incomes in the top 1 percent would get 20
percent of the proposal's benefits, averaging about $1,600 a year,
more than a hundred times what taxpayers in the bottom 20 percent
would gain in tax relief. Even Marie Antoinette might blush at
inequity on that grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate GOP's minimum-wage scam was approved as an amendment
to a personal bankruptcy reform bill, the object of which is to
make it harder for borrowers to evade paying off their debts. That
initiative may have some merit, but there's no need to rush it into
law. The rate of personal bankruptcies has tapered off over the
last couple of years, and Congress would be wise to delve more
deeply into the causes and the extent of bankruptcy filings before
toughening federal rules governing them.
</P>
<P>
   With congressional leaders eager to adjourn, it doesn't appear
likely the Senate can act on the wage-tax-bankruptcy package and
resolve it with the House version in time to put it on President
Clinton's desk this year. If everything falls into place, however,
he needs to veto this measure and urge Congress to strike a fairer
wage-tax cut balance next year.

TEACHING HOSPITALS RECEIVE MORE THAN $1 BILLION UNDER PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators and the Clinton
administration have agreed to give back more than a billion dollars
to teaching hospitals that the institutions lost when Congress
balanced the federal budget in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, expected to be approved by Congress next week,
was part of an agreement to restore $12 billion over five years in
Medicare payments to health care providers who have lobbied
furiously on Capitol Hill in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important step in the right direction,'' said Robert
Dickler, a vice president at the Association of American Medical
Colleges, which represents 400 of the largest teaching hospitals.
``We're appreciative of the recognition (by Congress that the
payments) are a very important source of support for teaching
hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickler estimated that teaching hospitals would have lost $1.3
billion if Congress and the Clinton administration had failed to
reach an agreement this year. While not canceling out that loss
altogether, the agreement's dollar restoration is ``a significant
amount,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the agreement contained worrisome news for about
100 teaching hospitals _ many of them in New York _ that will lose
money under a plan to more evenly distribute the money that
Medicare gives to help train medical residents. About 300 other
teaching hospitals would come out ahead under the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1984 law that doled out so-called ``direct medical
education payments'' for training residents, many of the older East
Coast teaching hospitals fared better than other institutions in
the Sunbelt and on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Congress reimbursed teaching hospitals for their
uncovered costs of training residents. If a teaching hospital was
located in a community with well-insured patients, or was part of a
medical school, or was backed by a state legislature that helped
defray the cost of the residents, Medicare paid the hospital less.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in some older well-established New York teaching
hospitals, for example, getting as much as four times as much
Medicare reimbursement for each resident as newer teaching
hospitals elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the chairman of the health
subcommittee of the Ways and Means panel, has argued that these
disparities were unfair. They ranged from $223,000 to $20,000 per
resident, depending on the teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas succeeded in pushing through a provision in a Medicare
give-back bill the House passed last week that would have slowly
evened out the payments so that they came close to a national
average of $65,000 per resident.
</P>
<P>
   But as House and Senator negotiators tried to hammer out a
compromise Medicare give-back bill, Thomas' plan created fireworks
in backroom negotiations as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and Rep. Charles
B. Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means
panel, tried to protect New York hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers begrudgingly accepted the deal late Wednesday
after Thomas agreed to soften his approach so that no teaching
hospital would get more than $110,000 per resident or less than
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel complained Thursday that the reductions in Medicare
payments for training doctors ``will hurt rather than help many of
our finest hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Medicare bill is supposed to correct the excessive cuts
Congress made in 1997 and help every hospital,'' Rangel said.
``Sen. Moynihan and I argued forcefully that our teaching hospitals
contribute far more to society than they get back in this deal. We
did not want short-sighted stinginess to hurt the future quality of
health care in New York and across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles B. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday said the proposed
Medicare agreement ``does quite well'' for New York's nursing homes
as well as rural and suburban hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schumer added, ``It's major shortcoming is that it does
not solve the long-term financial problems that our great teaching
hospitals face across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also would give teaching hospitals the big-ticket
item their lobbyists fought hardest for: It would pump in about $1
billion to slow scheduled cuts over five years in ``Indirect
Medical Education,'' according to congressional aides.
</P>
<P>
   Known by the acronym IME, the money goes to compensate teaching
hospitals for treating a higher portion of acutely ill patients, as
well as the additional physician manpower to train residents in
caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Medicare cuts slashed $5.6 billion from Indirect
Medical Education.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Nickels, a vice president at the 5,000-member American
Hospital Association, estimated the agreement would channel $600-
to $700 million back to teaching hospitals, somewhat less than
congressional staff estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nickels praised the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we get two years of decent relief,'' he said, noting
the agreement slows the IME reductions in the 2000 and 2001 budget
years only. ``We can live to address it another day.''
</P>
<P>
   With a one-year freeze on scheduled cuts in reimbursement rates,
the agreement also would restore about $100 million in
``Disproportionate Share'' payments, money for teaching hospitals
that serve a large share of the poorest patients. The 1997 act had
called for $400 million in cuts.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, nursing homes did moderately well, gaining
about $1.5 billion in an across-the-board pay increase and a
short-term increase in fees to pay for their sickest and most
expensive patients.
</P>
<P>
   Home health care agencies, also have little to complain about
with about $2 billion in the previous Medicare cuts restored.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care providers that serve Medicare patients got about
$1.5 billion. That money will more gradually ease in a new payment
formula that is expected to cost them money.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitative therapists benefit from a provision that would
for two years lift caps that have limited physical, speech and
occupational therapy and caused hardships for elderly and disabled
patients who have needed more than the $3,000 annual therapy
limits.

<P>
   Teaching hospitals serve as a training ground for the nation's
young physicians, conduct critical medical research, and are often
the last hope for the most gravely ill patients who benefit from
their academic focus and state-of-the-art technology.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals also care for a disproportionate share of
indigent patients and host most of the nation's pediatric intensive
care and burn units.
</P>
<P>
   All this drives up the cost of care at teaching hospitals, a
fact recognized by the federal government which has subsidized them
through Medicare funding streams.
</P>
<P>
   However, when Congress slashed Medicare by $112 billion in 1997
to balance the federal budget, teaching hospitals lost a key part
of their financial life support. They were already weakened by
managed care plans, which drove down payment rates and steered
patients away from to avoid their higher costs.

SIDES GETTING CLOSER TO BUDGET DEAL, CLINTON SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Praising a bipartisan agreement on education
policy, President Clinton predicted Thursday that the White House
and Congress will soon wrap up negotiations on outstanding budget
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotional issue of abortion remains a stumbling block,
holding up an agreement on paying back dues to the United Nations,
which is necessary to closing any budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said negotiators are ``making progress on other vital
budget priorities,'' such as funding for hiring more police
officers, more environmental protection and the payment of U.N.
dues.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Clinton and Congress reached an accord on
education policy that gives the president the bulk of his plan.
``This is a victory for America's children,'' Clinton said,
surrounded in the Oval Office by educators.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans agreed to continue Clinton's program of hiring
100,000 new classroom teachers by 2005 and providing $1.3 billion
for fiscal year 2000. Both sides are still quibbling about how to
pay for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority abandoned its attempt to eliminate such
federal programs and turn the money over to the states for local
officials to use as they choose. The compromise calls for allowing
states to spend up to 25 percent of the $1.3 billion on additional
training or testing teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the flexibility to look at any of the needs identified
in the schools by the local administrators working with their
governors I think is an enormous victory,'' said House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department estimated that school districts last
year hired more than 29,000 new teachers and reduced the class size
for 1.7 million children to 18 from 23 students per class.
</P>
<P>
   Overall negotiations on how to fill a $6 billion gap continued
despite the fact that most members of Congress left town for
Veterans Day. Clinton leaves Sunday for a 10-day trip to Europe,
but he will likely be in contact by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said the issues of United Nations dues and debt
forgiveness to Third World nations remain difficult. ``Quite
frankly, they're both bogged down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will lose its right to vote in the U.N.
General Assembly in January unless it makes good on arrears of more
than $1 billion. Armey criticized Clinton for refusing to allow a
provision blocking U.S. funds to international organizations that
support abortion rights in other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the president to veto United Nations arrears over a
relatively small matter like whether or not you should use American
tax dollars to lobby other nations on their abortion laws, we
thought was a rather extreme position for the White House to
take,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey noted the anti-abortion forces have won every related vote
on the House floor when it comes to abortion and international
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said there was hesitancy on debt forgiveness because of
its complexity. The International Monetary Fund wants to use a
portion of the value of its gold reserves to offset the debt of
poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   He called the United Nations and IMF problems ``issues of the
heart'' that transcend funding or policy debates.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, were
threatening to tie up any final budget agreement if an amendment
allowing coal and hard-rock mining companies to dump wastes into
nearby streams and valleys is not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The administration opposes such an amendment because they say it
would violate a recent West Virginia court ruling outlawing coal
waste dumping.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader also dismissed in advance any criticism that
may come from conservatives about the House Republicans' acceding
to many of Clinton's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most powerful office in the world. The president
of the United States has priorities. No legislative body can ignore
that,'' Armey said.

MCCAIN WOOS VETERANS ON THEIR SPECIAL DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TILTON, N.H. _ John McCain came Thursday to the New Hampshire
Veterans' home here, seeking foot soldiers for his campaign among
the old men in wheelchairs, leaning on canes, or straining to hear
the speech McCain said he wondered if he should give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how appropriate this is on this Veterans Day,''
McCain began, suggesting it was a day too solemn for a political
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, a Vietnam veteran and presidential
candidate, said he came to say thanks to the men who served their
country. At his side was Connie Stevens, the entertainer who was a
favorite when she visited troops in Korea and Vietnam, and several
``comrades'' who were prisoners of war in Hanoi along with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse wheeled Carl Jordan, an infantry soldier in World War
II, to McCain and told the candidate that Jordan was captured by
Germans in 1944 but escaped after 11 days, making his way with the
help of the French resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you do for food?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan told McCain that he borrowed money from the Swiss Red
Cross to buy food from the Italians. After the war, he said, the
Red Cross sent him a bill, seeking repayment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you didn't pay it!'' McCain laughed.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for the Republican presidential nomination, McCain
is spending much of his time appealing to veterans here for
support. With 139,000 former military people in New Hampshire, one
of the top states for veterans per capita after South Carolina, he
hopes their backing will help him win the first-in-the-nation
primary and topple the frontrunner, Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of New Hampshire voters released Thursday showed McCain
for the first time tied with Bush in the primary race. Bush had 38
percent, compared with 35 percent for McCain, a difference within
the poll's 4 percentage point margin of error. The New Hampshire
Poll showed men were more likely to favor McCain, while women
favored Bush. The poll also showed McCain with the highest
favorability rating _ 67 percent _ among Republicans. Bush's
favorability rating dropped to 56 percent from 71 percent in
October. The telephone poll of 600 likely Republican primary voters
was conducted Nov. 4 through Nov. 9 by the American Research Group
Inc. of Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, McCain ate scrambled eggs at the Veterans of Foreign
Wars post in Laconia, among men who served in the Army, Navy, and
Marines. Some wore their faded green fatigues; others displayed
medals, ribbons, and navy blue veterans caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on one last mission with me and these old guys, and the
young guys,'' he implored the crowd of more than 200 men and women
jammed into the long, pine-paneled hall. ``Let's go on another
mission and we can do that as foot soldiers in this campaign and we
can win.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also spoke to some specific concerns of veterans and
those now in the service.
</P>
<P>
   He condemned the lack of quality health care and long-term care
benefits for veterans and called it an ``outrage'' that some
veterans need to travel to Boston for VA care.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to restore morale, pay, and benefits for military
men and women before buying any new equipment for the armed forces.
And he decried the fact that there are 12,000 military families so
pinched for funds that they rely on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just deplorable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's message seemed to resonate with the veterans here, many
of whom were sporting his stickers, and some of whom were clutching
his book, ``Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cut him, it would be red, white, and blue,'' said
William Champagne of Franklin, a staff sergeant in Vietnam who now
serves as the VFW's state commander.
</P>
<P>
   Added Kenneth Warner, a retired electrician from Moultonboro and
a Marine in Korea: ``I like the way the man talks.''

AS EXPECTED, WILLIAMS GETS AL MANAGER HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He thanked everyone, of course, including the
ticket-takers, the secretaries, groundskeepers, the coaches and
trainers, and clubhouse kids. The catch in his throat was audible
when he mentioned his wife, Peggy _ ``a pretty special lady'' _ and
he predictably deflected the credit to his players. ``Even though
they're not here,'' he said, ``those 50 guys, they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   And, naturally, on the day Jimy Williams was named American
League Manager of the Year, exactly one week shy of the three-year
anniversary of his hiring by the Red Sox _ there was a bit of
Jimywocky.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was what it will take for the Red Sox to improve on
this year's 94-win performance and a trip to the American League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've been home working on sprinkler heads and pulling
weeds,'' said Williams, who made a quick trip to Boston Thursday
from his home in Florida for the announcement of the manager's
award. ``I've been looking for the right tea leaves, and I haven't
found them yet . . . We're going to do our best, I know that. We'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams received 20 first-place votes among the 28 ballots cast
by members of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America, two voters
from each AL city, then joked about sending a check to all the
writers who voted for him. He finished with 115 points on a 5-3-1
(5 for first, 3 for second, 1 for third) points system, well ahead
of Oakland's Art Howe, who finished with five first-place votes and
85 points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having no first-place votes, Joe Torre of the Yankees
was third, with 21 points. Texas's Johnny Oates, who had one
first-place vote, and Cleveland's Mike Hargrove, who had two,
finished fourth and fifth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine AL managers previously honored this decade, five are
no longer with the team they were managing when they won the award.
Jeff Torborg, who won in 1990 with the White Sox, is a broadcaster.
Tony La Russa, the '92 winner with the A's, is with the Cardinals.
Gene Lamont, who won in '93 with the White Sox, is with the
Pirates. Buck Showalter, who won in '94 with the Yankees, is now
with the Diamondbacks. Davey Johnson, who was fired by the Orioles
on the day he won the award in '97, is now with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 56, is under contract with the Sox for next season,
but Thursday once again expressed little concern about landing an
extension from the club. In each of the last two years, Sox general
manager Dan Duquette has waited until the end of spring training
before announcing Williams had been given another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Williams said. ``I'm happy with my situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was fired as manager in Toronto 10 years ago. He was in
a philosophic mood talking about the changes he's gone through
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably see life a lot different now than when I was with
Toronto,'' Williams said. ``We're here today for this award, but
there are a lot of things right outside this building that maybe
should take precedence, maybe in your own families, that are a lot
more important than winning a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams found time to put in a good word about Mo Vaughn, whose
departure last winter was supposed to have made his job so much
more difficult this season. He wouldn't hear of disparaging today's
generation of players, often derided as selfish and
nonteam-oriented. ``Money doesn't play,'' he said. ``The players
play. I don't talk at them or to them, I talk with them. You can
make a lot of money and still have feelings. You'd be surprised how
fragile some of these people are. Us, too. We all have our
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to go through adversity to get better, if
in fact getting fired is going through adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who has spent his lifetime in the game paid his respects
to that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great game, isn't it?'' said Williams, who probably would
have liked nothing better than to stuff a half-dozen baseballs in
the back pocket of his gray suitpants, the way he does in his
uniform. ``Wow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I chose baseball or it chose me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton honored the last World War II
veteran serving on active duty at Veterans Day ceremonies Thursday,
but Capt. Earl Fox did not feel like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel a sense of humility because so many of my
friends, my classmates and shipmates did not come home,'' said Fox,
an 80-year-old Coast Guard doctor who served on Navy torpedo boats
and submarines in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the president was really recognizing Earl Fox,''
he said. ``I represent all the people of World War II who weren't
able to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   More Americans served in World War II than in any other war. But
of the 16,535,000 participants, only Fox remains on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   His pace has slowed significantly since 1943, when a Japanese
aircraft strafed his patrol boat and he earned a Silver Star for
rescuing a colleague. But Fox, a fourth-generation military
officer, said he still feels the same pride he did back then when
he puts on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He was attending the Naval Academy on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japan
bombed Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war. Months
later, Fox, a native of Petersburg, Va., was assigned to a squadron
of torpedo boats in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   After five years as a Navy officer, he left the service and
entered medical school. He became a general practitioner in St.
Petersburg, Fla., and thought he had hung up his uniform for good.
But in 1974, the Coast Guard encouraged him, at the age of 55, to
re-enlist as a flight surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The age limit for Coast Guard doctors was 44, but officials
waived it because of a shortage. Fox's service with the Coast Guard
has involved far more than giving physicals. He learned to fly
helicopters and airplanes, and at an age when many are
contemplating retirement he was being lowered from rescue
helicopters to treat injured mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He truly dedicated his life to serving his country,'' said
Adm. James Loy, commandant of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I'm able to be here,'' Fox prefers to say.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, after 30 years of military service, Fox will retire
from the U.S. Public Health Service, where he is a senior medical
officer at the Coast Guard's Military Personnel Command in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has earned his retirement,'' Clinton said at
Veterans Day commemorations at Arlington National Cemetery. ``But,
captain, on behalf of a grateful nation, we say thank you for your
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the oldest person on active duty with any of the uniformed
services, stood ramrod straight in the VIP section. His mind, he
said, was on all those buried around him. He was pleased when the
applause ended and the president moved on in his speech to focus on
fallen veterans and America's leadership in the world, and not Earl
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than two months we'll be able to say the conflict and
bloodshed that took so many American lives came from another
century,'' Clinton said. ``So we gather today for the last time in
this century to dedicate ourselves to being good stewards of the
sacrifice of the veterans of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced that the remains of three soldiers
missing from the Korean War had been recovered and were on their
way back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming home tonight,'' Clinton said. ``But we must not
waver in our common efforts to make the fullest possible accounting
of all our MIAs, for all their families to have their questions
answered.''

FOR MRS. CLINTON, IT WAS A TIME TO SMILE, LISTEN

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ If Hillary Clinton wanted another ``listening
tour,'' she sure got it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, a potential US Senate candidate from New York,
found she was unable to tiptoe through the minefield of Mideast
politics without a few blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, she stayed mute in her chair, flashing the tight
smile she employed through the embarrassment, controvery and
scandal that has marked so much of her time as First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   When one Palestinian public official after another stood up and
made references to the ``Palestinian state'' with ``Jerusalem as
its capital,'' Mrs. Clinton stayed mum.
</P>
<P>
   In Palestinian-controlled Ramallah, Mrs. Clinton listened
passively as Palestinan President Yasser Arafat's wife, Suha,
accused Israel of dumping toxic waste that she claimed contaminates
80 percent of West Bank water aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mrs. Clinton had an impossible act. In the Holy Land,
Hillary the candidate must convince New York's large Jewish
population that she is loyal to Israel. Yet, at the same time,
Hillary the First Lady must uphold America's image of itself as an
even-handed broker in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Arafat's outburst, she alleged that Israel has used
``toxic gas'' or ``tear gas,'' depending on the translation, which
has caused long-term health problems for Palestinian women and
children. The Israelis were quick to condemn the remark about
``gas'' as offensive to the sensibilities of the nation with the
world's largest population of Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton quietly sat in her chair through it all.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady is in a bit of a tough spot on her visit to
Israel in large part because of an earlier statement regarding
Palestinian statehood. Last year, she raised eyebrows in the US
Jewish community by saying Palestinians should eventually have a
``functioning modern state,'' a view that many Israelis and Jewish
Americans disagree with.
</P>
<P>
   That statement came before she was considering the run for the
Senate in New York. Although she has still not announced her
candidacy, she is considered likely to take on New York's
Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the two-day trip to Israel and Jordan
was paid for by the White House and the State Department and was an
official visit of the First Lady planned more than six months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Since making her Palestinian statehood comment last year, she
has carefully toed the US policy line that Palestinian statehood
should be resolved as part of the ``final status'' negotiations set
to take place over the next 100 days between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But the pending ``final status'' talks hasn't stopped her from
issuing an opinion on the future of Jerusalem, which Israelis and
Palestinians say should be the capital of their future state and
which is probably the most emotional of issues at the final talks.
In July, Mrs. Clinton chose words in a letter to a New York-based
Orthodox Jewish group that echoed Israel's passionate insistence
that Jerusalem is the ``eternal and indivisible'' capital of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But on this trip, from the point of view of Rabbi David Clayman,
Jerusalem representative of the American Jewish Congress, Mrs.
Clinton succeeded in ``pushing all the right buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She stayed away from controversial issues, she talked
eloquently about her love of Israel, and spoke glowingly of (slain
former Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin and what his legacy meant to
Israel. You can't go wrong with that,'' Clayman said.

<P>
   JENA, Germany _ When the Berlin Wall collapsed 10 years ago,
Stephan Schambach was 18, and he had never set foot in a capitalist
country.
</P>
<P>
   Karsten Schneider, then 29, worked listlessly at the bloated
Kombinat, a huge communist-era electronics factory in this small
city south of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about their only link to communism is the name of their
software company: Intershop Communications, a name they
mischievously lifted from East Germany's old hard-currency stores
for foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one remembers who first thought of it,'' Schneider recalled
recently. ``But it seemed perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Intershop sales doubled this year to $40 million, and the
company employs 500 people worldwide. Its stock, now publicly
traded in Germany, has a value of about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the Berlin Wall came down, such buoyancy seems
wildly at odds with eastern Germany's enduring image of shuttered
factories and stagnant growth. Eastern joblessness is still 18
percent, twice as high as in the west.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of this despair, something else has happened.
Parts of the east have become magnets for entrepreneurs and
high-technology start-up companies. In Saxony, eastern Germany's
most populous state, industrial production is climbing at
double-digit rates, faster than all of western Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Jena, the renaissance is striking. The old ``Kombinat'' is
dead. But the city has been a seedbed for nearly a thousand new
ventures in the last few years. Many fizzled, but just as many have
taken off, and unemployment, about 20 percent two years ago, is now
about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my west German friends that we have gone through what
they still need to go through,'' said Kurt Biedenkopf, the
pro-business premier of Saxony and a westerner himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Germany, by reason of its peaceful revolution against an
all-powerful state, has unleashed tremendous development,'' he
said. ``People here are more adaptable, more elastic. It has been
painful and they didn't want it, but it was a consequence of their
desire for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of new companies has yet to offset the loss of old
industry. Nor has it solved what may be eastern Germany's most
intractable problem: high wages. Partly as a result of efforts to
equalize pay in the east and the west, hundreds of thousands of
low-skilled jobs that might have been ideal for eastern Germany
have been lost to lower-cost rivals in the Czech Republic, Poland
and elsewhere in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, eastern Germany's textile work force of 320,000 before
the wall fell now amounts to just 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders here also note that there are big differences
between fast-growing southeastern states like Saxony and Thuringia
and much poorer rural states in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have hard work ahead of us for the next 15 years or
so,'' said Lothar Spath, chairman of Jenoptik AG, a technology
giant he carved from the unwanted leftovers of the communist-era
conglomerate and which has since become one of eastern Germany's
biggest success stories. ``But the process is fundamentally on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jena's turnaround is also the story of Spath, a wily former
politician from western Germany who is now this town's biggest
employer. When he arrived in Jena in 1991, Jenoptik was nothing
more than a jumble of old real estate and 30,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no products, none at all, when we started,'' he said.
``All we had was some good technology and a lot of people.'' This
year, Jenoptik will earn about $20 million on sales of $1.5
billion. Its biggest business is making ``clean room'' equipment
for computer-chip manufacturers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Spath hardly seemed like an obvious savior.
Eastern Germany is full of tales of western Germans who took over
companies in the east only to strip their assets and shut them
down. Western German supermarkets overwhelmed fledgling eastern
retailers, as did western German publishers, banks and consumer
products from beer to clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Spath, a man whom German newspapers have nicknamed ``the clever
one'' because of his political skills, had abruptly resigned in
1991 as premier of the western Germany state of Baden-Wurttemberg
after accusations that he had accepted favors from industry
cronies.
</P>
<P>
   With huge subsidies from the German government, about half of
the Jena's old Kombinat had been reunited with Carl Zeiss AG, the
western German company that had abandoned its Jena factory when the
nation was divided after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Spath, who arrived here first as a consultant, was left with the
debris: acres of real estate, about 30,000 workers and no
customers. There was no business plan either.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could tell us what the strategy was or what it should
be,'' recalled Petra Lorenz, one of many mid-level Kombinat
managers who found herself scrambling in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The whole project would have been hopeless had Spath not been
able to extract huge financial help from the German government.
Pledging to save at least a third of the 30,000 jobs here, he won
about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, Spath laid off 16,000 people, and Jenoptik
executives say about $1.3 billion of the public money went simply
went to cover pensions and unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   To raise more cash, he fixed up Zeiss' old properties into new
industrial parks and sold off as much as he could. He used the cash
from real estate sales to buy western German companies that would
help him crack western markets.
</P>
<P>
   Then he scoured the old research centers for ideas and bused in
potential investors from the west.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Jenoptik dabbled in scores of
businesses _ security systems, automation technology, engineering
services and telecommunications equipment, to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ventures floundered. Between 1995 and 1997, Jenoptik
sold or spun off businesses with combined sales of about $470
million. Just this year, Spath sold off money-losing businesses in
telecommunications equipment and engineering services.
</P>
<P>
   He has also infuriated Germany's biggest labor union, IG Metall,
because Jenoptik refused to negotiate with it and instead struck a
deal with a tiny rival named the Christian Metalworkers Union.
Under that contract, workers can be asked to work up to 44 hours a
week before earning overtime pay. Christmas bonuses and extra pay
for vacations, a time-honored entitlement for western German
companies, are contingent on workers' performance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   IG Metall asked a court to throw out the deal with the other
union, saying it was little more than a front for management. But a
court rejected the complaint in March, and Spath has had no
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism, Jenoptic is profitable and has spawned
many other start-ups that now pack the industrial parks outside of
town. Although only 1,500 of Jenoptic's 8,500 employees are
actually in Jena, Jenoptik has also spawned several dozen companies
that are estimated to employ more than 14,000 people here.
</P>
<P>
   One of those companies is CyBio AG, which makes automated
systems for analyzing chemicals for pharmaceutical research. The
company's sales have climbed to about $12 million this year, and
more than half of its sales come from exports.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Petra Strumper, a western German biologist recruited to help
build the fledgling business, is now one of two executives who took
over the company last summer through a management buy-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends kept saying, how can you do something like
that?'' Dr. Strumper said here. ``But I was sure this would be
successful. Besides, I liked the idea of being a pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, many eastern Germans have seethed quietly
as western Germans took over companies in the east only to sell off
real estate and then shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment has been particularly high among older workers,
hundreds of thousands of whom lost their jobs and could not find
new work. The sense of sullen resentment against ``besser wessis,''
an eastern German phrase for ``western know-it-alls,'' was evident
in a recent survey by the Hans Bockler Stiftung, a nonprofit
research institute in Dusseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that only 9 percent of easterners wanted to
return to the old regime, but that a solid majority could not
identify with western Germany either.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of resentment against western Germans. But
it is hard to find much evidence of it in cities like Jena that are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people can tell bad stories about things that wessis have
done, but when you have wessis who are skillfull, efficient and are
honest, you don't find that hostility,'' said Werner Patzelt,
professor of political economy at the Technical University of
Dresden and a wessi himself.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has poured tens of billions of dollars
into bailing out communist-era conglomerates, but there was no help
for Schambach and Schneider when they needed funds to start
Intershop Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was simple: Computer software was simply not on the
official list of industries eligible for subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, Intershop is one of eastern Germany's most striking
home-grown successes. Its offices here are packed with young
software developers, almost all of whom graduated from East German
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anything about how a market economy worked when
we started,'' recalled Schneider. ``In East German schools, it was
all ideology. Everyone who was rich was capitalist, and capitalism
was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Schambach was a 19-year-old technophile when he started out in
1991. Schneider was unemployed, having quit his job as an
electronics engineer at the Carl Zeiss conglomerate almost as soon
as the Berlin Wall came down.
</P>
<P>
   After a few false starts, they discovered the Internet and began
setting up a rudimentary online store for computer parts in 1995.
But Schambach decided the real money was in selling software to set
up retail web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Since they could not tap money from Bonn and did not know any
venture capitalists, they did the only other thing they could think
of: advertise for investors in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, they succeeded: a west German company invested
$800,000 in exchange for 30 percent of their company.
</P>
<P>
   The company also focused heavily on the United States, licensing
its software to equipment suppliers and to Internet service
providers, who in turn signed up individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   Intershop has yet to turn its first profit, mainly because it
has plowed huge sums of money into marketing and additional
software development. But its customers include Hewlett-Packard,
IBM, Sun Microsystems and Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, even the most dedicated optimists acknowledge
that eastern Germany's economy has a long way to go. Rural and
comparatively poorer states like Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-West
Pomerania are recovering much more slowly than fast-growing
industrial states like Saxony and Thuringia.
</P>
<P>
   And experts say there simply is no quick solution to the problem
of eastern Germany's high costs and wages. Wages in eastern German
factories are higher on average than those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we reduce our wages down to the levels in
Poland of the Czech Republic,'' Spath said, referring to two
countries where factory wages are generally 20 percent of what
German factory workers earn. ``But if they can build a healthy
industry making textiles, then we can sell the machines to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Biedenkopf, Saxony's premier, argues that the worst shocks have
now been largely absorbed and that prospects are healthier than
they appear.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the obliteration of eastern Germany's old
industry and government is now over. Also, the big boom in real
estate construction in eastern Germany has receded. Now, after a
deep recession, eastern construction is slowly coming back to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at unemployment figures,'' Biedenkopf said of
the east in a recent interview at his office in Dresden, which
overlooks the Elbe River. ``But success is measured by employment
figures, and in 1998 we had 414 people employed out of 1,000. That
is better than most states in the west.''
</P>
<P>
   But even people like Biedenkopf and Spath acknowledge that it
will be another 10 or 15 years before eastern Germany weans itself
from its dependence on money from the west.
</P>
<P>
   Though the German government has pruned back subsidies, western
taxpayers still pay a hefty ``solidarity surcharge'' to help
finance eastern reconstruction, pensions and unemployment costs.
There no signs the surcharge will be eliminated any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Germany remains almost totally dependent on outside
investment capital. While western Germans have accumulated enormous
savings and real estate, eastern Germans have almost no money for
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the one big difference that remains between east and
west Germany, and it will continue to have a major impact here for
years to come,'' Biedenkopf said.

NYC TAXI DISPUTE A RACIAL ISSUE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - A tall black man named Kareem Abdul stood on a
streetcorner one block west of Times Square, in the middle of the
day, trying to hail a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul was in New York buying fabric for the garment-factory that
he owned in the Virgin Islands, and now he was trying to get to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a few minutes, six taxicabs _ all with their
rooflights on, indicating they were empty and on-duty _ passed him
by.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a white onlooker offered to stand next to his bags and
wave for a cab on his behalf, while Abdul stepped back out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The first taxi to come along pulled over for what he thought was
a white man's fare.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Abdul learned what native New Yorkers have known for
years _ that a black man has a hard time getting a taxi in this
town.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Danny Glover discovered this truth in an unpleasant
fashion a couple weeks ago _ standing with his daughter in Harlem,
waving his arm in the air, while five cabs drove by as if he didn't
exist. Being famous and thus having instant access to the media,
Glover called a news conference to complain about such racism.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable African-Americans _ including David Dinkins, the
former mayor _ came forward to say they too have suffered the same
indignity.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced a crackdown, which
goes into effect Friday. More than 100 undercover police will take
to the streets in pairs. A black police officer will hail a cab,
while his white colleague, standing 100 feet or so ahead, does the
same. If the driver passes the black to pick up the white, his
license will be suspended and his cab confiscated, pending a
hearing within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on between the taxi drivers and black people,
however, is not entirely racism _ and, to the extent it is, it is
racism of a peculiar sort.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the 42,000 licensed taxi-drivers in New York City
are, themselves, men of color. About two-thirds are immigrants from
South Asia, mainly India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. Most of the
others are from South America and West Africa. Almost none are
white or native-born American.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the discrimination is not whites against blacks. It's
immigrants _ mainly brown, yellow, and black _ against
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Vollo, assistant director of the Taxi Drivers Institute
at LaGuardia Community College, teaches a course on racial
sensitivity, which, since it was started in 1997, all New York
cabdrivers must take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is, our drivers are victims of racism themselves,''
Vollo said. ``Some of them say the only way they can get a cab when
they're off-duty is to wave their hack-licenses in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Beveridge, professor of sociology at Queens College, who
has conducted many studies on New York immigrants, said, ``A lot of
West Africans or Haitians or Jamaicans who come here _ they don't
know they're `black' yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll learn soon enough, or their kids will,'' he went on.
Meanwhile, like other newcomers to the city, ``they pick up very
quickly on the prevailing American values. They immediately see
Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant as dangerous. They see a black person,
they don't pick him up because they're nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with a dozen cabdrivers, while riding around
Manhattan one recent afternoon, tended to confirm this notion.
</P>
<P>
   None of the cabbies wanted their names published, for fear of
getting in trouble. They all knew that _ even before Giuliani's new
get-tough measures _ the law prohibits them from refusing a fare,
unless the person seems drunk or violent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked about ``the Danny Glover situation,'' they all
said much the same thing: They are reluctant to pick up blacks,
especially young or big men. And they concede they sometimes refuse
to go into certain black neighborhoods _ because they are afraid.
</P>
<P>
   A taxidriver from Ecuador: ``They don't pay their fare. I had
this one guy _ I took him all the way to the Bronx, he jumped out
of the cab and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   A cabbie from Indonesia: ``I was robbed by this black man _ he
got in the front seat, took my money.''
</P>
<P>
   One from Panama: ``I'll take someone to East Harlem, but then
I'll get right out of there. I won't pick anybody up from there.
I'm not looking for trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Wilson, professor of African-American studies and
sociology at the University of Wisconsin, hardly endorses these
attitudes but he does empathize with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants have this survivor-mentality, which makes them
cautious,'' Wilson said. ``If they've had a risky experience with
one person of a particular description, they will behave as if it's
risky to deal with all people of that description.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this reluctance is reinforced by economic logic.
Drivers do not want to take passengers _ white or black _ to
Brooklyn or Queens, especially during rush-hour when a trip there
and back could take an hour or more, because they are unlikely to
pick up a fare on their way back to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police statistics suggest that cabdrivers may not be
in as much danger as they seem to think. Like crime on New York
streets, crime in New York taxis has gone way down lately. The
number of robberies against taxidrivers has declined by nearly
two-thirds in this decade. And while seven cabbies were murdered in
1993, there hasn't been a single taxi homicide since January 1997 _
and that one took place on 23rd St. and 3rd Ave., a ``respectable''
part of Manhattan no cabbie would shun.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's new measures impose stiffer penalties, but are
otherwise similar to an existing program called Operation Refusal
in which undercover agents from the Taxi and Limousine Commission
hail cabs in pairs. But violators have faced fines, not suspensions
and the rules were seldom enforced _ last year just 399 cabbies
were nabbed this way.
</P>
<P>
   Real customers can also complain and request a hearing before an
administrative judge. Last year, 2,317 phoned in to complain about
a taxi passing them by, but only 1,217 agreed to appear at a
hearing. Of them, just 664 actually showed up. Of those, 323 saw
the offending cab driver convicted.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Danny Glover did not file a complaint against the
five cabbies who refused to give him service, saying he wanted to
change the system, not punish an individual driver.

<P>
   IN THE JUDEAN FOOTHILLS, Israel _ ``Come, climb into the
grave,'' said Amir Ganor, an archaeologist-cop, his hand reaching
out from an underground hole. ``See what the robbers have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a ruin. A tomb from the first century B.C., one
of thousands hidden in an ancient urban center under the desolate,
cactus-strewn hills, had been vandalized and plundered of
antiquities. Stone doors were pried from the burial holes, human
bones scattered in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They leave the bones, take the goods and destroy the site
forever,'' Ganor said, shining a flashlight to show three burial
places, typical for a Jewish grave site from the early Roman
period. ``When I first saw this, I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Grave-robbing is as old as time, especially in these parts,
where time really stretches back. But in expectation of sharply
increased religious tourism to the Holy Land at the turn of the
millennium, the robbers appear to be working overtime, Israeli
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   They say that as antiquities dealers seek to stockpile
merchandise, an open season on rare coins, oil lamps and precious
glass has been unofficially declared. But merchants themselves say
that they don't have great hopes for an increase in sales in the
year 2000. It must be the middlemen, they say, who are filling the
diggers' heads with dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect much from the millennium,'' said Khader Baidun,
a dealer in the Old City of Jerusalem. ``Those who do come, the
pilgrims, are unlikely to do much rare antiquities shopping. But
there is a new phenomenon that has no basis in the market. The
hysteria among people has increased. They have started thinking the
land is full of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   With guns on their hips, cell phones in their pockets and
shovels in their jeeps, Ganor, 31, and a band of about a dozen
agents patrol off-road Israel in defense of history. But the
Antiquities Authority's anti-theft unit is essentially powerless to
stop the destruction. Not only is its turf vast _ 50,000
archaeological sites _ but the laws are not on its side. Only the
little guys _ the diggers and the middlemen _ are acting illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the sole country in the Middle East that allows a
free market for antiquities, it is perfectly legal to sell the
fruits of pilfered graves. Some 80 dealers are licensed by the
state and do a $5 million-a-year business, according to Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The plunderers follow in the grand tradition of the late Moshe
Dayan, a master digger with an obsessive hunger for valuable
archaeological finds. Dayan, Israel's legendary general, used to go
so far as to use Israeli soldiers and army helicopters to assist
him as he liberated national treasures for his private home.
</P>
<P>
   But antiquities authorities refrained from cracking down on him,
even when they caught him red-handed, as when he was nearly buried
alive during an illegal dig. In exchange, he told them to help
themselves to anything in his house that they wanted to display in
the Israel Museum _ and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The motives of Dayan, an addicted collector, were never
pecuniary. But today's grave robbers, focusing on a hoped-for
millennial rush, are driven by the expectation of double or nothing
_ about $40 _ for an oil lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Even with dwindling resources and staff cuts, the tiny
anti-theft unit of Israel's antiquities agency has nabbed 15
would-be grave robbers in the last month, compared with 100 in a
typical year. They have caught 20 middlemen so far this year, up
from four in 1996. Each middleman was found with at least $50,000
worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities authorities say that dealers, who usually do not
keep a lot of stock and only buy rare objects, are stocking up. The
evidence lies in their registers, which undergo spot checks, the
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be better in the year 2000 than to take home some
souvenir _ a coin, an oil lamp, from the Jesus period?'' Ganor
said, sounding like a huckster for the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But the dealers themselves, who have no reason to lie since
their end of the business is perfectly legal, say they are not in
fact increasing their buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antiquities is a dead business,'' said Abu Shakra, another
dealer in the Old City. ``Look at my stock. I haven't bought
anything in seven years. And I don't particularly see a reason the
year 2000 will be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-theft unit's job is an almost ludicrous pursuit.
Working with tips from informers in Arab villages, where they say
most robbers come from, they roam a vast area in the dead of night.
Wearing night-vision goggles, they try to sneak up on the small
gangs of men who work with pick-axes, spades and metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   At ruins south of Bet Shemesh and a couple of miles from the
Palestinian territories, Ganor covered the terrain as if he knew
what lay beneath every mound, which he probably does. To most
Israelis, the hills are geographically and psychologically
off-limits, part of a forbidding landscape that surrounds them. But
to Ganor, the dirt is just cover for an extensive early Roman and
Byzantine-era city beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbers really like this place because it's a huge
graveyard,'' he said, as he descended crumbling steps and wriggled
his tall body head-first into a hollow beneath the earth. ``They
search for the smoothly cut rock, with curves, which indicate the
entrance. They are good, like archaeologists.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he sat underground, his cell phone rang. ``We have one,
come,'' he said, scrambling up and into his jeep. One of his agents
had caught a man with a metal detector at an already excavated site
in Bet Shemesh. Ganor drove on and off the road, then clambered up
a hill, physically transforming in a matter of minutes from
mild-mannered archaeologist to Israeli policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, the man was cuffed and seated on an ancient
mosaic floor as Ganor and his agent searched his bag. ``If I had
found something it would be in my pockets,'' the man informed them,
asking for the apple in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I find coins; today, nothing,'' he whispered so the
officers couldn't hear.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers drove the man, who would not give his name, to
the Bet Shemesh police station, an agent, Alon Klein, said: ``That
was a stupid one, broad daylight. I could see him from the road. I
parked my car behind and then I sneaked through the brush like
Indiana Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, an Israeli, started to cry. It would later turn out
that he had a long rap sheet of plunder and pilfer, all to support
a drug habit, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very good profession,'' the man said, hanging his
head.
</P>
<P>
   The real professionals, though, work under cover of darkness and
rarely get caught. They use expensive, finely tuned metal
detectors, and then hack away at layers of history, leaving Ganor
to stumble on the wreckage of another site ruined and, sometimes,
in a manly way, to cry himself.

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implant Henry said two months is too
early to draw conclusions; the peak response time probably comes
later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

JAPAN MOVES TO STIMULATE ITS ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Fearful that Japan's tenuous recovery from its worst
postwar recession could collapse in an election year, the
government announced Thursday a package of economic stimulants
worth 18 trillion yen, or about $171.4 billion, almost twice the
amount that had been expected just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which includes a vastly expanded loan program for
small businesses and a large increase in spending on bridges, roads
and other public work projects, represents the ninth huge
government infusion of money into the economy since Japan tumbled
into a severe slump seven years ago. There is no guarantee that it
is the last package.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials had been saying for weeks that the government
was preparing an enormous new program of spending and other
incentives aimed at nurturing the economy, which technically
emerged from the longest and harshest recession since World War II
this past spring. Economists and investors had been eagerly
anticipating the size and details of the new package because
outlays from the government's last spending salvo have been
tapering off. Although the stock market has surged ahead on
anticipation that Japan's economy will strengthen further, there is
little evidence so far that it has enough momentum to grow on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the plan announced Thursday was considered
surprisingly large and reflects the government's determination to
at least sustain the recovery and defend the waning political
fortunes of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who must call elections by next
September, is suffering in the polls. He cannot afford to risk a
return to the near-stagnation that had plagued the world's
second-largest economy since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite satisfied with this,'' said Richard Koo, chief
economist at the Nomura Research Institute, an affiliate of Nomura
Securities. ``It will be sufficient to keep the economy going at
the current level of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is not, however, expected to stimulate further consumer
demand. Many big Japanese companies like Nissan Motor and NEC are
in the process of restructuring their operations and reducing
employment, and consumers are afraid to spend when they fear lower
wages and possible joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason the economy grew in the first two quarters of
this year was public spending. ``The economy won't grow as a result
of this package,'' said Brian Rose, chief economist at Warburg
Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``It's simply that without this package, the
economy would slide back into recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said
in announcing the package that he expected it to increase the gross
domestic product over the next 12 months. The agency revised its
forecasts for economic growth in the fiscal year that ends March 31
to 0.6 percent from 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sakaiya suggested that more such spending
packages may be required. ``Private demand is still weak, and the
economy needs one or two more pushes from fiscal spending,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Political considerations were largely responsible for swelling
the plan's size from Obuchi's original target of 10 trillion yen.
Public approval of the new three-party coalition government has
been slipping.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The expansion of a government loan program for small and
mid-sized businesses at a cost of 5 trillion yen is by far the
biggest single component of the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   And a politically contentious decision to reduce and, in some
cases, postpone health care insurance premiums for the elderly
added another 900 billion yen to the package.
</P>
<P>
   But in measurable new spending, the plan falls pretty much in
line with Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's original 5.5 trillion
yen projection. Almost half the new spending will be dedicated to
construction projects and other public works programs, while 1
trillion yen will go to research.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers, whose government-supported purchases earlier this
year helped spur the economy, will get an additional 200 million
yen in assistance from tax breaks and as much as 2 trillion yen
over time.
</P>
<P>
   And the government pledged an additional 900 million yen to help
banks write down bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between what economists call the ``headline
figure'' of 18 trillion yen and the real spending embedded in the
package is the anticipated amount of lending and spending by local
governments, neither of which typically lives up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Financial market concerns about how the government will pay for
the new program were muted Thursday, perhaps because investors had
already factored much of the news into their pricing. The yen ended
little changed against the dollar. The Nikkei 225 stock average
fell 1.3 percent, but is still up 32 percent this year. In a mild
surprise, prices of government bonds rose, confounding economists
who had expected them to fall because of worries that the
government must issue more bonds to finance the package.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revenues are falling, and economists estimate that 40
percent of the government's budget will have to be covered by bond
sales at a time when government debt levels are already at record
postwar highs.
</P>
<P>
   Masaaki Kanno, the chief economist at J.P. Morgan Securities in
Tokyo, said the government would probably have to issue 7 trillion
yen in new debt to cover the costs of the new program. ``That's
quite a large number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's suggestion that the Ministry of Finance use five-year
bonds to pay for the new spending may have helped alleviate some
fears, as the banks that are the biggest private sector buyers of
government debt prefer such maturities over longer-term debt, which
generally pay higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Kanno said that while bonds with a shorter maturity would
find ready buyers, they could create another set of problems for
the government. ``They're good in the short run perhaps because
they would reduce interest payments, but at the end of the day,
short-term debt will destabilize the financial markets because
every year, the government will have to be rolling it over,'' he
said.

<P>
   With Vietnam War hero John McCain forcing him into a virtual tie
in New Hampshire, George W. Bush paid tribute to U.S. war veterans
Thursday and admitted that he had a different type of fight on his
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the point is it's a competitive race,'' Bush said,
citing polls that showed him leading in New Hampshire, site of the
nation's first presidential primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But an American Research Group poll, published Thursday in the
Manchester Union Leader, had Bush with 38 percent support and
McCain with 35 percent, well within the poll's 4 percentage point
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a friend. He's a good fella. I'm just going to continue
talking about what I think's right for America,'' added the Texas
governor and early Republican front-runner, who only a few weeks
ago enjoyed double-digit leads in most presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a spirited contest, and I look forward to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   National polls still show Bush with a sizeable lead, but the
impression that Bush will have a cakewalk to the GOP nomination is
colored by the new numbers in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, enjoying Veterans Day as the only war hero in the
campaign, said he was pleased with the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his candidacy, ``people laughed and said it's
a done deal,'' McCain said, referring to the assumption Bush would
be the nominee. ``My friends, it's not a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, acknowledging that voters could change their minds several
times before February, McCain said he would have preferred to be
closing in on Bush a little later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Navy pilot who spent five years in a POW camp in
Hanoi, was accompanied by old military friends, including several
colleagues who were also prisoners of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hudson, N.H., VFW he asked the veterans to ``join me on
one more mission and help me get to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to improve health benefits for veterans, saying he
could pay for better service by cutting billions of dollars of
waste from the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to criticize Bush's proposal this week to
improve veteran's benefits, McCain noted that the Texas governor
had only recently demonstrated an interest in this group of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that as we approached Veterans Day the governor and
the other candidates are discussing veterans' issues,'' McCain
said. ``I've been discussing veterans' issues every day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also criticized the Clinton administration's foreign
policy, saying ``I will not conduct foreign policy as social
work.``
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, used a holiday address at the
Veterans Home in Marshalltown, Iowa, to call for the nation to
remain not only the strongest military power in the coming century,
``but also the strongest force for peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a blue American Legion cap as a veteran of the Vietnam
conflict, Gore renewed his attack on the isolationism of some
Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change we need requires more than just a strong defense,''
Gore said. ``It also requires American engagement with the world _
and it requires American leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke to about 150 veterans, most from World War II and
many of them in wheelchairs, on what his staff described as
official business, although Iowa is the site of the first
presidential caucuses in January.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew mixed reviews from former servicemen when he headlined
a Veterans Day ceremony at a cemetery in Clinton Township, Mich., a
few miles from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But the veterans said their choice of a new commander-in-chief
would not rest solely on the sharp contrast in military records
between McCain and Bush, who stayed home as a part-time Texas Air
National Guard pilot during the Vietnam conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's avoidance of Vietnam ``kind of is in the back of your
mind,'' said Tim Burke, 51, a former Army draftee and Vietnam
veteran. ``But at least he sure as hell didn't dodge it.``
</P>
<P>
   Burke, a veterans employment representative for the state of
Michigan, said the service experiences of Bush and other
presidential candidates could ultimately affect his ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Bush ``seems to have his heart in the right
place.'' He said McCain may get a ``lot of sympathetic votes'' from
Vietnam veterans, but the Arizona senator's war record alone
``doesn't mean he's the right person for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fitzgibbons, a 72-year-old retiree who came to hear McCain
in Laconia, N.H., said the Arizona senator has ``paid his dues. He
has been in the fire.'' He said he was turned off by Bush's
prodigious fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be listening to how much money you have. I
want to know what you will do for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry DeVold, 77, of Clinton Township, Mich., a Marine Corps
veteran who was wounded on Saipan during World War II, said he was
still studying the candidates but certainly was not going to fault
Bush for avoiding combat during a ``very unpopular war.``
</P>
<P>
   George Van Loon, 67, of Macomb Township, a veteran of the 1950s
``peace-time'' Army, said he liked Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have a good grasp of affairs, domestic and
foreign,'' Van Loon said.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran, Charles Van Riper of Macomb Township, said he
resented Bush's turning the Veterans Day ceremony into a
``political sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Riper accused Michigan Gov. John Engler, Bush's biggest
supporter in the state, of trying to ``shove it (Bush's candidacy)
down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler accompanied Bush on Thursday. Bush's trip to Michigan,
which also included a fund-raising luncheon in Troy, where he
raised another $150,000 to add to his nearly $60 million warchest.
He later flew to Cleveland for another fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   In his cemetery address, Bush promised to strengthen America's
defenses. But he mostly avoided discussing specific policy
proposals and, instead, spoke in patriotic terms, paying tribute to
the military ``heroes who saved the century.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Engler shared an outdoor platform on a sunny but cold
morning with leaders of several veterans organizations. Ten U.S.
flags were lined up behind the Texas governor, and he and Engler
laid a wreath at a veterans memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant from Austin, Texas,
captured part of the ceremony on video for possible campaign use
later.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign decided to redesign a similarly patriotic ad
that included footage of McCain walking through Arlington National
Cemetery. The Army noted that McCain never sought permission to
film a campaign ad there, and that regulations prohibit the
facility's use for partisan purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a very serious mistake. We corrected it,'' McCain
said.

`MESSENGER' A RIVETING LOOK AT JOAN OF ARC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film history is littered with biographies of Joan of Arc _ from
DeMille's 1916 ``Joan the Woman'' to Otto Preminger's 1957 ``Saint
Joan'' to last May's four-hour CBS miniseries _ and they're all
amazingly different, each reflecting the sensibility of their time
and their author's unique molding of the legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger,'' an eye-filling, mostly very compelling and
incorrigibly weird new version by France's Luc Besson, is yet
another take on the story. Besson's Joan (Milla Jovovich, his
ex-significant other) is a likable near-psychotic subconsciously
seeking revenge for the rape-murder of her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with a fast-moving crawl that sets up the historical
situation of the Hundred Years War, the film introduces the young
Joan as a happy child with a precocious affinity for the religious
life who is scarred forever when her village of Domremy is raided
by the English and she witnesses the indescribably brutal death of
her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a decade or so later, and the 19-year-old Joan is already
well known throughout the country as a visionary who hears heavenly
voices. When she bangs on the doors of the Dauphin (John Malkovich)
demanding he take France back from the English, he and his crafty
mother-in-law (Faye Dunaway) see the hand of opportunity knocking.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film follows the familiar path _ Joan rallies
the demoralized French troops, she drives the English from Orleans,
she becomes such a nuisance to the French they conspire to get rid
of her _ except that her final hours before the flames becomes a
dramatized internal dialogue in which Joan comes to a horrifying
self-awareness of herself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has more than its share of oddities. The script is
riddled with anachronistic dialogue and '90s-isms. Joan's hair
color inexplicably changes from blond to a rich brunette for the
final scenes. And what the heck is Dustin Hoffman doing in those
soul-searching climactic moments wandering around the cell in a
dark robe? Is he the personification of Joan's voices or God or
what?
</P>
<P>
   Besson's MTV-style of filmmaking will also annoy some viewers.
He believes in dramatizing only high points, and, as always in his
films, there's some big gaps in the storytelling process. Also, if
you think about it, his version of the story bears such a striking
resemblance to the beats of David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia''
that a critic could reasonably call it a ripoff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite all this, ``The Messenger'' is a fast-paced and
riveting affair that held my interest well for a two-hour,
21-minute running time. The scenes of political intrigue are
especially engrossing, and the supporting cast is strong _
Malkovich and Dunaway are splendid, and Pascal Greggory, Vincent
Cassel and Tcheky Karyo all have rich and memorable parts.
</P>
<P>
   As Joan, Jovovich acts her heart out, and is finally painfully
convincing. She doesn't have the stature or star quality of some of
the earlier Joans, but she's magnificently passionate, just burning
from within. Noted for her physical agility and athletic ability,
the ex-supermodel is at her charismatic best dashing through the
carnage like a quarterback in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole movie comes wonderfully alive in its sweeping
battle scenes. Indeed, it's possible that the horror and spectacle
of medieval battle has never been recreated on film before with
such ghastly beauty, and in such intimate and frightening detail.
Besson may not exactly be _ as some critics have dubbed him over
the years _ the ``Spielberg of France,'' but he definitely has an
eye for the epic.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Messenger'' piques your interest in the Maid of
Orleans, there are plenty of earlier _ and strikingly different _
film versions of the story available on video for your own personal
Joan of Arc Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start, if you can find it, is Cecil B. DeMille's
``Joan the Woman'' (1916), one of the movies' first epic feature
films, starring the opera singer Geraldine Farrar. Another silent,
Carl Dreyer's 1928 ``The Passion of Joan of Arc'' starring Maria
Falconetti, is considered by many critics as one of the greatest
films of all time, and has just been re-released on video (Home
Vision) and DVD (Criterion Collection).
</P>
<P>
   The '40s gave us Victor Fleming's ``Joan of Arc'' (1948)
starring Ingrid Bergman; the '50s had Otto Preminger's adaptation
of Shaw's ``Saint Joan'' (1957), introducing Jean Seberg; and in
the '60s France's legendary Robert Bresson made ``The Trial of Joan
of Arc'' (1962), with Florence Carrez.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, there's the CBS miniseries starring the
16-year-old Leelee Sobieski _ by far Hollywood's most complete
telling of the story _ which has been released on videotape and DVD
by Artisan.
</P>
<P>
   The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. Directed by Luc Besson.
Written by Andrew Birkin and Besson. Cast: Milla Jovovich, John
Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman, Tcheky Karyo. Columbia.

`DOGMA' MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON A RESTROOM WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Smith's ``Dogma'' has been such a long time in coming and
endured such harrowing pre-release problems _ dropped by its
initial distributor, denounced as blasphemy by Catholic Church
groups _ that it would be nice to be able to report it was worth
all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the film is not much. There's a raucous
chuckle here and there, but it's never consistently funny, and it's
agonizingly foul-mouthed and adolescent, surprisingly empty and
ineffective as a satire of organized religion, and at least 30
minutes too long.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about two unbearably cool angels of death (Matt
Damon and Ben Affleck) who have been out of God's favor and
stranded on Earth for millennia _ currently in Wisconsin _ who
finally find a loophole in God's law that will allow them to
re-enter Paradise via the blessed arch of a New Jersey cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that if they do, all human and heavenly existence
will vanish. So a heavenly messenger (Alan Rickman) appears before
the only human being with the spiritual clout to stop them: the
unknowing last descendant of Christ, a young woman named Bethany
(Linda Fiorentino) who works in a Pittsburgh birth control clinic.
</P>
<P>
   So the movie becomes a goofy spiritual-adventure quest as the
long-suffering and perplexed Bethany journeys by car, bus and thumb
to get to New Jersey's most sacred spot before the renegade angels,
picking up a variety of companions _ heavenly and otherwise,
friendly and hostile _ along the way.
</P>
<P>
   As he proved in ``Clerks,'' ``Mallrats'' and ``Chasing Amy,''
writer-director Smith has a gift for cynical, wise-guy dialogue and
Gen X stereotypes. And he has his best cast ever here in the form
of Damon, Affleck, Rickman, Fiorentino, Chris Rock (as another
angel), Salma Hayek (as a muse), Alanis Morissette (as God) and
George Carlin (as a hip cardinal).
</P>
<P>
   But except for Carlin, Fiorentino (who anchors the film nicely)
and Smith-regular Jason Mewes, the cast is wasted in a succession
of lame burlesque skits and scatological excursions. And it's soon
painfully clear that Smith has badly overextended his modest
filmmaking gifts: he doesn't have the wit, the skill or the vision
to make this anything but the cinematic equivalent of graffiti
scrawled on a restroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dogma. Directed and written by Kevin Smith. Cast: Ben Affleck,
George Carlin, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, Alan
Rickman, Chris Rock, Jason Mewes. Lions Gate Films. 125 minutes.
Rated R for language, violence, crude sexual references, and some
drug use.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, WHAT A WONDERFUL 12-HOUR DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On CBS Sunday night, a fairly typical November-sweeps miniseries
offers a moviemaker's idea of what it would be like if New York
City were struck by your basic car-swallowing, statue-toppling
earthquake. As disaster fare, it's quite passable, with enormously
appealing visual effects. Anyone with an intense dislike of New
York will especially enjoy it, gaining some visceral satisfaction
in seeing the city crumble like a dry leaf underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   But something far more affecting than ``Aftershock: Earthquake
in New York'' is Ric Burns' monumental ``New York: A Documentary
Film,'' which also begins Sunday night as part of ``The American
Experience,'' a PBS series that never seems to disappoint. Despite
war and civil uprising, depression and scandal, Burns' New York
does remain standing, if not always upright. Regardless, it is one
of this country's most astonishing and inspiring visual effects, if
you will, and the essential embodiment of the American experience.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four centuries after Henry Hudson, an Englishman on the
Dutch payroll, stumbled upon a huge sheltering harbor in his search
for Chinese take-out, New York City continues to capture the
imagination like no other city. It inspires. It frightens. It
enrages. It amazes. It beckons. It seduces.
</P>
<P>
   Burns _ he's Ken Burns' younger but no less accomplished brother
_ captures it all in ``New York: A Documentary Film.'' True, with
12 hours to fill, you'd expect him to. But Burns has done it
lyrically, musically and with the important understanding that New
York is itself a story continually unfolding, as worthy of an A&AMP;E
``Biography'' as great New Yorkers like Peter Stuyvesant, Alexander
Hamilton, DeWitt Clinton, Walt Whitman or Al Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator David Ogden Stiers says early in part one: ``Of all the
early explorers, Hudson was the first to sense the immense
potential of the remote and lonely harbor. Yet even he could never
have foreseen the tremendous human forces it would someday unleash,
nor that the great city that would rise there would be dedicated to
a crucial experiment, one that would grow ever more urgent with
each passing year, the exhilarating, often harrowing experiment to
see if all the peoples of the world could live together in a single
place.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of New York as an industrial-size petri dish, where
ferment and hubbub mingle to create constant upheaval, is the core
of Burns' film, and the reason it enthralls. It's the sort of
craziness that causes many to despise New York, many more to adore
it. But if it were a book, ``New York'' would be impossible to put
down. From the deplorable introduction of the African slave trade
in the 1600s to the remarkable completion of the Empire State
Building in just over a year in 1931, Burns' ``New York'' marries
great writing and solid filmmaking into a perfect union of
education and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased from its native occupants by its Dutch settlers for no
other reason than to make a few guilders, New York today remains
loyal to its mercenary origins. Along the centuries, it defined
itself with generous measures of democracy, diversity and
depravity. But, as author Alfred Kazin notes in part five, New York
has come to stand as a symbol of the ultimate goal, a reminder that
where you are, if it isn't New York, is not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Millions will immediately disagree, but Kazin's point is valid
in the sense that New York has indeed become the economic and
cultural center of the world. Burns adds: ``The world has come to
New York as it has come to no other city on Earth, and the city
itself has projected itself back out across the country and the
world as has no other.''
</P>
<P>
   With this documentary, a five-year-long project, Burns and his
colleagues have projected themselves into the historic canon with a
work for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   New York: A Documentary Film. Twelve-hour, six-episode
historical documentary about New York City directed by Ric Burns,
narrated by David Ogden Stiers. First 10 hours Sunday through
Thursday on PBS. Final two hours air next spring. Parental
guideline rating: TV-G.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frank Ciotola, a restaurant owner in Columbus,
Ohio, is paying dishwashers $8 an hour nowadays, up from $6 two
years ago. And he is spending more money placing help wanted ads
than he is promoting the restaurant itself.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of his total costs accounted for by labor has
crept up to 29 percent from 24 percent during the last few years,
and though he has clamped down on other expenses as much as
possible, Ciotola said he had reached the point where customers at
his restaurant, Da Vinci, will have to pick up some of the tab if
wages keep rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just about as tight as it's going to get,'' Ciotola said.
``Any additional increases we face, we'll just have to pass along
in terms of menu prices or I'm not going to make any money.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's low and still declining unemployment rate _ it fell
to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest in almost 30 years _ has been
great news for Ciotola's 75 employees and workers in most
industries all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility
that upward pressure on wages could spur inflation, seem to be the
biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they
debate whether to raise interest rates a third time this year when
they meet on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, employment cost increases have remained remarkably
restrained despite the drop in unemployment. Moreover, to the
degree that those costs have surged, from such hot industries as
computer software and telecommunications to more traditional
sectors like retailing, businesses have proven remarkably
successful in absorbing them without sacrificing profits or raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons range from new trends in compensation, like the
rising use of stock options in the place of salary increases, to an
upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or each worker's output
each hour. The question is how long such forces can keep a lid on
the pressures that might force up wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have productivity improvements up the wazoo, but it
defies all logic to assume you won't get increases in prices and
wages at some point,'' one Fed official said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows precisely when that point will be reached, though,
making the decision about whether to raise rates next week a
particularly close call for the central bank, which pushed its
benchmark federal funds target rate up by a quarter of a percentage
point in August, to 5.25 percent, after an earlier quarter-point
increase in June.
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly a case for the Fed to remain on hold next week.
By most measures, inflation remains reasonably well contained. The
economy is showing some signs of slowing in response to earlier
interest rate increases. The stock market is down from its highs
this summer. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and
other Fed officials are increasingly convinced that the improvement
in productivity growth reflects structural changes in the way
businesses operate, not just a brief cyclical upturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do raise rates, I'd really likow why,'' said
Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a
consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ``The only rationale is that
growth is strong, and I think the Fed has moved beyond the idea
that growth by itself is something to be afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   The case in favor of another rate hike next week is built
largely on the idea that the nation is running out of workers, and
that at some point a simple supply-and-demand situation will lead
to a surge in wages and then, perhaps, prices. In this view, the
Fed should stay ahead of the trend by slowing the economy a bit
more to keep the labor market from getting even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the absence of a rise in core inflation, developments
in the labor market are likely to result in the Fed instituting
more pre-emptive rate hikes,'' said Ian Morris, an economist at
HSBC Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last month, John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., took an in-depth look at the strains in the labor
market. He said that even the broadest measure of available labor _
including not just people who are officially unemployed but some
part-time workers and others who might be tempted back into the
labor market _ had declined steeply, to 7 percent in September from
7.6 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Joblessness among adults, 3.5 percent in October, is near a
three-decade low. Overall labor force participation is stagnant or
down, and the growth of the labor force is slowing somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Youngdahl concluded that there appears to be growing sentiment
at the Fed that it is ``not only the small size but the
inflexibility of the margin in labor supply that creates potential
for an appreciable upward shift in labor expense growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public appearances, Greenspan has alluded repeatedly to
tight labor markets. Speaking to a group of business executives
last month, Greenspan said that the number of people being drawn
into the work force beyond those due to normal population trends _
in other words, people who had previously chosen not to work _ was
accounting for roughly half a percentage point of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Greenspan said, the economy would have to revert
back to a growth rate reflecting normal labor force growth and the
long-term rate of productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the growth in gross domestic product cannot exceed
the sum of growth in structural productivity and in the working-age
population indefinitely,'' Greenspan said. ``Market pressures must
eventually emerge that work to contain such unsustainable growth.''

</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of mounting pressures in
the labor markets. Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. said that in some cities it
has to pay cash bonuses to attract and even retain employees in its
stores, and that regional managers have discretion to raise wages
if needed.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls, a manufacturer
based in Milwaukee, said his company now often draws new employees
from lower-paying, less-skilled jobs in the service sector, and
must spend money and time training them. Moreover, Johnson's
customers in industries like automobiles demand decreasing prices
on some of its products, putting additional pressure for the
company to offset rising labor costs with productivity
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   And at the loftiest reaches of the employment scale, experienced
executives going into senior jobs at technology startups are able
to demand and get richer packages of stock and options in addition
to cash compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in the middle of an unprecedented
supply-and-demand imbalance,'' said David B. Kixmiller, a partner
in the Silicon Valley office of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the executive
search firm.
</P>
<P>
   To hold down labor costs in that kind of environment, companies
have become more imaginative. Some use one-time cash bonuses to
reward workers without permanently raising wage rates. Others are
offering more equity-based pay schemes like stock options that do
not show up in traditional measures of wage and salary growth.
Others are offering expensive gifts, extra time off and other
benefits in an effort to lure new employees and hold onto the ones
they have.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also think that workers themselves are less
aggressive in pushing for pay increases than they were in previous
business cycles when unemployment dipped to low levels. The reason,
they speculate, is that the combination of global competition and
the relentless corporate push to cut costs have left workers
somewhat insecure about their jobs _ even if they are relatively
confident that they could find another if they do become
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on labor costs could well ease if the economy is
indeed slowing. But the economy has repeatedly defied projections
of a slowdown, and at this point continued strong growth could send
unemployment down to levels the nation has not seen since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Morris of HSBC calculated recently that if labor force growth
remains at its current annual rate of roughly 1 percent, labor
force participation remains steady at around 67 percent and the
economy creates an average of 250,000 nonfarm jobs a month, the
unemployment rate will decline to as low as 3.5 percent by the
middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   If job growth averages 200,000 a month _ it has been running at
an average of 192,000 a month this year _ it would push the
unemployment rate down to as low as 3.9 percent by mid-2000, Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials will no doubt scrutinize new reports on retail
sales and productivity that are to be released on Friday, the last
major economic indicators before their meeting next Tuesday. And
while they have given few clues in the last few weeks as to their
thinking about the arguments for and against a rate increase, they
have made clear that they are very much on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should not assume that the business cycle is dead,''
William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
told reporters in Vienna Thursday after delivering a speech there.
``One should not assume that the American economy can keep growing
faster without inflation.''

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, WHAT A WONDERFUL 12-HOUR DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On CBS Sunday night, a fairly typical November-sweeps miniseries
offers a moviemaker's idea of what it would be like if New York
City were struck by your basic car-swallowing, statue-toppling
earthquake. As disaster fare, it's quite passable, with enormously
appealing visual effects. Anyone with an intense dislike of New
York will especially enjoy it, gaining some visceral satisfaction
in seeing the city crumble like a dry leaf underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   But something far more affecting than ``Aftershock: Earthquake
in New York'' is Ric Burns' monumental ``New York: A Documentary
Film,'' which also begins Sunday night as part of ``The American
Experience,'' a PBS series that never seems to disappoint. Despite
war and civil uprising, depression and scandal, Burns' New York
does remain standing, if not always upright. Regardless, it is one
of this country's most astonishing and inspiring visual effects, if
you will, and the essential embodiment of the American experience.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four centuries after Henry Hudson, an Englishman on the
Dutch payroll, stumbled upon a huge sheltering harbor in his search
for Chinese take-out, New York City continues to capture the
imagination like no other city. It inspires. It frightens. It
enrages. It amazes. It beckons. It seduces.
</P>
<P>
   Burns _ he's Ken Burns' younger but no less accomplished brother
_ captures it all in ``New York: A Documentary Film.'' True, with
12 hours to fill, you'd expect him to. But Burns has done it
lyrically, musically and with the important understanding that New
York is itself a story continually unfolding, as worthy of an A&AMP;E
``Biography'' as great New Yorkers like Peter Stuyvesant, Alexander
Hamilton, DeWitt Clinton, Walt Whitman or Al Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator David Ogden Stiers says early in part one: ``Of all the
early explorers, Hudson was the first to sense the immense
potential of the remote and lonely harbor. Yet even he could never
have foreseen the tremendous human forces it would someday unleash,
nor that the great city that would rise there would be dedicated to
a crucial experiment, one that would grow ever more urgent with
each passing year, the exhilarating, often harrowing experiment to
see if all the peoples of the world could live together in a single
place.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of New York as an industrial-size petri dish, where
ferment and hubbub mingle to create constant upheaval, is the core
of Burns' film, and the reason it enthralls. It's the sort of
craziness that causes many to despise New York, many more to adore
it. But if it were a book, ``New York'' would be impossible to put
down. From the deplorable introduction of the African slave trade
in the 1600s to the remarkable completion of the Empire State
Building in just over a year in 1931, Burns' ``New York'' marries
great writing and solid filmmaking into a perfect union of
education and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased from its native occupants by its Dutch settlers for no
other reason than to make a few guilders, New York today remains
loyal to its mercenary origins. Along the centuries, it defined
itself with generous measures of democracy, diversity and
depravity. But, as author Alfred Kazin notes in part five, New York
has come to stand as a symbol of the ultimate goal, a reminder that
where you are, if it isn't New York, is not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Millions will immediately disagree, but Kazin's point is valid
in the sense that New York has indeed become the economic and
cultural center of the world. Burns adds: ``The world has come to
New York as it has come to no other city on Earth, and the city
itself has projected itself back out across the country and the
world as has no other.''
</P>
<P>
   With this documentary, a five-year-long project, Burns and his
colleagues have projected themselves into the historic canon with a
work for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   New York: A Documentary Film. Twelve-hour, six-episode
historical documentary about New York City directed by Ric Burns,
narrated by David Ogden Stiers. First 10 hours Sunday through
Thursday on PBS. Final two hours air next spring. Parental
guideline rating: TV-G.

COMMENTARY: GEORGE W. HELMSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush must be feeling at least a tiny bit of heat from
John McCain, since he's felt compelled to come up with a reason
that he would make a better president than the senator from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had chief executive experience,'' says Bush. ``I know how
to set goals. I know how to make decisions. I know how to rally
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a truly cynical person might say that Bush's background
would prove useful only if Congress decides to start behaving like
the Texas legislature and meet every other year. But hey, you work
with what you have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president of the United States must have executive
experience; we don't need people learning on the job,'' said
Carroll Campbell, the former governor of South Carolina, driving
the message home at a Bush rally in Seneca, S.C., this week.
</P>
<P>
   People there had been standing packed in a hot American Legion
hall for two hours while a local state representative periodically
shrieked out false alarms. (``He's right outside! Trust me!'') They
were almost all committed Bush supporters, who said they had
decided to support the governor over McCain and the other
Republicans because:
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother was one of the best first ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of the same beliefs as his father had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody mentioned executive experience.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty apparent that Bush became the odds-on favorite to
get the Republican nomination because he was born with a famous
political name. He happened to start running for president at a
time when the campaign began so early that asking voters to name
their favorite candidate was like asking them for their favorite
poet. Bush, the Robert Frost of political name recognition, won the
first polls easily, and after that things just started snowballing.
He got more and more support because, in the words of a woman in a
diner in Easley, S.C., ``he's popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the campaign needs a more impressive story arc. Bush
and his surrogates would like to attribute his success as a
presidential candidate to his record as governor, which includes
making Texas one of 49 states to lower taxes over the last five
years and one of 50 that slashed welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has prospered under the current governor, but it's hard to
tell how much of that has to do with a national economy so
stupendous it would have required a herculean effort to fail. Last
year the number of crimes in the state dropped 5.2 percent. But
South Dakota's crime rate went down 19 percent, and you don't see a
presidential boom for Gov. William Janklow. The welfare caseload in
Texas dropped about 30 percent during the first several years of
George Bush's watch, but it dropped 44 percent in Alabama under Fob
James, who spent most of his administration obsessing about putting
prayer back in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's best assets _ an energetic campaign style and great
timing _ will take you a lot further politically than a genius for
management. (Just ask the other governors.) At the rally in Seneca,
one of the most well-informed voters in the audience seemed to be
Haynie Floyd, who is in the pest control business. Floyd said he
was disappointed that Bush hadn't talked more about the
environment, but he felt he had the best character for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is sometime down the road going to show his temper,''
the exterminator said. ``Now when Bush couldn't answer that
question about the world leaders on TV, he didn't lose his temper.
I don't know what McCain would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine what would have happened to Al Gore if he'd gotten
caught on TV drawing a blank on the name of the prime minister of
India and calling the head of Pakistan ``General ... general.'' How
many people think it would have been taken as a sign of
presidential temperament that he didn't slug the interviewer?
</P>
<P>
   The polls in New Hampshire show McCain making substantial
progress in the race for the presidential nomination. But he's
still way, way behind Bush in the Luck Sweepstakes.

 &HT;    Unanswered questions focus of Gingrichs' first day in divorce
court
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Gingrich divorce went to court for the first time
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's lawyers argued over 32 questions Newt Gingrich
hasn't answered, and the judge hinted that she may consider hitting
him with the day's legal tab.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich showed up for the hearing in Cobb County
Superior Court, but the former speaker of the U.S. House did not.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour hearing was spiced with the same tedious and
contentious tone that has marked the case since Newt Gingrich, 56,
filed for divorce in July.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, 48, held an intense gaze through most of the
proceeding, her hands rested on her lap and her back pressed
against the chair as news cameras clicked and videotape rolled to
her left.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, she admitted she was ``a little nervous.''
Most of those in the courtroom's gallery were from the local and
national media.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Marianne Gingrich learned that her husband has been
seeing his admitted lover, Callista Bisek, for six years. Bisek,
33, is a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee in
Washington and lives in nearby Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Marietta, Ga., Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson heard
arguments over Gingrich's alleged refusal to answer his estranged
wife's questions about his extramarital love life and his finances.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's attorney, John Browning, argued that Marianne
Gingrich's 32 questions actually amount to 200 or more. Browning
characterized the multiple-part questions as a shrewd attempt to
get around Georgia law, which limits parties in a divorce to 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe Mr. Gingrich is trifling with the court,''
said John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney. ``We want him
sanctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer brought three associates and used window-sized flip
charts to diagram several of the questions at issue.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the questions are routine _ ``Please list the
contents of any safe deposit box(es) which you maintain, giving the
exact location thereof.'' _ others are far more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   One asks Gingrich to ``identify the names and addresses of any
and all persons, other than your wife, with whom you've had sexual
relations during this marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another question, Mayoue conceded during the hearing, could
be considered an argument: ``Do you believe that you have conducted
your private life in this marriage in accordance with the concept
of `family values' you have espoused politically and
professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning added that the phrase ``politically and
professionally'' made it two questions.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue argued that Gingrich's refusal to answer his wife's
questions was ``egregious, extreme and abusive,'' especially since
it was Gingrich who requested the divorce. Mayoue said the
multiple-part questions were an attempt to be specific, not
burdensome. He asked the judge to set a deadline for Gingrich to
answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she would issue her ruling later, in writing, but
there were indications that she may have been swayed by Mayoue's
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The judge raised the possibility of sanctioning Gingrich by
making him pick up the costs for Marianne Gingrich's lawyers over
the issue. Mayoue told the judge he makes $275 an hour and racked
up 50 hours in preparing for Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for me to see how 50 hours are put into this,''
Browning later told the judge. ``I don't have 50 hours in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost two today,'' replied Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce attorneys outside the case agree that Gingrich will
eventually have to answer many of the questions he's now avoiding.
Many of the financial questions will be answered by a sworn assets
statement the Gingrichs will each have to supply at a court-ordered
mediation hearing Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Browning insisted Gingrich is cooperating in his divorce and has
turned over thousands of pages of documents to his wife's
attorneys. ``We have produced everything we have, every smidgen,''
he said.

 &HT;    Lady Bird Johnson in fair condition after fainting
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former first lady Lady Bird Johnson was in fair
condition at Seton Medical Center on Thursday after fainting at her
home.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were planning to keep Johnson, 86, at the hospital
overnight for observation. Officials said she was alert and her
vital signs were normal,
</P>
<P>
   ``Her age is a factor,'' said Stephanie Elsea, a hospital
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was married to former President Lyndon B. Johnson
for 39 years, arrived at the hospital at 12:30 p.m. in an ambulance
with her daughter Luci, who did not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had been treated at and released from Seton for heat
exhaustion Sept. 13, and had cataract surgery in Houston a couple
of days ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she was hospitalized after she fainted while giving a
private dinner party at the LBJ Library. That year she also
suffered a mild stroke but quickly recovered. At the time, Luci
Johnson said her mother has fainting spells from time to time after
long periods of intense activity.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley James, Johnson's executive secretary, said Johnson had
been on the phone with a friend when she fainted. ``I had just left
the room while she was on the phone,'' James said. ``It was just a
little fainting episode.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Johnson was ``in good spirits,'' was ``really doing
very well'' and did not want to go to the hospital. Johnson is the
founder of the Wildflower Center that bears her name in south
Austin and spearheaded the effort to beautify Town Lake.

 &HT;    Delta, union exchange accusations
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants is turning up the heat in
its organizing campaign at Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The union on Thursday accused Atlanta-based Delta of employing
``a union-busting consultant with an unseemly record'' to thwart
its organizing drive.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA, in a news release, said the consultant is American
Consulting Group, a California-based firm. It said the firm's
president, Fred Long, was cited by the National Labor Relations
Board for previous anti-union work. In 1994, the AFA said, the
board issued a restraining order after Long allegedly threatened
two union officials.
</P>
<P>
   American Consulting didn't reply to a request for comment. A
secretary at the firm's Los Gatos, Calif., office said Long was
retired. Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate said the firm has worked on
``communications strategies'' for the airline for about two years
but that Long has never been directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the flight attendant union, said
American Consulting is well-known for helping companies try to
defeat organizing drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of having this kind of consultant is that
Delta is showing it doesn't want to let flight attendants make a
choice free from threats and intimidation,'' he said. ``They're
using a consultant with a record of just that.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFA also said Delta plans mandatory meetings for all 20,000
flight attendants this month in Atlanta and other cities, as part
of its anti-organizing effort. It said Delta will spend some $2
million on the series of meetings. Zack said such ``captive
audience'' meetings are a standard tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Pate said the meetings are designed to let the airline's new
in-flight service chief, ex-Xerox Corp. executive Sharon Wibben,
meet flight attendants, lay out her vision and take questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``AFA's news release really just demonstrates their paranoia
about us talking to our people,'' Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is the least-unionized major airline but has faced
intensifying organizing efforts in the 1990s. In addition to the
AFA, the Transport Workers Union is organizing at the carrier and
recently won an election to represent pilot instructors. The
Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association also is trying to drum up
support.

BOSTON GLOBE REJECTS TOBACCO ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Globe said Thursday it will no longer accept
or carry advertisements that promote tobacco products and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   With the ban, the Globe joins a small list of newspapers that
reject tobacco advertising. The list includes the Globe's sister
paper, The New York Times, which like the Globe, is owned by The
New York Times Co. Globe officials said the decision to ban tobacco
advertising was entirely a local one.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching the decision to ban tobacco ads, Globe publisher
Richard H. Gilman said he had to weigh a newspaper's responsibility
in balancing the free flow of information with sometimes opposing
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though tobacco remains legal, its effect on public health
is clear,'' Gilman said in a statement. ``We can no longer justify
carrying advertisements that promote a product when the harm it
causes is so evident and is now acknowledged even by one of the
tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot in good conscience expose our readers, particularly
our young readers, to any more of these messages,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said tobacco ads have accounted for only a small
fraction of total revenues but did not elaborate with specific
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on accepting tobacco ads is effective immediately for
the pages of the Globe newspaper. For sections of the paper that
are printed or published by others but carried by the Globe, such
as Sunday supplements, the ban will go into effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sections are printed weeks before the actual day
of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe repeated Thursday that it tries to impose as few
restrictions on advertising as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Among ads the Globe refuses to accept are those for handguns,
ammunition, automatic weapons, adult movies, 900 telephone numbers,
dating and escort services, and term paper agencies.

 &HT;    Home Depot expanding roof installation nationally
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home Depot's installation sales evidently are going through the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   A test that began in the Carolinas has turned into a major
initiative for the Atlanta-based retailer. Installed Products USA,
a Tampa-based roofing contractor, has struck a long-term, exclusive
deal to provide installation for Home Depot customers across the
nation. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The roofing company now operates in about 350 of Home Depot's
888 stores. During the next three years, Home Depot will take the
service to nearly all of its markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot is looking to take a big piece of the installation
business,'' said C. Michael Verble, chairman and chief executive of
Installed Products. The total residential roofing market is a $12
billion business, Verble said. His company is aiming for at least
10 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Installed Products currently is selling $1 million a week in
roofing services to Home Depot customers, Verble said. Home Depot
gets an undisclosed percentage of those sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. is the only other national retailer that
installs roofing and other products. The contractor that provides
the installation is struggling, though. Publicly held Diamond Home
Services Inc. said last week it entered into forbearance agreements
with its lenders and with Sears as it tries to correct operating
problems. Diamond expects operating losses for the third and fourth
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mercer, Home Depot's executive vice president of
operations and group president, recently told an investment
conference that Home Depot would surpass Sears this year as the
largest installer of home improvement products.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Cos., the second-largest home improvement retailer, has
been expanding installation services to compete with Home Depot.
Lowe's plans to add roofing installation at some point, said
spokesman Brian Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Service is an important new category for Home Depot. Thanks to
the aging population, the installation market is expected to grow
at a faster pace than the do-it-yourself market in the next 10 to
15 years. Mercer estimated that the total market for installed
products is $130 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer began installing roofs in 1997 with a test at 10
stores in the Carolinas. Most of the company's roofing business
today is along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to roofing, most of Home Depot's installation work
is driven by carpet, kitchens, siding and windows.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer also has a program for water heaters in Dallas.

 &HT;    Boards approve WebMD merger with Healtheon
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boards of Atlanta-based WebMD, Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Healtheon and two smaller companies Thursday approved a merger
aimed at creating an Internet health care juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Combining with East Meadow, N.Y.-based Mede America and
Atlanta-based Greenberg News Networks, the new company,
Healtheon/WebMD, has been praised by industry analysts, who say the
venture will face a slew of Internet rivals, including
CareInSite.com, DrKoop.com and Atlanta-based Adam.com.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD is scheduled to issue earnings today, then host
a Manhattan luncheon for reporters. Company officials also meet
today and Tuesday with New York analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported Thursday that News Corp. will pay $50 a
share for 2 million shares of the combined company as part of a
total investment of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board was also named Thursday. Four WebMD board
members are on the board: Jeff Arnold, founder, chairman and chief
executive officer of WebMD; Atlanta entrepreneur Bert Ellis, head
of IXL Enterprises; Eric Gleacher of Gleacher &AMP; Co.; and Olympic
organizer Billy Payne. From Healtheon come Jim Clark, who founded
Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon; investor John Doerr of
Kleiner Perkins; and Bill Maguire, chairman and CEO of United
Health Group. Microsoft, which made a hefty investment in the
company, will be represented on the board by Vice President Laura
Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Lucrative link
</P>
<P>
   Many companies lay claim to pieces of the health care market,
but none has comparable breadth, according to Mike Long, chief
executive officer of Healtheon, who will become chairman and chief
operating officer of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD will forge a lucrative virtual link among
doctors, patients and the institutions that control billions of
dollars in health care spending, he said. ``We don't know anybody
else who wants to connect all three.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is the result of several compromises. Arnold will
become CEO of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold and Long will divide top executive duties, while both
companies get a piece of the name. The company's ticker symbol
remains that of Healtheon (HLTH), while the Internet presence will
be under the portal name of WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also creates a bicoastal company. Atlanta will be
Healtheon/WebMD's marketing, legal, financial and corporate
headquarters, while Healtheon's Santa Clara home will be the hub
for engineering and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to remain, because frankly the access there to
Internet skills is unequaled in the world, and we want to tap into
the people who are doing the innovation,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet companies, Healtheon and WebMD have reported
only losses. But Arnold said the company sees a clear path toward
profits. Because it can slash transaction costs, Healtheon/WebMD
can lure the huge companies that are gatekeepers for much of health
care spending, he said. ``There are 30 billion transactions in
health care, and they cost between $1.50 and $10 each to process
nonelectronically. We go to those companies and say we can do it
for 25 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has more than 60,000 physicians on its network,
while the consumer side of WebMD received 2.75 million visitors in
October, compared with 300,000 a day in June, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD also has agreements for $165 million in
advertising for the next five years, Arnold said. ``If you added
together all the guaranteed dollars for the other 20,000 health
care consumer sites, you wouldn't get half of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon stock rose $3.81 1/4 a share to close at $42.43 3/4
Thursday. Healtheon stock has been used as the currency in the
merger, as well as the purchase of Mede America and Greenberg News
Networks. The stock, which crested at $105 a share shortly after
the Healtheon-WebMD merger was announced, had been languid of late,
trading below $50 since late July and reaching a low of $30.06 1/4
a share in August.

IT'S TIME FOR MICROSOFT TO CHANGE ITS WAYS AND CUT A DEAL

 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the facts in, here is the Microsoft debate:
</P>
<P>
   One side says that if antitrust laws have any meaning, the
conduct described by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must be illegal.
The company used its monopoly in operating systems to force
customers to take its Internet browser. It cut prices on its
monopoly product for computer makers that agreed to buy its other
products.
</P>
<P>
   The other side warns that any remedy chosen by the government
will be either meaningless or so cumbersome that it will deter
innovation and retard progress.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are right, and therein lies the dilemma. It will be
bad if Microsoft is allowed to continue acting as it has, using its
massive clout to buy off or scare away would-be competitors. Doing
anything about it might be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma can be solved only if Microsoft decides to change
its ways voluntarily. The company must recognize that it cannot
compete in the same way that it once did _ and in the same way that
most of its competitors do _ by using every advantage. It must
accept that there are limits that apply to a dominant company that
do not bind lesser rivals. Innovation is fine. Threats and
intimidation are not.
</P>
<P>
   That is difficult because Microsoft is, after all, only 24 years
old. Companies that have previously found themselves in positions
of such dominance _ IBM in 1960s computers or General Motors in
1950s cars, for example _ were run by executives who had joined the
companies when they were successful and powerful. Microsoft is
still run by the first generation of executives, who vividly
remember what it was like to be a scrappy underdog. They know no
other way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft did agree to such a change, it would then have the
difficult task of convincing the Justice Department that the change
was real. Only then could a settlement be negotiated that allowed
for minimal government intrusion on Microsoft's ability to
innovate. The company could give computer makers such as Dell and
Compaq a role in picking the options they want in the Windows
operating system. Microsoft might end up selling systems with
varying features and prices, as Intel does with chips.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, says he wants a settlement,
but his comments at the company's annual meeting showed little
inclination to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, a company that once disdained Washington lobbying,
now embraces it with the fervor of a convert. It seems to hope that
even if it does lose in court, it can get a better deal from a
Republican administration in 2001. Since both Microsoft and its
high-technology foes have plenty of money, this could descend into
a replay of Glass-Steagall. In that fight, the various financial
services interests threw money at politicians for years, producing
legislative stalemate and fat campaign treasuries. Finally, the
various companies cut a deal, and Congress passed a bill.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft goes that route, it will spend its money on
campaign contributions and its management time parrying legal
thrusts. Even if the strategy works, Microsoft could end up in
worse shape than if its executives were able to concentrate on
improving its products and satisfying customers. Investors might
begin to doubt that Microsoft deserves to trade at 60 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the technology will change, and the specifics
being fought over now will be irrelevant. Let's hope someone can
convince Gates that Microsoft's chances of being in the forefront
of whatever comes next will be better if he cuts a deal and moves
on.

 &HT;    CNN gets a stake in another Net firm
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN News Group has enlarged its portfolio of investments in
Internet companies yet again.
</P>
<P>
   The latest investment, announced Thursday, is a $20 million
minority stake in Intervu, a video streaming company.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based company already provides the CNN group and
its various cable TV channels with technology that enables computer
users to watch live TV footage on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing number of CNN.com's users are accessing both live
and on-demand video, and we believe that the demand for Internet
video content will increase dramatically,'' said Bill Burke,
president and chief executive of Time Warner's new Digital Media
unit, which oversees the Internet efforts of all the company's
business, including that of Turner Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Intervu joins a growing list of Internet alliances made by CNN
and its parent, Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting. Other
investments include those in Atlanta-based WebMD, computer magazine
group IDG, PC Quote.com, C2B Technologies and Womenconnect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting executives won't release the total value of
the investments, but its stakes in IDG and Intervu are worth a
total of $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made no secret of its interest in online
ventures. ``The Internet is an extremely huge business opportunity
for us,'' said Terence McGuirk, the company's chairman and chief
executive. ``We plan to develop a great deal more in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   With Intervu, CNN is striking a deal similar to that of its
other Internet investments. CNN will take a minority stake in the
form of stock. Intervu will provide video streaming and other
technologies to the Turner Broadcasting Web sites of CNN, TBS,
CNNfn, CNNSI, Cartoon Network and TNT.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CNN will provide advertising time for Intervu and
promote the company across its various channels for the next three
years. Intervu also gets the right to use CNN video content with
its other corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Intervu and CNN have been working together since 1998. It helped
CNN provide live Internet feeds of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony, Operation Desert Fox in Iraq and former NBA star Michael
Jordan's press conference announcing his retirement.

AT LEAST 14 DIE AS AN APARTMENT BUILDING IN ITALY COLLAPSES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ At least 14 people died early Thursday when a six-story
apartment building collapsed in Foggia, a city in southern Italy.
The toll was expected to rise sharply as rescue workers continued
to dig with shovels and their bare hands in the search for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, officials had identified 17 survivors, but
dozens of people remained unaccounted for. At least 70 people lived
in the building, though it was unclear how many were in it when it
collapsed, soon after 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the survivors were extracted, injured but alive, from
the rubble. A few others, who reported hearing an ominous creaking
in the building just before its collapse, managed to flee.
</P>
<P>
   At least one child, a 10-year-old boy, was among those found
dead. Rescuers were still trying to locate and extract a 6-year-old
boy who was heard crying for water underneath piles of shattered
concrete slabs.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Italy, where shoddy and illegal construction is
widespread, is a region where acts of God are often compounded by
human negligence. Thursday, while hundreds of firefighters and
other rescue workers desperately searched for signs of life, the
country looked for culprits in a tragedy that has yet to be
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Television commentators interviewed local officials and Foggia
residents, who instantly blamed faulty construction and even
abusivismo, ``abusive'' or illegal construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now we have no information about a possible case of
abusivismo,'' said Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who went to
Foggia on Thursday and declared a state of emergency in the city of
150,000 people. ``But in any case, we are fighting abusivismo and
even knocking down houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino, who also traveled to
Foggia, said the local prefect had received no complaints about the
building, which was erected between 1968 and 1971 in a
working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of the city. She said
she had reviewed the city permits and thought it unlikely that the
building had been illegally built.
</P>
<P>
   One of the building's still-missing residents was the man who
constructed it, Antonio Delli Carri.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament held a minute of silence for the victims. Pope John
Paul II sent his condolences. The archbishop of Foggia, Domenico
D'Ambrosio, spoke to survivors at the site and called the
building's collapse a tragedy that had ``brought this city to its
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   The building began to tremble and rock around 3:15 a.m.
Firefighters said that they received a telephone call from someone
in the building about five minutes before it collapsed, but that
they arrived at the scene too late.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of one family fled the building when they heard
suspicious sounds. Once outside, they said, they rang apartment
buzzers to try to warn sleeping residents.
</P>
<P>
   The building's superintendent, Luigi Laconta, 50, said he was
awakened around 3 a.m. by a resident who reported creaking noises.
They left the building, and he also rang buzzers to alert people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I took a step back, thinking I would see someone
stick their head out of the window,'' Laconta told reporters,
``Instead, I saw the entire building crumple in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncle of a year-old boy who lived in the building said he
had found his nephew trapped under the smoking ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon I saw his little hand in the rubble, I started
digging,'' Nicola Crincoli told the Italian news agency ANSA. ``I
heard cries, and I screamed, and threw myself on the rubble and
started digging with my bare hands.'' The child was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse may be one of the worst accidents of its kind in
Italy in the last 20 years. Last December, 27 people died when a
five-story apartment building in Rome collapsed; investigators
later concluded that the cause was structural failure.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliest incident took place near Foggia 40 years ago.
Sixty people died when an apartment building in Barletta collapsed
after new floors were added illegally.

HARVARD AGING SPECIALIST RESIGNS AMID ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A nationally known Harvard aging specialist has
resigned from two top administrative posts, days after the
university raised concerns about one of her grants to US officials
and months after a US suit alleging misuse of research funds
against her and a Boston teaching hospital was settled for
$920,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeanne Y. Wei, 50, remains an associate professor at Harvard
Medical School and retains her medical and research appointments at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, but she resigned as head of
Harvard's division of aging and BIDMC's division of gerontology as
of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Harvard and BIDMC declined to comment on what
spurred the resignation, and whether it was related to the US civil
suit that was settled in April, after the hospital paid $920,000 to
reimburse the US government. They also declined to comment on
whether there have been further investigations into other federal
research grants under Wei's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the National Institute on Aging said
Wednesday that Harvard University contacted agency officials within
the last week, telling them ``it has reason to examine a particular
grant'' on which Wei is the lead researcher _ a ``Mentored Clinical
Scientist Development Award,'' a five-year grant amounting to
$416,000 in fiscal 1999. She had no further details.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the investigation said some of the funds
from the grant, designed to train scientists and provide research
support, had been used for other research purposes, and not
according to grant terms. ``That's what's been going on here,''
said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``In some
ways, when people make mistakes, this is the kind of mistake they
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Wei, a member of the National Institute on Aging's advisory
council and once featured in Boston Magazine as one of the city's
top geriatrics specialists, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Her interests include the biology of aging and heart disease,
and she is known as an advocate for the elderly being able to live
independently. State medical board records show that she is
board-certified in cardiovascular disease, geriatric medicine, and
internal medicine and that she has published 150 articles and 50
books or chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Other geriatricians and researchers familiar with Wei and her
work expressed surprise this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within geriatric academic medicine, Jeanne Wei has never been
anything other than a leader who has been admired and respected,''
said Dr. Eric J. Hardt, clinical director of geriatric services at
Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not know why she resigned, Hardt said: ``It would
surprise all of us to find that she actively supported anything
that didn't meet federal standards. Things are so complex and
bureaucratized and legalized and fiscalized in medicine in these
times, we're all capable of missing some of these details.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital and who has worked most
closely with Wei on the National Institute on Aging's advisory
council, said: ``I've always thought highly of her. I thought she
was doing a good job as an administrator for (Harvard's) division
on aging. She served very effectively on the . . . council.''
</P>
<P>
   The US District Court lawsuit that named both BIDMC and Wei as
defendants was initially brought under a federal whistle-blower
provision by a former hospital researcher who alleged that another
scientist under Wei's supervision did not do the research as
required by the terms of the grant. After an initial investigation,
the federal government intervened and settled with BIDMC.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement, the grant terms were violated when
the scientist under Wei's supervision, Dr. Jan Gossen, moved back
to Holland and the hospital continued to receive and reapply for
funds in his name and used some of the money for other research
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Evan Slavitt, who represented Michael Boerrigter, the
researcher who first brought the lawsuit, said Wei was named as a
defendant because ``she knew Gossen was in Holland and she knew he
was not working as principal investigator. Whether she put it in
the envelope or not, she was sort of the responsible corporate
official for the whole deal. . . . I believed she did it or caused
it to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Boerrigter received about $156,000 of
the $920,000, as allowed under the federal False Claims Act,
according to Slavitt, a partner with Gadsby &AMP; Hannah in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But BIDMC spokesman Bill Schaller said Wei was named a defendant
``based on her role as division chief. By the fact of her title
alone, it made her part of the suit, but indeed it was . . . Jan
Gossen who was drawn into question.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement, BIDMC rebutted the allegations, but
agreed to maintain a compliance program to prevent fraud, false
statements, or misuse of federal research funds.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School administers four National Institutes of
Health grants for Wei as principal investigator, totaling $2.3
million this year, according to Don L. Gibbons, associate dean for
the school's office of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The medical center administers two federally funded grants for
Wei as principal investigator, totaling about $800,000 this year,
according to Schaller, director of media relations for BIDMC.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, she has headed Harvard's division of aging, which
brings together people from multiple disciplines. Dr. David
Calkins, recently recruited to the medical school as associate dean
for academic programs, was named the acting head of the division as
of Thursday, according to Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas T. Perls, director of the well-known New England
Centenarian Study, is serving as BIDMC's acting chief of the
division of gerontology at BIDMC, while a search for a permanent
replacement is conducted, according to Schaller.

`ANYWHERE BUT HERE' JUST `CLICKS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to put your finger on exactly why Wayne Wang's new
film, ``Anywhere But Here,'' works so well _ so much better, in
fact, than most of the other bittersweet family relationship dramas
of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly its strength comes from Mona Simpson's original novel,
whose story about a mismatched mother and teenage daughter who
rashly move from Middle America to the bad side of Beverly Hills,
attracted teams of filmmakers _ and endless scripts _ for more than
a decade before it was finally licked.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be due to the delicate script by two-time Oscar-winner
Alvin Sargent (``Julia,'' ``Ordinary People''), which steadfastly
avoids all the cliche moments of the genre, never stumbles into
even a single false beat and gives us dialogue that's consistently
literate, revealing and witty.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may work off its inspired casting. As the 40ish mother
seeking a more romantic life, Susan Sarandon has never been more
outrageously appealing. As her more traumatized and
practical-minded 14-year-old daughter, Natalie Portman is simply
exquisite _ my choice as the year's best performance to date by a
young actress. Together, they're as believable as your Aunt Sally
and Cousin Bess.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be simply the result of the steady hand and endless
good taste of director Wang, who has previously shown an affinity
for this kind of material in his movies about Asian-American
families in crisis (``Dim Sum,'' ``The Joy Luck Club''). He makes
us feel the jeopardy involved in the characters' daring move West,
and completely understand why they're so attracted _ and repelled _
by one another.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more likely, it's a combination of all these factors. But
whatever the reason, this movie just ``clicks.'' It brings us
intimately into the character's world, takes us on a journey of
discovery with them, and gives us an authentic emotional
experience. In a fall movie season filled with manipulative and
overwrought dramas, this one rings as true as Texas, and is well
worth your time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere But Here. Directed by Wayne Wang. Screenplay by Alvin
Sargent. Cast: Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman. Fox 2000 Pictures.
113 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references.

VOTERS UNHAPPY WITH GOP BUT NOT BUSH, POLL SHOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an election year looming, voters are
increasingly unhappy with the Republican Party but not its leading
presidential candidate, according to a new poll that predicts a
struggle for control of the White House and Congress in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released Friday by the Pew Center for the People and
Press, surveyed more than 5,000 adults for their views on political
parties, presidential candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
   It found that voters are no longer motivated by anger at the
government and the desire for change that spurred the Republican
takeover of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the survey found voters less cynical and more
supportive of government efforts, such as the need to regulate
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moderation is back,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said the moderating trend is evident among all but the
most conservative Republicans and is helping give congressional
Democrats an edge heading into the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lead Republicans by eight points when voters are asked
whether they would vote for a Republican or Democrat for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that the Democratic Party now has its biggest
advantage over Republicans in at least a decade. Five years ago the
party affiliation was close to parity, with 32 percent of voters
calling themselves Democrat and 30 percent Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Republican affiliation had fallen to 27 percent
while Democratic identification had grown to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Republican-leaning voters has been particularly
severe among those younger than 30 who were turned off by the Newt
Gingrich-led revolution in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, voters older than 65, once the most solid of Democratic
voters, are increasingly leaning Republican, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continue to hold big leads among other traditional
supporters, including women, blacks, Hispanics and Jews, the poll
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The public also believed the next president should focus on
issues on which Democrats are perceived as stronger: education,
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   However, the poll did not contain all good news for the
Democrats. The movement away from the GOP has not translated into
support for the Democrat's top presidential contender Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   GOP front-runner George W. Bush is well-regarded by all but the
most faithful Democrats, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that voters see Bush as a stronger leader who has
newer ideas and a more likeable personality than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said Gore has been hurt by his association with President
Clinton, particularly last year's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hangover from the scandal is clearly hurting Gore,'' said
Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that Gore is not doing well among
independent voters who are key in determining national elections
and who largely supported Clinton in his two White House races.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more troubling for the vice president, Kohut said,
is the softness of support among socially conservative Democrats,
the largely working-class and Catholic voters who helped Ronald
Reagan win the White House in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohut predicted the race will be close because many
Democrats who are now saying favorable things about Bush to
pollsters will in the end remain party loyalists and vote for the
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that early polls do not always predict success, Kohut
said that eight years ago, 70 percent of those surveyed believed
that President Bush would be re-elected. He wasn't. This year's
poll found almost the exact percentage saying that his son will win
the White House next year.

 &HT;    Bosnian student shares war memories with class
 &HT;    By Scott Elliott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Before war broke out in Bosnia, Nerina Corbadzic
was like many 9-year-olds, enjoying carefree hours playing with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   That life was shattered in 1991 when ethnic fighting forced her
family to flee Sarajevo for the countryside, where she spent six
years living in fear and constantly moving in search of food,
shelter and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand why someone wanted to kill me, my brother
and my friends just because we were Bosnian,'' the now 17-year-old
told students at Chaminade-Julienne High School on Tuesday. ``I
cried every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbadzic is one of 12 students from an arts and music high
school in Bosnia-Herzegovina visiting Dayton this week to
participate in activities commemorating the 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords, which helped bring an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Chaminade-Julienne art teacher Janet Lasley has visited Sarajevo
as part of Friendship Force, a group aiming to establish
relationships between that city and Dayton. She helped arrange the
cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian students will participate in a program at the Dayton
Art Institute to share their art, dance and music, culminating with
a concert at the institute at 3:30 p.m. today in the Renaissance
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Corbadzic is staying with Chaminade-Julienne sophomore Kim
Wolf's family in Centerville and has attended classes at the school
this week, speaking to students about the evils of racism and war.
In Bosnia, the war has ended but much hatred remains, Corbadzic
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate anybody _ it doesn't matter what nation, religion
or color,'' she said. ``It doesn't matter what they did to you. I
learned to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbadzic said she remembers hearing that the war was over after
the Dayton peace talks, but the fighting did not stop. The two
years after the accords were reached were among the worst times,
she said. Now, Corbadzic is back living in Sarajevo, this time
alone in an apartment while she attends school. She plans to go to
college next year in Spain to study art.
</P>
<P>
   As Corbadzic took questions, the Chaminade-Julienne students
learned she was a fan of American television shows and an avid MTV
watcher. She shared a taste for hip-hop, rock n' roll and soul
music.
</P>
<P>
   When one student asked what she found most different about the
United States, Corbadzic said attitudes toward smoking. Many more
people, especially young people, smoke in Bosnia, she said.

 GORE'S 4th COMMERCIAL FOCUSES ON CHILD HEALTH CARE  
 (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second commercial is the fourth from Vice President Al
Gore. It discusses health care for children and is being broadcast
in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Century-Media.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Gore, who is being interviewed by his aides, is
in shirtsleeves and a knotted tie, addressing the camera directly.
The scenes then shift to shots of various children, including a
child with a doctor and the words ``Affordable high-quality health
care'' across the screen. The commercial closes with a homey scene
of a family on a couch with a child and a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``I think it's just unconscionable at a time when we
have the strongest economy in history, we're the wealthiest nation
on earth, to have millions and millions of children who have no
health-care coverage at all. We ought to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we ought to start by making a commitment to have
affordable high-quality health care for every child in America
before the end of the next president's term. And we can do that
within a balanced budget. Then we can go down the road toward
coverage for every single American.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Like Gore's previous commercials, this one makes
almost no factual claims. There are about 44 million Americans
without health insurance, 11 million of whom are children.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Gore's health-care proposal is under stinging attack
from former Sen. Bill Bradley, his only rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, as unambitious and incremental. The
commercial gives the impression of the opposite _ that Gore wants a
sweeping proposal that would lead to coverage for everyone _ and
the Bradley campaign took Gore to task for virtually lifting its
language.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp also noted that 11 million uninsured children
is 7 million more than in 1993 and blamed the Clinton-Gore
administration. In this commercial, Gore emphasizes his camp's view
that his plan is more practical and realistic and would not wreck
the budget, as he contends Bradley's would.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers wanted reporters to know that Gore was not
speaking from a script but chatting about his concerns over a
two-hour period during a recent visit to his home in Carthage,
Tenn. The Gore campaign is trying to fight the impression that Gore
is overly scripted, and the commercial, with its conversational
style, soft piano music and images of children, is intended to
humanize him as well as speak to the issue of health care.

pay for one game each by the NBA for their fight during the Lakers'
89-88 win Wednesday night at Compaq Center. O'Neal was hit with a
$10,000 fine, and Barkley was fined $5,000. O'Neal received the
greater fine for throwing the first punch and getting involved in a
fight. Barkley was fined for throwing the basketball and fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley did not attend Thursday's practice or join the Rockets
on their flight for tonight's rematch in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I expected it,'' Barkley said Thursday. ``It's no
big deal. I look forward to Saturday (when the Rockets play at
Golden State).
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I felt like he's the instigator. He swung at me. He
pushed me. It's no big deal. Hopefully it's over with. It's over.
Once the game is over, it's always over.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he was unconcerned with O'Neal's claim that Barkley
did not want to play Wednesday and schemed to get them both thrown
out of the game, a contention Barkley said does not make sense with
O'Neal instigating the fight.
</P>
<P>
   But having lifted and slammed the 7-1, 330-pound O'Neal to the
court, the 6-6, 250-pound Barkley said he was impressed when he saw
the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hold my own,'' he said. ``I'm all right. You just have
to be a man, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape did not reveal any Rockets player leaving the bench
area to join the fight. In announcing the fines and suspensions,
NBA senior vice president of basketball operations Rod Thorn termed
the matter closed.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that decision behind them, it is uncertain whether the
Rockets will return from their California back-to-back with their
first win. The trade-off would seem to hit both teams hard. But
perhaps no player changes the Rockets' defensive schemes as does
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage is most likely Shaq won't be there,'' Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``He's a big focal point of their
deal. (With O'Neal out) we're not double-teaming down on the post,
except on (Glen) Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Olajuwon said that in Wednesday's game O'Neal's absence
should have changed the Rockets' offensive strategy as much as it
did their defensive schemes. Defended by John Salley, more noted in
recent seasons as a halftime analyst than a low-post defender,
Olajuwon said the Rockets should have ``pounded the ball inside''
and should tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was 5-of-18, most of those shots were jump
shots,'' Olajuwon said. ``They weren't shots in the paint. It is to
our advantage with Shaq out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt uncomfortable setting the pick outside when I know I
should be inside the paint, pounding the ball inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich said the Rockets did look to Olajuwon. On two
possessions late, they failed to get him the ball. With Salley
fronting Olajuwon, Cuttino Mobley's entry pass was intercepted. In
the last minute, Mobley was unable to get a pass to Olajuwon and
called time out with 5.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets changed the strategy to give the ball to Steve
Francis. But Tomjanovich said Olajuwon had plenty of opportunities
inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most we've run plays for a player,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``That's the most shots a player has gotten this year.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the details of strategy or performance, the Rockets'
greatest problem might be that they remain winless, making that
first victory progressively more difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, we just have to find a way to do it,'' forward Carlos
Rogers said. ``We just have to bear down because there is no excuse
for us to lose that game. We lost one I thought we should have won.
But I think we have more folks to go to battle with than LA. We
have two games we can go out and win and win big if we just do what
we're supposed to. If we just do what we're supposed to, I think
we'll win these on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said the Rockets remained upbeat under the
circumstances. He has said since the preseason the Rockets would
have to handle adversity in the first month, though he never
mentioned anything about 0-5.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis said even if the Rockets were down, he could set a
tone tonight to get them past the winless blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is mentally down like they're going to
die,'' Francis said. ``Everybody's angry. There is going to come a
time when the Houston Rockets are going to win some games. It's not
like we're all mentally down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys on this team that have a lot of high spirits.
It's going to be hard to bring our spirit down. I'm pretty sure
we'll come out with confidence. If your point guard comes out with
confidence, I'm pretty sure the whole team will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Tomjanovich can still point to different, costly little
things after each loss, he and his players said it might be the one
big thing that will put the rest right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we just have to get over the hump,'' forward Walt
Williams said. ``I think guys feel the frustration of losing. I
don't have any answers. We just have to get a win. We have to get a
win.''

 &HT;    Engineers Club leaders optimistic about dwindling rolls, rising
debt
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The venerable Engineers Club of Dayton,
co-founded by Charles F. Kettering and Col. Edward A. Deeds 85
years ago, has hit such hard financial times in recent months that
the staff's uniforms were collected for late payment of rental fees
and the club nearly had to negotiate a payment plan to keep from
having its utilities shut off.
</P>
<P>
   But President Wade Adams said Thursday he's optimistic a
mandatory assessment of all dues-paying members and an aggressive
membership drive will replenish a depleted cash reserve, allow the
club to restore some cuts in staff and services, and pull the club
out of its ``emergency funding crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a member organization, and we live together or we die
together,'' Adams said. ``We have fun together and we can go out of
business together _ and that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to all members dated Nov. 1, Adams said the club
needed $20,000 ``immediately,'' and announced the assessment,
payable in a lump sum or over three months. The assessment is 25
percent of dues, which are $480 a year for most members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The membership is supporting it superbly,'' Adams said.
Because some members gave more than required, he said the club
could double its $20,000 goal and has ``paid all our slightly
overdue bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The club was founded in 1914 by NCR President Deeds and Dayton
inventor Kettering, its first and second presidents. Orville Wright
was an early member and the group's fourth president. Deeds and
Kettering personally paid the $350,000 construction cost of the
posh clubhouse, which opened in 1918. Kettering's body lay in state
in the club upon his death in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The club's mission is to contribute to education, especially in
engineering and the sciences, and to provide a setting where
professionals can network to enhance their professional success and
solve community problems.
</P>
<P>
   Like other social clubs, the Engineers Club _ which is open to
all professionals, not just engineers _ has been suffering from
dwindling membership for years, Adams said. He blames busy
lifestyles and the ``suburbanization'' of the region for the
stagnant rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The club has 630 members, down from a 1,000-1,200 peak about
four decades ago, but only 480 of them pay dues. The rest are
widows of members, honorary members and fellows or members over the
age of 85, who don't have to pay dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our demographics have also suffered _ we don't have very many
younger members,'' Adams said. ``Our average age has been
approaching age 70.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign to add 199 members in 1999, launched this summer, has
resulted in 70 new members so far, he said. He's hopeful the goal
will be met.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, club officials laid off nearly half the
staff and cut services to reduce the club's budget deficit from
$98,000 in 1998 to $32,000 in the fiscal year ending in May 1999,
according to Adams. But the deficit spending wiped out the club's
cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   With the riverfront development project under construction and
the baseball stadium also nearby, the Engineers Club is poised for
success, Adams said. A new full-time manager, William Selkirk,
started work Monday, and the club dining room has a new chef, Doug
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' daughter, Keri, who at 27 is one of only a handful of
under-30 club members, said ``it would be tragic for Dayton'' if
the club failed. ``It needs to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father agreed. ``This is the only place in Dayton that
contains so much of our past and so much of our future.''

 &HT;    Staffing at issue with GM, union
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORAINE, Ohio _ Union leaders at the General Motors Corp. truck
plant here fear up to 1,100 workers could be laid off if union
members vote to end the current staffing system at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, leaders of International Union of Electronic Workers
Local 798 met with GM Vice President Guy Briggs and Manufacturing
Manager Frank Palopoli to pledge support for the three-crew,
two-shift system. The union leaders also sought promises from the
company that it would work harder to address employee concerns,
according to a handbill signed by Daniel Poffenberger, chairman of
Local 798.
</P>
<P>
   The union's shop committee also discussed with Briggs and
Palopoli the possibility of the Moraine plant producing a new
proposed vehicle known as GMT370. GM spokesman Dan Flores declined
to discuss details about the product, but renovations now under way
at the plant leave room for more production.
</P>
<P>
   The Moraine plant employs 3,834 unionized and 298 salaried,
nonunion workers. The plant produced the four-door versions of the
Chevrolet Blazer, GMC Jimmy and Oldsmobile Bravada sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In the handbill, Local 798 Shop Chairman Daniel Poffenberger
warned employees that the company is serious about retaining the
staffing system and that GM could shift sport utility vehicle
production to Oklahoma City, Okla., if the union does not
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   In September, members of Local 798 rejected a local contract
proposal that included continuation of the three-crew, two-shift
system.
</P>
<P>
   It is controversial with workers because the 1,100 employees on
the third crew switch between day and night shifts, allowing
20-hour production six days a week without the need to pay overtime
for the sixth day. Some union members would prefer that the company
switch to a three-crew, three-shift system, but company officials
say that would cost too much and make the plant uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is in the midst of a $355 million renovation, paving
the way for 2001 production of the next generation of mid-sized
SUVs. At the same time, a feasibility study is underway to
determine if an Oklahoma City car plant should be converted to
truck production, which union officials fear could include
production of the next-generation SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Flores emphasized that Moraine remains the lead plant for the
new SUVs. He pointed to the company's heavy investment in
renovations as proof that there is no plan to move that production
elsewhere. But he also said GM needs a local agreement with the
union to replace the pact expiring in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Moraine to run at full capacity when they're producing the
new products, it is absolutely crucial that the plant's work force
ratify a local labor agreement which continues the three-crew,
two-shift operation,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Without that agreement, he said there is a ``likely
possibility'' that an undetermined number of the third-crew workers
would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the United Auto Workers local at the Oklahoma plant
is negotiating a local agreement there that will determine if that
plant can competitively produce trucks. Flores refused to confirm
that the GM board of directors will consider a truck group proposal
on Dec. 6 to convert the Oklahoma City plant.
</P>
<P>
   He also would not comment on Poffenberger's statement that the
company would work with the shop committee on employee concerns
about working conditions and low morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give management a shot at changing,'' wrote
Poffenberger. ``We will be ready to move on if they start treating
us with respect and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores said GM is committed to reaching a local agreement that
addresses worker concerns and makes the plant more competitive.

 &HT;    Dell ends streak of record quarterly profits
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. said Thursday it earned $483
million in its fiscal third quarter, matching Wall Street's
diminished expectations of 18 cents per share that resulted from
sharp spikes in prices for memory chips in the final weeks of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Including a $194 million charge for the September purchase of a
Silicon Valley data-storage company, ConvergeNet Technologies Inc.,
Dell's profits were $289 million or 11 cents a share on record
sales of nearly $6.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With the charge, Dell ended its streak of record quarterly
profits that goes back at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares closed up $2 at $43.43 3/4 in Nasdaq trading, their
highest level since Oct. 14. The results were reported after
markets closed.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 29 was $6.78 billion, up 41
percent, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of record sales.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare event for the world's most profitable big PC maker,
Dell executives warned investors last month that an unforeseen
spike in random-access memory prices would hurt profit.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed effects of earthquakes in Taiwan that damaged
chip factories in late September. The giant quakes helped push
memory prices up by 25 percent in October. That came on increases
of more than 200 percent earlier this year, according to Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the price increases are behind us,'' Dell Vice
Chairman Mort Topfer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spike in memory came at the end of the quarter,'' said
William Milton of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ``They were
not able to offset it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, the fastest-growing major PC maker, said it added about
4,000 jobs in the quarter, bringing its worldwide total to 33,200.
More than half the new hires were for manufacturing plants in
Ireland and Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been hiring in Brazil, where it opened it
newest factory last week. Dell officials expect the Brazil
operation to start adding to its profits in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil ``is is a really big opportunity for us,'' Topfer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said its overall PC shipments grew 59 percent in the third
quarter, more than twice the rate for the industry. Servers,
workstations and storage systems shipments grew by 72 percent and
made up 17 percent of Dell's revenue, up from 14 percent a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can exceed 20 percent in the next year or two,
which helps us keep average revenue per unit pretty stable,''
Topfer said.
</P>
<P>
   PC makers count on the more profitable enterprise products --
uch as servers and storage systems, to offset thin or non-existent
margins on desktops, which make up the bulk of sales for the
industry. Average desktop prices have been under pressure since the
advent of sub-$1,000 PCs about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's average price fell 11 percent or $100 from a year ago to
$2,100, still well above the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Notebook sales grew 55 percent despite a shortage of
liquid-crystal display screens that affected all PC makers. Like
enterprise products, notebooks bring higher profits and their sales
grew to 24 percent of total revenue vs. 22 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a significant improvement in the availability of
flat-panel screens than we were two months ago,'' Chief Executive
Michael Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Lou Mazzucchelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York
said the quarter was another consistent performance by Dell. But he
said Compaq Computer Corp.'s new Web PC, announced Wednesday, may
pose a problem for Dell beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at the commercial market, Compaq's iPaq starts at $499 for
a 500 megahertz Celeron processor and 64 megabytes of memory. Dell,
which has taken large accounts from Compaq this year as it became
the No. 1 PC vendor in the United States, is targeting consumers
with its own Web PC, expected to be unveiled late this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see a change on the competitive landscape,''
Mazzucchelli said. ``Maybe Dell will have to do a quick response.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is growing twice as fast as the industry in Europe,
Dell's business there is still below expectations. Revenue
increased 22 percent over the year-ago period in Europe, the
world's second-biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   Topfer said he expects higher growth rates as the economies in
Europe improve.

U.N. TRIBUNAL WRONG TO FREE TOP SUSPECT, RWANDA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The decision of a U.N. tribunal to drop its
case against a former official in Rwanda accused of helping to
organize the 1994 genocide there has angered the Rwandan government
and threatens to unravel efforts to bring the most prominent
suspects to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Rwanda condemns this decision in the
strongest possible terms,'' Joseph W. Mutaboba, the Rwandan
representative to the United Nations, said Thursday at a news
conference, where he described the former foreign ministry
official, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, as the ``No. 1'' criminal wanted
for fomenting genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Mutaboba described the court, the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda, as negligent in its duties. Until the tribunal
apologizes for dismissing the case last week and reverses its
decision, he said, Rwanda is suspending cooperation on other cases,
a move that could bring new prosecutions to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Barayagwiza, 49, led the Coalition for the Defense of the
Republic, a Hutu political party that espoused hatred of the
country's Tutsi minority. He also helped start Radio Television
Libres des Milles Collines, a radio station that incited the
country's Hutu majority to kill Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-million Rwandans, mostly Tutsi, were slaughtered
by Hutu militia groups and mobs in 1994, according to most
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3 the tribunal's appeals court ordered Barayagwiza's
release, saying his fundamental rights had been violated by
prolonged detention without trial.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the tribunal prosecutor had failed to
inform Barayagwiza of the charges against him and had not
transferred him promptly enough from prison in Cameroon, where he
was arrested on March 27, 1996, and detained 19 months before being
delivered to the tribunal, in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Barayagwiza was accused of genocide, incitement of genocide and
crimes against humanity. Mutaboba described him as ``one of the
architects'' of the bloody campaign to exterminate Rwanda's Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardship he allegedly suffered in Cameroon jails is
negligible compared to the suffering his victims endured,''
Mutaboba said.
</P>
<P>
   He took pains to deny a permanent rupture with the tribunal.
``We have not burned any bridges between us and the United Nations
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the dismissal of the case created ``a terrible
precedent'' that other accused Rwandans could use to have their
cases dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, who at the time was Louise Arbour of Canada, is
responsible for compiling cases against suspects in Rwanda and in
the former Yugoslav republics. Mrs. Arbour quit on Sept. 15 to take
a seat on Canada's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Del Ponte, a Swiss jurist who succeeded Mrs. Arbour, has
said she takes the criticism seriously and will visit Rwanda later
this month. But Mutaboba said it would be pointless for her to go
to Rwanda before his government receives a written explanation and
apology from the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ordered that Barayagwiza be returned to
Cameroon. Barayagwiza, who remains in custody in Tanzania, has
asked to choose his destination, saying he has no legal status,
resources or family in Cameroon. Cameroon turned down an earlier
request to extradite him to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Mutaboba called on the tribunal to give its file on Barayagwiza
to the Rwandan government, which would try his case. ``If this
tribunal doesn't have the courage to do it,'' he said, ``we shall
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, an estimated 125,000 detainees have been awaiting
trial for their possible roles in the genocide, some for five
years.

NARCOTERRORISM FEARED IN DEADLY CAR BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ In an attack that revived nightmare memories
of the Medellin cartel's terror campaign a decade ago, a car bomb
exploded Thursday in an upscale neighborhood here, killing at least
seven people and injuring 51, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial suspicion fell on the country's major drug smugglers,
reeling with the Supreme Court's order this week to extradite two
accused traffickers. Hours after the bombing, President Andres
Pastrana's government signed the papers for the country's first
extraditions to the United States since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have any proof that it was narcoterrorism, but
the certain thing is that the Colombian society isn't going to be
intimidated by violent acts,'' Mayor Enrique Penalosa said from the
bomb site shortly after the explosion. Authorities offered a
$250,000 reward for information into the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bomb _ packed with more than 170 pounds of
explosives _ exploded in a red Mazda truck at 10:15 a.m., killing
and injuring passersby and shattering windows throughout the
neighborhood of Pepe Sierra, a district of apartment buildings,
restaurants, shops, and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The attack stunned the capital, which had been targeted in a
bombing, assassination, and kidnapping campaign led by Medellin
cartel leader Pablo Escobar during the 1980s and early 1990s.
Escobar died from police gunfire in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Since Escobar's death, the capital has been rife with street
crime but largely insulated from the years of rural-based
guerrilla- and paramilitary-related violence. The campaigns have
been so deadly and disruptive to the nation's struggling democracy
that several US political leaders have pushed for billions of
dollars in US military and humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the shattered glass of nearby stores, onlookers feared the
blast was the start of another campaign of so-called
narcoterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps there won't be another bomb here, but maybe in
(upscale shopping mall) Hacienda Santa Barbara or maybe in the
Unicentro Mall,'' said Marco Aurelio Castro, a tailor who had been
shortening a pair of blue jeans at his sewing machine when the bomb
exploded across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt as if I'd been hit hard in the chest, and then the
whole window caved in on top of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying on the floor, he thought that guerrillas or traffickers
had to be behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical,'' he said. ``It's always one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign in the early 1990s came because Escobar and
his colleagues in the Colombian narcotrafficking underworld sought
to pressure the government to change a law that permitted the
extradition of suspects for trial overseas.
</P>
<P>
   They were particularly doubtful of their chances in the hands of
US justice and even developed a motto for their deadly campaign:
Better a grave in Colombia than a jail in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves The Extraditables, killing politicians
and security officials and kidnapping members of the small,
aristocratic political class. They destroyed the El Espectador
newspaper office and downed an Avianca flight from Bogota to Cali,
killing all 107 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Caving into the violence, the Colombian government dropped the
extradition law from its 1991 constitution. But following pressure
from the United States, the Colombian Congress reinstated the law
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the country's highest court approved the
extradition of Fernando Jose Flores and Jaime Orlando Lara, who are
both wanted in the United States for alleged drug smuggling.
Justice Minister Romulo Gonzalez, whose signature is required to
send Colombian defendants overseas, said Thursday that if the
drug-trafficking community turns out to be responsible for the
crime, the government will keep the word of the President of the
Republic to extradite all the narcotraffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez was hesitant to lay the blame at the feet of the
narcotraffickers so quickly. ``At this moment we can't accuse
narcoterrorism because people in Colombia take advantage of many
circumstances to commit violent acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the US Embassy in Bogota said several dozen
suspects currently in Colombian prisons could be extradited to the
United States. Among them: Fabio Ochoa, one of the Medellin cartel
founders, who was arrested last month along in an international
string dubbed Operation Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of extraditions from Colombia, the world's leading
exporter of cocaine and a growing source of heroin, has been an
issue of contention between the two countries, said US officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, police tape cordoned several blocks of the
normally bustling neighborhood, and the prevailing sound resembled
the tinkling of dozens of giant windchimes _ glass being chipped
from windows throughout the neighborhood and swept into piles.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was plucking sharp twists of metal from the glass that
covered the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're from the car,'' she insisted. ``Evidence.''

MICROSOFT AND TANDY IN INTERNET AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. Thursday announced a strategic agreement with
Tandy Corp. to spotlight Microsoft's Internet products and services
within Tandy's Radio Shack stores.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Microsoft will make an equity investment of
$100 million in RadioShack.com, Tandy's recently started online
store. Links to the online store will have premier placement across
all of MSN, Microsoft's Internet service, including eShop, MSN's
online shopping service. Tandy will create a Microsoft
``store-within-a-store'' in each of its 7,000 retail outlets.
Microsoft will provide money for fixtures, PCs and the design of
the in-store boutique areas, which are expected to be completed
late next year.
</P>
<P>
   The boutiques will feature Microsoft products and services,
including MSN Internet Access, WebTV, Windows CE-based hand-held
devices, MSN mobile solutions and Microsoft home networking. Radio
Shack salespeople will sign up customers for MSN Internet service,
including a version of MSN co-branded with Radio Shack, and will
offer installation. Radio Shack will earn an undisclosed portion of
Microsoft's revenues from the Internet customers it signs up.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement dispels rumors that Tandy was planning a similar
agreement with America Online, &UR;  &LR; under which the online service
would be Radio Shack's preferred Internet service provider, or ISP.
Although Radio Shack stores feature personal computers made by
Compaq Computer Corp. that come loaded with AOL software, customers
will not be aided in subscribing to AOL, but they will be
encouraged to sign up with MSN, said Leonard Roberts, Tandy's
chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic model with Microsoft definitely won out,''
Roberts said in a telephone interview. ``While we went looking for
an ISP partner, what we needed was a total connectivity partner.
The logical and only choice was Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares closed at $89.625, up $2.50, in Nasdaq trading;
Tandy shares gained $6.25, or 9.59 percent, to close at $71.4375 on
the New York Stock Exchange. America Online shares slid $2.75, to
close at $143.25, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal was a win-win that would help Microsoft
spread its Internet business to a mass market. At the same time,
they said it would establish Radio Shack's credentials as an online
services provider, much the way its partnership with Sprint helped
make it a powerhouse in cellular phones, where it claims 70 percent
of retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resurgent Tandy has done a beautiful job with the
store-within-a-store concept for Sprint and Compaq, and I think
Microsoft recognized that,'' said Seymour Merrin, president of
Merrin Information Services. ``It's really a unique entity, Radio
Shack, and this sort of thing will play very well there. This
should be a win-win, and the customer can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Tandy have actually had a close relationship
dating to the early days of the personal computer, when the
then-fledgling software company provided a version of the basic
programming language for the TRS-80, an early PC. Microsoft also
created the simple operating system and applications for the Radio
Shack Model 100, a pioneering notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   Waxing a bit nostalgic on a conference call with securities
analysts, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive,
recalled: ``That was one of the last projects where I got to write
the majority of the code myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, said in a telephone
interview that it was Radio Shack's more recent track record that
made the partnership attractive. ``We know Radio Shack well, but we
had to be reminded that Radio Shack is really a unique entity,'' he
said, noting the small size of the stores, and the training the
sales people receive. ``They really work with a partner to tell a
story.''

CELLUCCI MULLS VETO OF ELECTION FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A day after legislative leaders created a loophole in
the voter-approved campaign finance law, Governor Paul Cellucci is
seriously considering vetoing $10 million to fund public elections,
saying he never supported the idea anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers say striking the money for publicly financed elections
will undermine potential candidates' confidence in the new system,
and further weaken the law, which won overwhelming approval at the
ballot last November.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci said Thursday he is looking for areas to trim the
$20.87 billion budget, and the elections money may be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like using public monies to fund political
campaigns,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comment came just hours after lawmakers placed
the budget on his desk Thursday. He plans to announce his vetoes by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like being the guy who says no, but it's my job to
impose fiscal discipline on state government and on the state
legislature,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks represented another potential blow to the new
campaign finance law, which has touched off hostility and anxiety
in the state's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million would be used as seed money to start the fund
for public matching money for the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   This week House Speaker Thomas Finneran and Senate President
Thomas Birmingham, potential gubernatorial candidates now raising
campaign cash, inserted language into the budget weakening the new
law's limits on raising and spending money.
</P>
<P>
   As passed by voters, the law would give public matching funds to
statewide candidates if they agree to cap their fundraising and
spending at specific limits _ $3 million in the case of candidates
for governor, $750,000 for attorney general, and $30,000 for House
candidates, for example. The limits would be in effect throughout
the four-year election cycle for statewide candidates, and two
years for legislative candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham and Finneran rewrote it, allowing candidates to
raise and spend as much money as they want up until the last six
months of an election year. That would especially beneift
incumbents, who could raise millions of dollars in the years and
months leading to the election, scaring away challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he had not seen the details of the change and
would not comment on whether he would veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made any decisions,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   After voters approved the ``Clean Elections'' ballot question by
a 2-1 margin last November, Cellucci, a longtime opponent of
publicly financing campaigns, said he respected the voters' will
and would support providing money for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday Cellucci stopped short of saying he would
definitely veto the $10 million. But his comments showed what aides
say is a strong inclination to veto the funding. And he reiterated
his previous personal opposition to providing public funds for
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also questioned why the money needs to be appropriated
now, when candidates would not begin drawing upon it until 2002. He
also suggested the law could face a constitutional challenge. But
supporters of the law argue the state has to start a regular annual
outlay of public funds, to create confidence in the system and, by
the fourth year of appropriation, generate a $56 million pot of
money for matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who are considering running for office in 2202
will know that the money will be there for them to run,'' said
David Donnelly, executive director of Mass Voters For Clean
Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham and Finneran have argued that their legislative
colleagues need to raise and spend donations regularly, to pay for
district offices, staffing, and other expenses, such as sending out
news letters and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign reform law _ and the sweeping changes it
presents _ has touched off deep anxiety within the state's
political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly also denounced the Birmingham and FInneran rewriting of
the law as ``unconscionable'' and said it would ``open the
floodgates for special interest to dominate elections.'' It was
also sharply criticized by two Democratic lawmakers, Jay Kaufman of
Lexington and Douglas W. Petersen of Marblehead, who cited the
changes to the law as reason they voted against the budget on the
House floor Wednesday. They were the only two House members to vote
no.

 &HT;    McCain enlists veterans for White House `mission'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ John McCain calls on fellow veterans to join him
on ``one more mission'' and the crowd at the local veterans hall
reacts as if it will do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win if we can galvanize these veterans in New Hampshire
and across America,'' McCain said Thursday. The Arizona senator and
celebrated former prisoner of war in Vietnam blitzed the state with
busloads of fellow POWs and Naval Academy classmates on a chilly,
brilliant Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush also has stepped up his appeal to
veterans as the race has tightened in New Hampshire. Both men have
promised to improve health care for veterans and hike the pay of
soldiers, some 12,000 of whom have families that receive food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Wednesday trotted out a dozen or so New Hampshire
veterans who have endorsed him. The next day, McCain released a
list of 500 of his own and said they are the vanguard of 10,000
veterans in the state who have been identified as his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The backing of veterans is more crucial to McCain than to Bush.
The senator's campaign is counting on veterans in the first two
primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, states with the
largest number of veterans per capita, according to campaign aides.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, a decorated World War II veteran, made a similar
appeal in his 1996 campaign but failed to capture a majority of
veterans. McCain's campaign believes Dole did not court veterans
enough.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Veterans Day was chock full of events, including stops
at three Veterans of Foreign Wars chapters, a parade in Nashua and
a nursing home for veterans in Tilton.
</P>
<P>
   He brought with him fellow POWs from Vietnam, a Medal of Honor
winner, a former superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy, academy
classmates and the actress and singer Connie Stevens, who
entertained U.S. troops in Korea and Vietnam in the 1950s and '60s
and delighted crowds Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain admitted to one misstep Thursday on an issue of some
sensitivity to veterans. He acknowledged that filming portions of a
campaign ad in Arlington National Cemetery was a breach of rules
and judgment, and his campaign pulled the ad from the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Even in explaining his mistake, though, McCain emphasized his
military heritage. ``I'm not embarrassed to be seen at a cemetery
where my father and grandfather and a couple of uncles are
buried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This straight talk, as McCain's supporters call it, appears to
win over some of those who may disagree with McCain on some
military issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the senator is strongly identified with the military,
he is no rubber stamp for defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks openly about getting rid of programs such as the
C-130J transport plane, which he said Air Force officials do not
want. The plane is made by Lockheed Martin at its Marietta, Ga.,
plant.
</P>
<P>
   He supports another round of base closings, an especially
ticklish issue for members of Congress because their districts and
states could lose major employers as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial issue, however, was McCain's support in
1995 for restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and his
belief that such ties would aid in the effort to locate and return
the remains of missing servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups howled and relatives of men listed as missing in
action asserted that they had been betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnam issue is the single largest area of disagreement
with him,'' said Mike Schlee, the American Legion's director of
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Even some allies winced when McCain stood by President Clinton,
who prominently avoided military service, when he formally
re-established ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagreed with him on that, but, hell, that's John McCain,''
said Orson Swindle, a former cellmate of McCain's in Hanoi who
campaigned with him Thursday. ``He showed respect for the
institution of the presidency. Is that wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   A band of activists on behalf of MIAs says it is. One Web site
urges readers not to vote for McCain in particularly harsh
language.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hridlicka of Wichita, Kan., goes so far as to call McCain
a traitor who was brainwashed by his captors. Her husband, David,
was an Air Force colonel whose plane was shot down over Laos in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally convinced that he is owned by someone other than
our country,'' Hridlicka said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   David Murray, the New Jersey POW-MIA committee chairman of the
Vietnam Veterans of America, said McCain ``is no friend to family
members of POW-MIAs or the Vietnamese community in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he has talked with like-minded veterans about going
to New Hampshire in January to spread the word on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that is already occurring on some level. One man
who attended a Bush rally in Manchester on Wednesday night said
someone had come to his barber shop and told him McCain talked too
freely to his Vietnamese captors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that he is not liked by some of the
relatives of MIAs. But he said it is increasingly rare that he
hears complaints about his aggressive support for relations with
Vietnam. ``Thousands and thousands of veterans have gone back to
Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several veterans interviewed in New Hampshire on Thursday said
they strongly approved of McCain's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely more cooperation from the Vietnamese now,''
said James McKinnon, vice commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
in New Hampshire. James Chassie of Laconia, a Vietnam veteran,
said, ``It's time to shake hands and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly McCain's story is enough for some veterans. At the
veterans home in Tilton, World War II veteran Carl Jordan pledged
his vote to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, in a wheelchair and using an oxygen tank to help him
breathe, told McCain his own POW story. In 1944, he said, he
escaped from a German POW camp and made his way to Switzerland.
There, he borrowed money from the Swiss Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, the relief organization sent him a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gratitude,'' McCain said.

STAPLES TO SELL 5 PERCENT OF TRACKING STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Staples Inc. has agreed to sell 5 percent of a new ``tracking''
stock that will follow the office supply company's electronic
commerce business to a group of five venture capital and private
investment firms that focus on Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Highland Capital Partners, Greylock Management Corp., Essex
Investment Management, General Atlantic Partners and Summit
Accelerator Partners agreed to buy the position for an undisclosed
sum in the transaction expected to be announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the investment firms will also participate in
a new advisory board Staples created to advise the company on its
Internet efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's an opportunity for bricks and mortar
companies to do dot-com activities and Staples is a great
company,'' said Robert Higgins of Highland Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The private placement was facilitated by Wit Capital Corp., the
online investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock is formed to reflect the fortunes of particular
businesses inside a company, though holders of the shares do not
own any of its underlying assets.
</P>
<P>
   Staples shareholders formally approved the creation of the
tracking stock, called Staples.com, in a vote this week.
</P>
<P>
   The company may sell new Staples.com shares to the public next
year, but can also use the stock to back options for employees and
as a currency to conduct Internet-related acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stock arrangement also makes it easier for Staples
to show investors the financial details of its electronic commerce
business, according to chief financial officer John Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been announced and approved at a time when shares
of Staples and other office supply retailers have been under
pressure. Analysts have worried that smaller competitors would open
many new stores to boost sagging growth and weaken business for all
the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Staples.com operations include the company's electronic commerce
business conducted on three Internet sites: staples.com,
quillcorp.com and stapleslink.com.

ON TRIAL, KOSOVO DOCTOR DENIES SERBIAN CHARGE OF TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia _ The most prominent Kosovo Albanian in Serbian
custody went on trial here Thursday, facing charges of terrorism
and separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Flora Brovina, 50, a physician and founder of the League of
Albanian Women in Kosovo, was arrested last spring during the NATO
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. During Thursday's court
session, she rejected the prosecution's accusations that she
assisted rebels who fought for Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not accept that I was a terrorist against the state,''
she said. ``What was my mistake? That I did not ask the nationality
of the children that I helped? I will help anyone, any time, any
way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   After three hours, the court was adjourned for two weeks to
allow the prosecution to call a witness from the neighboring
province of Montenegro. The trial will resume Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina, who said she had heart problems, appeared pale and
tired. But she spoke for some 30 minutes in her own defense,
pleading to be regarded as a medical professional and not as a
political activist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina, one of about 2,000 ethnic Albanians detained during
Belgrade's yearlong attempt to suppress rebellion in Kosovo, was
arrested April 20 in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, a month after the
start of the NATO campaign. In June, as Yugoslav authorities
withdrew and NATO forces prepared to take control, she and other
prisoners were transferred out of Kosovo to jails elsewhere in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   She has been charged under two articles of the Yugoslav criminal
code, with terrorism and conspiring to perform hostile acts. As
founder of the League of Albanian Women, she was accused of
supporting the separation of Kosovo from Yugoslavia and ``helping
terrorist gangs of the Kosovo Liberation Army.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution says that she organized several political
demonstrations and provided medicine, clothing and other assistance
to the rebels. Prosecutors also said that, as minister of health in
Kosovo's Albanian shadow government, she helped plan terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is in that indictment is not me,'' Dr. Brovina said in
court Thursday. ``The only thing I accept is that I and some
friends formed the League of Albanian Women. It is an independent
organization and is not interested in organizing demonstrations,
separatism or military affairs. It is just like any other women's
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   She also denied that she was health minister in the shadow
government, and said that she was in charge of medical issues for
the women's league.
</P>
<P>
   She explained her efforts to help Kosovo's Albanian women,
saying, ``They are the worst-treated citizens of Yugoslavia and
suffer a poor education, a high birthrate and frequently have to
give birth without medical assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   She denied any involvement with the Kosovo Liberation Army, and
said no one in her family was involved with the rebels or in any
political party. Her husband, Ajri Beku, is an economist and
banker, and her two sons are students, one in Texas. She said she
had demonstrated only in the name of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are anti-war, you cannot be a terrorist,'' she told the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and human rights organizations have voiced
concern about Dr. Brovina's case. This week, U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said he doubted she would receive a fair
trial.
</P>

   ``We want to express our concern over the apparent abuse of the
legal system in this case and others, and condemn Serbia's actions
as a continued demonstration of Serbia's disregard for
international norms of behavior,'' Rubin said.

   Barbara Davis, a representative of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights in Belgrade, was present at the court
session Thursday, and said she had raised the issue recently with
Serbia's health and justice ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Barovic, a Serbian lawyer advising the U.N. commissioner,
said he was not dissatisfied by the court proceedings, but said he
had not seen any evidence so far to support the charges against Dr.
Brovina. The terrorism charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina's lawyer, Zika Zokanovic, a Serb originally from
Kosovo, agreed that the trial was fair but he protested strongly at
the postponement, suggesting it was a delaying tactic of the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic of the Humanitarian Law Center, based in Belgrade
and Pristina, said hundreds of Kosovo Albanians had been tried in
Serbia in recent months, and that most had been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the Serbian authorities decided to organize trials
and keep Albanians in prison because they think it is a
manifestation of Serbian sovereignty,'' she said. ``It is important
for them to show they have power and that Kosovo is part of
Yugoslavia.''

FOOTPRINTS, CHAIN PUT SUSPECT BEHIND WHEEL IN DRAGGING DEATH,
PROSECUTORS SAY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Shortly after three white men began dragging
James Byrd Jr. to his death in the East Texas woods last year, the
chain connecting the black man's ankles to the pickup came undone,
forcing the driver to stop so it could be reattached.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill King and Russell Brewer stepped out of the pickup onto
a rural logging road, they left footprints near the passenger side,
leading investigators to believe that 24-year-old Shawn Berry was
behind the wheel, witnesses testified Thursday in Berry's capital
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors showed the jury of seven women and five men excerpts
from a television interview of Berry, aired on CBS-TV's ``60
Minutes II'' this fall, in which Berry established for the first
time that King had been wearing sandals at the crime scene on June
7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles and investigator Tommy
Robinson then testified that prints from King's sandals and the
tennis shoes worn by the 32-year-old Brewer were found only on the
passenger side of Berry's truck, leaving Berry as the only possible
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``King was on the passenger side,'' Rowles testified, dismissing
several written and verbal statements from Berry contending that
King drove the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Berry is the last of the three white men to be tried in the
slaying of Byrd, 49, who had accepted a ride from the men as he
walked home after a party in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who was drunk, was taken to a clearing in the woods east
of town, beaten, stripped and chained by to the back of Berry's
truck. He was dragged more than two miles before his head slammed
into a concrete culvert, decapitating him.
</P>
<P>
   If Berry is convicted, he would face either a life prison
sentence or join his white supremacist co-defendants on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have always known the sandals, stained with the
victim's blood and found in King's apartment, belonged to King. But
because King, 25, and Berry wear a similar size and had been living
together, there was no hard evidence to show which of the men was
wearing which shoes at the crime scene until Berry told Dan Rather
on national television.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum''
Hawthorn, challenged the prosecutor's theory, questioning Rowles
and Robinson about where the footprints were in relationship to
tire impressions and other evidence they collected. Hawthorn also
asked how far apart they were, which way they were pointed, and
whether the person who made them was walking or standing still.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two footprints,'' Hawthorn said outside the
courtroom later. ``Where they were located, I don't know. What it
means, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jasper County Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy
countered that regardless of the new evidence, he has always
believed Berry was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his truck, his chain, and he's the one that got the man
in the vehicle,'' Hardy said. ``Everything in common sense points
that he was the one (who) was driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if prosecutors don't succeed in proving Berry was behind
the wheel, they hope the footprint evidence will help the jury see
Berry has changed his story repeatedly and his eventual testimony
can't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Berry gave seven statements to police, some of which conflicted.
In his first statement, signed the night after the killing, he
said, ``I had nothing to do with it whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I wanted to believe Shawn Berry,'' Rowles testified
Thursday. ``His uncle and I are good friends. We had worked
together in the Highway Patrol. I felt sorry for this kid.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed, Rowles said, when the evidence began to pile up
against the 24-year-old manager of the local movie theater. As he
was confronted with each new discovery, Berry changed his story to
fit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of believing him, all of a sudden there was a big
question mark (that) went up,'' Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the all-white jury got its first look at more
than a dozen color photographs, including one of Byrd's dismembered
corpse in the middle of Huff Creek Road, near a rural black
cemetery, and another of his head, right shoulder and arm in a
ditch a mile away. Jurors also were shown close-ups of autopsy
photos of Byrd's knees, ankles and elbows, all of which had been
ground to the bone as he struggled to keep his head off the
pavement as he was dragged.
</P>
<P>
   One juror wiped her eyes several times, others bit their lips or
covered their mouths as they looked at the gruesome pictures just
before the morning break.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were not shown to the courtroom audience. Byrd's
parents, siblings and other relatives, who sat in the front row,
have never seen them.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, dressed in a dark gray suit and sporting a clean-shaven
face and a new haircut, sat at the defense table between Hawthorn
and his girlfriend, Christy Marcontell. Marcontell, a former East
Texas beauty queen and the mother of Berry's young son, Montana, is
assisting Hawthorn by serving subpoenas and taking notes during the
trial. The lawyer called her ``invaluable'' to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's biological father, whom he hasn't seen in more than 20
years, also is attending the trial and has hugged the defendant and
spoken to him during breaks. Berry's brother, Louis, and other
family members also have been in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope to wrap up their case by Monday, and Hawthorn
has indicated the defense will last one or two days, with Berry
taking the stand.

U.S. SIDE SEEMS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEAL ON CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: References to Friday are CQ -- Beijing time elements.) 
(sw) 
 By ERIK ECHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ American officials seemed optimistic on Friday that a
long-sought deal to get China into the World Trade Organization may
be at hand, after Chinese officials asked President Clinton's
negotiators to remain in Beijing at least one more day to receive a
new offer of market openings from China's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the talks were tight-lipped, and Clinton, speaking
at the White House on Thursday, said, ``When I know we have got an
agreement or whether we haven't, I'll let you know.'' Clinton was
described by aides as deeply involved in the talks, which are being
held here by his trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and the
head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the less we say now the better because these are
difficult negotiations, and they are working on them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The American negotiators had been scheduled to return to
Washington early on Friday, but decided on Thursday evening to
remain in Beijing for further talks.
</P>
<P>
   After years of hesitation, both China and the United States now
both seem intent on achieving China's entry into the global body,
which sets trade rules and adjudicates trade disputes among
countries. A deal was nearly struck in April, but Clinton decided
that China's concessions at the time were insufficient to pass
congressional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Now the negotiations appear to be down to a handful of major
issues, including the rights of American companies to take majority
stakes in Chinese companies, American restrictions on the import of
Chinese textiles and questions about whether the United States
could unilaterally ban some Chinese products if it concludes that
China is violating its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   China, agreeing in principle to a more open economy, insists
that it should be treated as a ``developing country,'' which would
give it greater ability to protect its struggling state-owned
industries and provide it more time to lower other trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   All day Wednesday, staff-level working groups met on specific
topics, such as the right of foreign businesses to invest in _ and
take control of _ Chinese banking, telecommunications and other
companies. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji offered such moves in April,
but the Chinese government has been under pressure since then to
back off on some of the concessions to protect local industries and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen just how far the Chinese are willing to go,''
one administration official familiar with the talks said on
Thursday in Washington. ``We hope to know in a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky and Shi Guangsheng, China's trade minister, met for
six hours on Wednesday. They spent Thursday morning closeted with
their own staffs, apparently assessing the results so far.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials then met for just one hour Thursday afternoon
before adjourning for the day. The Americans, exhausted and
jet-lagged, said they needed some sleep, but officials also hinted
that the two sides needed time to evaluate each other's latest
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   China hopes to gain entry soon into the trade organization _
which now has 134 members _ so it can participate in a new round of
global trade talks that begin Nov. 30 in Seattle. It must first
reach bilateral accords with major trading partners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the time of the April negotiations, the American trade office
released a description of Zhu's concessions, apparently hoping to
build support among American businesses. The release did elicit
such support, but in China it caused a firestorm, in part because
some affected ministries had not signed off on Zhu's concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister himself, a champion of using outside
competition to shake up China's moribund state sector, was
criticized for giving away too much.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one Western diplomat said, the two sides are in effect
dancing around the April agreements, seeking a formula that will
enable China to say it is giving up less than before, and permit
Washington to assert that it has struck deeper blows against
Chinese protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the Chinese continue to demand some slack because of
the country's poverty and critical social problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States can lower its demands this time, then
there is likely to be an agreement,'' said Ji Chongwei, a senior
researcher at the State Council's Development Research Center. ``I
hope the United States can be patient and understand the reality in
China, instead of imposing excessive demands.''

ULSTER UNIONISTS REJECT IRA DISARMAMENT DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Ulster Unionist assembly members
Thursday rejected assurances from the Irish Republican Army and its
political allies in Sinn Fein that the IRA would begin disarming if
a local power-sharing government was formed.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-member Ulster Unionist Party faction in the new Northern
Ireland assembly refused to recommend the package of IRA
concessions to the 750-member party council of the UUP, the largest
unionist party. It was unclear whether this marked the effective
end of the attempt by former US senator George Mitchell of Maine to
save the Good Friday political settlement he brokered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mitchell said he would return Friday for what
may be a final day of trying to break the stalemate that has
stalled the peace process in Northern Ireland for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams emerged from a meeting with
Mitchell to say: ``We've been told the Ulster Unionist Party has
said no.'' Adams said Sinn Fein ``is deeply disappointed,'' but
added that, ``The senator has asked to see us again in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has been caused by the Ulster Unionist refusal to
sit in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins disarming.
Sinn Fein insists there is nothing in the Good Friday Agreement
that links IRA disarmament to their participation in government.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to break the stalemate, the IRA and Sinn Fein
this week reportedly offered verbal and written assurances to
unionists that they would begin the process of decommissioning
weapons as soon as the power-sharing government was formed.
</P>
<P>
   According to several participants in the secret talks, the IRA
has offered to appoint a senior member of its organization as a
liaison to John de Chastelain, the retired Canadian general in
charge of the international body set up to handle the
decommissioning of paramilitary weapons here.
</P>
<P>
   But that offer, and promises by Sinn Fein that it would do all
it can to facilitate disarming, was not enough for a majority of
those who were elected to the assembly that under the Good Friday
Agreement was supposed to return local government here for the
first time since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   That assembly was suspended in July when the dispute over the
IRA's weapons prevented the creation of the power-sharing Cabinet
that would serve as the executive arm of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The negative reaction of the majority of Ulster Unionist
assembly members was a setback for Mitchell's effort to give new
momentum to the peace process. But a spokesman for Mitchell, Colin
Ross, insisted that ``this process is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources within the Ulster Unionist Party say that its leader,
David Trimble, is willing to take a gamble on the assurances from
Sinn Fein and the IRA, but that he faces a badly split party which
includes those who will not compromise on the demand that weapons
be turned in up front.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's setback followed several days of growing optimism
that a compromise was in the offing. Mitchell, who initially
expected to spend a few weeks overseeing a review of the process,
is now in his tenth week of talks with the parties here.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is anxious to return home to his family and his
Washington law practice, has insisted that the parties refrain from
giving public statements about the substance of the talks. The
secrecy of the talks, which have been shifted between here and the
London home of the US Ambassador to Britain, Philip Lader, has
frustrated journalists but apparently led to a thaw in the personal
relationships between the leaders of Sinn Fein and the Ulster
Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   But while Trimble and his top deputies have sat down to dinner
with and frankly engaged Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, the rank and file of Trimble's party remain deeply
suspicious of republican promises.
</P>
<P>
   One of Trimble's potential rivals, Jeffrey Donaldson, said
Thursday that a majority of the party would not budge on their
insistence that the IRA turn in weapons first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot move on that principle,'' Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   The republicans say they are similarly boxed in. Adams says that
disarming ``has to take place within the context of the Good Friday
Agreement,'' meaning that unless the agreement is implemented, with
the creation of a power-sharing local government and cross-border
authorities in which the Republic of Ireland has a say in mutual
interests, arms decommissioning will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the ornate lobby of the building that houses the
suspended assembly, the newly appointed British secretary of state
for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, urged a group of unionists
to make a leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put these people on the spot. Call their bluff,'' Mandelson
said, in an apparent reference to the republican assurances on
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments say the unionists have nothing
to lose by forming the government, saying they can walk away if the
republicans do not keep their end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But as Thursday proved, there are many unionists who would
rather stand on principle than take a chance on the words of
longstanding enemies.

BUSH COURTS VETERANS IN MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. _ About 200 people turned out at a historic
cemetery here Thursday to see Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
commemorate Veterans Day. But he should not count on winning their
votes just yet.
</P>
<P>
   They liked his stirring, patriotic speech, with its kind words
for veterans' causes. They liked that he crossed his heart after
laying a wreath at a memorial tomb for those who fought America's
wars. They liked that he stayed and signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the eight veterans interviewed after the ceremony
promised to vote for Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, um, I'm still a little bit undecided,'' said William S.
Anderton, 68, who did not want to seem impolite. ``I kind of like
McCain because he's an ex-Marine and an ex-fighter pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Navy pilot who was
shot down in Vietnam and held prisoner, had hoped, as he taps
veterans nationwide to support his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   To Anderton, who served in Germany, Korea, Japan, Spain and
Saudi Arabia in his 22-year Air Force career, it is ``extremely
important'' that the nation's commander in chief have active-duty
military experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only then can they really sympathize with the needs of our
military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who served as a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National
Guard, was asked by a reporter whether voters were interested in
active-duty service by candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, Bill Clinton wouldn't have been elected,''
Bush said. ``I flew F-102 fighters, and proudly so, I might add.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also criticized Clinton's handling of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you define a mission in Kosovo and you announce right off
the bat that ground troops would be taken off the table, it makes
the mission a muddy mission,'' he said. ``Tying one hand behind
your back simultaneously with committing American troops doesn't
make much sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit was the third time he has campaigned in Michigan
since announcing his candidacy. Michigan has one of the earlier
Republican primaries, on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   This trip was to McComb County, best known for its Reagan
Democrats, most of whom voted for Clinton in the last election. ``I
hope they become the Bush Democrats,'' Bush said.

 &HT;    Southerners not wedded to marriage
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The country's divorce rate bulges the most at the
Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   From the land of family values and Baptist preachers, eight Deep
South states rank in the top 20 when it comes to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada is No. 1 on the list with 8.5 divorces per 1,000 people.
But for every 1,000 people in Tennessee, there are 6.4 divorces.
Arkansas and Alabama follow. Dixie's break-up procession continues
with No. 9 Kentucky, Florida (11), North Carolina (16), Mississippi
(18) and Georgia (19), according to an analysis of 1998 federal
statistics by The Associated Press. The national average is 4.2
divorces per 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same reason in country songs so many people get
married. There's pressure to get married to have sex because you
can't get away with living together as well in these parts,'' said
Jim Cobb, a history professor at the University of Georgia and past
president of the Southern Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   In Gatlinburg, Tenn., a glut of marriage chapels churn about $15
million annually into the local economy. Nearly 40,000 marriages a
year take place in that slice of the Great Smoky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not equally matched when they come here,'' said
Eddie Taylor, proprietor of Gatlinburg's first commercial wedding
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come here overnight and fall in lust, not love,'' said
Taylor, an ordained Southern Baptist minister. ``They come to the
area and in five minutes, they show a driver's license. You could
have three or four living wives at the same time. Nobody checks.
They've slept together and then tomorrow is a new day.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's Web site reminds the betrothed that there's no waiting
period and no blood test required in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, disabled Marine Bill Wade added his name to the
70,000 couples married by Taylor's outfit since 1980. The Ohio
resident said he and his bride, Mary Beth, are undeterred by the
divorce statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a 50-50 shot,'' said Wade, Taylor's 5:15 p.m.
appointment. ``You can make a lot of mistakes in your life, but
it's not like you can't fix those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In bygone generations, marriages stayed together because man and
wife needed the money, especially in Southern textile towns, said
John Shelton Reed, director of the Institute for Research in Social
Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's booming economy, the self-reliance and
independence of Southern women might be revealing themselves in the
escalating divorce rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love it or leave it is a good Southern sentiment here,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   Religion also may play a role in the Southern divorce rate. The
region has relatively few Roman Catholics, whose church doesn't
recognize divorce.

With NFL teams having reached the midway point of the 1999 season,
this is a good time to make some observations about where teams
stand and where they are going over the next two months.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a season of unprecedented parity _ in which 33.6 percent of
the games have been decided by three points or fewer _ the AFC is
vastly superior to the NFC. The AFC has a 24-12 (.667) record
against the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the NFC makes a strong comeback over the second half, the
AFC is on a pace to win a record 40 interconference games.
</P>
<P>
   Only five AFC teams have losing records. Only five NFC teams
have winning records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFC really has some good teams,'' Giants defensive end
Michael Strahan says. ``I mean, they seem to have some teams that
are just explosive right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFC, believe me, is still tough. There are no easy games
anywhere in this league. I guarantee that you can take the best NFC
team and the best AFC team, and it's going to be a tough game.''
</P>
<P>
   The four teams that reached conference championship games last
season _ Denver, the New York Jets, Atlanta and Minnesota _ have a
combined record of 12-23. Only the Vikings, whose three-game
winning streak has elevated them to 5-4, are a legitimate playoff
contender.
</P>
<P>
   There are more quality teams in the AFC East _ Miami, New
England, Indianapolis, Buffalo _ than there are in the entire NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really give any side the advantage,'' Strahan says.
``Every week is different. I think that's what makes it so
interesting now, because you never know who's going to win. It's
pretty amazing to me to look at the scores and say, `I cannot
believe that they won this game against this team.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everybody thinks the AFC has the edge. We'll see in
the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The only 7-1 teams, Miami and Jacksonville, reside in the AFC.
There is nothing surprising about the performance of the Dolphins
and Jaguars, but there have been a lot of surprising performances
by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Under new coach Mike Holmgren, who was lured from Green Bay for
an average salary of $4 million a year, Seattle is 6-2 and on top
of the AFC West. The Seahawks have their best record at the midway
point since 1984 as they try to make the playoffs for the first
time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC Central, Tennessee is 6-2 after finishing 8-8 for
three consecutive seasons. The Titans are trying to make the
playoffs for the first time since 1993, when they were the Houston
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising team in the AFC is Indianapolis. The Colts
are 6-2, their best eight-game record since 1977. They are tied for
second in the AFC East, one game behind Miami. Their six wins equal
the total of the last two seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd asked me if this team could be 6-2, I'd have said it
would be really tough,'' says Colts coach Jim Mora, a leading
candidate for NFL Coach of the Year honors. ``I think 6-2,
realistically, would have been beyond anybody's expectations, but
I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are surprises in the NFC, too. If the playoffs started
today, Detroit (6-2) would have the conference's home-field
advantage. The Lions play five of their last eight games on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, the NFC's other 6-2 team, is running away with the
West after not making the playoffs since the team played in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   None of last year's NFC division winners _ Dallas, Green Bay and
San Francisco _ has a winning record. The Cowboys, Packers and
49ers have won seven of the last 11 Super Bowls, but none is
considered a serious threat this season.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants and Washington, neither of which made the
playoffs last season, are tied for first place in the NFC East. The
Giants, who started 1-2, have a bad offense and a good defense. The
Redskins have the second-highest-scoring offense in the league but
rank last in defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much parity,'' says Minnesota quarterback Jeff
George, who has ignited a three-game winning streak since replacing
the benched Randall Cunningham. ``If you look at last year, there
were maybe two teams, Denver and us (Minnesota), that were (far
superior to) everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, with free agency, what has been going on throughout
the league, you just don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a down year one year, and the next thing you know
that team's going to the Super Bowl. I think it's great for the
league and especially for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of free agency and the salary cap, there may never be
another dynasty. Although there is no dominant team, average
attendance is 65,154, up from 64,020 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings are up, too.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that fans believe their favorite team has a chance
to make the playoffs. There are 12 teams in first place or only one
game out. Seven more teams are only two games out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the level of play is down,'' George says. ``I
think you're getting a lot of teams with a lot of good defenses and
scores aren't as high as they used to be. In the offseason, coaches
have studied these offenses, and they know how to defend a lot of
these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we're coming across a lot of good defensive teams
that are stopping a lot of offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Through half the season, there have been plenty of impressive
individual performances.
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner has thrown 24 touchdown passes,
putting him on a pace to tie Dan Marino's NFL record of 48 set in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins running back Stephen Davis has scored 12 touchdowns,
putting him on a pace for 24, one behind Emmitt Smith's record of
25 set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Colts running back Edgerrin James has 746 yards rushing. He's on
a pace for 1,492 and is trying to become the first rookie to lead
the league in rushing since Eric Dickerson had 1,808 yards in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think there's any great football being played in
this league?'' Detroit cornerback Bryant Westbrook says.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did you hear the one about the old maid and the
traveling salesman? Groan if you will, but there was a time when
the question summed up not only a whole species of smutty jokes but
also a gentler genre of romantic comedies. You know the formula,
which was given its most popular incarnation in ``The Music Man'':
flashy con artist meets buttoned-up spinster; sparks fly; she makes
him honest, he makes her fun.
</P>
<P>
   As fables of life-altering love go, this prototype now has all
the electricity of a manual typewriter. But if it's told by the
right tellers, it can still generate sentimental goose bumps, and
one can only be grateful that Woody Harrelson and Jayne Atkinson
have been assigned that task in the Roundabout Theater Company's
smooth, mild-mannered revival of ``The Rainmaker,'' N. Richard
Nash's play from 1954, which opened Thursday night at the Brooks
Atkinson Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As Lizzie Curry and Starbuck, the plain midlands farm woman and
the fancy dream peddler who meet during a drought in the 1930s,
these first-class actors find freshening currents in what could
have been a stagnant pond of an evening. Performers of very
different professional histories, they are not an obvious match.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atkinson, an artisan of natural radiance and filigree stage
technique, is much cherished by theater connoisseurs, rather as her
contemporary Cherry Jones is. Harrelson is a fascinatingly
combustible screen presence (``Natural Born Killers,'' ``The People
vs. Larry Flynt'') who also floats in the immortality of television
syndication as the lovably dim bartender of ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the very contrast between the two that make this
``Rainmaker,'' directed with plenty of polish and little
imagination by Scott Ellis, worth sitting through. Ms. Atkinson and
Harrelson ply their respective strengths to give unexpected and
subtle spins to characters stamped firmly by Geraldine Page and
Darren McGavin (in the original Broadway production) and Katharine
Hepburn and Burt Lancaster (in the 1956 movie).
</P>
<P>
   When they cozy up in a barn loft at the end of the play's second
act, with Harrelson playing irresistible force to Ms. Atkinson's
immovable object, their characters' mutual seduction becomes an
appetizing counterpoint of theatrical styles. Harrelson, bounding
and slithering across the stage like an overgrown gymnast, is
loose, loopy and a little out of control. Ms. Atkinson is as still
as a painting, but her carefully modulated facial expressions are
just as eloquent as his physical exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the scene progresses, there is the sense of a delicate
exchange, a sentimental education, going on between the performers
as well as the characters they play. It's more sweet than sexy, but
that sweetness has its own emotional force.
</P>
<P>
   That moment, it must be admitted, is a long time coming. ``A
popular comedy without artistic pretensions'' was how the New York
Times critic Brooks Atkinson (yes, the man for whom the theater is
named) summed up ``The Rainmaker'' when it opened 45 years ago, and
the years have only confirmed the faintness of the praise.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's construction is as clean, clear and shiny as a newly
washed window, with every metaphor, plot turn and bit of comedy
fully evident from a first reading of the script. You can see why
``The Rainmaker'' has long been a staple of community and school
theaters, if not, with its insistence on how a man's love completes
a too independent woman, a special favorite of feminists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This same clarity and directness can also make the play slow
going these days. ``The Rainmaker'' spends a lot of words in making
its self-evident points and arriving at its predetermined
conclusions. To captivate an audience entirely, any staging, Nash
writes in his introduction to the script, must focus ``through a
romantically gauzed lens.'' There is scarcely a hint of gauziness
in Ellis' forthright staging.
</P>
<P>
   James Noone's handsome, panoramic setting, which with its vistas
of wheat field and big skies directly recalls the recent London
revival of ``Oklahoma!,'' isn't really conducive to the spinning of
private dreams. Louis Rosen's incidental guitar music seems more
appropriate to a suspenseful western movie than romantic reverie.
And the nicely observed, gritty physical details, from the dirt on
the men's trousers to the sweat that soaks Jess Goldstein's period
costumes, sometimes undercuts the fairy tale tenor of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly the supporting actors, while all entirely
professional, only rarely tear through the stock cloth from which
their characters are cut. The comic eagerness with which Lizzie's
father (Jerry Hardin) and brothers (David Aaron Baker and John
Bedford Lloyd) consider the possibilities of marrying her off can
be frankly tedious. There are several strongly played moments of
domestic confrontation, yet their fierce naturalism is not of a
piece with the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd brings admirable consistency and restraint to the role of
the aspiration-withering pragmatist of the family, and Randle Mell
is fine as Lizzie's deeply ambivalent suitor. But it's Ms.
Atkinson, who played the same part at the Williamstown Theater
Festival in 1998, who must hold the show together, and she does so
with anchoring skill and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Like Janet McTeer in the memorable Broadway revival of ``A
Doll's House'' in 1997, Ms. Atkinson finds the unconscious actress
in a character who has adopted a role she doesn't even know she is
playing anymore. Arms folded, mouth set firmly in a skeptical
smile, this Lizzie has a gruffly affable persona that seems to have
come from growing up in a household of men. When the more fragile
Lizzie peeks through, it's heart-rending.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Ms. Hepburn (and one assumes from descriptions, Ms.
Page), Ms. Atkinson sidesteps high-key mannerisms to create a
sturdy facade of plainness rippled with small signs of discontent,
which together make Lizzie's transformation both inevitable and
surprising. Her Lizzie also never completely loses her
self-possession, thus avoiding the unpleasant suggestion that all
this up-tight lady needed was a good roll in the hay.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's Starbuck, the self-styled rainmaker who arrives to
relieve both climatic and emotional droughts, is less a hypnotic
Spielmeister than a clumsy provincial idealist desperate to believe
in his own fantasies. You can feel Starbuck trying to convince
himself, as well as others, through the sheer energy he pours into
his improbable promises. Like Lizzie, he lacks confidence, just of
a different sort, which gives a warming balance to their scenes
together.
</P>
<P>
   You might remember that another admired Hollywood actor showed
up last season on Broadway as a fast-talking salesman who deals in
pipe dreams, though his business was to shatter rather than
encourage them. That was Kevin Spacey in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' and
though Harrelson has less meat to chew than Spacey did, he has
still found a way of melding psychological nuance with the
expansiveness of gesture that the stage demands.
</P>
<P>
   The talent flow between theater and film is not, it turns out, a
one-way street. The recent live performances of celluloid idols
like Harrelson and Spacey _ not to mention those of Ethan Hawke,
Matthew Broderick, Marisa Tomei, Nicole Kidman and Annette Bening _
have all confirmed this most hearteningly. Attention, movie stars
with strong lungs and nerves to match: come on in; the water's
fine.

IN IRA MESSAGE FOR NEGOTIATORS, A HINT THAT ACCORD ISN'T DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The Irish Republican Army, having
submitted a long-awaited message to peace negotiators, has raised a
slim, last-minute hope that former Sen. George Mitchell's rescue
mission might still succeed in moving forward the stalemated
Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of the statement were not known _ nor how far it
went toward meeting the demands of politicians seeking assurances
of guerrilla disarmament. But it represented enough of an olive
branch to prompt David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, to
hold a series of sounding-out meetings throughout the day with
party members gathered in the nearby Stormont Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary vote Thursday night, his colleagues narrowly
rejected what Trimble put to them, but they later summoned Peter
Mandelson, Britain's secretary for Northern Ireland, for a
``clarification.'' They continued meeting and said on adjournment
that they would return for more discussion Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to write this off,'' a spokesman for Trimble
said. ``We will be back tomorrow; the party leader is determined to
try to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, emerged from the Mitchell
talks to say that he had been expecting a more accepting response
from Trimble's party and that he was dismayed by word of the
rejection. Under Mitchell's prodding and a well-maintained news
blackout, the Sinn Fein and Ulster Unionist leaders have been
talking to each other in recent weeks with unaccustomed candor.
Before driving away Thursday night, Adams said, ``I am asking
everyone to reflect on this and appreciate the seriousness of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dispute that has frozen in place the peace agreement
greeted with euphoria in April 1998, the Unionists have insisted
that the IRA begin shedding its weapons before its political wing,
Sinn Fein, occupies its leadership positions in the new Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has objected to the demand as a newly imposed
condition not included in the original agreement, and has claimed
it does not have the power to order the organization to turn over
its weapons anyway. The IRA has maintained a cease-fire for two
years but has viewed disarmament as a form of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest message, the IRA was not expected to have relaxed
that position. But it may have addressed Ulster Unionist wishes for
a statement disavowing violence and pledging commitment to the
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The original agreement stated that all parties must try to
achieve disarmament by May 2000, but it set no starting date and
assigned the handling of ``decommissioning,'' as it is called, to
an international commission headed by a retired Canadian general,
John de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely reported that the IRA's message included a pledge
to assign a senior official of the underground force as an
``interlocutor'' with the decommissioning panel.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue package that was emerging Thursday night involved a
sequence of actions and pledges that would enable the Unionists to
let Sinn Fein into government with assurances of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble has accepted this formula of reciprocal
confidence-building gestures, he faces difficulties selling it to
his party. He will be risking his leadership, and several
newspapers here urged him to have the courage to take a ``back me
or sack me'' position.

BOGGS ANNOUNCES END TO 18-YEAR RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No more chicken feasts for Wade Boggs. Only an occassional
nugget or two to remind him of a stellar 18-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, who in 1999 achieved his goal of joining baseball's
3,000-hit club, officially retired Thursday and accepted a
front-office position with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He left with
3,010 hits over a career that began in 1982 with the Red Sox. He
made three postseason appearances with Boston, and he won a World
Series ring with the Yankees in 1996 before finishing up with Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs has done it all _ on and off the field. And unlike his
exit from Boston and New York, he wore a smile on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few players have the luxury of culminating their career at
home surrounded by family and friends,'' said Boggs, accompanied by
his wife, Debbie, in his farewell press conference. ``Never being
one to look back, I now look forward to helping the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays be the best organization it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs has Hall of Fame credentials. On Aug. 7, he became the 23d
player in the majors to reach 3,000. He did it with a home run, the
only player to do so. That hit was the culmination of a dream for
Boggs, a five-time American League batting champ. When he woke up a
month later, the party was over. At age 41, he knew he had no
chance of overcoming season-ending surgery to repair torn cartilage
in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to the fork in the road of making the decision of
not to be a player,'' said Boggs. ``It was a long, painstaking
decision. It wasn't an easy decision because an athlete can always
look in the mirror and say `OK, I can still play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down inside, probably, I thought I still could. But why
not go out out on top. I've always said: I'll never embarrass
myself in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   A 12-time consecutive All-Star (1985-96), Boggs should be best
remembered as the only player this century with seven-straight
200-hit seasons and a winner of two gold gloves. He still holds the
AL rookie record with a .349 average.
</P>
<P>
   But even that year there were complaints from Red Sox teammates
that he was selfish, and worse, a Punch-and-Judy hitter who
everyone on the team knew had the ability to hit for power. Only in
1987, when Boggs hit .363 with 40 doubles, 6 triples, and 24 home
runs did his critics back off. The following year he batted .366
and dropped to five home runs. The complaints started again, even
though the Red Sox made the postseason three times with Boggs at
third (1986, '88 and '90). When Boggs dropped to .259 in '92, the
Sox allowed him to become a free agent, ending an 11-year
association.
</P>
<P>
   Even more embarrassing for Boggs as a Red Sox was national
publicity associated with an extramarital affair with Margo Adams.
Boggs's attempts to save his reputation fell on deaf ears, and he
lost the support of not only the fans but also Jean Yawkey, the
late Red Sox owner. The Sox offered Boggs only $9 million for three
years after the 1992 season. Boggs signed a three-year contract
with New York worth $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apple was hardly paradise for Boggs, who was treated
rudely as an ex-Red Sox, much like Roger Clemens this year. The
Margo chants followed him to Yankee Stadium. Early, he needed a
police escort to reach the park. He silenced his critics by hitting
over .300 for four straight seasons. He hit .292 in 1997, and
sensing his days in New York were about to end, Boggs leaped at a
chance to finish his career in his hometown. In 1998, Boggs played
in 123 games for Tampa Bay and hit. 280. This year he hit .301.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays have reason to be happy with Boggs's decision.
They faced a deadline Wednesday to exercise a $1 million option on
a contract Boggs signed two years ago. Although his duties as
special assistant to general manager Chuck LaMar aren't well
defined, Boggs said he is excited about the prospect of having
input in the development of what he thinks can be a championship
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season was an incredible high point in a long journey,''
said Boggs. ``I will always treasure it. Now I can take time to see
my son (Brett) play Little League baseball. I'm looking forward to
it.''

 &HT;    Kiddies will enthuse, parents will snooze watching `Pokemon'
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ From the country that brought you
Godzilla and Hello Kitty comes another pop-culture abomination:
``Pokemon: The First Movie.'' And not a moment too soon as far as
your kids are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   For those without the benefit of Pokemon-loving grade-schoolers
in their house, I'll try to explain. In all its many forms _ video
game, trading cards, TV show and now feature-length film _ this
made-in-Japan phenomenon concerns a bunch of troll-like creatures
with such silly-sounding names as Pikachu, Charizard and Psyduck.
Working with their human companions _ or ``trainers'' _ they engage
in all sorts of adventures. Does it make any sense? Not to me, but
I'm still trying to figure out why anyone would shell out $7 for a
toy animal stuffed with plastic pellets.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pokemon is the 1999 answer to the Beanie Baby
craze, which in turn replaced the Power Rangers for children's
attention. But at least they had the decency not to make a Beanie
Baby movie. (I wish I could say the same for the Power Rangers.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the animated TV series, ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
presents these creatures in all their oddly individualized glory _
Pikachu, for example, can't stop saying ``Pikachu.'' There's a
story, but it's really just a premise to introduce another Pokemon
(and, of course, to sell more Pokemon products). Meet Mew, a
catlike Pokemon resurrected from ancient times. He's been cloned,
and his copy _ Mewtwo (what else?) _ is evil incarnate. There's a
battle between the two, and the trainers stand on the sidelines
nervously awaiting the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   As kiddie flicks go, you can't get much worse than this _ the
animation is atrocious in that peculiarly Japanese way (think Hello
Kitty meets Scooby Doo), the dialogue clumsy and corny. I actually
preferred the 22-minute ``short'' that preceded the movie, a
semi-amusing, surreal romp called ``Pikachu's Vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike a Disney animated feature, ``Pokemon'' was never
intended for the adult set. The best a parent can hope is to get
some shut-eye while his or her kids enjoy the movie (and trust me,
they will). Just pray that by the time they make ``Pokemon: The
Second Movie,'' your children will have outgrown the fad.

BIOTECH FIRMS TRY TO COUNTER CONCERNS ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED
FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Worried about growing resistance to genetically
modified foods, some of the world's biggest biotechnology companies
have decided to mount a huge lobbying and marketing campaign to
counter their critics and combat what they fear is a rising wave of
anti-biotech hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of genetically modified seeds have taken a beating this
year in Europe, where critics have sabotaged test plots of altered
crops and have fostered widespread distrust of what they call
Frankenstein Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Now that wariness is starting to appear in the United States.
Environmental groups are stoking opposition through lobbying and
full-page advertisements; federal lawmakers on Wednesday introduced
legislation that would require labeling of food made with
genetically modified crops, and regulators are re-evaluating
everything from food safety to the effects bioengineered crops may
have on the monarch butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in this contest for American public opinion are
billions of dollars in investments by the biotecnology industry
and American farmers who have rapidly adopted products like corn
and soybeans that have been engineered to produce their own
insecticidal toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the leading biotechnology companies were
reluctant to respond to criticism in this country for fear of
making the novel foods an issue. But some biotech executives now
say that there is a sense that the tide may be turning against
genetically modified foods and that action is urgent.
</P>
<P>
   And so in recent months, Monsanto Co., Du Pont, Novartis AG and
other biotech companies have formed a series of industry-wide
alliances and have set aside tens of millions of dollars to fight
what they view as an ugly campaign that has vilified the companies
_ calling Monsanto, for example, ``Monsatan'' and ``Mutanto,'' _
and has misrepresented their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protest industry has gone too far,'' said Edward Shonsey,
chief executive at Novartis Seeds Inc., in an interview. ``They've
crossed the boundaries of reasonableness, and now it's up to us to
protect and defend biotechnology. As a result there's a combined
effort to get the facts out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the alliances are financing scientific research,
organizing educational forums, lobbying legislators, regulators and
farm organizations, and using their own Web sites to promote the
benefits of genetically modified, or GM, products. The members have
also retained three major public relations concerns in recent
weeks. And many are pooling their resources and preparing a global
advertising and public relations campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these forces are coming to bear where we're going to have
a really big battle,'' said Todd Duvick, a food industry analyst at
Bank of America. ``We already have huge quantities of GM foods and
there are companies that want labeling and companies that don't
want them; it's creating a logistical nightmare. Meanwhile, all the
biotechnology companies are trying to protect themselves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate centers on a technology that can borrow genetic code
from plants or animals and transfer it to a plant to give it a
desired trait. This year, 20 to 45 percent of American corn and
soybeans were grown from seed engineered to produce its own
insecticidal toxin, and those crops have found their way into many
processed foods. Backers say biotechnology may eventually lead to
crops that have extra nutrition or can thrive in adverse weather.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer advocates and scientists, particularly in
Europe, say that not enough research has been done to prove that
food made from genetically altered crops is safe to eat. In
response, federal regulators say that no studies have proven that
food made from genetically modified products is harmful to eat, and
that all biotech products now on the market have been deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the possible effect such crops might have on
the environment. An increasing number of studies suggest that
genetically modified plants could interact with the environment in
hazardous ways, like creating a hard to eradicate ``superweed,''
and that regulators are not demanding the proper studies to assess
the risks.
</P>
<P>
   With the drumbeat of concern growing in the United States, the
biotechnology companies feel they need to act. But their campaign
is not unified. Monsanto, whose aggressive efforts to gain
acceptance for its genetically modified products, backfired in
Europe, recently retained Burson-Marsteller, a global public
relations firm, at an annual cost of millions of dollars, according
to people who reviewed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, whose stock price has suffered over the past year
because of growing concern about the viability and profitability of
its biotechnology division, is now trying a two-pronged effort to
educate consumers and reach out to its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as a much more positive, pro-active dialogue
with the public, which has the right to know more about the
benefits of biotechnology,'' said Nick Rosa, a senior vice
president at Monsanto in St. Louis. ``We are not interested in a
guerrilla response. There are many coalitions interested in
communicating on biotech and in many instances we are working with
them. We believe that the benefits of biotechnology need to be
told.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto is even meeting with some of its most vocal opponents.
A month ago, Monsanto chief executive Robert Shapiro addressed a
gathering of the environmental group Greenpeace. And Shapiro and
other top Monsanto executives plan to meet soon with Jeremy Rifkin,
an influential commentator on science and technology to whom
biotechnology is a ``Faustian bargain.'' The meeting was arranged
by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pont is taking a conciliatory approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public concern has been aggravated by the perception that we
in industry have often acted as though public fears are not
legitimate and are the result of ignorance,'' Du Pont chief
executive Charles Holliday said in a speech last September.
``Unfortunately, many in the industry have been reluctant to
address concerns about the risks of biotechnology. But we have to
listen to the people who are now raising alarms. We don't have all
the answers and to pretend we do, or to brush off concern as
unfounded, is to be arrogant and reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Du Pont recently released a series of television commercials
about the future, featuring the company's ``to do list,'' which
included research to ``find food that helps prevent breast
cancer,'' a breakthrough that might induce broader acceptance among
consumers, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Seeds U.S.A., however, is publicly acknowledging a
spirited campaign to balance the flow of public information about
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in four or five different working groups on this issue,''
said Shonsey, the chief executive at Novartis Seeds. ``We're
holding in-depth sessions with members of Congress, with
universities and trade associations, the grocery manufacturers and
food associations. Strategy is taking place to do that, you may
even see TV and radio ads, even scientific conferences. We want a
consistent message out there. We want a more balanced discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Food industry trade groups are also rallying and recently formed
the Alliance for Better Foods, whose Web site betterfoods.org, is
devoted to promoting the benefits of biotech foods.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which is supported by groups like the Grocery
Manufacturers of America, says it wants consumers to know not only
that bio-engineered crops resists pests and increases crop yields,
but that the technology holds out the promise of creating more
nutritious foods and perhaps even foods that could serve to prevent
or treat medical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the shrill statements and outrageous tactics by
people who are attacking biotech foods,'' said Gene Grabowski, a
spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the Alliance
for Better Foods. ``Our site is intended to be based on fact; it's
decidedly pro-biotech but it's not intended to be strident.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have reviewed their stunning public relations loss
in Europe and now acknowledge that there were a number of missteps.
``I think there was a certain naivete in our initial approaches to
the European market,'' Shapiro said in an interview. ``We had been
operating on a model that had been used in the U.S. If the question
is have we learned anything in recent months in the sociology, the
media orientation, yes we have learned something.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the trade groups and other coalitions are
expected to take the visible lead in the months to come. ``There's
a feeling that some of the companies have been vilified, and so
it's more credible if scientists and academics and farmers stand up
on the issue,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology
Industry Organization in Washington, which is lobbying on behalf of
Monsanto and others. ``If it's the company people say, `Well it's
got a commercial interest.' So it's better this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leading environmental groups, however, say they
believe the new campaign will backfire because it will raise even
more questions about biotech foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are under the misguided assumption that the more
information they put out the more light at the end of the tunnel,''
said Rifkin, who is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends,
an environmental group. ``But the more information they put out the
more questions people have about GM foods.'' He asserted that the
products were dangerous and said, ``They think it's public
relations disaster but it's more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue began to become an issue in this country last May,
when a Cornell University study showed that pollen from corn
producing the insecticidal toxin Bt could stunt the development of
monarch caterpillars in the laboratory. Since then, amid growing
coverage by the news media detailing concerns about the safety of
genetically modified crops, Federal officials are moving to act.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of 20 members of
Congress introduced legislation that would require labeling of
genetically engineered food products because of concerns about food
safety and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are weighing their own responses. In the
coming weeks, the FDA is planning to hold a series of forums on
biotechnology, largely to solicit public opinion, and Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman is expected to name a panel of experts to
advise him on biotechnology issues; the Environmental Protection
Agency is also expected to announce in the coming weeks on how
biotech corn can be planted, a decision that may be influenced by
the recent restudies on the Monarch Butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   In the scramble to influence this debate, a group of public
relations officials apparently jumped the gun last weekat a
scientific conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which was financed by the large biotechnology
companies, invited representatives of the news media. Yet before
the deliberations began, staff members issued a news release
announcing that the conference expected to show that genetically
engineered corn did not harm monarch butterflies , even though no
scientists later polled by a reporter said they could draw such a
conclusion and most of them acknowledged that their research was
far from complete.
</P>
<P>
   The conference and about half the studies presented were
financed by the biotechnology industry. But the public relations
officials insisted the meeting was strictly scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quibble with it but I think it was a low-key press
release,'' said Libby Mikesell, a spokeswoman for the Agricultural
Biotechnology Stewardship Working Group, a trade group financed by
big biotechnology companies. ``This just said: `This is what we
expect them to say, please tune in. There wasn't any interest in
trying to spin it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists, however, say they were told the conference
could help influence the decision by the Environmental Protection
Agency on biotech Bt corn. ``It's my understanding that they wanted
to give some partial data to the EPA by this date,'' said John
Foster, a professor of entomology at the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say part of the reason they chose to release
preliminary data, some of the studies with as little as 10 percent
of the work complete, was pressure from farmers seeking more
information on what they call genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Growers want to know what is going to happen, Foster said, and
re are asking, ``Are we going to be able to plant GMOs?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the debate about biotechnology is coalescing
around seed sales to farmers. The nation's leading seed and
biotechnology companies are trying to convince farmers of the
viability of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a lot more hand holding,'' John Hawkins, a
spokesman for the Illinois Farm Bureau. ``Farmers are upset with
low prices and now you have this technology with potential to lower
their costs but foreign countries are saying `we're not going to
buy it or we'll have to label it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And if farmers turn against them, the big biotechnology
companies could face huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly everyone in the biotech industry is concerned,'' said
Frank Mitsch, who follows chemical and biotechnology companies at
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, a brokerage firm. ``To some extent the
year 2000 is going to be a lost year for them, and we're trying to
see the order of magnitude.''

A LOSING GAME AT THE UN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States midwifed the birth of the United Nations in
1948. As the preeminent economic and military power in the world,
America has a greater stake than any other country in a flourishing
UN _ the organization Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill
envisioned as the world's best hope for preventing a repetition of
the two world wars that defiled this century. Yet the United States
has placed itself in the company of the world's most incompetent
failed states, a deadbeat member refusing to pay its overdue debts.
</P>
<P>
   In sorrow, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told a gathering of
American journalists recently that one ambassador had compared UN
headquarters to a ``building with bad tenants.'' The bad tenant
does not pay its bills or pays them late but makes all sorts of
demands on the management.
</P>
<P>
   What is most astonishing about the current congressional snafu
that could cause the United States to lose its vote in the General
Assembly on Jan. 1 is that it comes at a moment when the United
Nations is more congenial to US interests than it has been at any
time since the onset of the superpower rivalry. The days of Soviet
ambassadors rounding up Third World votes to thwart Washington or
of the General Assembly passing resolutions to condemn Zionism as
racism are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the United Nations has made terrible blunders in
recent years, notably in Rwanda and Bosnia. But these were not the
result of deliberate efforts to oppose Washington's will. In each
case the people who suffered from decisions taken on East 42d
Street were victims of local mass murderers and ethnic cleansers,
not of a geopolitical conflict. And in both cases, much of the
carnage could have been prevented if the United States had done the
right thing at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect illustrations of how the United Nations can enhance
US security interests in the aftermath of the Cold War were its
resolutions authorizing the use of force by the coalition that
drove Saddam Hussein's troops out of Kuwait in 1991. The subsequent
Security Council resolutions demanding that Saddam disclose and
dismantle his weapons of mass destruction expressed the will of an
international community deserving of the name. The errors that
permitted Saddam to survive and rid himself of weapons inspectors
were made in Washington, not at the UN secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   At present a UN peacekeeping force is in Kosovo, protecting
Serbian and Albanian Kosovars alike from vengeful forces in either
camp. A multilateral force authorized by the UN has taken up
peacekeeping duties in East Timor, enabling Timorese refugees to
return home and administering the territory until the population is
prepared to govern itself. Another peacekeeping operation is
expanding in the strife-torn West African country of Sierra Leone.
These situations are different from each other; what they have in
common is that in each case an American security interest is
advanced without placing Americans in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   The US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, who
has been laboring mightily on Capitol Hill to persuade legislators
to pay the American arrears, describes UN operations as ``highly
leveraged for our advantage.'' Speaking to the National Conference
of Editorial Writers last Friday, Holbrooke summarized the value of
the United Nations to the United States by saying it allows America
to exercise ``leadership without hegemony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, has
linked the domestic issue of abortion to the payment of UN dues in
an amendment attached to an appropriations bill. This is a gesture
that has already done considerable damage to America's standing at
the UN. Although House members have a right to attach amendments to
unrelated bills, the practice should not be allowed to hobble or
maim US foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate bill known as Helms-Biden, approved 97 to 1, would pay
America's debts to the United Nations if certain conditions, or
benchmarks, are met. The bill, though an implicit rejection of the
Smith amendment's abortion linkage, would still pay only a little
more than $1 billion of the $1.7 billion owed to the United
Nations, mostly for peacekeeping operations, and would unilaterally
reduce the annual US assessment in stages, from 27 percent, to 25,
and then to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogant refusal to abide by rules that apply to all other
UN members has angered America's closest allies most of all, since
it will force them to pay more than their allotted share _ a
percentile apportioned according to the size of each country's
gross domestic product. Only governments hostile to the United
States take pleasure in the feckless behavior of US legislators,
who are acting like drunken poker players who were dealt four aces
and a deuce and are throwing away the four aces.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER with JANE GROSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After Bill Bradley retired from the New York
Knicks, he stopped following basketball, or any other sport, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only that he wanted to be taken seriously in his new
line of work as a U.S. senator. Basketball was the past, and for a
long time, it seemed to hold surprisingly little interest for him.
The shift was so abrupt that it shocked even those friends who had
always understood his ambivalence about the life of a professional
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys getting out of the game maintain a foot in it, if
just as an observer or fan, but he hasn't at all,'' said one of
Bradley's oldest friends, his college roommate, Dan Okimoto.
``People would say, `Oh, wow, did you see Kareem Abdul-Jabbar score
50 points?' and he'd have to say, `No, I didn't.' He was out of it,
and he didn't have a way of connecting with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only rather recently _ with timing that some of Vice President
Al Gore's supporters say strikes them as terribly convenient _ did
he rediscover his love of the game. Now, as a presidential
candidate, basketball is the first way many people connect with
him. ``It's his base and it's a huge asset,'' said his friend Carl
Wagner. ``They know him from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And for popular appeal, it is hard to imagine a topper for
Bradley's fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, where he
will appear with a number of his Knick teammates, the men with whom
he played and shared a punishing life on the road between 1967 and
1977: Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Willis Reed and Phil Jackson, the
new coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. A bunch of guys he used to
compete against will be there, including former Boston Celtic John
Havlicek, who is now his campaign's co-chair in Massachusetts,
along with a long roster of other sports folk. There is talk _ no
confirmation, though _ that Michael Jordan may put in an
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was a Knick, Bradley remained something of an
outsider on the team. But his friend Jackson says that Bradley
still ``found ways to talk to people about who they were and how
they got to the game. He listened to their stories.'' Now he does
that on the stump, asking audiences to share something important
about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Bradley say that his athletic history is probably
having more of an impact on the candidate himself than on the
public, at this point. Because only now, they say, for the first
time since he left the Knicks, is he using everything he learned as
a player about competition and timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't translate in the Senate, with all the compromise,
and that's not professional sports,'' said one friend. ``Now he's
playing to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he uses his athletic history to full political
advantage, though, his conflicted feelings about his life as a
basketball star still show. When he touts that part of his past, it
is usually in ways that seek to show him as more than just another
ex-jock.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about using basketball on the campaign trail, he said
in an interview last summer: ``The sports thing is about the 10
years of my life I was pro and a lot more years than that that I
played, so it's kind of a language that most people understand.
It's not language as language, necessarily, but it's experience, a
shared experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why people come up to me now and say on a regular basis
that `Values of the Game' struck a chord,'' he said, referring to
his most recent book. ``It struck a chord because it was about
their experience. All I did was find the words to capture their
experience through mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley now makes constant references to basketball, and sees
the primary race as the equivalent of a long season requiring
discipline and pacing. Aides say that following his lead has made
them more disciplined and focused, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bill, you identify the positions and then you perform the
functions of those positions,'' said Rick Wright, a former
Princeton teammate who is working for him now. ``In this campaign
I'm only doing money, so I stick to that, and if there's another
topic brought up at a meeting that I might know something about, I
keep my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   In talking about what he learned in his days as a player, the
candidate repeatedly mentions how playing and living with black
players gave him a deep understanding of the sin of racial
prejudice. He points to his career in basketball as a key reason to
choose him over Gore, saying it allowed him to get to know the
country and its people in a way that the vice president, stuck in
Washington, never could.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla over the event at the Garden, some of Gore's
friends are eager to point out that the vice president also plays a
mean game of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just find it interesting that Bill Bradley spent most of his
Senate career trying to run away from basketball and be accepted as
a senator, but now that he's running for president, he wants to
play it up,'' said Gore confidant Tom Downey, who bonded with the
vice president while playing basketball in the House gym when both
were in Congress. ``Al Gore is a very good athlete and a very good
team ballplayer, a deadly shooter, a fabulous rebounder and a great
competitor, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who averaged 2.6 points a game at Harvard in his
freshman year, might be well advised to concede the basketball
primary.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bradley is polling particularly well among white men in
the Northeast, and his appeal as a sports legend does appear to be
especially potent with guys who may have felt ignored in the last
couple of election cycles in favor of soccer moms, waitress moms
and women in general.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fame as a player began when he was a high school
all-American in Crystal City, Mo. At Princeton, what Bradley
himself has always called ``the myth'' of Bill Bradley took hold.
He was seen as a paragon of nearly superhuman virtue after John
McPhee wrote ``A Sense of Where You Are,'' which was first
published as a New Yorker article when Bradley was only 19.
</P>
<P>
   Yet friends say he managed to maintain perspective while living
life under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   He was also apparently able to maintain his concentration both
on the court and off. College friends remember him coming home
after scoring 40 points in a game and then trundling off to the
library where he'd study until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he went to Princeton. He didn't want to be
stereotyped as a jock,'' said Gary Walters, a former teammate who
is now the school's athletic director. ``Some people never are able
to grow beyond the allure of sport, but he was able to apply what
he gave to basketball in other areas of his life.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   After his college graduation in 1965, Bradley initially spurned
the pros to study at Oxford _ a decision that Walters said
``cemented that image of him in the public's mind as the
incarnation of the scholar-athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Bradley now says, he was not only eager to study
and travel abroad but to escape _ not the game itself, but the
celebrity and expectations that went with it.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe that his game never fully recovered from
that detour, even when he did eventually return to play for the
Knicks, in 1967. And perhaps because the possibility of a future of
public service was something he thought about well before he went
pro, according to friends, he held himself slightly apart from the
sports world, even when he was in it.
</P>
<P>
   From day one he was different, called ``Mr. President'' and
``the professor'' by his teammates. On the road, he would visit art
museums or historical sites while his teammates slept or
entertained women.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate on the road, Dave DeBusschere, now a New York real
estate executive, said he found some of Bradley's activities
mystifying. He even tried to drag DeBusschere along on a visit to a
local prison. ``I go to museums with you,'' he remembers telling
him. ``Isn't that enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the joy of discovery, though, the feelings expressed
in ``Life on the Run,'' his basketball memoir, include loneliness
and resentment at feeling like a circus performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain a performer traveling from city to city with only my
work to sustain me,'' he wrote in that book. ``Some day, I say to
myself, I won't be spending 100 days a year on the road. Travel
disrupts the continuities of life. Seasons of the year become
merely months of basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   He did pick up other useful skills in those years, including one
of incalculable worth to any presidential aspirant: the ability to
fend off unwanted questions. As a Knick, Bradley got plenty of
practice at doing that, whenever possible giving unadorned yes or
no answers. When hit with the same foreign affairs pop quiz that
recently surprised George W. Bush, Bradley simply refused to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his aides, who idolize their man and stick together in a
way that contrasts attractively with the infighting Gore bunch,
also say that Bradley is still able to shut out the crowd noise,
just as he did when shooting free throws. And he realizes that he's
going to have off nights.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the Knicks, he says he stopped following the game
because he just didn't have time to while running for the Senate in
New Jersey. And a friend said that after so rapidly making the
transition from ballplayer to senator, he found he had a lot to
learn, and a stack of homework on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year after he left the NBA, he was the Democratic nominee,''
said the friend. ``That was a big bounce. To play in that league,
it was like going back to his first year with the Knicks all over
again. He had no choice but to turn away from basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Senate colleagues say they saw little evidence of the
selfless willingness to pass the ball for which he is remembered on
the court, press reports on his 18-year legislative career rarely
failed to include a compound sports metaphor or two. (Bradley
laughed that these were typically along the lines of ``The
rebounding was rough because he was boxing out before the back
door.'')
</P>
<P>
   He did keep in touch with friends from the game, though. Jackson
used to visit him in Washington and offer to introduce him to
friends looking to play good pickup games. ``He wanted no part of
it,'' he said, adding that Bradley became less absolute about his
ban on basketball as the years passed.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the Senate, he called some of his old basketball
buddies to say that he was taking some time off, and added that
they would soon be hearing from him.
</P>
<P>
   It was only then, last year, during a post-Senate teaching stint
at Stanford, that he renewed his ties to the game itself, and
became a fan of the school's men and women's basketball teams. He
was especially enamored of the women's style of play, he said,
because it reminded him of the way he used to do it, with more
passing and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   And he decided to write about the lessons he had learned from
basketball, in what essentially became a campaign book, `Values of
the Game.'
</P>
<P>
   As he recounts in that book, ``One day in 1996, I was completing
my regular physical workout on the Stairmaster and treadmill at our
local YMCA in Montclair, N.J., before returning to work in
Washington. After the aerobics, I took a look into the small gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding it empty, he checked out a basketball and went in. ``It
bounced well and the leather felt good. I began to shoot at 10
feet, then 15, then 18. Swish! went the ball as it ripped through
the net. Within minutes I was in another world, alone with my body
movements and my memories. Years had passed since I'd done this,
and yet in several minutes I was back. `I love this game!' I
thought.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Christmas Eve 21 years ago, thieves dropped
through a skylight into a San Francisco museum and made off with
four paintings from the late 17th century, including one attributed
to Rembrandt valued at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now three of the paintings, rather the worse for wear, have
turned up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, left anonymously in a box
at the William Doyle Galleries auction house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eager to get the painting back, it's a relief,'' Harry
S. Parker III, the director of the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco, a group of municipal museums, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But his joy and that of other officials at the M.H. de Young
Memorial Museum, where the theft occurred, was tempered by the
damage done to the paintings and by lingering doubts over whether
this particular Rembrandt, ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' was actually
painted by the Dutch master.
</P>
<P>
   If the daring of the heist's plan seemed reminiscent of ``To
Catch a Thief'' or ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' its execution was
somewhat less suave.
</P>
<P>
   To make their escape, the thieves dragged a big antique Dutch
chest under the skylight, pulled out the drawers to form a
makeshift stepladder and climbed out. More importantly, while three
lesser paintings they stole were together valued at about $75,000,
they missed a true Rembrandt hanging in the same gallery, ``Joris
de Caulerij,'' painted by Rembrandt in 1632.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reflects poorly on the thieves' connoisseurship, Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As,'' he added sadly, ``the condition of the paintings
reflects poorly on their skills as conservators. They were
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Federle Orr, the de Young's curator of European
paintings, flew to New York this week to see the paintings at an
FBI warehouse in Queens, where they are being stored while the
investigation continues, and found the pilfered paintings in bad
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures were obviously ours,'' she said. ``But,
regrettably, the pictures were in a sorry state of preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two paintings left at the Doyle Galleries were ``River
Scene at Night'' by Aert van der Neer and ``Interior of the Church
of St. Lawrence, Rotterdam,'' by Anthonie de Lorme. Both of the
works were painted on thin sheets of wood, and Orr said the van der
Neer painting had been split into three panels and de Lorme's was
``terribly split and buckled.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' she said ``somebody tried to
clean it, leaving a large rectangular space over the face. It made
the varnish opaque, rather than having the luminosity that makes
the image bright and easily read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously something's terribly wrong with the varnish,'' she
went on, explaining the effect was a kind of smudge, similar to the
white rings caused by leaving a wet glass on a varnished cocktail
table.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth stolen painting, ``Harbor Scene,'' by Willem van de
Velde, has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Since the paintings were stolen, in 1978, there was never any
word or clue of where the paintings might be or who took them. But
then on Nov. 2, the paintings were left in a box at the Doyle
galleries, at 175 East 87th Street, with a note inside saying they
were the paintings stolen in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery holds a popular open house on Tuesday mornings, when
people can bring in paintings, furniture, clothing or other objects
to be appraised by its staff of experts. That week's session was
particularly popular, officials at the gallery said, drawing more
than 100 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd had cleared around 11:30, Alan Fausel, the
gallery's vice president for European and American painting, said
that a package was found, with a wooden frame and Masonite sides,
of the type commonly used for shipping paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The police were called, and after they satisfied themselves that
the box did not contain a bomb, it was opened and the paintings and
note were found. The FBI appeared and carried the art off.
</P>
<P>
   Fausel, who is also a featured appraiser on ``Antiques Road
Show'' on Public Television, had once worked at the de Young
Museum. He contacted Dr. Orr, and the two exchanged pictures of the
paintings in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portrait of a Rabbi'' had long been considered a genuine
Rembrandt, Parker said. It had been exhibited by the museum as such
and had traveled to major Rembrandt exhibitions around the country
and abroad. Doubts, however, began to arise in the 1960s when
Abraham Bredius, in his definitive work on Rembrandt, suggested it
was of the Rembrandt School _ a painter of the same time and
technique _ rather than the master himself. That judgment was
backed up in a 1968 revision of the book by Horst Gerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to the 60s, everybody loved it,'' Parker said, adding that
new scholarship had discredited a number of Rembrandts. ``I
remember a few years back, the Met had a Rembrandt exhibit and some
of our favorite Rembrandts' bit the dust, even `Man with a
Helmet.'''
</P>
<P>
   With new techniques for analyzing paint, he said, it might be
possible to authenticate the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Macmillon, a spokeswoman for the museum, said: ``It was
a Rembrandt when it was stolen. We hope it will be a Rembrandt when
it comes back.''

DELL REPORTS EARNINGS ON TARGET AND GROWING SHARE OF PC MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After warning in October of an earnings squeeze because of
rising memory chip prices, Dell Computer Corp. reported
third-quarter earnings Thursday that met analysts' revised
estimates. But the company's unit shipments grew at more than twice
the industry rate as Dell continues to gain market share from other
personal computer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dell reported its results, its shares rose $2, to
$43.4375. The stock edged up slightly in after-hours trading. Dell
shares are down 21 percent from their 52-week high of $55.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Oct. 29, Dell reported earnings of $289
million, or 11 cents a diluted share, down 25 percent from $384
million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales
rose 41 percent, to $6.78 billion from $4.82 billion. The results
reflect a charge of $194 million associated with the purchase of
ConvergeNet Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Without the charge, Dell earned $483 million, or 18 cents a
share, matching analysts' estimates, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings. Analysts
said the only negative in the report was that revenue growth of 41
percent trailed shipment growth of 59 percent, suggesting that
average selling prices have come down, possibly because Dell is
selling a higher percentage of consumer machines, which have lower
prices than servers or notebook computers do.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, chairman and chief executive Michael
Dell said he thought the memory chip situation had improved
slightly. He added that the company had recently struck a deal with
Samsung to improve availability of flat panel displays for notebook
computers. Rising memory chip prices narrowed Dell's profit margins
and reduced earnings in the third quarter, while a shortage of flat
panel displays delayed notebook shipments, limiting revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   On memory chips, ``the cost appears to be leveling off, or
moderating,'' Dell said. ``It's still a pretty volatile
situation,'' he continued. ``We faced a situation like this four
years ago, and we know how to win in that environment, too. We were
more profitable than any of our competitors'' in the third quarter,
even after the warning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said he did not see any significant slowing because of Year
2000 spending freezes in the coming quarter, in part because the
company's consumer business is growing so rapidly. ``What we're
hearing from customers on Y2K is it's less of an impact than people
might have originally thought, and to some extent offset by
customers who are in an intense buying mode and increased consumer
sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture here is Dell is taking share from everybody
else,'' said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read.
``They not only have a cost advantage by selling direct, but
they're able to exploit the Internet to really know and talk to
their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Compaq, IBM and HP, the dealer channel is like a moat,
preventing them from interacting with their customers,'' he said.
``The only negative is Dell is getting so huge that to continue to
grow at 40 percent becomes increasingly difficult.''

CONGRESS, ADMINISTRATION REACH AGREEMENT TO REVAMP SYSTEM OF ORGAN
DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a last-minute plea by Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, members of Congress have
cleared the way for the Clinton administration to enact a
long-delayed regulation that will revamp the nation's system for
distributing donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal struck Wednesday night between Shalala and members
of the House and Senate who were ironing out details on health
spending, the regulation, first proposed in February 1998, will go
into effect 42 days after the spending bill is adopted. It should
be in place by late December or early January, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settles, at least for now, a bitter economic and
political feud over which patients should have priority in
receiving human organs, the nation's scarcest medical resource. The
United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit agency that
coordinates distribution of donated human organs, will now be
required to alter its policies so organs are shared broadly across
regional lines, with sickest patients being given first priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rule is an important one,'' said Dan Mendelson, associate
director for health at the Office of Management and Budget, who
took Shalala to Capitol Hill Wednesday night to press her case
before a conference panel of House and Senate appropriators, who
were considering a provision that would have delayed the rule at
least four more months. ``It's one where lives are truly at stake.
To see it come to fruition is really very exciting for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point, said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was that Shalala
agreed to give opponents of the plan a 21-day period for public
comment, and then take an additional 21 days to review those
comments. Until Wednesday, the administration had insisted that the
rule be put into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred a longer time,'' Young said, who had
earlier proposed a six-month delay, which he later reduced to four
months. ``My whole effort here was to guarantee an opportunity for
those who are professionals in the organ transplant field to be
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forcing broader sharing, the rule gives the
secretary of health and human services final authority over organ
allocation policy, a provision the network bitterly opposed.
Thursday however, a spokesman for the network said its board would
meet next week to figure out how to comply with the rule. ``We are
moving forward,'' said the spokesman, Bob Spieldenner.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Spieldenner and other opponents suggested that
the fight over who has final say over transplant policy might not
be settled. The National Organ Transplant Act, the 1984 law that
created the organ allocation system, expired several years ago, and
some members of Congress have indicated that they would use the
reauthorization process to try to strip Shalala of her authority.
Last week, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., introduced legislation that
would do just that; he was joined by more than two dozen
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental sticking point revolves around the secretary's
policy-making authority,'' said Martha Kendrick, a lobbyist for the
Patient Access to Transplant Coalition, a group of 31 small and
mid-sized transplant centers that are opposed to the new rule.
``That issue is ultimately not going to be resolved until Congress
finishes the reauthorization.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 62,000 Americans are now waiting for a heart, lung,
liver, kidney or pancreas, and last year alone, 4,000 people died
waiting. The dispute over who should receive donated organs is so
intense that when Shalala first proposed the overhaul last year,
some states responded by passing laws prohibiting organs from being
sent out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, patients are ranked according to the
severity of their sickness. The country is divided into 62 local
areas, which range in size from a few counties to entire states and
several states, and range in population from 1 million to 12
million. Those 62 areas are lumped into 11 regions. When an organ
becomes available, it is offered locally first. If a matching
patient is not found, it is then offered regionally.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiting time varies greatly from region to region, a
factor . Shalala cited in announcing her plan for wider sharing.
The proposal immediately touched off a fight between large and
small transplant centers, with small centers insisting Shalala's
rule would put them out of business by steering organs to big-city
hospitals. So Congress stepped in, imposed a moratorium and ordered
the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, to investigate the organ sharing system.
</P>
<P>
   The institute looked only at livers, the scarcest organ. Its
report, issued in July, recommended widespread sharing, but not as
widespread as Shalala had initially proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it called for the country to be broken up into
regions of about nine million people each, with donated livers
going to the sickest patients in each region first. The authors
also urged that Shalala create an independent panel to advise her
on organ-sharing matters.

ALBRIGHT OFFERS TO ABSORB CRITICISM FOR DEAL ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive. EDS: A second take will move by 9:30 ET.) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
volunteered to be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion
rights groups if President Clinton compromises with Congress on a
deal to free nearly $1 billion the United States owes the United
Nations, senior administration officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As a Cabinet member who supports abortion rights, Albright has
urged the White House to cut a deal that administration officials
fear could strike some Clinton supporters as a retreat from the
president's pledge to defend abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the administration has refused a demand from House
conservatives, led by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., to cut off
U.S. financing to international organizations that promote abortion
rights overseas, as a condition to repaying Washington's debt to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   White House political operatives, in particular, have been loath
to alienate a core Democratic constituency _ women voters _ by
backing away from Clinton's commitment on abortion rights abroad to
resolve an increasingly embarrassing foreign policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Albright, a former ambassador to the
United Nations, has aggressively lobbied Republican lawmakers and
Clinton to resolve several issues that threaten American global
leadership: the U.N. dues, debt relief to impoverished countries
and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   She recently told John Podesta, the White House chief of staff,
that if services offered by abortion rights groups overseas are
only minimally affected by any deal, the administration should be
willing to compromise its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women's groups are going to be outraged, as a pro-choice,
woman secretary of state, she is prepared to meet with them, and
explain to them why this does not harm our fundamental position,
but that getting the U.N. dues is critical for our national
security,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.

JUDGE'S FINDINGS MAY LEAVE A FEW LEGAL OPENINGS FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive. EDS: A 2NDTAKE will move by 9:30 ET.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although mostly solid, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings
in the Microsoft antitrust trial may have been so sweeping as to
leave the company room to chip away at them on appeal, some leading
antitrust experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say the judge's document is striking in its
eloquence in concluding that the big software maker is a monopolist
whose anticompetitive tactics have harmed consumers and stifled
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But in relentlessly upholding the government and 19 states on
point after point, rejecting volumes of the company's written
evidence, his findings do appear vulnerable to appellate scrutiny
in a couple of areas, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Those points suggest the likely road for Microsoft's legal team
and a possible path toward avoiding the harshest sanctions being
considered by the government _ like breaking up the company or
forcing it auction off or give away its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will not discuss its legal strategy or what it might
offer as an olive branch, if any, when its legal team meets with
government lawyers in Jackson's chambers in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft believes that Jackson's findings, as damaging as
they appear, leave the company some legal openings. On Saturday, in
a conference call to worried Wall Street analysts and institutional
investors, Microsoft's general counsel, William H. Neukom, was
asked repeatedly about an antitrust scholar's comment that judge's
findings ``poured a lot of concrete'' in the case, analysts who
took part said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Findings of fact are not bulletproof,'' insisted Neukom,
according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an appeals court can toss out portions of Jackson's
findings only if it finds them to be ``clearly erroneous'' _ the
legal standard embodied in the federal rules for court procedure. A
final opinion, by contrast, is far more subject to being overruled
based on differing interpretations of how the antitrust laws apply
to the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But one leg of the judge's findings open to challenge, the
antitrust experts say, is his conclusion that there is no real
consumer benefit or technical efficiency from Microsoft's decision
to meld its Internet browsing software with its industry-standard
Windows operating system. Microsoft did so, the judge found, only
to thwart competition from Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   The government's allegation that Microsoft illegally tied its
browser to Windows appeared to suffer a severe blow when a federal
appeals court ruled in a related case last year that Microsoft
should be free to blend its browser into Windows as long as it can
make a ``plausible claim'' of business efficiency or consumer
benefit from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say there is no pro-competitive effect of integrating the
browser and the operating system is an extreme position because of
the appeals court's earlier decision,'' said Andrew Gavil, a Howard
University law professor. ``That finding is a live target on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the findings of fact that may well be open to
challenge, antitrust experts say, is Jackson's rather sweeping
assessment of the consumer harm from Microsoft's practices. They
point, for example, to the judge's conclusion that ``the ultimate
result'' of Microsoft's practices are that ``some future
innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
law school, observed that Jackson's writing on the harm Microsoft
has caused consumers includes ``phrases of elegance reminiscent of
Learned Hand,'' referring to the often quoted federal judge. ``But
the issue for review with whether those elegant statements are made
more by way of assertion than being grounded in the evidence,'' he
said. ``I do think that is open to question.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential soft spots in Jackson's findings of fact could be
significant in any out-of-court settlement talks between Microsoft
and the government. The public statements by both Microsoft and the
Justice Department and the states suggest a level of acrimony that
may make a settlement difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the government recognizes that these findings are not
bomb-proof, there could well be a settlement,'' said George L.
Priest, a Yale University law professor.

 &HT;    Rider tells Hawks, `Make me the man'
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ Isaiah Rider has given the Hawks an ultimatum: ``Make
me the man, like Steve Smith was, or get me out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider issued the statement after Wednesday's 102-97 overtime
loss to Vancouver. It might have been made in frustration after the
loss to the lowly Grizzlies, who defeated the Hawks for the first
time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But Rider said earlier in the week that he wanted to become the
focus of the offense. ``It doesn't make sense if I don't get the
ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lenny Wilkens and Hawks players wouldn't discuss Rider's
comments after Thursday's practice. General manager Pete Babcock,
who is accompanying the team on the trip, said: ``There are still
no surprises with J.R., but that doesn't prevent us from being
disappointed from time to time. His performance in Vancouver was
less than professional. He knows how we feel about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Vancouver, Rider didn't start and scored only five
points on 2-for-7 shooting. He played only 14 minutes and spent
most of the game on the bench because, Wilkens said, ``He obviously
didn't want to be out there. I didn't think he was ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I took him out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Rider is scheduled to play here in Portland for the
first time since being traded to the Hawks last summer. But he said
he would just as soon part company with his current team five games
into the season if the Hawks aren't going to make him the
centerpiece of their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go back to the Timberwolves _ no, they're pretty
good right now. I'd rather go back to _ I don't know ...''
</P>
<P>
   Rider obviously does not share the optimism Wilkens and Babcock
have for their young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a strong team,'' Rider said. ``That's why you got
to give (the ball) to me. Everybody knows I can score. I've scored
against double-teams my whole career. It's Mitch (Richmond),
Latrell (Sprewell) and Mike (Jordan). I'm there with every one of
the best (No.) 2 guards. Through good times, bad times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to play the game. They need to make it happen, and
tonight I think is the turning point, whether they're going to give
it to me or whether they need to let me go.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was upset, Rider responded, ``Yes, I'm upset.'' Then
he said being used off the bench was not the reason he was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset we lost,'' he said. ``Like I told Lenny about not
starting: I'm not gonna say anything. I'm not gonna complain. But
this is quite ridiculous. I'm not a starter on this team, so the
onus isn't on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Should he be a starter? He said, ``It don't matter to me, not as
long as I get my minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I like Lenny,'' Rider added later. ``I don't think it's
a me-and-Lenny thing. I think it's (that) he doesn't want to step
on other people's toes, for whatever (reason). This is not a strong
team. No. This is not a strong team, and you have to give it to me.
There's no reason why they shouldn't give it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is also funny because in practice I'm the go-to man.
There's no situation in which I can't score.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated a message he sent Monday night in Denver after he
scored 28 in a 15-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line is, a team like this, you gotta know who's who and
what's what. This isn't the Blazers, where you spread it around. Or
the Lakers. ...That's my whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on this team don't move,'' Rider said. ``When you're on
a team (that doesn't) have a lot of scorers, you give me room, you
got to move, set screens and rebound. That's been my whole thing
since preseason. I got to go one-on-one, and my own teammates are
running toward me. What's that? Give me room. We need to get it out
in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not been outplayed by nobody _ and I need to be the man
on this team.''

 &HT;    Georgia sounds its Bell
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Jim Donnan was scanning the Bulldogs' pregame
media packet during Tuesday's weekly news conference when he made a
startling discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe he's not on that list of players for
all-conference,'' the Georgia coach said to no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to junior linebacker Kendrell Bell, who, in his
mind at least, was inexplicably omitted from the Bulldogs' list of
All-SEC candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Claude?'' Donnan asked, his eyes scanning the room for
sports communications director Claude Felton. ``What do we have to
do to get him on that ballot? Kendrell Bell, can we put him on that
list?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we'll put him on there,'' Felton answered from the back
of the room.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight was understandable. Since arriving on campus this
summer, Bell has been sneaking up on a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is not what one would call a blue-chip prospect. Nearly
everybody missed on him when he was a senior at Augusta's Laney
High. Because of poor academics, only Georgia and N.C. State
bothered to talk to him. And it was only after a phenomenal
sophomore season at Middle Georgia Junior College that the Bulldogs
got excited about him.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing game tape and sending recruiting coordinator
Rodney Garner to Cochran to check out Bell personally, Georgia
decided to offer him a scholarship, even though it had no immediate
need for linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the Bulldogs thought.
</P>
<P>
   Before preseason camp could get under way, two linebackers _
senior Mike Luckie and redshirt freshman Kawika Mitchell _
transferred to other schools. Later, junior Adrian Hollingshed
suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. Later still, starting
middle linebacker Will Witherspoon went down with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Four starts later, Bell has emerged as one of the best players
on a fast-improving Georgia defense. And, if Donnan is to be
believed, a legitimate All-SEC candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting here was the first thing,'' Bell said this week.
``Once I did that, I think I've been able to adjust and step up to
the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. Despite his early lack of playing
time, Bell has risen to fifth on the team in tackles with 42. He's
tied for the team lead with four sacks, has a team-high 10
quarterback pressures, has forced three fumbles and has blocked two
punts and a field goal. His best game was against Kentucky when he
had 10 tackles and three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is most effective when blitzing. All three of his kick
blocks and most of his sacks have come when he broke through the
middle of the line of scrimmage. He has the uncanny knack of
finding the soft spot in opponents' protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bell tried to explain the method to his madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to do is size up everybody on the line,'' he said.
``If I've got a 300-pound guy on me and he's back on his heels in
his stance, I'm going to hit him high on his shoulder pads and
force him back. If I've got like a 200-pound guy, I might try to go
right through him. It just depends. I just try to find the weakest
link and take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach Brad Lambert was asked what makes the
6-foot-2, 240-pound Bell so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power,'' he said. ``Power and speed. He just gets to the line
quick and hits with lot of power when he gets there. It's not often
you get that kind of speed and quickness in a guy that size.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is as surprised as anybody at his production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I had it in me. I just didn't know it was going
to come out like it has,'' he said. ``At the beginning of the
season, I was just hoping for some playing time. Things have just
kind of unfolded for me. I got an opportunity and I'm just trying
to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it's probably safe to say that Bell has.

 &HT;    Those terrific Tigers
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEWANEE, Tenn. _ The campus sits atop a mountain and is
surrounded by 10,000 acres of southeast Tennessee pine. In an age
when colleges have increasingly become New Age and high-tech, this
campus is a step back in time.
</P>
<P>
   It is the University of the South, better known as Sewanee, an
exclusive liberal-arts college that has provided an Ivy
League-caliber education since Episcopalian priests founded it in
1857. ``To me it's one of the most beautiful places on earth,''
former Tennessee football coach Johnny Majors said. His father,
Shirley, was the coach at Sewanee from 1957 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, Sewanee once housed the greatest team in
college football history.
</P>
<P>
   You can have Nebraska of 1971. Or Alabama of 1992. The folks
here will gladly take the Sewanee Tigers of 1899.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago this week, Sewanee did something no team
had attempted before or will attempt again. The team played five
games in six days, all on the road. And they won every game _ by
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents were not patsies. The Tigers started at Texas on
Nov. 9, and before returning home beat Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, Tulane,
LSU and Mississippi by a combined score of 91-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here as coach, I told myself I was going to take
this program to places it had never been before,'' said John
Windham, in his fourth year at Sewanee. ``Then I found out about
the team of 1899. It is the most incredible thing I've ever heard
of, but not a lot of people know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This accomplishment began with a quirk of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee, which began playing football in 1891, went 4-0 in 1898,
including a victory against Vanderbilt, 90 miles to the west in
Nashville, Tenn. Luke Lea, the 20-year-old Sewanee team manager,
was convinced Vanderbilt shortchanged the Tigers on their share of
the gate receipts, so an 1899 game was not scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the team manager was more like the athletics
director. He recruited the players, made the schedule and even
hired the coach. So Lea brainstormed, trying to find a way to make
up for the revenue Sewanee would lose by not playing Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   This was the idea he hit upon: Sewanee had a game scheduled at
Texas. He would schedule four more games in five days and let the
team play them on the way home. Lea also negotiated a deal that
would give Sewanee half the gate receipts at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Lea spent a lifetime making big deals. He went
to law school and became a United States senator by age 32. He also
founded The Tennessean newspaper in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy did think in big terms. He was quite enterprising,''
said Lea's daughter, Mary Louise Tidwell of Nashville. ``He had
unbounding energy and was a hard man to say no to. He would always
persuade you that his way was the only way.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Nov. 7, 1899, 21 players, a coach, a manager and a trainer
rode down the mountain on the Mountain Goat, a special train that
ran between Sewanee and the tiny town of Cowan, some 10 miles
below. There they boarded another train to begin a 31-hour ride to
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The trip almost never got started. In the group's enthusiasm to
get on the train in Cowan, the trunk containing their specially
made football shoes was left on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got to Nashville, Daddy had the conductor send a
telegram back to Cowan and the shoes were put on the next train,''
said Tidwell, 76. ``He had to talk to a lot of people to get
special handling for those shoes, but they got to Austin just a few
hours before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There were adventures along the way. Team captain Henry
``Diddy'' Seibels, one of three Sewanee players in the College
Football Hall of Fame, told his teammates before the trip that no
one could get hurt. In those days, a player leaving the game
because of injury could not return.
</P>
<P>
   Seibels, however, sustained the first real injury of the trip.
Against Texas, he sustained a gash on his forehead, but he kept
playing. By the end of the trip, plaster was being put on the wound
to hold the skin together.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee beat Texas 12-0, then rode a train all night to Houston
and beat Texas A&AMP;M 10-0 the next day. The Tigers rode 350 miles to
New Orleans and beat Tulane 23-0. After taking Sunday off in New
Orleans, Sewanee traveled 90 miles to Baton Rouge and beat LSU
34-0. After another all-night ride, the Tigers beat Mississippi
12-0 in Memphis for their fifth victory in six days.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, after traveling more than 2,500 miles by train, the
weary team returned home. It took the Mountain Goat back up to
Sewanee, where it received a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mountain showed up,'' said Eph Kirby-Smith, son of
Joseph Lee Kirby-Smith, who played on the team. ``They put the team
on a big flatcar and pulled the whole team up. They celebrated for
two days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy said they built a bonfire that you could see for miles
and miles,'' Tidwell said. ``It was quite a celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee finished 12-0; the only points it allowed were in an
11-10 victory against Auburn, coached by the legendary John
Heisman. After beating North Carolina 5-0 in the final game,
Sewanee declared itself the champ of Southern football.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee still plays football, in NCAA Division III. But for one
shining season, it had the best team in the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about all the things that are happening (in
college football) today,'' said Yogi Anderson, a former Sewanee
player and its director of alumni relations. ``But what those guys
did will never been equaled. It's a record that Sewanee will always
have. No one will touch it.''

GORE, REBUKING CONGRESS, REJECTS POLICY OF ISOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore chastised the
Republican Congress on Thursday for what he cast as its
isolationist stance, calling for an emphasis on diplomacy in
foreign policy as an invaluable tool to stop the spread of nuclear
weapons and stabilize the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, more and more each year, engagement abroad
means a political struggle here at home,'' Gore said in a Veterans
Day speech to about 150 people at the Iowa Veterans Home. Like many
in the audience, Gore, a Vietnam veteran, wore his American Legion
cap, with the insignia of his post in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   His views echoed the Clinton administration's portrayal of
Congress as isolationist, particularly since the stinging defeat
last month by the Senate of the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides to Gore said that while the vice president was not
separating himself from administration policy, he wanted to lay out
his own course for the future. They said a central tenet of a Gore
administration would be reliance on diplomacy to address a range of
issues, including nuclear proliferation and the spread of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the nation should make a commitment ``to conduct
diplomacy with as much seriousness of purpose and maturity of
patriotism as was shown in the aftermath of World War II.'' The
goal, he said, should be ``avoiding conflicts that are avoidable
when we can pursue and achieve our goals wisely through
diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   His advisers said the vice president was seeking support from
voters for his world view, particularly pressing the Senate to
reconsider the test ban treaty; having the United States pay the
nearly $1 billion in dues it owes the United Nations; and
encouraging free markets. They said this was the first of several
foreign policy speeches in which the vice president would lay out
his goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech was categorized by his campaign as ``official''
business, meaning he was to refrain from asking for votes, and
taxpayers were to foot the bill for this leg of a two-day campaign
swing. Nonetheless, his remarks carried an unusually partisan air
for an official Veterans Day speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our best chance of achieving a nuclear test ban is
sacrificed on the altar of partisan politics,'' Gore said, ``that
does not honor our veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Republican leadership of the Senate of having
scrapped the test ban treaty ``without even having the courtesy to
the president and the secretary of defense to have hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   While he did not name his opponents, Gore sought to benefit from
his years of work on arms-control issues, implicitly inviting
comparison with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination, whose command of
international issues has appeared limited.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also outlined a position on military spending different
from that of former Sen. Bill Bradley, his sole rival for the
Democratic nomination, who has said he is satisfied with current
levels of military spending. Gore said such spending needed to be
``enhanced, not reduced.'' He said he was committed to increasing
the pay and the technology available to the nation's forces.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared to invite comparisons with his opponents by
alluding to his military service in Vietnam, where none of them
served. Gore enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam as an Army
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't claim that my military experience matches in any way
what others here have been through,'' Gore said at the veterans
home.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he and his wife, Tipper, knew a bit about Army life,
having lived ``on a private's pay in a house trailer'' at an Army
base, ``where helicopters sometimes blew her laundry off the
clothes line.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in response to reporters' questions, Gore said he opposed
a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag. Such a
measure has cleared the House in the past, but it has always died
in the Senate, and the Clinton administration has opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The matter came up Thursday in Marshalltown, where Rep. Leonard
Boswell, the Iowa Democrat who shared the dais with Gore, told the
audience of veterans that he expected Congress to eventually pass
such an amendment. While many in the audience applauded, Gore did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with what Thomas Jefferson said,'' Gore said later.
``Someone who expresses a view that is contrary to the view of the
overwhelming majority should be allowed to stand undisturbed as a
monument to our commitment to free speech.'' He added, ``I do not
favor amending the Constitution for that purpose.''

CLINTON AND GOP REACH COMPROMISE ON EDUCATION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Okla., Pa.)  (bl)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional Republicans on
Thursday hailed their compromise on his program to hire 100,000
teachers and reduce class sizes in public schools. But it remains
to be seen how much their political victory will benefit the
children it aims to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``School enrollments are exploding, record numbers of teachers
are retiring,'' Clinton said Thursday. And Education Secretary
Richard Riley said the nation would need an additional 2.2 million
teachers in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   But qualified teachers are hard to find, especially in poor
school districts, where the educational needs of students place
huge demands on teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-poverty schools are looked at as boot camps,'' said Amy
Wilkins, a senior associate at the Education Trust, an advocacy
group for the poor. ``This one bill is not going to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is in the first of its seven years, seeks to
reduce class sizes in grades one, two and three in public schools,
so that there are no more than 18 students in a class. The debate
hinges on Clinton's assertion that smaller class sizes are crucial
to better education. The program's backers point to a Tennessee
study, conducted from 1985 to 1989, which concluded that the
greatest benefits from smaller classes come in the poorest urban
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the benefits of the program are apparent
in big cities like New York, which hired 808 new teachers under the
program. New York City has about 72,000 teachers in its public
schools _ and it had 6,000 positions to fill this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of the Great City Schools, a professional
association of the nation's largest urban school districts,
reported last week that out of the $1.2 billion that Congress
appropriated last year, $281 million went to 54 large urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The council said that 3,558 teachers have been hired in 40 of
those big-city districts under the program. Most were to teach
reading, math, bilingual classes and special education classes.
Their salaries and benefits, paid for with federal money, came to
more than $167 million. An additional 22,000 teachers received
professional training.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the second year of the program will continue to
pay the salaries of the teachers hired in the first year, and
includes money to hire more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the new teachers hired were not fully
certified under state or local standards _ evidence of ``the
difficulty in finding qualified teachers,'' the report said, and a
clue to the crux of the problem: getting skilled teachers to work
in the neediest schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican stance in the budget negotiations was
straightforward: ``If classroom reduction means hiring unqualified
teachers, then don't do it,'' said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., a
former schoolteacher and the chairman of the House Education
Committee, who negotiated the compromise with the White House.
``Above all, we want quality teachers in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the council's report, there are no independent
qualitative assessments of what the program has accomplished
nationwide. The impact of the money appropriated last year was not
felt until the beginning of this school year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that the money spent so far would ``hire
more than 29,000 teachers and reduce the average class size for 1.7
million children.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring thousands of new teachers is a boon for the National
Education Association, the nation's largest professional employee
organization, representing more than 2 million teachers and school
administrators _ a group that traditionally supports Democratic
candidates, along with a handful of moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the political compromise struck Wednesday, Republicans agreed
to spend more money than last year in exchange for more stringent
restrictions on how it will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is to be voted on by the House and Senate next
week, means that the program will receive $1.3 billion in federal
money for the coming school year, said White House Budget Director
Jack Lew. Last year, its first, the program received $1.2 billion.
This year, Clinton sought $1.4 billion. The two sides split the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the two sides struck says 25 percent of the money can
be spent on training teachers, rather than hiring them. In the past
year, it was 15 percent. Teachers hired under the program must be
certified under state standards. Schools where at least one-tenth
of the teachers are uncertified would be able to use all the money
they receive for teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This increased flexibility and higher standards are a victory
for quality education in this country,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also agreed to drop a demand that school
districts be allowed to spend money on ``any other local need,''
which the administration and the National Education Association
said would open a loophole allowing the money to underwrite school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans sought additional restrictions even though they
hailed the program as passed last year. Back then, Goodling called
it ``a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more
important, a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed
up with Washington mandates, red tape and regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the program became one of the biggest sticking
points in this year's budget negotiations, since Democrats and
Republicans both want voters to see them as advocates for education
and children.

<P>
   If there is no settlement, the vulnerable parts of the findings
of fact could be important on appeal, mainly to curb the kinds of
sanctions that the courts may impose. Antitrust experts do not
expect Microsoft to win the case, even on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, what Microsoft is going to try to do is whittle down
the mountain,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings
Institution. But even if Microsoft succeeds in convincing an
appeals court that bundling its browser with Windows is not
illegal, he added, ``there is still an awful lot left.''
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust experts say that Jackson's finding of monopoly
power _ a crucial first step to winning an antitrust case, but not
a violation on its own _ seems unshakable. They also say that the
findings do seem to establish that some of Microsoft's contracts
with computer makers like Compaq and with Internet service
providers like America Online were exclusionary, by unfairly
limiting the distribution, promotion and use of competing software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal liability, if any, will be determined in the
next stage of the case when Jackson issues his conclusions of law,
unless there is a settlement. Before the judge rules, Microsoft
will offer its view of what legal precedents should apply to his
findings of fact, as will the government. Microsoft will argue that
some its actions may look bad, but they did not actually cross the
threshold to illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Microsoft can get parts of the findings set aside, it
will face a milder ruling eventually and improve its chances of
milder remedies. By shedding the bundling issue and reducing its
liability for consumer harm, antitrust experts say, Microsoft may
avoid the drastic steps of being broken up or being forced to
auction off or license the crown jewel of its intellectual
property, Windows.
</P>
<P>
   More moderate sanctions would require significant changes in
Microsoft's behavior. But the company has shown some willingness to
discuss them in earlier rounds of settlement discussions, according
to people close to those talks. One recommendation, they say, is
what is known as the ``clean Windows license.''
</P>
<P>
   This would involve opening up Microsoft's secret contracts with
personal computer makers. Microsoft, they say, would have to
publish its price lists so that all comparable PC makers pay the
same price to license Windows. Volume discounts, as in any
business, would be available. But Microsoft's ``market development
agreements'' _ sometimes running over 100 pages _ would have to
offer the same terms to all. A key part of the government's case is
that PC makers that favored Microsoft software were rewarded with
lower Windows prices than those who promoted or distributed the
products of Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be regarded as a mild remedy at the moment, but if you
look at the judge's findings, so many of Microsoft's transgressions
and so much of its ability to abuse its market power goes away with
a clean Windows license,'' said Robert E. Hall, an economist at
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The other instrument of Microsoft's control of the industry,
according to the government, has been how it has used its
technology: giving preferred access to friendly companies and
denying access to rivals like Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the narrative of the government's case begins with
Netscape trying to obtain access to the links that enable other
companies programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating system,
known as application programming interfaces. Microsoft maintains
that it already publishes these and says the notion of ``hidden
APIs'' is an industry myth largely created by its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But one possible sanction mentioned by antitrust experts, would
be to force Microsoft to publish these technology interfaces to
Windows and appoint an independent body to monitor that disclosure.
Microsoft has never offered to take such a step in settlement
discussions with the government, according to people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet antitrust experts say that after Jackson's powerful findings
against Microsoft, the company has to put something new on the
table, if it has any chance of interesting the government in
engaging in serious settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an important part of the political process, a
well-administered technology disclosure requirement could make a
lot of sense and would not run the risk of doing a lot of economic
harm, as the most drastic sanctions would,'' said Hall of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not saying what it might be willing to do, but
providing assured access to its technology would be preferable to
being forced to auction it off or give it away. It would still own
its own intellectual property, but the terms of access for the rest
of the industry would be open and clear-cut.

PALESTINIANS CRITICIZE ISRAEL DURING MRS. CLINTON'S VISIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ In a return visit to Palestinian territory
Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton was acclaimed anew as a champion
of Palestinian nationhood, and then listened with visible
discomfort as her hosts at a health care function here excoriated
Israel for its alleged toxic contamination of Palestinian air and
water.
</P>
<P>
   Going furthest of all was the other first lady in the room: Suha
Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian Authority president, who in a
rare public address claimed that the Israeli military had routinely
used carcinogenic crowd-control gases in Gaza and the West Bank,
creating a severe public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have been subjected to the daily intensive use of
poisonous gas by the Israeli forces, which have led to an increase
in cancer cases among women and children,'' Mrs. Arafat asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Her comment sparked an immediate uproar in Israel, with
opposition legislators demanding a retaliatory halt to planned West
Bank troop withdrawals. Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued his own
swift denunciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These comments have no connection to reality, and it would
have been better if they would have never been said,'' the prime
minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poisoning the public atmosphere does not help in bringing
about success in these negotiations,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of her tour in the Middle East, Mrs. Clinton,
the first lady and presumptive senatorial candidate, who has tried
hard to avoid such controversy in her regional tour, was
unavoidably in the middle of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The day began peaceably enough, with a Jerusalem hotel breakfast
with Nava Barak, the prime minister's wife, and Reuma Weizman, the
Israeli president's wife. With her daughter Chelsea and the Baraks'
daughter Michal, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Barak spent 90 minutes
viewing new exhibits and laying a wreath at Yad Vashem, the
Holocaust memorial and museum.
</P>
<P>
   And after her two-hour foray into Palestinian territory, she
returned to a cordial but uneventful celebrity's welcome at the
Western Wall in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. Chaim
and Libby Friedman, a vacationing Orthodox couple from Rockland
County, watched as Mrs. Clinton headed toward the segregated
women's section of the wall with Mrs. Barak, their daughters and a
sunglassed phalanx of Secret Service and Shin Bet bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what her politics are,'' mused Friedman as the
entourage passed. Commenting on Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent in
the Senate race, he said, ``Giuliani is tough. You know what he
stands for.'' But Mrs. Friedman followed Mrs. Clinton to the wall,
chatted with the her and returned to pronounce her ``a nice
person.'' Friedman did not disagree: ``She comes across very
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Clinton frequently noted during her 30-hour tour here,
this was her fifth visit to Israel, and the fourth since she moved
into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But her intimate knowledge of Israeli and Palestinian politics
did not make it any easier to bridge the short but sharp divide
between Ramallah and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in Ramallah to announce a $3.8 million U.S.-financed
maternal care program, Mrs. Clinton was greeted with a consistent
message: It takes an independent state to raise a healthy child,
Palestinian officials insisted. Calling ``the legacy of three
decades of Israeli occupation'' one of environmental despoliation
and rampant disease, they argued that only sovereignty and Israeli
withdrawal would allow Palestinians to remedy their medical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in remarks at the opening of the program here, had
herself stressed the acute health care needs in the West Bank and
Gaza. Fewer than half of the area's expectant mothers receive any
prenatal care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she devoted most of her brief address to the peace
negotiations that were renewed here in Ramallah Thursday morning.
``This visit is particularly meaningful to me because today the
Palestinian and Israeli people are at a crossroads, ready to take
the hard decisions necessary for a just and lasting peace,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say on behalf of the president and the
administration that you can count on the United States and the
strong U.S.-Palestinian relationship as you move forward on the
path to peace,'' she added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then, in what turned into a hard-edged West Bank version of the
``listening tours'' she conducted as a prospective Senate candidate
in New York, Mrs. Clinton sat mute as public health professionals
alternated attacks on Israel with effusive praise for her 1998
remark favoring an eventual Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to remind you of the words that you said to
Israeli and Palestinian children,'' said Jihad Mashal, the
Palestinian health minister. ``Words that are inscribed in the
hearts of all Palestinians, when you told them that the path to a
just and real peace is the establishment of a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Clinton actually said regarding Palestinian statehood
last year _ in a spontaneous comment she never retracted _ was a
more nuanced call for Palestinians to assume responsibility for
their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking via satellite to an international gathering of
teen-agers in Europe, Mrs. Clinton had stated in response to a
question that it was ``in the long-term interests of the Middle
East for Palestine to be a state and for it to be a state that is
responsible for its citizens' well-being, a state that has
responsibility for providing education and health care and economic
opportunity to its citizens, a state that has to accept the
responsibility of governing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are hardly the stuff of drama in Israel itself,
where most Cabinet ministers acknowledge that they see Palestinian
independence as an inevitability. The real statehood issues are
ones of terms and timing.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's statement has been viewed as a political
problem in New York. And it created a sensation among Palestinians,
who had never heard such a high-profile American approvingly link
the terms ``state'' and ``Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks made by Palestinian officials Thursday touched off
even more criticism hours later, with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
aides in New York chiding Mrs. Clinton for not confronting Mrs.
Arafat. The fallout prompted Mrs. Clinton's office to offer a
written statement by the first lady: ``What was said today in
Ramallah is an example of why the president at Oslo urged the
parties to refrain from making inflammatory charges or engaging in
excessive rhetoric and to deal with any issues at the negotiating
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's other recent statement on local sovereignty
controversies seemed unfamiliar to Palestinian officials in
Ramallah Thursday: her letter to Orthodox leaders in New York in
July supporting Jerusalem's status as Israel's ``eternal and
indivisible'' capital. Yet they pointedly reiterated the
longstanding Palestinian demand for a state incorporating
Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, including all of the Old City, with
the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock mosque high above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I hope we will host you in our homeland in our
capital, Jerusalem,'' said Mashal.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Mrs. Clinton kissed Mrs. Arafat goodbye and
departed for Jerusalem, where she would enter the gates of the Old
City as Mrs. Barak's guest.

GROUPS OFFER WAY TO TEACH BIBLE IN CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NADINE BROZAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of arguing over whether the Bible ought
to be taught in public schools, 20 national organizations from
across the ideological spectrum have joined to produce a booklet
that spells out how to do so without breaching the wall between
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced on Thursday at a news conference in Manhattan, a
booklet, ``The Bible and Public Schools: A First Amendment Guide''
published by the National Bible Association and the First Amendment
Center, has the imprimatur of groups that have been on opposite
sides of several divisive religious issues. The groups range from
People for the American Way, an organization that tries to combat
the influence of the religious right, to the National Association
of Evangelicals, a group that has supported school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaching agreement was a long difficult process,'' said
Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center at
Vanderbilt University, and co-author of the booklet. ``It is easier
to teach about various religions than to deal with Scripture that
is central to the lives of millions of Americans in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The booklet recognizes that the Bible has helped shape history,
culture, art and literature, and it suggests ways to make teaching
about the Bible in public schools acceptable without risking
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   What the booklet proposes are courses that do not teach the
Bible per se but that teach about the Bible. Students might learn
how the Bible influenced history or how it played a role in the
struggles for civil rights. Or the Bible could be analyzed as a
work of literature.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet urges educators to emphasize that different cultural
groups interpret the Bible differently and in fact, advises against
using any single version but incorporates Hebrew, Catholic,
Protestant and Orthodox versions into the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet will be distributed to school districts around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible, a point of contention virtually since the
establishment of public schools about 200 years ago, was for many
years simply read verbatim in classrooms with no commentary or
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in 1963
prohibiting organized prayer in public schools, many educators took
the ruling to mean that any mention of Bible was prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its school prayer decision, the Supreme Court went out of
its way to say that study of the Bible or of religion when
presented objectively as part of a secular program of education was
constitutional, yet this word of advice seemingly fell on deaf
ears,'' said Forest Montgomery, counsel for governmental affairs
for the National Association of Evangelicals. ``As a result many
public schools have been wandering in the wilderness almost 40
years, gripped by a kind of religious paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Thomas, special counsel to the National Council of
Churches, said: ``For many years, the fear of stepping over the
lines of acceptability was such that Martin Luther King became a
political reformer, Roger Williams a civil libertarian and the
Pilgrims people who traveled long distances.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult issue for the group drafting the guidelines
was how to deal with the Bible as historical record. ``What is
historical in the Bible and what isn't?'' Haynes asked. ``It is
sacred history of the unfolding divine action in human life? But
what is its secular history, what sources support it?''
</P>
<P>
   These questions are likely to come up during the study of such
events as the creation of the world in Genesis and the account of
the resurrection in the New Testament. On Wednesday, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, announced that he favors teaching the biblical version
of creation along with the scientific theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how evangelical families who regard the Bible as literal
truth might react when their children learned that some people do
not believe that everything in the Bible occurred as recounted,
Kimberlee H. Colby, senior legal counsel for the Christian Legal
Society, said, ``In the big picture, most Christian parents
understand that objective teaching is better than ignoring or
suppressing the Bible.''

GLOBAL CONSOLIDATION REDEFINES THE HOSTILE TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could it be that hostile takeovers have become just a little
friendlier?
</P>
<P>
   When an unwelcome suitor showed up in a company's lobby in the
1980s, the chief executive knew he was confronting the enemy. But
those days are gone and with them the raiders who borrowed heavily
to buy underperforming companies that they later dismantled for a
profit. In their place are deal-savvy corporate executives who want
to seize an edge by acquiring a rival and know their prey well
enough to negotiate a quick compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the art of the hostile takeover is being redefined
as global consolidation proceeds at an ever faster clip.
</P>
<P>
   Such offers have exploded this year. An unprecedented 100
unsolicited bids valued at $364 billion have already been made
worldwide, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. That is
triple the total for 1988 _ the previous record year _ and 21 times
greater than last year. And the largest hostile bid ever was made
last week when Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical giant, bid $80
billion for Warner-Lambert hours after Warner had announced a
cordial merger with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   Buying power in a bull market makes it all possible. Stock is
the preferred currency; it represents 45 percent of the value of
hostile bids this year. (In contrast, it accounted for less than 1
percent in 1988, when 63 percent of hostile deals were for cash.)
``The activity we're seeing now is so dependent on the stock market
going up,'' said Tom Burnett, founder of Merger Insight, an
investor advisory business.
</P>
<P>
   By accepting stock in a new company for their existing shares,
shareholders are betting that a chief executive clever enough to
pull off a hostile offer has the strategic insight to deliver value
to shareholders in the long term too.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, executives need to forgo the distractions of a
protracted fight. Rivals could swoop in and steal market share,
putting their businesses, and their share price, at even greater
risk. A result is that companies feel pressure to seal a deal
quickly or move along to the next one. And haggling in court has
all but disappeared, perhaps one reason the hostile trend has gone
all but unnoticed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the continuing expectation on Wall Street that
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert will resolve their differences in some
mutually agreeable way. Pfizer's offer was a stunner, not only
because Pfizer and Warner-Lambert are partners in marketing some
drugs, but also because the titans of the clubby pharmaceutical
industry have preferred to hammer out deals behind closed doors.
But if recent practices in other industries hold true _ and
Pfizer's bid remains the highest offer _ the three companies may
decide to cut a deal that lets every party walk away consoled.
</P>
<P>
   In May, for instance, AT&AMP;T Corp. pried MediaOne Group, the
fourth-largest cable operator, from the embrace of Comcast, which
had agreed to a $53 billion stock swap in April. How? A knockout
offer of $58 billion in stock and cash that gave Comcast something
to smile about, too _ 4 million additional cable television
subscribers. And last July, the Internet start-up Qwest
Communications wrested US West from the arms of Global Crossing,
but not before agreeing to give up its pursuit of a third company
that Global had agreed to merge with.
</P>
<P>
   When Pfizer announced its offer last week, William Steere, the
chairman, was resolute in his conditions for the deal. But in
recent meetings with investors and analysts, he seems to be
softening. Pfizer is mulling its options, the company now says,
open to the idea of a higher offer or dropping its demand that
Warner rescind certain anti-takeover provisions in the merger
agreement, including a $1.8 billion breakup fee. (Pfizer has sued
Warner-Lambert to revoke the fee and other provisions.)
</P>
<P>
   Further, Pfizer is expected Friday to send a letter to Warner
asking for a quick end to the battle.
</P>
<P>
   A kinder, gentler Pfizer perhaps? Hardly. ``This is about money,
shareholder money,'' Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's president, said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's posturing, the outcome is far from
certain. Many analysts and investors say privately that they prefer
the long-term growth prospects of an American Home and Warner
combination. But a linkup with Warner would make Pfizer a
powerhouse in research and too big for rivals to ignore. One thing
is sure: If American Home fails at this merger attempt, its third
in a year and a half, it will have little room to negotiate demands
with its next partner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert has begun agitating for a quick resolution, too.
A long court battle _ over its anti-takeover provisions _ could
jeopardize its relationship with Pfizer. The two are partners in
the development and marketing of the highly successful
cholesterol-reducing drug, Lipitor, and that relationship is now
strained. In a drawn-out battle, ``there is a certain anxiety and
uncertainty that leads to corporate paralysis,'' said Kris Jenner,
a pharmaceutical and biotechnology analyst at T. Rowe Price, the
mutual fund company in Baltimore, which owns all three stocks.
``Non-productivity sets in, and that allows competitors to gain
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the executives in the pharmaceutical industry have
managed an uncommon gentility. Much like the technology industry,
drug makers have bet on strategic alliances to grow, fostering
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem in a rapidly consolidating industry is that a
current partner could end up being a predator. And with fewer
industry prizes left, the skirmishes for them could turn nasty. ``A
lot of people are saying this is late-stage craziness,'' Burnett
said of the Pfizer deal.
</P>
<P>
   Is the pharmaceutical industry prepared for such jousting? The
spin doctors at work this past week showed either inexperience with
hostile deals or reluctance. Warner-Lambert was slow to respond to
Pfizer's attack. And Pfizer struggled to present a uniform message
about whether it was revising its offer. That is surprising, given
that American Home, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer are paying four
public relations firms _ along with their own staffs _ to advise
them.
</P>
<P>
   But in one way, at least, hostile deal-making remains the same
as it was in the '80s. When an adviser on the drug deal was asked
if he would be upset if all three companies ended up with different
partners, his reply was all too fitting: ``Who cares? Either way I
get paid.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
OL' Sarge says it's all just Bad Bull _ just a bunch of
2-percenters gone t-sip.
</P>
<P>
   That's Aggiespeak for the old-time Texas A&AMP;M alumni defending
coach R.C. Slocum from the vocal minority that wants him fired, or
bought out, or sent to a pasture on the ninth floor of the Reed
McDonald building _ something like what Texas did to Fred Akers,
David McWilliams and John Mackovic.
</P>
<P>
   But Ol' Sarge forgets something pivotal in determining how the
Aggies should react to a horrible season by A&AMP;M standards. We'll
put this as delicately as possible: Ol' Sarge is old.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M standards have changed. This is an era of expected
successes and higher expectations. This is an era when a combined
score of 25-109 against Texas Tech, Oklahoma and Nebraska is cause
for an upheaval, not a celebration for hanging close at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Ol' Sarge is clinging to old Aggie ways. He's pointing to
Slocum's string of success because Ol' Sarge remembers the days
when a 6-3 season with two games left was good. When a 6-3 mark had
Aggies giddily piling on the timber at the bonfire stack, dreaming
of maybe beating the Longhorns on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are gone. The Aggies today should expect to win
nine or 10 games, compete for a New Year's Day bowl, land at least
50 percent of the state's top recruits and strut into any stadium
knowing they have every piece of the program in place.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those aspirations are gone. The Aggies scare no one. And
while this might not be time to say Slocum should be gone, too,
probably never has Slocum faced two weekends of football like the
ones upon him now.
</P>
<P>
   Call me two pickles short of a barrel, one cord short of a
bonfire, a Dixie Chicken or a 2-percenter. But Slocum's tenure as
coach could hang in the balance over the next two weeks as much
because of when this slide is happening as how.
</P>
<P>
   You can point to the Aggies' pitiful offensive production and
know there's ammunition for the trendy choice _ Broncos offensive
coordinator Gary Kubiak _ to swoop in and get the Aggies whooping
again. You can remember the way Tech running back Sammy Morris
shredded the A&AMP;M defense, the way Southern Miss, Kansas and Baylor
moved the ball right at it, and know the Aggies' defense is decent,
but it's not the Wrecking Crew it was.
</P>
<P>
   You can point to leading rusher Dante Hall's suspension from the
team and wonder if Slocum's steady hand on the program is getting
wobbly. But more than anything, you can point to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At any other point in Slocum's 11-year head coaching career, the
Aggies would have rightfully shrugged over the situation they are
in. Just a glitch, Ol' Sarge would have said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's because over the past 11 seasons the Aggies never had
someone in Austin they could consider a threat to their football
and recruiting supremacy. Mackovic had the personality of pocket
lint. McWilliams' control over the program was as tousled as his
hair. And Akers, well, they called him ``Dead Head Fred,''
remember?
</P>
<P>
   But Mack Brown is practically walking on water as he heads into
recruits' living rooms. He has flair, style and a plan that's easy
to buy into because it has worked wonders in just two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Slocum has become a slouch on the recruiting
trail and his program is falling to pieces. Spend five minutes with
the man, and Slocum's love for the school, his campfire-casual
demeanor and his determination come through like 75,000 Kyle Field
fans yelling, ``Farmers fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruits are listing the Ags among their favorites, and the
roster is splashed with young talent. But this season has fallen to
pieces and the offense remains one-dimensional, although passing
dominates the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   It has the Aggies calling for the coach's hide like they haven't
since Tom Wilson. Chat rooms could just as well be padded cells.
Letters to the editor are seething reports of frustration. A ``Fire
R.C. Slocum'' Web page has been developed. And if Ol' Sarge thinks
it's just the 2-percenters raving, then the Aggies must have an
alumni base of about 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum probably deserves time to heal the wounds, especially
since after Jackie Sherrill broke the rules to jostle the sleeping
giant, Slocum has kept the Aggies roaring for more than a decade.
But one thing the Aggies cannot afford to be is patient. That's not
McWilliams in Austin scratching his head while the Aggies rule.
That's not Mackovic washing down another inexplicable loss with an
'89 Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Aggies' worst nightmare _ a coach making strides and
reawakening the UT giant, while the Aggies wonder how long they
have until they have to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   I would say about two weeks.

FDA ISSUES A HEALTH WARNING ON A WEIGHT-LOSS SUPPLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another round of its escalating battle with the
dietary supplement industry, the Food and Drug Administration
issued a health warning Thursday about a weight-loss product that
is being marketed as a natural remedy but that the agency deems
``an unapproved new drug.''
</P>
<P>
   The product, Triax Metabolic Accelerator, has been sold as a
dietary supplement for the last eight months by Syntrax Innovations
Inc. of Cape Girardeau, Mo. But FDA officials say Triax capsules
can cause heart attack, stroke and other serious illness; they warn
anyone who is taking them to stop immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This capsule contains an active ingredient that is the same as
a minor metabolite of a thyroid hormone,'' said Dr. David Orloff, a
medical officer at the agency. ``The dose that they are
recommending, which is two to four capsules a day, is the
equivalent of as much as five to 10 times a maintenance dose of
thyroid hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Syntrax said he had sold nearly 100,000 bottles of
Triax in its eight months on the market and insisted that it was
safe. He vowed to continue selling it and threatened to sue the
agency for what he called ``irresponsible behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had many doctors who buy this product and give it to
their patients with great results,'' declared the owner, Derek
Cornelius, who said he founded Syntrax 18 months ago. ``We have had
people lose 100 to 200 pounds on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient in Triax is tiratricol, a derivative of a
thyroid hormone. Orloff said a Los Angeles doctor had reported to
the FDA that two of his patients, a husband and wife, had abnormal
thyroid function tests while using the product. The woman, age 38,
also suffered severe diarrhea, a symptom Orloff said was common in
people with overactive thyroid glands.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue does reach the courts, it will most likely
intensify the five-year-old battle between the FDA and the dietary
supplement industry. The dispute centers on a 1994 law, the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act, which severely restricted the
agency's ability to regulate vitamins, herbs and other dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The law gave manufacturers the right to advertise the potential
benefits of supplements, so long as they did not claim that the
products could treat, cure or prevent disease. But in the view of
critics, the statute muddled the line between what is and is not a
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius, 29, the owner of Syntrax, described himself as a
former military officer with an undergraduate degree in
biochemistry. He maintains that because tiratricol occurs naturally
in beef liver extract, it should be classified as a dietary
supplement under the 1994 law.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its warning, the FDA did not move to have Triax
withdrawn from the market. The last time the agency tried to
reclassify a dietary supplement as a drug, and so have the product
removed, it lost in court. Legal experts say the law makes it
difficult for the agency to win reclassification in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agency has persuaded the contract laboratory that
encapsulates Triax to stop manufacturing it for Syntrax. And
Missouri officials have placed on the product an embargo that will
prevent Syntrax from releasing for sale the supply it has on hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornelius said he would continue selling Triax, although he
would not explain how he intended to get around the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other ways to distribute it,'' he said.

<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ Cautiously buoyed by new poll results and
increasingly swarmed by reporters and supporters, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., swept through a half-dozen Veterans Day observances in New
Hampshire on Thursday, taking full advantage of a holiday that
played directly to his military credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The good numerical news came in a poll, by the American Research
Group, which found that among likely Republican voters in New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary, McCain, an
Arizonan, was in a statistical tie with Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain proclaimed himself happy, but counting no unhatched
chickens. ``I want to emphasize that we're still way behind, we
still have a long way to go and there's no doubt we're still an
underdog,'' he told reporters, noting that New Hampshire voters
tended to change their minds repeatedly. In fact, he worried aloud,
ideally such a strong showing in the polls here would come later in
the campaign, when momentum would be easier to maintain until
primary day, Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was complaining, McCain hastened to add. ``It sure
beats the daylights out of no traction at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also proclaimed himself wrong and sorry for a new
campaign advertisement that showed him walking in Arlington
National Cemetery, where his father and grandfather are buried. In
response to criticism, he said, the advertisements will be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a very serious mistake by not getting permission and
violating the regulations of the cemetery,'' McCain said.
``Obviously I would not do such a thing again and I regret the
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood the cemetery's policy that it not be used
for commercial purposes. Otherwise, he added, ``Next thing you
know, the Dunkin' Donuts people will be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls and apologies aside, McCain's day was a solemn and homey
one, a day of bunting and medals and parade twirlers and ``It's a
Grand Old Flag.'' He traveled mainly among veterans whose culture
is so familiar to him after a long career in the Navy that included
five and a half years in Hanoi as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Hampshire Veteran's Home in Tilton Thursday morning,
McCain made a brief speech to aged veterans assembled in their
wheelchairs: ``We think of you today and we praise you and we do
everything we can in a very small way to express appreciation,'' he
said, ``and at the same time we revere the memory of those who made
the ultimate sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's main activity was to visit from veteran to veteran,
among the oxygen tubes and the legs ending in sock-covered stumps,
shaking the men's fingers if their hands were too gnarled to grasp,
and saying, ``Thank you for serving. We're proud of you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the assembled veterans, 63-year-old Robert Gokey of
Tilton, said he had become so enthusiastic about McCain that he had
been riding up and down Main Street, bearing a McCain sticker on
the back of his motorized wheelchair and getting the word out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main thing is, he's for the veterans, and he's got a lot of
good points,'' Gokey said. ``He's the only one that even drew an
interest for me. Normally, I don't even vote.''
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps not a typical day for McCain, with its natural
military orientation, but in his remarks and give-and-take, he
focused much more on foreign policy than on domestic affairs. After
one stop, settling back onto his campaign bus with several
reporters, he said, unprovoked, ``I want to talk for a moment about
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   He is increasingly concerned about the recent Russian attacks on
Chechnya, McCain said, and if he were president, he would threaten
to cut off International Monetary Fund money to Russia unless it
reached ``some kind of peaceful settlement of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poll results showing him neck and neck with Bush in
the Feb. 1 Republican primary, McCain maintained that he would
never run a negative advertisement _ ``Life is too short'' _ and
turned down several opportunities to criticize the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The American Research poll found that among 600 likely
Republican voters polled from Nov. 4 to Nov. 9, 38 percent
supported Bush while 35 percent supported McCain, with a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Seven percent supported
Steve Forbes, it found, other candidates received 4 percent or
less, and 13 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The results stand in some contrast with a Newsweek poll
published earlier in the week. In a survey of voters on Nov. 4 and
Nov. 5, the poll found Bush leading McCain 44 percent to 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the campaign plans to continue its ``building
block'' strategy of concentrating heavily on New Hampshire and
South Carolina now because of their early primaries, then moving
more resources to other states. He said he would participate in two
debates in Iowa, but still had no plans to expend extensive
resources ``on the ground'' for its caucuses in late January. He
has no doubt he will win in Arizona, his home state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, he said, he is focusing on the state's 130,000
veterans, as he demonstrated Thursday when his campaign announced
that it has compiled a list of 10,000 veterans who supported him.
Two busloads of veterans criss-crossed his route, campaigning on
his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Along with veterans, McCain said, he will particularly seek
support from students, who tend to like his views on overhauling
the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   And who else does he plan to cultivate? Oh, he said,
half-smiling, ``Iconoclasts, mavericks, cranks, all of these are
part of the coalition we're building here.''

 &HT;    Tracks paved with gold
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two giants in the NASCAR industry just got bigger.
</P>
<P>
   While Winston Cup drivers bask in the new level of credibility
that Thursday's estimated $2.4 billion television contract brings
to stock car racing, they are not among the happiest men in the
sport today.
</P>
<P>
   Bill France Jr. and Bruton Smith, the two most influential
figures in racing, will reap millions from their cut of the
big-bucks pie, estimated at $400 million annually for six years.
</P>
<P>
   They own 15 of the 21 tracks (71 percent) used for Winston Cup
racing. France and his International Speedway Corp. operate nine
speedways. Smith and his Speedway Motorsports Inc. run six tracks,
including Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR spokesman John Griffin said the television revenue will
be split the way it has been under the existing $100 million
contract: 65 percent to the track owners, 25 percent to the drivers
and 10 percent to NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is too fresh for in-fighting over percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would the tracks be without the owners? Not very far,''
said Larry McReynolds, crew chief of the No. 31 Chevrolet. ``Where
would the owners be without the tracks? At other tracks. If this
track doesn't want us, there's eight more that do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps France saw this day coming. He took over NASCAR, the
family business, in 1972, 20 years before his father, Bill Sr., a
former promoter and NASCAR's founding father, died.
</P>
<P>
   When he stepped down as head of NASCAR in February, Bill Jr.
said he was going fishing. His catch was race tracks. Since
stepping aside, he has added three tracks and is building or
planning three more.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, France seemed to be in an acquisition and building race
with Smith, the wealthy car dealer from Charlotte, N.C., whose
vision brought creature-comforts like private suites and condos to
speedways.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs has been a chess match of a relationship, with France
holding the upper hand because he ruled the sport's governing body.
Sometimes considered a feud, often seen as a rivalry, their
association occasionally has turned antagonistic.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has tried to downplay the friction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media likes to play on that,'' Smith has said.
``I've tried repeatedly to stop it, unsuccessfully. Bill has tried
to help, maybe not as aggressively as he could have, but we've
tried to put that out. Bill knows that he has my commitment of
helping him build NASCAR. As NASCAR grows, that positively affects
me. The better I can make it, the better it is for Speedway
Motorsports.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, France ordered Smith to make improvements at his
new track in Texas, which developed a water drainage problem in its
first race. Smith answered by selling T-shirts that read: ``Shut Up
NASCAR And Race.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also has been on a buying and building binge, acquiring
tracks in California (Sears Point, 1996) and Las Vegas (1998),
which he rebuilt, and building a showplace in Texas. A minority
stockholder in North Carolina Motor Speedway, Smith tried to buy
control of the Rockingham track in 1995 only to see rival Penske
Motorsports Inc., acquire it in a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Penske merged with France's ISC group last May, and the track
became part of France's empire, along with speedways in Michigan
and Fontana, Calif. The bidding and building war came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   France was the driving force behind the new TV deal, convincing
the single-track owners in April that negotiating the rights for
the entire NASCAR season would be more profitable than doing the
bidding individually. The 1999 TV contract is worth an estimated
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a whole heck of a lot of sense to have all our eggs
in one basket instead of scattered around,'' said Paul Sawyer,
president of Richmond International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer bought the 97,000-seat track for $47 million in September
from Atlantic Rural Exposition after having leased it since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR drivers also are pleased with the 25 percent that will
come their way, but they seem more pleased with the exposure. Their
sport has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of confirms the fact that we are a credible sport,''
driver Jeff Burton said. ``This deal is comparable to the NBA and
baseball, and I think it shows how far this sport has come. Any
money that we get from it is an extra bonus that we're not
expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran driver Ricky Rudd said he was pleased for the sport's
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might help offset some of the sponsorship expenses and take
pressure off sponsors to have to put up so much money to maintain
Winston Cup teams,'' Rudd said. ``TV revenue for the Daytona 500 is
a big part of your purse. You go to somewhere like a Martinsville,
Va., and it's a pretty small amount because each one was
negotiating their own TV revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Single-track owners also were smiling. They see reasonable
ticket prices and track improvements.
</P>
<P>
   At the 91,000-seat Pocono Raceway in Pocono, Penn., track owner
Joseph Mattioli said he expected NASCAR's new deal to fetch about
$300 million a year. NASCAR refused to confirm numbers, but
analysts say his estimate is short by about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us in the realm of the NBA and NFL,'' said Mattioli,
a former dentist who financed Pocono's construction in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioli, who currently has contracts with cable stations TBS
and CBS Corp. unit TNN, said he might use his increased
broadcasting money to build an extra highway interchange near the
unique triangle-shaped track that hosts two Winston Cup events a
year.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a road paved with NASCAR gold.

 &HT;    Insiders not surprised by contract value
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ The staggering financial windfall from
NASCAR's new TV contract seemed to be just another figure for
Winston Cup drivers and race teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not that much of a surprise because I felt like it
was going to be a big contract,'' driver Michael Waltrip said of
the deal, worth an estimated $400 million annually. ``When you see
people swarming around here on Sunday, look at how the sport has
grown over the past five years, and think about how the inaugural
Brickyard 400 (in 1994) sold out in about 10 minutes. ... Nothing
shocks anyone any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jack Roush agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty big figure, but the sport is pretty big,
too,'' Roush said. ``So it's no shock. NASCAR has done a real nice
job marketing (the TV package). We'll try to give the advertisers
and fans their money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really keep up with the numbers anyway, but millions
of dollars _ they all run together,'' said a grinning Robert Yates,
who owns the race team of Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the new contract spread slowly around the garage area on
Thursday. Many drivers, including Bill Elliott, were far more
concerned with the day's inaugural practice at the 1.5-mile oval
than thinking about a landmark TV agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my main concern is to get this race car around the
race track,'' Elliott said, as he looked under the hood of the No.
94 Ford. ``I don't have enough information about the (contract) to
form an opinion, but I'm sure it's good for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be good for Elliott and the other drivers. Under
terms of the agreement, the TV revenue will be divided between the
host tracks (65 percent), the race teams (25 percent) and NASCAR
(10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Yates said one-fourth of the money seemed to be fair for the
race teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of concrete and steel to make one of these
facilities, and we don't run there but once or twice a year. ... So
I can be a little sympathetic to their side,'' Yates said. ``I know
we're going to spend all the money we can get ours hands on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy to be involved with NASCAR. I have no
complaints about the (percentages).''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Sabates, who owns the race teams of Sterling Marlin and
Joe Nemechek, expects the new TV deal to benefit the sponsors, who
will be able to focus advertising and marketing on the
NASCAR-chosen stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the sponsors to share in the good times as well,''
Michael Waltrip said. ``In two years, we hopefully won't have to go
to them every time we need more money to make us competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who has had his share of surprises this season with
the resignation of his long-time crew chief Ray Evernham and the
impending departure of five members of his famed ``Rainbow
Warriors'' pit crew, was amazed that Fox, NBC, and the cable
channels TBS and FX anteed up the winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised with NBC; they haven't even done a
Winston Cup race,'' Gordon said. ``This will be their first one
this weekend, but they are at the top of their class, if you look
what they do in sports. Fox has really been coming on strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup champion who has been
on the circuit since 1972, said the new contract and ensuing
massive exposure is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now finding out what we've known all along: that
this is the greatest show on Earth,'' Waltrip said. ``I've said for
years that dollar for dollar, this is the best sports marketing buy
in the country. I don't care if you are a sponsor, a fan or a
television network looking to get involved.''

IN E-POLITICS, CLINTON'S EX-ADVISER STILL PLAYS BY HIS RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best-known veterans of old-fashioned hard-ball
politics, Dick Morris, has turned to the Internet and shaken up
e-politics.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' method of working the Internet involves asking visitors
to vote yes or no on issues featured on his Web site, which
converts the votes into thousands of e-mail messages that are sent
to elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   That technique has provoked outrage among longtime Internet
political experts, who say it should be the visitors to the Web
site who are selecting the issues, not Morris. They also object to
his flooding elected officials with thousands of e-mail messages
that could obscure the correspondence sent by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The experts characterize Morris as a member of the old guard who
is blundering into a medium he does not understand. ``He is
destroying the medium for people who want to have serious
discourse,'' said Ken Deutsch, vice president for Internet strategy
at Issue Dynamics, a public affairs concern in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet venture has also brought Morris, a former adviser
to President Clinton, into a dispute with the White House over
whether staff members there had blocked e-mail sent from his Web
site, Vote.com, which went online Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message sent last Friday to users of his
profit-making Web site, Morris wrote that the site had sent more
than 82,000 e-mail messages to the White House in a week. He said
that after an initial rush of messages, the White House had blocked
all e-mail from Vote.com, then set its computer ``to accept only 70
e-mails per hour from our site.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said e-mail from Morris' Web
site had never been blocked. Further, Toiv said, the practice of
slowing e-mail is a standard method of deterring what is known as
mail bombing, a basic hacking technique used to cripple Web
servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kicks in automatically,'' Toiv said. ``Neither our
computers nor the people who run them know or care who Dick Morris
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In his message last Friday to users of his site, Morris wrote:
``What an odd response from an elected administration to hearing
the views of those who vote. It appears that the Internet
administration is burning the bridge to the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris urged the users of his site to send their own messages of
protest, and included the president's e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview Monday, Morris said he saw ``that
the White House did have a point.'' He added that he had started
rounding up the votes cast by users on the site on a variety of
issues and consolidating them in packets of 1,000, to be delivered
in a single e-mail message that lists all the individuals' e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Morris has called the routing of individuals'
votes on issues to elected officials online ``a megaphone that
gives an opportunity for anyone who wants to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   But political strategists who specialize in use of the Internet
denounce that practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the perspective of the Internet, this just adds to e-mail
gridlock,'' said Joe Rodota, the founder of an election-oriented
Web site, FAQvoter.com.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' presentation of issues for voters to consider also runs
counter to the spirit of the Internet, said Rodota, who was deputy
chief of staff for Pete Wilson when he was governor of California.
Rodota's profit-making site allows voters to set the agenda by
allowing them to address questions to candidates. The site runs all
questions as received.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues Morris asked users of his Web site to vote on
were the use of racial profiling by law-enforcement officers,
school vouchers, regulation of fees for automated teller machines
and allowing the sale of pistols to people under 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what a Washington insider would think the
Internet is all about,'' Rodota said of Morris' site. ``They
control the information that flows to the voter, and the content is
heavily controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris responded by saying: ``They believe we're undermining the
goal of electronic democracy by exercising it. My question to them
is, why the hell haven't you done this yet?''
</P>
<P>
   But Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation,
a nonprofit group that has provided election information online
since 1994, raised another question about the site: ``Is this
hurting anything? I think it may be. It leads people to a false
sense of participation in democracy.''

 &HT;    Boone: No trade demand, but deal could still happen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bret Boone has decided he won't demand a trade from
the Braves. But he might be traded anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Boone will play next year for the $3.75 million in his original
contract. The second baseman said he thinks that the Braves are
shopping him, but, as of Thursday's deadline for his decision, he
was fine with the part he could control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down with my family and my agent last night, and we
talked about it,'' Boone said Thursday. ``There were a lot of pros,
and they outweighed the cons for me. I just want to win, and I
think my best chance is here. As far as I'm concerned, the thought
process is over with, and we'll go forward from here.''
</P>
<P>
   A trade ``is always a possibility,'' he said. ``I don't take
anything like that personally. When I left Cincinnati, they didn't
want to trade me, but they wanted Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of people are untouchable. If you're going out and
you need a couple of pieces, you've got to trade an every-day
player. ... I'd like to stay in Atlanta, but I have no control over
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone came to the Braves from the Reds last November with Mike
Remlinger in a trade for Neagle, Michael Tucker and minor-leaguer
Rob Bell. Boone had the right to demand a trade because he was
traded in the middle of a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman had said he hoped the Braves would rework his
contract, which has a club option for 2001, so that he would be
paid $7.75 million in the next two years. But the Braves didn't
offer him anything, which left Boone to decide whether he wanted to
stay for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon enough, I'll have a chance to make the money I want to
make,'' Boone said. ``Winning is first; money is second. Bottom
line is, you don't get a chance to go to the World Series that
often. ... That was my first taste of the World Series (this year),
and there's nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team's No. 2 hitter, Boone struggled for long stretches,
which would give the Braves reason to consider trading him. He was
second on the team with 112 strikeouts and hit only .197
(38-for-93) in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   He came on stronger in August to finish the season with a .252
average, but his production dropped off from 24 home runs and 95
RBIs in 1998 to 20 home runs and 63 RBIs in 1999.

 &HT;    Lawyer Thomas securely in Holyfield's corner
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Protecting the heavyweight champion of the world is
an endless job with limitless responsibilities. And for Jim Thomas,
attorney for Evander Holyfield, it has been a fulfilling odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport in which stability seldom has a place, Holyfield and
Thomas are going on a decade as a tag team atop the boxing world.
They have survived and thrived because of Thomas' superlative
litigating skill, his willingness to extend himself beyond lawyerly
duties and a friendship and respect that grew along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I'm doing, and I get great satisfaction out of
it,'' Thomas said. ``Evander is like family and vice versa, I'd
like to think. If it needs to be done and I can do it, I do it. If
it helps Evander, that's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is particularly protective of Holyfield these days. He
understands the magnitude of the rematch with Lewis, so he has
added ``buffer'' to his list of services.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing is to keep as much away from Evander as possible,''
Thomas said. ``I want him to focus on what's most important _ and
that's fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 42, has countless areas of focus. One day, Thomas
negotiates a $20 million payday for Holyfield for a championship
fight. The next day he interviews prospective nannies for
Holyfield's kids.
</P>
<P>
   That's the range of Thomas' position _ endless and limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas could be on vacation in Hawaii with his family, yet get
up at 5:30 a.m. to complete the logistics for Holyfield's fight
last year at the Georgia Dome against Vaughn Bean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meant a lot to me to have Jim,'' Holyfield said. ``He's
done what a manager is supposed to do and more. He protects and
helps a fighter. With us, it's almost like a marriage. We work
together on things. It's a relief to have him on that legal end and
feel comfortable about it, that he's getting things done with my
best interest at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said Thomas' success is at the heart of their
relationship. Thomas built a strong reputation in the litigation
department of the law firm of Long, Aldridge &AMP; Norman in downtown
Atlanta. He and Holyfield first met there in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim had a life before me,'' Holyfield said, ``and he has one
now. He doesn't live off of me. He's paid well, but it's because he
does a great job. We respect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stress involved with the contracts and other
matters. Jim's been able to allow me peace, even in some personal
areas. He allows me to focus on what I need to do to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Thomas sees his biggest responsibility. He said
Holyfield's nature is to be trusting, which, in the fight game, can
lead to trouble. In fact, Holyfield admitted to losing ``lots of
money'' before hooking up with Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   While Holyfield trusts Thomas' judgment and often agrees with
his advice, the champion makes his decisions. ``I offer Evander my
advice; it's up to him to accept it,'' Thomas said. ``Many times he
does, and sometimes he doesn't. But we have so much respect that my
feelings aren't hurt if he decides to go another way. In fact,
there are times when I ask him for advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said: ``A lot of fighters tend to hire somebody to
portray themselves as smarter than them. Jim doesn't feel he's so
smart that he won't ask my opinion. His thing is, `It's Evander's
life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he will advise Holyfield, 37, to retire after the
Lewis fight, if his performance shows skill deterioration _ even in
victory _ or if it is a health risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice would come in questions,'' he said. ``I'd ask Dr.
Chris Vaughns if there are any signs of deterioration. If he found
any, I'd be very active to persuade Evander to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no damage or potential for damage, then there would
be other questions,'' Thomas said. ``Can he go through another
tough training camp? What is there to gain to fight again? What is
there to lose? Do you need the money or want the money? What good
would the next million do you? Is there some meaningful fight out
there? If any one of those answers goes the other way, I'll tell
him it's my opinion that he retires.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after Holyfield's public workout at the Vegas Hilton,
Thomas was nearly sprinting to another urgent mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get Evander an Energy Bar,'' Thomas said. ``He
hasn't eaten much today.''

 &HT;    Bills set for AFC East climb
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six weeks ago, the Buffalo Bills stunned the Miami
Dolphins 23-18 on the road. But the Bills lost two of their next
three games and dropped in the rugged AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins haven't lost since and are off to their best start
since 1990 at 7-1. The Bills are in fourth place in the division at
6-3, setting up a must-win game when Miami visits Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three teams sitting in front of us, but they're all
within our grasp,'' Bills quarterback Doug Flutie said. ``This game
will decide whether we're making a legitimate run at winning the
AFC East or we're just fighting to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have lost five of their past six games in Buffalo,
including two playoff contests in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But this season might be different. The Dolphins are 4-0 on the
road despite losing quarterback Dan Marino to a neck injury nearly
a month ago. Backup Damon Huard, who had thrown nine passes in the
NFL before this season, is 3-0 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not like we're beating losing teams on the road,''
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``We've been able to beat some
pretty good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Since losing to the Bills, the Dolphins have won at
Indianapolis, New England and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are coming off their most impressive victory of the
season, 34-17 at Washington. But the Dolphins haven't allowed a
touchdown in 14 quarters and shut out Tennessee 17-0 last Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time in Johnson's NFL career that one of his
teams is 7-1. The first time was in 1992, when Johnson won his
first Super Bowl with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time in his career that Johnson's team had at
least a 6-2 record at the midpoint of a season was in 1993. That
season, the Cowboys won their second Super Bowl in a row.
</P>
<P>
   _ Divisional matchup: San Diego has faded after a 4-1 start and
has lost three games in a row. The Chargers and Raiders try to keep
their playoff hopes alive when they meet in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: The Bears embarrassed the Vikings with a 24-22
victory in Minneapolis on Oct. 10. Minnesota has rallied around
quarterback Jeff George with three victories in a row, but the
Vikings must avoid another slow start. That shouldn't be a problem
with Jim Miller under center for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: The New York Giants are coming off a bye
week and could give the Colts trouble. If the wind is blowing at
the Meadowlands, Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning might have
a tough time throwing
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: Miami cornerback Sam Madison intercepted
Tennessee's Steve McNair three times Sunday. Buffalo receiver Eric
Moulds, who has a touchdown catch in each of his past four games,
will see a lot of Madison and cornerback Terrell Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: Pittsburgh rushed for 217 yards in a 43-0
blowout at Cleveland in Week 1. Steelers running back Jerome Bettis
might gain that many himself against a tired Browns defense.

ALBRIGHT OFFERS TO ABSORB CRITICISM FOR DEAL ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for rewriting throughout; story is now complete in one take) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
volunteered to be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion
rights groups if President Clinton compromises with Congress on a
deal to free nearly $1 billion the United States owes the United
Nations, senior administration officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As a Cabinet member who supports abortion rights, Albright has
urged the White House to cut a deal that some administration
officials fear could strike some Clinton supporters as a retreat
from the president's pledge to defend abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the administration has refused a demand from House
conservative, led by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., to cut off
U.S. financing to international organizations that promote abortion
rights as a condition to repaying Washington's debt to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   White House domestic advisers, in particular, have been loath to
alienate a core Democratic constituency, women voters, by backing
away from Clinton's commitment on abortion rights abroad to resolve
an increasingly embarrassing foreign policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Albright, a former ambassador to the
United Nations, has aggressively lobbied Republican lawmakers and
Clinton to resolve several issues that threaten American global
leadership: the United Nations dues, debt relief to impoverished
countries and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Albright recently told John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, that if services offered by abortion rights groups overseas
are only minimally affected by any deal, the administration should
be willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to move off existing law, as a woman secretary of
state who knows extremely well the instinctive concerns of women's
groups, she's prepared to take the heat,'' said a senior
administration official, who would speak on the condition of
anonymity. ``She is prepared to meet with them and explain to them
why this does not harm our fundamental position, but that getting
the U.N. dues is critical for our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, declined to comment on
any offer Albright had made, saying, ``We're committed to paying
our fair share at the United Nations by paying our back dues, and
we're working very hard on a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and administration officials said discussions
continued Thursday on the abortion issue, which is holding up a
deal on the U.N. payments, one of the last major sticking points
blocking a session-ending budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators also faced a new environmental amendment delaying a
ban on road building in national forests and a dispute over debt
relief to impoverished countries. But the abortion issue could be
the last issue left on the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a great deal of rigor on that, as regarding the
question of whether or not American tax dollars should be used by
the U.N. or any other agencies to lobby other nations on their
abortion laws,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive lobbying by Albright and Richard Holbrooke, the
new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to repay $926 million
over the next three years has been well known.
</P>
<P>
   Making known Albright's intention to absorb the political flak
of a sensitive domestic political decision serves several purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It prepares abortion rights groups for a possible deal they may
not like, and that will probably affect the presidential campaign
of Vice President Al Gore and the possible Senate campaign of first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves to pressure wavering White House domestic
advisers. And it could be intended to steal some of the limelight
from Holbrooke, with whom Albright has had a tense relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning groups reacted cautiously to reports of
Albright's willingness to bear the brunt of any political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that will cut family planning is hardly a compromise
on the issue of abortion,'' said Susan Cohen, assistant director of
policy development for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research
and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite declarations that a deal may be near, only a tiny number
of people are intimately involved with the talks, mainly between
Steve Ricchetti, a White House deputy chief of staff, and Scott B.
Palmer, chief of staff for the speaker of the House, Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients of a possible deal include using Smith's
language but allowing presidential waivers to that provision for
international organizations that provide abortions or lobby for
abortion rights. The agreement would also include funding penalties
imposed by Congress on the amount of U.S. grants awarded to the
foreign organizations if the waivers were used.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional aides said there were other
approaches under consideration that they refused to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides agree that the political climate and cast of
characters this year enhance the prospects of ending a three-year
battle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, Clinton is free from the distractions
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and advisers like Albright and
Holbrooke have been pushing harder to resolve the issue. That is in
part because the stakes are higher. The United States will lose its
vote in the U.N. General Assembly if it fails to meet a Dec. 31
deadline for payments
</P>
<P>
   The dispute does not threaten the U.S. vote or seat on the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   There are also practical budget considerations for striking a
deal this year. Under the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Congress
can appropriate money for the United Nations without having to make
cuts in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, that will not be allowed, making repayment in an
election year much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also feeling some pressure. Some conservatives
do not want to give Clinton ammunition to fuel his charges that
Republicans are isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who opposes abortion, has quietly
urged both sides to reconcile, and he called Hastert on Wednesday
to offer his advice. Helms wants a deal because a Senate bill that
he sponsored ties the repayment of $926 million over three years to
changes he wants at the United Nations, including reducing budgets
and the United States' share of payments.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are also weighing in with Republicans. The
Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are pushing
for a deal to pay back the dues and carry out reforms at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Better World Campaign, a group financed by Ted Turner that
advocates repaying the debt, has hired Haley Barbour, former
chairman of the Republican National Committee, to lobby on its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear whether House conservatives will
support a deal. Their demand is to write into law an executive
order issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Clinton reversed
the order in 1993, shortly after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred direct financing for abortion since
1973, but the 1984 policy, known familiarly as ``Mexico City''
since Reagan announced it during a U.N. conference there, denied
grants to international family-planning organizations for any
purpose if they promoted abortion rights.

 &HT;    Lewis boxing's biggest puzzle
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If you believe Evander Holyfield, he has done
something no other man has done:
</P>
<P>
   Beat Mike Tyson? Nope, Buster Douglas did that first.
</P>
<P>
   Win the heavyweight title three separate times? No, Muhammad Ali
also did that.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the heavyweight title into a preacher's pulpit? Oh no,
George Foreman's been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes Holyfield so unique?
</P>
<P>
   It came to light Wednesday afternoon when he was talking about
Lennox Lewis, whom he'll fight for the undisputed heavyweight title
Saturday night in Las Vegas. Asked if he needed a new strategy for
the rematch of their controversial draw last March in Madison
Square Garden, Holyfield shook his head ``no'' and finally said:
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I know him for what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield has done that _ if he's solved the equation of
Lennox Lewis _ he'd be the first person to do so. Lewis' own
trainers haven't done that, nor has his promoter, or most of the
fight-game insiders gathered here in Vegas this week for the
sold-out bout at the Thomas and Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is prizefighting's most complicated puzzle. The Matrix
Man. The big enigma. No one can figure this guy out.
</P>
<P>
   He's the biggest, strongest boxer in the fight game and yet,
he's one of the most cautious. ``I prefer to err on the side on
caution,'' he admitted Wednesday. That this was coming from a man
who stands 6-foot-5, weighs a taut 250 pounds and looks as if he's
Adonis come to life, only makes you shake your head.
</P>
<P>
   He's the heavyweight champ, a guy who's won 34 pro fights as
well as an Olympic gold medal, and yet many fans don't believe in
him. As his trainer, Emanuel Steward, put it: ``Lennox is a
two-time champion and still he hasn't won the public's respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ring, Lewis is just as hard to explain. He has 6,000
fervent fans flying here from England to cheer him _ hoping he
becomes Britain's first undisputed heavyweight champ since Bob
Fitzsimmons managed the feat 102 years ago _ and yet he lives in a
suburb outside Toronto. He and his mom left London's East End for
Canada when he was 9.
</P>
<P>
   As for Canada _ for whom he won the super-heavyweight gold medal
at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 _ Lewis never voluntarily talks about
the country when he's on a big stage like this. For promotional
purposes, mainly, he paints himself solely as a Brit.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Brits don't know him much better than we do. He's
soft-spoken, cerebral, calculating _ and doesn't let insiders into
his life. He's 34 years old and still lives with his ``mum,'' as he
calls her.
</P>
<P>
   People want to embrace him, but that's easier said than done.
Especially when it comes to boxing. Although his 34-1-1 record is
nearly spotless, there is no greatness on his resume. His biggest
wins have come against the likes of Andrew Golota, Oliver McCall
and Tommy Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting into the scheme of things _ where nothing is quite like
you'd expect _ what should have been Lewis' greatest victory last
March ended up the fishiest of draws.
</P>
<P>
   In that initial fight with Holyfield, Lewis dominated most of
the action. He won decisively on all ringsiders cards, yet the
fight judges saw it differently and ruled the draw.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Eugenia Williams _ because of her inexperience a
strange pick to be the International Boxing Federation judge _
claimed she had been unable to see the ring from her seat just
inches from the canvas. She said photographers blocked her view and
she scored the fight for Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Another judge, Larry O'Connell from England, scored the fight
even, then later apologized for his decision, saying he thought
Lewis won the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the four IBF administrators _ including IBF
President Bob Lee, who appointed Williams _ have been indicted on
federal racketeering and bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten it on good account that before that first fight,
Bob Lee said he had Holyfield as his champion,'' Lewis said. ``He's
the one who put Eugenia Williams into my fight. Now everything is
coming out and it just confirms to me our suspicions of
skullduggery going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lewis appeared to have won the fight, there is no
denying he still looked apprehensive at times. Holyfield seemed old
that fight _ Wednesday he admitted he had nothing left after round
three and fought off the urge to quit _ and yet Lewis didn't
capitalize on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   That's been a knock on Lewis his entire career. Wednesday he was
asked about that cautious approach to what Tyson calls ``the hurt
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a boxer-puncher, if you feel that's cautious,'' Lewis
said. ``I'm not like Mike Tyson. I'm a different fighter. People
kept telling me I should have finished Holyfield off, but they
weren't up there in the ring with me. They didn't have all their
life's hopes at stake and they didn't know how in command I felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, when I look at the tape of the fight, I see a lot of
things I could have done. Maybe I gave Evander too much respect.
But I was still hitting him three shots to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for that dominance, he admitted he thought briefly about the
one haunting moment of his career. In his first bout with McCall
five years ago, Lewis was knocked out by a solid right hand to the
jaw in the second round. The defeat was stunning, especially when
you consider McCall has since melted into oblivion with a series of
drugs arrests, rehab and some form of mental breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say Oliver McCall is something of a ghost for me,'' Lewis
said. ``I wouldn't call him a ghost _ I learned something from him
_ but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't aware of what happened to me
with him when I had Holyfield on the ropes in the fifth round of
our first fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCall's taught me you've got to soften a guy up first. Like
Larry Holmes said, get them drunk with the jab, then take them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Lewis said he's going to put Holyfield into
retirement. Yet when you ask him how, you find yourself holding
puzzle pieces that don't seem to fit.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lewis promised the first round Saturday would be
``filled with fireworks,'' and that he'd ``come right after
Holyfield.'' Moments later, he said he wouldn't go in looking for
the knockout and would ``let matters develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward, meanwhile, is predicting Lewis will knock out Holyfield
in six rounds: ``Lennox's training camp was the best of any
heavyweight I've worked with in my entire life. I can't see any
heavyweight in the world going over six rounds with him.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Holyfield offered his: ``At least I know the man for
what he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he feels he's got the people's confidence,''
Holyfield said. ``That's given him some false confidence and he's
liable to try to use it. But when I resist it, he'll go back to the
old Lennox Lewis. He'll be conservative; not want to take
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   If that should happen, the big enigma would be bigger . . . but
probably not a champ.

NASCAR: DRIVING FORCE ON TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR, one of the fastest-growing sports in America and the
only one to sustain television ratings increases over the last
decade, hit the big time Thursday as four networks agreed to pay at
least $2.4 billion to broadcast Winston Cup and Busch Series events
for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   Only the NFL's eight-year, $17.6 billion contract and the NBA's
four-year, $2.64 billion deal eclipse auto racing's television
rights package.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network, its FX cable channel, NBC, and Turner Sports
not only outbid CBS, TNN, ABC, and ESPN, but also guaranteed
prime-time coverage and extensive cross-promotions with the
networks' other major sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal starts in 2001. Unlike the six-year deal NBC and
Turner negotiated, Fox and FX have an option to extend the contract
an additional two years. The option could push the value to as much
as $3 billion, or more than quadruple its existing contracts.
Fifteen years ago, NASCAR received $3 million for the rights to 28
races.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering television deal reflects the growing popularity
of NASCAR and demonstrates once again the hunger among networks for
hot sports products. Earlier this year, NASCAR persuaded track
owners to give up their rights to negotiate individual television
deals in order to form a unified bargaining position. Armed with
the second-highest ratings in televised sports behind the NFL,
NASCAR's strategy worked to secure an unprecedented deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the deal is worth a possible $3 billion for the networks
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol and Fox Sports president
David Hill were very confident they made the right move.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers appear to support their investment. Ratings show
that NASCAR's Winston Cup (5.6 rating and 15 share) is the
second-most-watched sports programming behind the NFL,
outperforming the most recent NBA season (4.3/10), Major League
Baseball (2.9/9), and the NHL (1.4/4).
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup is also the second-highest-rated programming
among males and beats the NBA by 27 percent among men 18-34, 41
percent among men 18-49, and 57 percent among men 25-54, the most
coveted advertising targets.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol and Hill also said they believe NASCAR, long viewed as
the domain of Southern rednecks, has slowly expanded its
traditional base. Ratings in the Rust Belt are 15 percent higher
than the national average. But Winston Cup ratings in the Northeast
are 9 percent lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR ratings have grown in urban areas. Philadelphia,
Washington, and Milwaukee averaged more than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings bolster the networks' argument to increase
advertising rates. Hill joked that those undisclosed rates are sure
to double, if not triple. ``Why put a cap on the rates?'' Ebersol
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, Fox and FX will split the first half of
the season between February and November. NBC and TBS will air the
second half. NBC and Fox will alternate broadcasting the Daytona
500. The deal doesn't include international rights or Internet
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol and Hill said the deal will triple the existing number
of races on television right now. ``It will be an awesome change
for NASCAR fans,'' Ebersol said. ``Viewers will get to know their
heroes and they will have an easier time finding the sport on
network television.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill added that NASCAR fans needed ESP to find what channel a
race was on.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner, for instance, will combine resources to have a
uniform presentation, production look, style staff, and talent that
will air on both networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``An integral part of today's partnerships is the consistent
viewership patterns that will now be in place allowing fans an
easier and more enhanced presentation of NASCAR racing for those
watching at home,'' said Bray Cary, NASCAR's vice president of
broadcasting and technology.

FAMED PHOTOGRAPHER'S PRINTS FACE SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GRACE GLUECK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, collectors and dealers of high-quality art
photographs have been surprised by a proliferation of first-rate
prints by Lewis W. Hine, the important documentary photographer
best known for his early- to mid-20th-century images of labor,
poverty, immigration and the construction of the Empire State
Building.
</P>
<P>
   But the surprise has turned to concern with the recent discovery
that hundreds of the photographs, while made with genuine Hine
negatives, are apparently unauthorized posthumous prints that often
bear signatures purporting to be Hine's. With stakes that could run
into the millions of dollars, the principal Hine dealers across the
country have opened an investigation into the origins of the
prints. And they have alerted clients to the possibility that some
of the work will be called back.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the doubted photographs were sold by Walter Rosenblum,
81, himself a highly respected photographer who in his youth was
Hine's friend and colleague and is the leading authority on his
work. With his wife, Naomi Rosenblum, an esteemed historian of
photography who is also a Hine authority, Rosenblum was honored
last year with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the International
Center of Photography in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home in Queens, Rosenblum would not comment,
referring questions to his lawyer, Mark Sugarman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware that various people have raised questions as to
the vintage and authenticity of some Hine photographs out in the
market,'' Sugarman said. ``We are investigating these allegations
and will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Sugarman said, Rosenblum amassed a large
collection of Hine's works. They were obtained, the lawyer said,
directly from Hine, from the photographer's son, Corydon Hine, or
from art market sources.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Mr. Rosenblum consigned various prints to various
galleries over a period of time. If there is a problem with some of
the prints, he had no knowledge of it at the time he sold them. It
is possible that the prints not regarded as authentic came from
him, but they could also have come from a number of other sources.
If there is a problem with the ones he sold, we will try to remedy
it as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of approximately half a dozen dealers who are looking
into the matter is led by the New York gallery owners Robert Mann,
Edwynn Houk and Howard Greenberg. Peter Stern of the law firm of
Berger Stern &AMP; Webb, speaking for the group, said: ``We are
obviously extremely concerned with the authenticity of these
prints. We are in the process of factual investigation in a
dialogue with the Rosenblums, and are hopeful that this matter can
be explained and resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   No legal action has been taken. None of the dealers involved
would be interviewed on the record. Nor would they disclose the
names of clients who had bought Hine works.
</P>
<P>
   The questioned photographs may place a heavy financial burden on
the dealers, since, by trade practice, galleries guarantee the
authenticity of works they sell and are obliged to make restitution
to clients in cases of faulty authentication, no matter how long
ago the works were sold. Museum curators and dealers say that, for
about 15 years, they have been aware of well-finished, show-quality
Hine enlargements. Oddly, it was the high level of the printwork
that first drew attention. Hine, a socially committed artist who
lived from 1874 to 1940, was more concerned with the substance of
his images than with their finish, and was not particularly known
for his skills as a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, persuasive evidence that the prints could not have been
made by Hine emerged only recently through the efforts of a
collector, Dr. Michael Mattis, a physicist in Los Alamos, N.M.
Mattis, who would not comment for this article, worked with Paul
Messier of Boston, a paper conservator who for some time has been
doing ``materials analysis'' of 20th-century photographic prints.
</P>
<P>
   Messier would not comment on his work, saying it was a matter of
confidentiality between him and his client. But dealers and
collectors said he found that the paper used for the prints was
made after 1950, when photographic manufacturers changed their
formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the findings quickly traveled through the circle of
dealers and collectors involved with Hine's work, arousing concern
in the market as a whole. An article by Anne Horton mentioning the
matter appears in the current Art &AMP; Auction magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, with Hine photographs, we will be particularly
vigilant,'' said Denise Bethel, director of the photograph
department at Sotheby's, which has sold many Hine prints in the
past. At a Sotheby's sale last April, one was sold with a letter of
authentication from Rosenblum, requested by the consigner.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the age of the print paper, the signatures on many of
the works have been questioned. Although Hine, working at a time
when his photographs had no collectors' market, signed few prints _
and most of those in block letters on the front _ nearly all of the
prints in question are signed.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for Hine prints vary, from a few hundred dollars for his
earliest works, 4-by-5-inch contacts made for the National Child
Labor Committee in the early 1900s, to $60,000 or more for later
works, many of these 8-by-10-inch or 11-by-14-inch enlargements of
images. Only the enlargements are suspect, according to dealers who
declined to be named. The number of existing prints is only one of
many factors that may affect the price of vintage photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The record price for a Hine photograph was set at Christie's in
April 1994, when a photograph titled ``Mechanic and Steam Pump''
from the 1920s was sold for $90,500. In October 1998, a single
enlargement from his 1930-31 series of the Empire State Building
under construction went for $74,000 at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   A believer in photography as a tool for social reform, Hine
covered immigrants on Ellis Island, New York sweatshops and
child-labor abuses. After World War I, he turned to documenting the
positive side of labor, in a series called Men at Work that
culminated in the extraordinary Empire State Building photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years Hine, then living on welfare, was befriended
by Rosenblum, who also saw photography as an aid to social reform.
After Hine's death, his son gave his prints and negatives to the
Photo League, an organization of socially committed photographers.
In 1955, Rosenblum, the group's last president, turned over 3,800
Hine negatives and 6,000 prints to the George Eastman House in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers joining in the investigation stress that they are
looking for a ``peaceful'' rather than a litigious solution. ``The
important thing is that if there are fakes, let's get them off the
market,'' one dealer said.

 &HT;    New Hampshire poll tarnishes Bush's `aura of inevitability'
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is Gov. George W. Bush going to get a run for his
money in New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   Whispered for weeks, the question is now being uttered at full
volume after a poll released Thursday found Arizona Sen. John
McCain all but even with GOP front-runner Bush in the Granite
State, which is home to the first primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been closing in on Bush for weeks, but the latest
poll shows that McCain appears to have caught up with the favored
Republican, at least in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll of 600 likely Republican primary voters in
New Hampshire showed Bush had 38 percent, compared to McCain's 35
percent _ a difference that is within the poll's 4 percentage point
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, Bush's favorability rating has dropped 15 points,
from 71 percent to 56 percent. The poll showed McCain with the
highest favorability rating, 67 percent, among Republicans. The
poll, conducted Nov. 4 through Nov. 9 by the American Research
Group Inc. of Manchester, N.H., also found that men were more
likely to favor McCain, while women favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll comes after a Nov. 4 poll released by
WNDS-TV-Franklin Pierce College that showed McCain within 10 points
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush retains a commanding lead over the rest of the
field, and Thursday's poll shows no serious drop in his New
Hampshire standing. Instead, McCain has been quietly gaining. He
climbed 22 percentage points since July, while Bush's rating
dropped 9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the polls call into question what pundits have
dubbed Bush's, ``aura of inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the `W' in George W. Bush stands for
winner,'' said New York pollster John Zogby. ``If there is a sense
that he may not be the winner that (Republicans) want in the
general election, then they've been in the desert too long. They'll
find someone else. ... The aura of inevitability has been
punctured. He'll have to survive the debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Republican pollster Whit Ayers disagrees, saying
Bush will have to lose primaries in New Hampshire or South Carolina
to see his so-called aura of inevitability even begin to evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Senator McCain manages to win New Hampshire, then it
creates a very new climate in the Republican nomination battle,''
Ayers said. ``Governor Bush would still be the favorite because of
his financial advantage and his organization in all the key states
rather than in just two key states, but it ceases to be an easy
coast to the nomination. On the other hand ... if Governor Bush
wins in both New Hampshire and South Carolina against his strongest
challenger in the challenger's strongest states, than the
nomination battle is pretty well over.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Zogby and Ayers agree that the numbers that matter most
aren't generated by pollsters, but by contributors. Bush has raised
$57 million, far more than any other candidate. McCain has raised
$9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy of campaigning in the state also is paying
off, at least according to New Hampshire state Rep. Irene Messier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Senator McCain has been up here many more times
than Governor Bush,'' said Messier, who switched her support to
McCain after Elizabeth Dole dropped out of the race. ``That says to
voters that ... maybe Governor Bush might be resting on his
laurels? I think now that he's realizing that, I think he's coming
into the state a little bit more often.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a message Bush is hearing loud and clear. During recent
campaign stops, he was at pains to explain his decision to skip a
recent GOP forum in New Hampshire to be with his wife, Laura, who
was receiving an award in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has added more New Hampshire trips to his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush has spent nine days
in New Hampshire and plans to spend more, including several
scheduled stops the week of Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is an important early state, and we know that we
should be campaigning hard there, and that's what we're doing,''
she said. This article includes material from The Associated Press.

MISSISSIPPI'S HISTORY HAUNTS GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ The past is always palpable in Mississippi, but
rarely does it unsettle the present as powerfully as it has in the
last week, reaching forward from an unburied century to prevent the
voters of the state from choosing their own governor.
</P>
<P>
   It has been eight days since Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove got 6,642
more votes in the gubernatorial election than Mike Parker, a former
congressman. In 48 other states, he would have been governor-elect
by now, making appointments, hiring staff members and preparing for
battle on his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But in a thousand ways, Mississippi is different from most other
states, even more tightly tethered to its agrarian, separatist past
than the other states that share its fervent Confederate legacy.
More than a century ago, in the tumult that followed
Reconstruction, white planters inserted a clause into the 1890
constitution intended to prevent newly enfranchised blacks from
ever electing their own governor. The constitution, still in
effect, requires a winning candidate for governor to receive both a
majority of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral votes,
which are based on state House districts.
</P>
<P>
   If the leading candidate fails to overcome those hurdles, the
state House of Representatives _ which the planters assumed would
always remain in white hands _ must choose one of the top two
vote-getters as governor.
</P>
<P>
   For 109 years, this provision in the constitution was never used
in a gubernatorial race. But on Nov. 2, Musgrove, a white Democrat,
got only 49.5 percent of the vote, because there were four
candidates on the ballot. Parker, a white Republican who got 48.6
percent, is refusing to concede, clinging to the slim chance that
the House, controlled by Democrats, might elect him. And suddenly,
legislators both white and black are starting to reflect on the
racially charged political legacy that got them to this point, and
many believe the time has come for an overhaul of the state's basic
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that the same thing that was put in the
constitution to disenfranchise our vote, now a Republican is using
to hold on to,'' said George Flaggs, a Democratic House member from
Vicksburg, who is black. ``They put us out, and they're trying to
use the same method to get back in. It's time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two candidates scuffle for support in the House, the
bizarre situation has sent politicians and pundits scurrying back
to the origins of the state's political system, presenting voters
with an unwelcome civics lesson in the fragility of true democracy.
In the 1870s and '80s, while carpetbaggers roamed a state still
reeling from its losses in the Civil War, newly enfranchised blacks
managed to elect dozens of representatives to the state
Legislature. But white planters, part of the regional movement of
conservative Democrats known as ``the Redeemers,'' constructed a
new constitution to regain control of the state, adding literacy
tests, poll taxes and other impediments to strip blacks of their
Union-imposed power. Even if black voters managed to muster a
majority of votes for a governor, there would be enough
white-controlled districts, with their electoral votes, to throw
the decision to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution was full of provisions to prevent newly freed
and enfranchised blacks from having much of an opportunity to gain
political power,'' said Marty Wiseman, director of the Stennis
Institute of government at Mississippi State University. ``They
wanted to rescue the state of Mississippi from Reconstruction and
take us back to where we were, keeping the agrarian clutches on
power so the more elite areas of the state couldn't gain a
foothold. And this is the constitution to take us into the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The document did its job, keeping blacks out of the political
system until the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. The Democratic
Party became so dominant in the state that the provision allowing
the House to choose a governor was never invoked, although a
similar clause in the Georgia constitution allowed the Legislature
there to install Lester Maddox as governor in 1967. Maddox, a
Democrat and an avowed segregationist, had actually come in second
to a Republican, and the resulting outcry prompted Georgia to
change its constitution a few years later under Gov. Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But until this year, Mississippi never saw much reason to
replace its foundation, and some people say that is still the case.
Rusty Fortenberry, a spokesman for Parker, noted that the U.S.
Constitution still requires presidents to be elected by electoral
votes, with the House of Representatives deciding if no candidate
gets an electoral majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing standing between us and tyranny is our
constitution,'' Fortenberry said. ``Lots of people are trying to
demonize Parker, but it's really about whether we follow the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi and Vermont, however, are the only states that still
follow such a law, and many state legislators say they are inclined
to propose an amendment to the constitution to bring the state a
bit closer to the modern age, possibly in this term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly some sentiment to do that,'' said Timothy
Ford, the speaker of the House and a Democrat. ``It's an old
provision, and I'm sure at one time there was a reason for it,
before the advances in electronic voting were made. So I don't see
any need for it now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Parker does not succumb to the growing chorus urging him to
end the divisiveness and concede, Mississippi will have to wait
until the House convenes and votes on Jan. 4 before someone can
move into the governor's office. Musgrove calls that a disservice
to the people of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a governor to be effective, you have to have an
administration in place,'' he said in an interview. ``Obviously we
can't do that until the central issue of the election is decided.''
</P>
<P>
   But Musgrove, who is all but assured of eventual election, is
not waiting for history to rise up and run off with his future.
Although the electoral votes have not yet been tallied, his aides
are already calling him ``governor.''

   The strong numbers came despite a stumble at the company's Old
Navy chain and continuing weakness at its flagship Gap stores.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales, which exclude performance of new and closed
locations, rose 5 percent _ a number that is modest for Gap but
which many retailers would consider healthy. In last year's third
quarter, same-store sales grew 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Net income totaled $315 million, or 35 cents per share, a penny
above the Wall Street consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc. has continued to chip away at its costs by negotiating
cheaper leases in malls where it has several stores, shifting
production and materials-buying to less-expensive countries and
cutting administrative expenses, said Heidi Kuntz, Gap's chief
financial officer. Kuntz said. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The company has even reduced its tax rate to 36.5 percent from
37 percent, thanks to ``successful tax planning efforts,'' she
said. Gap Inc.'s gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.8
percent, versus 42.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All divisions contributed to the strong earnings growth we saw
in the quarter,''Kuntz said at a New York analysts' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, yesterday's news did little to reassure investors who are
spooked about continuing ongoing  &LR; weakness at Gap stores and a
lackluster October for Old Navy. Shares nudged up just 6 cents to
close at $34.25.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, meanwhile hit $3 billion, up from $2.4 billion in the
third quarter of 1998. However, same-store sales at Gap stores came
in slightly negative, compared to an increase in the high single
digits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales at the Gap division have been down or flat for
seven months, a problem management attributes to fashion mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect Gap to improve this holiday season, but still be
limping a bit toward the spring and summer season,'' said Rick
Snyder, an analyst with Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales at Gap Inc.'s budget-priced Old Navy store rose
in the low teens, compared to the low 20s in the comparable 1998
quarter, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy, which has been driving Gap Inc. sales with increases
as high as 30 percent, stunned investors last month by posting a
same-store sales gain in the mid-single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxiously awaiting November results because typically if a
season's bad, it stays bad because they buy things so far in
advance,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   GapKids performance was flat against last year while the stylish
Banana Republic chain posted a same-store sales gain in the high
single digits, compared to the mid-teens last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales comparisons remain very challenging through the
remainder of the year, particularly for Old Navy'' because of
extremely high same-store sales increases in 1998, Kuntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gap Inc. is ``well-positioned'' going into the Christmas
season, Kuntz said, noting that new holiday merchandise is selling
well and inventory levels are in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder projects a companywide 5 percent same-store sales
increase for the fourth quarter, with Gap coming in slightly
negative and Old Navy growing in the mid- to high single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc. is on plan to open 450 stores this year and intends to
open between 550 and 600 next year, spending more than $1 billion,
Kuntz said.
</P>
<P>
   New locations in 2000 include 270 to 290 Gaps, 40 to 60 Banana
Republics and 110 to 120 Old Navys. Internationally, 120 to 130 new
 &LR; stores will be opened, most or all of them Gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have a lot of confidence they can fix the Gap brand
because they're opening a lot of stores next year,'' Snyder noted.
``I would not bet against them.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Microsoft Will Sell Wares At RadioShack  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. has enlisted RadioShack's 7,000 stores and 30,000
sales clerks to sell its MSN Internet access service and related
products to consumers.
<P>
   The software giant, based in Redmond, Wash., said yesterday that
it would set up a Microsoft ``store within a store'' at most
RadioShack locations across the country starting in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under a five-year alliance, Microsoft will establish a strong,
branded presence within RadioShack. Employees of RadioShack
eventually will be trained to sell Microsoft products, such as
WebTV, as well as Microsoft's MSN Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   These employees also will educate consumers about new high-speed
Internet technologies such as DSL and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   So-called broadband, or high speed, Internet access is still not
well understood by the average consumer, according to Microsoft
officials. ``We are partnering with RadioShack to enter the next
frontier in connectivity,'' said Microsoft chief executive Bill
Gates in a conference call. The goal, he says, is to ``demystify''
the likes of DSL and to make people more comfortable with the
technology by walking them through the set-up process.
</P>
<P>
   In a major handholding effort, RadioShack service technicians
would be responsible for coming directly into the home and
connecting consumers to the Web. Microsoft stands to gain from
wide-scale adoption of high-speed access. The company has major
investments in such cable and telecommunications companies as AT&AMP;T,
which is positioned to become a leader in the broadband market.
High-speed access also is a natural fit for Microsoft products such
as Web TV.
</P>
<P>
   With broadband, consumers can surf the Web at speeds about 50
times faster than the typical 56K connection. Today, only about 1
million of the 40 million U.S. homes connected to the Internet have
high-speed access. The vast majority of households have so-called
dial-up access over traditional telephone modems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also will make a $100 million equity investment in the
newly relaunched RadioShack.com Web site. RadioShack is the retail
unit of Tandy Corp., based in Fort Worth, Texas. Tandy said it has
plans to spin off RadioShack.com in a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft's help, RadioShack.com aims to become a leading
e-commerce site for consumer electronics. The site also could be
used as a platform for driving consumers to Microsoft's MSN Web
site, which offers a host of services, from financial planning to
online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Noyes, an analyst with International Data Corp,
believes that the Microsoft-RadioShack alliance is a step forward
for Microsoft in terms of winning over the first big wave of
broadband converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the broadest level, Microsoft is moving its business away
from shrink-wrapped software and is gradually becoming a
full-fledged service provider,'' she said. ``They see broadband as
a way to expand their Internet market share.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicts that within five years, one in three households
hooked up to the Internet will have a high-speed connection.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Microsoft badly trails America Online in Internet
access. AOL has about 20 million subscribers, compared with only
about 2 million users of the MSN service.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with RadioShack promises to raise those numbers.
``This is a very strategic move for Microsoft because it gives them
feet on the street,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga
Information Group who noted that the majority of Americans live
within a five-mile radius of a RadioShack store. ``Microsoft now
has a direct channel into the home, which is something AOL doesn't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts wonder whether it is prudent for Microsoft to get
overly aggressive in the Internet access market, especially after
it was just ruled a monoply in computer operating systems. They
believe that the alliance with RadioShack could raise the specter
of Microsoft once again developing into a predatory monopolist and
dominating a market.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Sanderson, a general manager of business development at
Microsoft, downplays any threat. ``If anyone is a dominant player
in Internet access, it's not us,'' he said. ``We're just trying to
win our fair share of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares rose $2.50, to $89.63, in trading yesterday.
Tandy shares rose $4.19, to $69.38.

 &HT;    The arrival of NASCAR
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ NASCAR raced into a new era on Thursday when
it announced one of the richest TV deals in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network, NBC, and cable channels TBS and FX will pay an
estimated $400 million annually for the broadcast rights to
NASCAR's Winston Cup and Busch Series races, beginning in the 2001
season. The $400 million annual rights fees will be worth four
times the amount of this year's contract, when NASCAR's rights were
sold by individual tracks and races were televised on six networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day for everybody involved in NASCAR,'' said Ed
Clark, president of Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``I think the biggest
benefit of this whole thing is for people who questioned if NASCAR
is a major sport. (The enormity) of this contract settles it right
here; NASCAR belongs with the other major sports.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR trails only the NFL in viewership. Under terms of the new
agreement, which is expected to total $2.4 billion during the first
six years, NASCAR has secured the third-richest TV contract in
sports, ranking behind the NFL and NBA. Fox and FX will have an
option to extend the contract two more years that could push the
total value closer to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a money decision,'' said NASCAR official Bray Cary,
as he explained the rationale behind choosing the stations in the
high-stakes bidding war, in which ESPN and CBS were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal also provides stock car racing with better national
exposure. The agreement triples the number of Winston Cup races
that will be shown on network television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very enthusiastic and excited that our consolidated
television partners have captured our vision of the sport of
NASCAR's future,'' said Bill France Jr., former CEO of NASCAR who
pushed for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement will showcase NASCAR racing to millions of
sport fans like never before, providing fans with an interactive
experience and bringing them closer to NASCAR in ways they could
have never imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will broadcast a majority of the Winston Cup races and a
share of the Busch events during the first half of the season, with
the remaining races being shown on FX. NBC and TBS will televise
the races during the second part of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and NBC will rotate on a yearly basis for the rights of the
Daytona 500, the premiere race in Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Turner Sports is banking its hefty investment on
NASCAR's ever-increasing popularity across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly would not be at this level, in terms of
expenditures, if we didn't think this was a good value,'' said Mark
Lazarus, president of Turner Sports. ``We feel like at the end of
this contract, we will be profitable (with this venture).''

 _ SF CHRON   Desperate for Seasonal Help, Retailers Court Applicants 
 &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Dressed stylishly all in black and accessorized with a colorful
scarf, San Francisco City College student Victoria Kehoe sat
hunched over a Williams-Sonoma job application at a food court
table in the Stonestown Galleria on 19th Avenue.
<P>
   Kehoe took pains to write out her references slowly and legibly,
pausing only occasionally to sip on a soda and gaze at colorfully
dressed workers at the Hot Dog on a Stick stand. She also had
applied at Nordstrom and several other upscale stores in the mall
and knew she could be discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think I'll have a problem getting a job,'' she
said. ``But I want to get a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   She no doubt picked the right time to apply. With the opening of
the holiday shopping season _ the day after Thanksgiving _ fast
approaching, Bay Area retailers are scrambling to hire seasonal
salespeople. With unemployment at a 30-year low and the economy
booming, analysts say fewer people are looking for seasonal work to
earn extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly is the most challenging year retailers have
faced, in terms of hiring numbers, in some time,'' said Bruce Van
Kleek, a vice president with the National Retail Federation in
Washington, D.C. ``In a number of markets, wages have gone up as
much as $2 an hour from the ($5.15) minimum. And San Francisco is
traditionally one of highest wage areas in the country, so workers
have the power there.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers also face a job market in this region where
unemployment rates range from 4.2 percent in Solano County to 1.7
percent in Marin County, according to California's Employment
Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why every business from Macy's to the 98-Cent Clearance
Stores is doing the hard sell on applicants, offering everything
from higher wages and extra incentives to the promise of full-time
employment and management opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this trend coming long ago, and we were prepared to
attract workers,'' said Lori Winthrop, vice president for human
relations at Macy's West. ``We started our recruiting in September.
It's an absolute top priority to be fully staffed and attentive to
our customers, especially during the busy holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest Macy's get caught with lines heading out the door and
spilling into Union Square this holiday season, Winthrop said the
company's nine Bay Area stores advertise a toll-free number in
which seasonal applicants can have an initial interview over the
phone. Macy's recruiters also have gone to area colleges and
community groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're ready,'' Winthrop said. ``But we always need
more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every retailer seems as prepared. Up and down the Stonestown
mall, for example, nearly every store had signs in front windows
advertising for holiday workers. At the Pottery Barn, the lure was
``competitive wages and generous discounts.'' Nearby, at the Track
'N Trail, a placard declared, ``See if you can fill our shoes.
Apply now!'' Miller's Outpost touted ``casual dress'' and a ``fun
atmosphere,'' whereas Contempo Casuals next door proclaimed itself
a ``rockin' place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its close proximity to San Francisco State
University, San Francisco City College and Lowell High School, the
Stonestown Galleria has an easier time finding seasonal workers
than other Bay Area shopping centers, according to Stonestown
Marketing Director Lisa Ono.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to Doug Oliner, manager of the ``Things
Remembered'' gift shop at Stonestown. He expects the usual onrush
after Thanksgiving and hopes that he will have enough staff to
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been the worst, the saddest market for temporary
employees I can remember,'' Oliner said. ``The job pool is thin,
very thin. I have a great staff base of full-time workers, but I
just can't find decent temporary help. Hiring those 10 or 12
Christmas workers is tough. I've got a stack of applications here,
and I'll call somebody, set up an interview and they won't come in.
This isn't a month later, just three days after they applied. Maybe
they just don't want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, it is suggested, have the applicants found work elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be the case, too,'' Oliner said. ``People in the
mall don't like to talk about it, but there's a lot of stealing of
employees that go on. I had one girl who had worked for me only six
or seven months _ first job she ever had _ and another store in the
mall comes around and offers to make her an assistant manager.
That's how desperate it is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Halili, assistant manager at Miller's Outpost at
Stonestown, said poaching by stores in the mall is rampant, even to
the point where managers approach applicants filling out forms for
other stores on mall benches and try to lure them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost of one of our best workers to another clothing
store,'' Halili said. ``But we're going to lure him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, managers even try to steal fellow managers. That
happened to Deneva Bradley, assistant manager of KB Toys at
Stonestown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy comes up and gives me his business card,'' she said,
shaking her head in dismay. ``We've had a couple of employees play
one offer off another to get the best deal. But that's not really a
problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, Bradley said, is simply filling slots,
especially on the graveyard shift, stocking shelves. She said KB
needs to hire 36 temporary stockers by Thanksgiving and ``we aren't
close to there yet. A lot of the bigger (department) stores can get
the big numbers of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of resources, according Kim DeCarrico, a Nordstrom
spokeswoman. DeCarrico said Nordstrom's temporary workforce already
is in place at its nine Northern California stores because the
company's annual ``half-yearly'' sale runs through November.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we don't have to add as many (employees) for the holidays
because a lot of our extra workers stay on,'' she said. ``We also
offer extra holiday hours to our permanent employees first before
we go outside the company. That takes care of a lot of hours. We
don't have any plans to offer any extra incentives (other) than our
normal employee merchandise discounts. We're in a pretty fortunate
position.''
</P>
<P>
   As are many of the big retailers. Kmart, for instance, sends
recruiters to colleges, high schools and even senior centers to
lure seasonal salespeople. ``And we make radio announcements inside
every store for any shoppers that might want to work for us,'' said
Kmart spokeswoman Susan Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Target, one of Kmart's biggest competitors, has similar
recruiting efforts. And one Target outlet in Kansas City even hired
buses to transport workers who lived far from the store.
</P>
<P>
   At Stonestown, many seasonal salespeople can walk to the mall
from San Francisco State. Getting them physically to stay put in
jobs at the mall is the real challenge, according to Oliner of
Things Remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary jobs in e-commerce are hurting us, too,'' Oliner
said. ``When these kids can earn $10 to $12 an hour sitting and
writing up orders, why are they going to want to stand on their
feet eight hours here and make $6.50 to $7? I try to make it fun to
work here, but it's hard to compete with that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacobo Timerman, the distinguished Argentine journalist whose
imprisonment and torture by his country's military forces in the
1970s created an international human rights furor, died Thursday at
his home in Buenos Aires. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, his second this year, The
Associated Press reported, quoting his son Hector.
</P>
<P>
   After he was driven into exile in 1979, Timerman wrote
eloquently of his 30-month ordeal in secret prisons and under house
arrest in ``Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number,'' a
book published in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   A searing indictment of man's inhumanity to man, as well as a
vivid testament to man's ability to face brutality with nobility
and courage, Timerman's best-selling book aroused outrage around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was written in Israel, where Timerman, a lifelong committed
Zionist, lived in exile after his release, which had coincided with
the Argentine government's expropriation of his liberal newspaper,
La Opinion, and all his other property.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in 1986, three years after the Argentine military
dictatorship was overthrown, Timerman testified at the trial of
some of his chief tormentors, notably Gen. Ramon Camps, who was
convicted on 73 counts of torture and sentenced to 25 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his usual impulse toward the humane, Timerman reserved
the right to be selectively unforgiving, and described Camps, who
had been chief of police in Buenos Aires province during the
journalist's imprisonment, as ``a lunatic, paranoid assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   Never a stranger to controversy, Timerman, in his famous book
and in newspaper and magazine articles and television interviews,
repeatedly criticized prominent Argentine Jews as having been timid
in their response to the dictatorship's systematic suppression of
dissent and human rights. He compared them to members of the
Judenrat, or Jewish councils, of the sort that cooperated with the
Nazis in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And in the early 1980s he was vocal in his condemnation of the
Reagan administration's low-keyed human rights policy toward what
it called ``authoritarian'' right-wing regimes like those in
Argentina and Chile, which the administration tolerated, as
distinguished from ``totalitarian'' leftist governments as
exemplified by Cuba and Nicaragua, which it loudly condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Timerman was of the opinion that all extremist regimes, left and
right, were totalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   He was a voluble and dedicated patriot, although Argentina was
not his native country. ``The Timermans,'' he wrote, ``by way of
those strange, biforked paths of Judaism, escaped the Spanish
occupation of the Netherlands, and the Inquisition, and wound up in
a small town of Vinnitsia Oblast in the Ukraine, called Bar. Family
accounts, rather imprecise and often colored by vanity, claim that
the Timermans were prominent in the community and fought for Jewish
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Timerman was born in Bar on Jan. 6, 1923, the son of Nathan and
Eva Berman Timerman. When he was 5, the family fled Ukraine to
escape the pogroms widespread there and settled in the 11th
District of Buenos Aires, the heart of the Jewish quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12, his father died, leaving his mother to support
her two sons. They lived in a one-room apartment rent-free in
exchange for serving as janitors of the tenement building. Timerman
also worked as a jeweler's messenger.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Timerman said, was a ``neurotic obsessive'' on the
subject of the suffering of world Jewry, and when he was 14 she
urged him to join Avuca, a student group that studied Jewish
history and Zionism. Two young friends in the group, who called
themselves Socialist Zionists, were to have a lifelong influence on
him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard them speak,'' he wrote, ``I became destined for
that world I would never abandon _ a world that at times took the
form of Zionism, at times the struggle for human rights, at times
the fight for freedom of expression and at other times again the
solidarity with dissidents against all totalitarianisms.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens Timerman liked to read the works of what he called
``progressive, socially committed'' writers like Upton Sinclair,
John Dos Passos, Jack London, Erich Maria Remarque and Henri
Barbusse. He took part in Socialist May Day demonstrations and
supported the Hashomer Hatzair, the Zionist organization that sent
troops to fight Franco in the Spanish Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II Timerman joined the Youth League for
Freedom, which backed the Allied cause at the time when the
Argentine government was openly pro-German. Ultimately, the police
banned the league as a Communist front. Timerman was to maintain
throughout his life that he was never a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   Although he often said, ``I did not become a journalist, I was
born one,'' Timerman studied engineering in La Plata for a time. He
started writing in 1947, for several literary magazines. In 1950 he
joined La Razon, a leading Buenos Aires newspaper, and soon won a
reputation as a resourceful reporter with keen political insights.
</P>
<P>
   A restless workaholic, Timerman also worked in radio and
television, and, finally, with a group of other young journalists,
founded a Time-like weekly news magazine called Primera Plana. He
sold it in 1969 and founded Confirmidado, which also won popularity
as a newsweekly, then sold it and founded La Opinion in May 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, modeled on the liberal La Monde of Paris, was
greeted with glee by politically minded intellectuals, many of whom
welcomed its left-of-center stance, its profuse coverage of the
arts and its pro-Israel politics.
</P>
<P>
   La Opinion prospered, and when it reached a circulation of
150,000 in 1974, Timerman sold a 45 percent interest in it to David
Graiver, a young Jewish financier, who helped him build a modern
printing plant and start a small book-publishing company, Timerman
Editores.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine politics have always been complex, and in the early
1970s little that Timerman did, in any way, simplified his own
political actions. When Juan Domingo Peron returned from exile in
1973 and was re-elected president, the anti-fascist Timerman
supported him. But his Peronist allegiance ended in 1974 after the
death of Peron and the assumption of his office by his third wife,
Isabel Martinez de Peron.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Timerman continued to champion democratic institutions and human
rights, irrespective of ideologies, taking positions that were to
confound his interrogators later on.
</P>
<P>
   He condemned right-wing tendencies in the government of his
beloved Israel as well as the terrorist acts of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, while excoriating the Soviet Union's
persecution of dissidents and Cuba's treatment of political
prisoners. He also supported the Marxist government of Salvador
Allende Gossens in Chile. After Allende's overthrow by the
military, Timerman's denunciation of human rights violations was so
intense that the Chilean press referred to him as ``public enemy
No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Events leading to Timerman's imprisonment and torture began with
the 1976 overthrow of President Isabel Peron by a military junta
led by Lt. Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla.
</P>
<P>
   He backed the junta's pledges of economic reconstruction,
national unity and the eventual return to constitutional processes.
But it soon became clear the military was to remain entrenched in
power. Right-wing elements of the army embarked on a wave of
terrorism, taking scores of dissenters into custody and killing
thousands of desaparecidos _ the disappeared ones _ whose names
Timerman regularly printed in his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government began exerting pressure on La Opinion,
withholding official advertising, harassing its reporters and even
kidnapping some. Timerman regularly received death threats from the
right and the terrorist left, often brazenly publishing responses
to the threats on his front page. His answer to friends who urged
him to flee Argentina was, ``I am one who belongs to the Masada,''
a reference to the first-century Jewish community whose citizens
chose to die rather than surrender to the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Early on April 15, 1977, 20 armed men broke into Timerman's home
on orders of an army brigade commander. He was held in three
clandestine houses of confinement and two regular prisons for more
than a year, during which he was beaten, given electric shocks to
his genitals, put in solitary confinement under humiliating
circumstances and interrogated endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, and the 17 months of house arrest that
followed, the reasons for Timerman's treatment were never made
clear. There was vague talk by the military of ``subversive acts,''
of a Jewish plot to expropriate a southern area of Argentina and
set up a second Jewish state, and of ``economic crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an allusion to the government's charge that Timerman's
partner, Gravier, had used his international banking connections to
help a left-wing terrorist faction called the Montoneros invest
millions of dollars extorted through ransom. The military further
alleged that Timerman and Gravier were part of a
Jewish-Marxist-Montonero conspiracy. (Actually, Gravier's financial
empire had collapsed after his death in a mysterious plane crash in
Mexico in 1976.)
</P>
<P>
   During a period in which three separate judicial bodies cleared
Timerman of all charges against him, his incarceration drew
worldwide attention, with various people and institutions
protesting the violation of his human rights. These included Henry
Kissinger, President Jimmy Carter, Cyrus Vance, Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn, the Vatican, Amnesty International and the human
rights commission of the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court for the second time ordered Timerman's
release, on Sept. 25, the ruling generals summarily and illegally
stripped him of his citizenship, confiscated his newspaper and
other properties and put him on a plane for Israel, where he
claimed his Jewish right to citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   He lived In Israel, in Manhattan and in Spain until 1983, when
the military dictatorship was replaced by a democratically elected
government. In addition to testifying against his tormentors, he
took legal action to regain control of his newspaper, which had
been sold after his expulsion for $5 million. Eventually, the
government reimbursed him for that amount and he established homes
in Buenos Aires and in Punta del Este, the Uruguayan resort.
</P>
<P>
   Timerman's wife, Riche, died in 1991, and he acknowledged in an
interview last March in Punta del Este that her death had led to a
deep depression and writer's block and a reliance on drink.
</P>
<P>
   But he was beginning to come round, he added, and had begun work
on his memoirs, writing in longhand for an hour or two each morning
and afternoon. When he weakened, his son Javier said Thursday, he
tape-recorded his remembrances with a co-author, Carlos Gabetta of
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Timerman maintained his reputation for being an admirable but
egoistic individualist, disinclined to mince words or shy from
controversy. He continued to accuse the Jewish leadership of
Argentina, which has a Jewish population of about 300,000, of
looking the other way during the military regime as, he maintained,
some 1,500 Jews joined the ranks of the 15,000 or more Argentines
who ``disappeared'' because of their political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a
Number,'' Timerman was the author of ``The Longest War: Israel in
Lebanon,'' published in 1982, and ``Chile: Death in the South,''
released in 1988. He also wrote dozens of magazine and newspaper
articles.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three sons, Daniel, Hector and Javier, and
eight grandchildren.

ALBRIGHT OFFERS TO ABSORB CRITICISM FOR DEAL ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct slug to agree with FRONTPAGE advisory; moved
earlier as ALBRIGHT-U.N.-DUES. Story is now complete in one take.) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
volunteered to be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion
rights groups if President Clinton compromises with Congress on a
deal to free nearly $1 billion the United States owes the United
Nations, senior administration officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As a Cabinet member who supports abortion rights, Albright has
urged the White House to cut a deal that some administration
officials fear could strike some Clinton supporters as a retreat
from the president's pledge to defend abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the administration has refused a demand from House
conservative, led by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., to cut off
U.S. financing to international organizations that promote abortion
rights as a condition to repaying Washington's debt to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   White House domestic advisers, in particular, have been loath to
alienate a core Democratic constituency, women voters, by backing
away from Clinton's commitment on abortion rights abroad to resolve
an increasingly embarrassing foreign policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Albright, a former ambassador to the
United Nations, has aggressively lobbied Republican lawmakers and
Clinton to resolve several issues that threaten American global
leadership: the United Nations dues, debt relief to impoverished
countries and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Albright recently told John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, that if services offered by abortion rights groups overseas
are only minimally affected by any deal, the administration should
be willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to move off existing law, as a woman secretary of
state who knows extremely well the instinctive concerns of women's
groups, she's prepared to take the heat,'' said a senior
administration official, who would speak on the condition of
anonymity. ``She is prepared to meet with them and explain to them
why this does not harm our fundamental position, but that getting
the U.N. dues is critical for our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, declined to comment on
any offer Albright had made, saying, ``We're committed to paying
our fair share at the United Nations by paying our back dues, and
we're working very hard on a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and administration officials said discussions
continued Thursday on the abortion issue, which is holding up a
deal on the U.N. payments, one of the last major sticking points
blocking a session-ending budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators also faced a new environmental amendment delaying a
ban on road building in national forests and a dispute over debt
relief to impoverished countries. But the abortion issue could be
the last issue left on the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a great deal of rigor on that, as regarding the
question of whether or not American tax dollars should be used by
the U.N. or any other agencies to lobby other nations on their
abortion laws,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive lobbying by Albright and Richard Holbrooke, the
new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to repay $926 million
over the next three years has been well known.
</P>
<P>
   Making known Albright's intention to absorb the political flak
of a sensitive domestic political decision serves several purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It prepares abortion rights groups for a possible deal they may
not like, and that will probably affect the presidential campaign
of Vice President Al Gore and the possible Senate campaign of first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves to pressure wavering White House domestic
advisers. And it could be intended to steal some of the limelight
from Holbrooke, with whom Albright has had a tense relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning groups reacted cautiously to reports of
Albright's willingness to bear the brunt of any political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that will cut family planning is hardly a compromise
on the issue of abortion,'' said Susan Cohen, assistant director of
policy development for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research
and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite declarations that a deal may be near, only a tiny number
of people are intimately involved with the talks, mainly between
Steve Ricchetti, a White House deputy chief of staff, and Scott B.
Palmer, chief of staff for the speaker of the House, Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients of a possible deal include using Smith's
language but allowing presidential waivers to that provision for
international organizations that provide abortions or lobby for
abortion rights. The agreement would also include funding penalties
imposed by Congress on the amount of U.S. grants awarded to the
foreign organizations if the waivers were used.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional aides said there were other
approaches under consideration that they refused to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides agree that the political climate and cast of
characters this year enhance the prospects of ending a three-year
battle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, Clinton is free from the distractions
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and advisers like Albright and
Holbrooke have been pushing harder to resolve the issue. That is in
part because the stakes are higher. The United States will lose its
vote in the U.N. General Assembly if it fails to meet a Dec. 31
deadline for payments
</P>
<P>
   The dispute does not threaten the U.S. vote or seat on the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   There are also practical budget considerations for striking a
deal this year. Under the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Congress
can appropriate money for the United Nations without having to make
cuts in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, that will not be allowed, making repayment in an
election year much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also feeling some pressure. Some conservatives
do not want to give Clinton ammunition to fuel his charges that
Republicans are isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who opposes abortion, has quietly
urged both sides to reconcile, and he called Hastert on Wednesday
to offer his advice. Helms wants a deal because a Senate bill that
he sponsored ties the repayment of $926 million over three years to
changes he wants at the United Nations, including reducing budgets
and the United States' share of payments.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are also weighing in with Republicans. The
Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are pushing
for a deal to pay back the dues and carry out reforms at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Better World Campaign, a group financed by Ted Turner that
advocates repaying the debt, has hired Haley Barbour, former
chairman of the Republican National Committee, to lobby on its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear whether House conservatives will
support a deal. Their demand is to write into law an executive
order issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Clinton reversed
the order in 1993, shortly after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred direct financing for abortion since
1973, but the 1984 policy, known familiarly as ``Mexico City''
since Reagan announced it during a U.N. conference there, denied
grants to international family-planning organizations for any
purpose if they promoted abortion rights.

MANNESMANN ARMS ITSELF AGAINST AN OFFER BY VODAFONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Mannesmann AG is shoring up its defenses as
it prepares for what could be a huge-scale takeover battle with
Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, the leading mobile phone operator, is still wavering
about whether it will initiate a $100 billion hostile bid for the
German company, three weeks after executives close to Vodafone
indicated that such an offer was one of the options the company was
considering.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions within Vodafone began after Mannesmann offered
$33 billion to acquire Orange PLC, the third-largest mobile phone
operator in Britain, setting itself up as a rival in Vodafone's
home territory
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, people close to Vodafone cautioned that the company
was still far from certain about its plans and that it was still
considering other opportunities, but that it could make a move at
any moment if it chose to plunge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann executives, adamantly opposed to a takeover by
Vodafone, are taking no chances. The company has hired Deutsche
Bank, perhaps its oldest financier, to advise it on a defense
strategy, adding the bank to a team that already includes Merrill
Lynch and Morgan Stanley. And it has lined up a public relations
firm to help dissuade shareholders from accepting an unsolicited
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what Vodafone decides to do, it seems clear that
the scramble among companies to dominate a Europe-wide
telecommunications market is splintering old alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann and Vodafone had been partners for years. Vodafone
owns 35 percent of D2, Mannesmann's German mobile phone network, as
well as 22 percent of Omnitel, the Italian cellular network in
which Mannesmann recent acquired a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   But the partnership has turned into a bruising rivalry between
two of Europe's most aggressive and successful telecommunications
companies.
</P>
<P>
   And they are not the only companies circling each other. When
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom essentially called off their
longstanding alliance last summer, they prompted machinations among
other competitors, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The French company recently invaded Deutsche Telekom's market by
reaching an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in E-Plus,
Germany's third-largest wireless phone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is growing that Deutsche Telekom may bid for
Bouygues SA, which controls the French mobile carrier Bouygues
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   A hostile bid by Vodafone for Mannesmann would be extremely
risky, but it would hardly be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, which in June absorbed Airtouch Communications of San
Francisco for $60 billion in stock, has a market value of around
$160 billion. Mannesmann's market value is about $72 billion, and
with the pending acquisition of Orange, a suitor would have to pay
about $100 billion to win control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually don't believe that Mannesmann is overvalued,''
said Douglas Wight, an analyst with Commerzbank in London.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest argument in favor of a bid is that Mannesmann either
controls or will soon control wireless networks in three of
Europe's four biggest markets _ Germany, Italy and Britain _ as
well as fixed-line networks around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For all its size, Vodafone has only a weak position in Europe
outside Britain. Acquiring Mannesmann would strengthen its European
reach and eliminate a potentially dangerous rival at home.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, however, is that hostile takeovers remain
difficult in Europe, especially cross-border deals. Though German
government officials are unlikely to intervene against a hostile
bidder, Mannesmann's articles of incorporation now prohibit any
shareholder from exercising more than 5 percent of the company's
voting power.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions are to expire next year, and they could be
changed if Vodafone acquired enough shares to push for such a
change.
</P>
<P>
   But time could work against the company. Because Vodafone could
afford to make an offer only with its own stock, prolonged delays
could erode its share value and reduce the value of a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone executives have already spoken to France Telecom about
buying Orange if Vodafone made a run at Mannesmann. That would give
France Telecom control of wireless networks at home, in Germany
through E-Plus and in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, once an old-line engineering and industrial
conglomerate, has transformed itself into a highly successful
telecommunications company. Its German mobile network has 8 million
subscribers, slightly more than Deutsche Telekom, and it is growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported Thursday that its sales of
telecommunications services, bolstered by the acquisition of
Omnitel, soared 73 percent in the first nine months of this year,
to 5.8 billion euros, or a little over $6 billion. Leaving out
Omnitel and another acquisition, the German fixed-line carrier
Otelo, Mannesmann's telecommunications sales climbed 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shares rose nearly 7 percent here on Wednesday on
speculation of a Vodafone offer. On Thursday, after the European
edition of The Wall Street Journal reported that Vodafone was
considering making a bid as early as next week, the shares rose
2.85 percent more, to 178.70 euros, or $185.85.

BIOTECH FIRMS TRY TO COUNTER CONCERNS ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED
FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 4th graf to replace reference to `their own insecticidal
toxin' with `resist pests or produce higher yields') 
(bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Worried about growing resistance to genetically
modified foods, some of the world's biggest biotechnology companies
have decided to mount a huge lobbying and marketing campaign to
counter their critics and combat what they fear is a rising wave of
anti-biotech hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of genetically modified seeds have taken a beating this
year in Europe, where critics have sabotaged test plots of altered
crops and have fostered widespread distrust of what they call
Frankenstein Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Now that wariness is starting to appear in the United States.
Environmental groups are stoking opposition through lobbying and
full-page advertisements; federal lawmakers on Wednesday introduced
legislation that would require labeling of food made with
genetically modified crops, and regulators are re-evaluating
everything from food safety to the effects bioengineered crops may
have on the monarch butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in this contest for American public opinion are
billions of dollars in investments by the biotechnology industry
and American farmers who have rapidly adopted products like corn
and soybeans that have been engineered to resist pests or producer
higher yields.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the leading biotechnology companies were
reluctant to respond to criticism in this country for fear of
making the novel foods an issue. But some biotech executives now
say that there is a sense that the tide may be turning against
genetically modified foods and that urgent action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   And so in recent months, Monsanto Co., Du Pont, Novartis AG and
other biotech companies have formed a series of industry-wide
alliances and have set aside tens of millions of dollars to fight
what they view as an ugly campaign that has vilified the companies
_ calling Monsanto, for example, ``Monsatan'' and ``Mutanto,'' _
and has misrepresented their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protest industry has gone too far,'' said Edward Shonsey,
chief executive at Novartis Seeds Inc., in an interview. ``They've
crossed the boundaries of reasonableness, and now it's up to us to
protect and defend biotechnology. As a result there's a combined
effort to get the facts out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the alliances are financing scientific research,
organizing educational forums, lobbying legislators, regulators and
farm organizations, and using their own Web sites to promote the
benefits of genetically modified, or GM, products. The members have
also retained three major public relations concerns in recent
weeks. And many are pooling their resources and preparing a global
advertising and public relations campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these forces are coming to bear where we're going to have
a really big battle,'' said Todd Duvick, a food industry analyst at
Bank of America. ``We already have huge quantities of GM foods and
there are companies that want labeling and companies that don't
want them; it's creating a logistical nightmare. Meanwhile, all the
biotechnology companies are trying to protect themselves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate centers on a technology that can borrow genetic code
from plants or animals and transfer it to a plant to give it a
desired trait. This year, 20 to 45 percent of American corn and
soybeans were grown from seed engineered to produce its own
insecticidal toxin, and those crops have found their way into many
processed foods. Backers say biotechnology may eventually lead to
crops that have extra nutrition or can thrive in adverse weather.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer advocates and scientists, particularly in
Europe, say that not enough research has been done to prove that
food made from genetically altered crops is safe to eat. In
response, federal regulators say that no studies have proven that
food made from genetically modified products is harmful to eat, and
that all biotech products now on the market have been deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the possible effect such crops might have on
the environment. An increasing number of studies suggest that
genetically modified plants could interact with the environment in
hazardous ways, like creating a hard to eradicate ``superweed,''
and that regulators are not demanding the proper studies to assess
the risks.
</P>
<P>
   With critics gaining ground in the United States, the
biotechnology companies feel they need to act. But their campaign
is not unified. Monsanto, whose aggressive efforts to gain
acceptance for its genetically modified products, backfired in
Europe, recently retained Burson-Marsteller, a global public
relations firm, at an annual cost of millions of dollars, according
to people who reviewed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, whose stock price has suffered over the past year
because of growing concern about the viability and profitability of
its biotechnology division, is now trying a two-pronged effort to
educate consumers and reach out to its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as a much more positive, pro-active dialogue
with the public, which has the right to know more about the
benefits of biotechnology,'' said Nick Rosa, a senior vice
president at Monsanto in St. Louis. ``We are not interested in a
guerrilla response. There are many coalitions interested in
communicating on biotech and in many instances we are working with
them. We believe that the benefits of biotechnology need to be
told.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto is even meeting with some of its most vocal opponents.
A month ago, Monsanto chief executive Robert Shapiro addressed a
gathering of the environmental group Greenpeace. And Shapiro and
other top Monsanto executives plan to meet soon with Jeremy Rifkin,
an influential commentator on science and technology to whom
biotechnology is a ``Faustian bargain.'' The meeting was arranged
by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pont is taking a conciliatory approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public concern has been aggravated by the perception that we
in industry have often acted as though public fears are not
legitimate and are the result of ignorance,'' Du Pont chief
executive Charles Holliday said in a speech last September.
``Unfortunately, many in the industry have been reluctant to
address concerns about the risks of biotechnology. But we have to
listen to the people who are now raising alarms. We don't have all
the answers and to pretend we do, or to brush off concern as
unfounded, is to be arrogant and reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Du Pont recently released a series of television commercials
about the future, featuring the company's ``to do list,'' which
included research to ``find food that helps prevent breast
cancer,'' a breakthrough that might induce broader acceptance among
consumers, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Seeds U.S.A., however, is publicly acknowledging a
spirited campaign to balance the flow of public information about
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in four or five different working groups on this issue,''
said Shonsey, the chief executive at Novartis Seeds. ``We're
holding in-depth sessions with members of Congress, with
universities and trade associations, the grocery manufacturers and
food associations. Strategy is taking place to do that, you may
even see TV and radio ads, even scientific conferences. We want a
consistent message out there. We want a more balanced discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Food industry trade groups are also rallying and recently formed
the Alliance for Better Foods, whose Web site betterfoods.org, is
devoted to promoting the benefits of biotech foods.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which is supported by groups like the Grocery
Manufacturers of America, says it wants consumers to know not only
that bio-engineered crops resists pests and increases crop yields,
but that the technology holds out the promise of creating more
nutritious foods and perhaps even foods that could serve to prevent
or treat medical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the shrill statements and outrageous tactics by
people who are attacking biotech foods,'' said Gene Grabowski, a
spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the Alliance
for Better Foods. ``Our site is intended to be based on fact; it's
decidedly pro-biotech but it's not intended to be strident.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have reviewed their stunning public relations loss
in Europe and now acknowledge that there were a number of missteps.
``I think there was a certain naivete in our initial approaches to
the European market,'' Shapiro said in an interview. ``We had been
operating on a model that had been used in the U.S. If the question
is have we learned anything in recent months in the sociology, the
media orientation, yes we have learned something.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the trade groups and other coalitions are
expected to take the visible lead in the months to come. ``There's
a feeling that some of the companies have been vilified, and so
it's more credible if scientists and academics and farmers stand up
on the issue,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology
Industry Organization in Washington, which is lobbying on behalf of
Monsanto and others. ``If it's the company people say, `Well it's
got a commercial interest.' So it's better this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leading environmental groups, however, say they
believe the new campaign will backfire because it will raise even
more questions about biotech foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are under the misguided assumption that the more
information they put out the more light at the end of the tunnel,''
said Rifkin, who is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends,
an environmental group. ``But the more information they put out the
more questions people have about GM foods.'' He asserted that the
products were dangerous and said, ``They think it's public
relations disaster but it's more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups in the United States pounced on the issue
in May, when a Cornell University study showed that pollen from
corn producing the insecticidal toxin Bt could stunt the
development of monarch caterpillars in the laboratory. Since then,
amid growing coverage by the news media detailing concerns about
the safety of genetically modified crops, Federal officials are
moving to act.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of 20 members of
Congress introduced legislation that would require labeling of
genetically engineered food products because of concerns about food
safety and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are weighing their own responses. In the
coming weeks, the FDA is planning to hold a series of forums on
biotechnology, largely to solicit public opinion, and Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman is expected to name a panel of experts to
advise him on biotechnology issues; the Environmental Protection
Agency is also expected to announce in the coming weeks on how
biotech corn can be planted, a decision that may be influenced by
the recent restudies on the Monarch Butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   In the scramble to influence this debate, a group of public
relations officials apparently jumped the gun last weekat a
scientific conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which was financed by the large biotechnology
companies, invited representatives of the news media. Yet before
the deliberations began, staff members issued a news release
announcing that the conference expected to show that genetically
engineered corn did not harm monarch butterflies , even though no
scientists later polled by a reporter said they could draw such a
conclusion and most of them acknowledged that their research was
far from complete.
</P>
<P>
   The conference and about half the studies presented were
financed by the biotechnology industry. But the public relations
officials insisted the meeting was strictly scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quibble with it but I think it was a low-key press
release,'' said Libby Mikesell, a spokeswoman for the Agricultural
Biotechnology Stewardship Working Group, a trade group financed by
big biotechnology companies. ``This just said: `This is what we
expect them to say, please tune in. There wasn't any interest in
trying to spin it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists, however, say they were told the conference
could help influence the decision by the Environmental Protection
Agency on biotech Bt corn. ``It's my understanding that they wanted
to give some partial data to the EPA by this date,'' said John
Foster, a professor of entomology at the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say part of the reason they chose to release
preliminary data, some of the studies with as little as 10 percent
of the work complete, was pressure from farmers seeking more
information on what they call genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Growers want to know what is going to happen, Foster said, and
re are asking, ``Are we going to be able to plant GMOs?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the debate about biotechnology is coalescing
around seed sales to farmers. The nation's leading seed and
biotechnology companies are trying to convince farmers of the
viability of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a lot more hand holding,'' John Hawkins, a
spokesman for the Illinois Farm Bureau. ``Farmers are upset with
low prices and now you have this technology with potential to lower
their costs but foreign countries are saying `we're not going to
buy it or we'll have to label it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And if farmers turn against them, the big biotechnology
companies could face huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly everyone in the biotech industry is concerned,'' said
Frank Mitsch, who follows chemical and biotechnology companies at
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, a brokerage firm. ``To some extent the
year 2000 is going to be a lost year for them, and we're trying to
see the order of magnitude.''

   PARIS _ ``Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or
close the wall up with our English dead.'' (Shakespeare).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once more into the beef, dear friends, once more, or close the
supermarket trolley up with our English apples.'' (Tesco).
</P>
<P>
   Watching the escalation of the beef war from the other side of
the Channel, it has been difficult to know whether to laugh or to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   The British were once prized, on the French side of the water,
for their phlegm; their calm; their sense of fair play. No more.
The hype and hysteria surrounding the French ban on British beef
has been utterly disproportionate to the crime (and a minor
political crime in Paris there certainly was).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of propaganda and vilification in the tabloid press
_ and not just the tabloid press _ has been reminiscent of the
prelude to a real war, not a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this is not a government propaganda campaign but a
propaganda campaign generated almost entirely by the British press
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since when did the highly urban, British tabloid newspapers and
their mostly urban readers care a stuffed turnip for the genuine
problems of British farmers?
</P>
<P>
   Do we really feel outraged that the French prefer not to eat our
beef? Or have we all fallen victim to a part-cynical,
part-unthinking agenda which loves to feel outraged by foreigners,
especially the Europeans and mostly the French?
</P>
<P>
   Enough. Ca suffit. Please calm down, everybody. Can we just
return to a few simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   The French are in the wrong. It was foolish of them to break an
EU concensus and try to impose an absolute safety standard on
British beef.
</P>
<P>
   There are complex, emotive French political reasons why this
happened. But, in the end, France, as a great food-exporting
nation, has the most to lose from such wildcat applications of an
impossible 100 percent safety barrier for trade in food.
</P>
<P>
   But please let us remember what we are quarrelling about. We are
arguing about the resumption of British beef exports to France,
which British officials say would probably reach no more than 20
tons in the first year, in other words roughly one truck load.
</P>
<P>
   We are hurling insults across the Channel in a horribly
technical dispute in which the scientific arguments are not
completely understood by more than one in every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has declined sharply in the UK in the last three years _
more rapidly than the French admit _ but the disease is still
infinitely more rife in Britain than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The French scientific community has a right to be concerned; so
should we be. But the French have not produced convincing new
evidence that the limited British beef approved for export is
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   To turn this mind-bendingly complex quarrel into some kind of
national crusade in which the froggies are hypocritical,
protectionists whose cows eat dung (they don't); and we are
obviously right, just because we are British, is absurd; puerile;
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the hypocritical French farmers DO feed their cows
sewage, don't they? The European Commission said so.
</P>
<P>
   No it did not. It said that some French manufacturers of animal
feed had illegally placed processed sewage sludge into the mix with
cereals and a score of other ingredients. In other words, there
were minuscule traces of treated sewage in some animal feeds,
mostly used for pigs and chickens, not cows.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is horrible and disgusting enough. It caused
consternation in France when it was revealed months ago. It is a
long way from what you can still read daily in tabloid and
broadsheet British newspapers and the mouths of Conservative
politicians: that French farmers willingly feed their cows dung.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of fault on the French side of the Channel.
French farmers, always game for a bit of tractor-borne aggro, are
threatening to block British trucks. A trial run by a few farmers
recently received an escort of French gendarmes as it trundled
through the Pas de Calais.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts strangely with the pompous and high-handed
reaction of French police to a dotty little demonstration by
British Euro MP's on the Champs Elysees and a British roast beef
lunch organized in Amiens by FRENCH farmers, sympathetic to the
British case.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have in France _ do we have to reach the
depressing conclusion that it is a more grown up country? _ are the
mindless insults and foreigner-baiting which are rife in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are real issues here but they are not truly issues of
Britain versus France, or British farmers versus French farmers, or
British consumers versus French consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues of food safety in a world in which some farmers
no longer know what they are feeding to their animals; they are
issues of agri-industry versus traditional farming.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues which cross national boundaries because food
crosses national boundaries, in huge quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They are not issues which can be solved by waving flags and
screaming insults in the name of half-understood science.
</P>
<P>
   Let the politicians and the lawyers and the scientists sort it
out. Let's, everyone, take a deep breath. It is time for common
sense, and a sense of proportion, to break out, on both sides of
the Channel. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: KRZYZEWSKI'S LOGIC RUNS INTO REALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new kid running the famously erudite Duke offense has sizzle
to his game and a mouth to match, and a heart that has guided him
into a soup kitchen to volunteer. The third coming of Jason
Williams sounds something like an amalgam of the previous two.
</P>
<P>
   This Williams is another Jersey guy, without the Y. He came to
Mike Krzyzewski's lair out of Plainfield and St. Joseph's High
School of Metuchen, believing he was going to be William Avery's
apprentice for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had expected my freshman year to be a gradual learning
experience,'' he said before Duke was outlasted by Stanford, 80-79,
in overtime Thursday night at Madison Square Garden in the Coaches
vs. Cancer Classic. ``I really wanted to play with William, Elton
Brand and Corey Maggette.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the comings and goings of Division I. First, Brand, as
Krzyzewski expected, turned professional about 15 seconds after
Duke lost the 1999 title game to Connecticut, the guest star of
Thursday night's second game against Iowa. Then Avery, a sophomore,
and the freshman leaper, Maggette, formed a conga line out of
Tobacco Road. The coach erupted, in the manner of his mentor, Bob
Knight. Reportedly, he berated Avery, antagonized the point guard's
mother and alienated Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   All, naturally, for their own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I recruited them,'' Krzyzewski explained, ``I promised to
always tell them the truth as I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the coach's logic encounters the contentious
defense his teams are well known for. Those three players, the
first to leave the Duke program before four years elapsed on the
Cameron Stadium clock, were all selected in the first round of the
National Basketball Association draft. They signed three-year
contracts, putting them in an income bracket that would rescue
their families from the modest environments never associated with
former Dukies like Danny Ferry and Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As Krzyzewski signed what most observers of the sport rated the
country's best recruiting class, the only apparent casualty of the
defections was the coach's reputation as the Special K of the
college game. With the exception of a few Scholastic Assessment
Test scores, Duke, suddenly, was Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to show you can succeed in different time periods,
I think, is a challenge,'' Krzyzewski now reasons.
</P>
<P>
   With seven Final Four teams in the last nine years, he could
retire tomorrow to the Hall of Fame. Krzyzewski has managed to do
what few other coaches, college or professional, have done _ win
big and steer clear of crisis. Even as he began to de-prep his
program, seldom, if ever, has he had to address reports of his
players at the wheel of the wrong Land Rover, the ominous
distraction that UConn's Jim Calhoun faced Thursday with another
sniff of impropriety regarding Khalid El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   This is no knee-jerk condemnation of El-Amin. The college game
is rife with double standards and outright hypocrisy. Coaches can
wear sandwich signs for shoe companies but players get investigated
_ as UConn's Jake Voskuhl was recently _ for accepting a ride to
class. Players have their loyalty and sanity questioned for turning
professional, but a coach can break his contract at first sniff,
which is how Steve Alford was coaching Iowa last night after making
the regionals last spring with Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing when an uninformed, unprepared player lets some
sleaze bag agent talk him into leaving school. If Coach K could
have known what vehicular fate awaited Bobby Hurley after four
years at Duke, would he have sent him out a year or two sooner to
make a few extra bucks? When a kid who's going to make a cool
million wants to go, Jackson Browne sang the appropriate coach's
response years ago: ``If you see somewhere to go, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski's riddle was believing he could bend his value
system, without it breaking, the way the old Soviet hockey people
tried to open the door to the West just a bit, back in the days of
Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika. It let a few aging stars out, but
soon the telephones were ringing with news of riches, and the
Sergei Federovs were defecting first chance they got.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be something if UConn, with this latest revelation
about El-Amin's associations, wound up stripped of its title? Not
likely, but that would mean Brand and Co. would have departed as
champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of mad when William and the others left,'' Jason
Williams said. ``But I still want to win four national titles.''
</P>
<P>
   His tune may change in a year of two. No one, least of all the
coach, should argue with him if it does.  &QL;

   PARIS _ ``Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or
close the wall up with our English dead.'' (Shakespeare).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once more into the beef, dear friends, once more, or close the
supermarket trolley up with our English apples.'' (Tesco).
</P>
<P>
   Watching the escalation of the beef war from the other side of
the Channel, it has been difficult to know whether to laugh or to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   The British were once prized, on the French side of the water,
for their phlegm; their calm; their sense of fair play. No more.
The hype and hysteria surrounding the French ban on British beef
has been utterly disproportionate to the crime (and a minor
political crime in Paris there certainly was).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of propaganda and vilification in the tabloid press
_ and not just the tabloid press _ has been reminiscent of the
prelude to a real war, not a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this is not a government propaganda campaign but a
propaganda campaign generated almost entirely by the British press
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since when did the highly urban, British tabloid newspapers and
their mostly urban readers care a stuffed turnip for the genuine
problems of British farmers?
</P>
<P>
   Do we really feel outraged that the French prefer not to eat our
beef? Or have we all fallen victim to a part-cynical,
part-unthinking agenda which loves to feel outraged by foreigners,
especially the Europeans and mostly the French?
</P>
<P>
   Enough. Ca suffit. Please calm down, everybody. Can we just
return to a few simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   The French are in the wrong. It was foolish of them to break an
EU concensus and try to impose an absolute safety standard on
British beef.
</P>
<P>
   There are complex, emotive French political reasons why this
happened. But, in the end, France, as a great food-exporting
nation, has the most to lose from such wildcat applications of an
impossible 100 percent safety barrier for trade in food.
</P>
<P>
   But please let us remember what we are quarrelling about. We are
arguing about the resumption of British beef exports to France,
which British officials say would probably reach no more than 20
tons in the first year, in other words roughly one truck load.
</P>
<P>
   We are hurling insults across the Channel in a horribly
technical dispute in which the scientific arguments are not
completely understood by more than one in every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has declined sharply in the UK in the last three years _
more rapidly than the French admit _ but the disease is still
infinitely more rife in Britain than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The French scientific community has a right to be concerned; so
should we be. But the French have not produced convincing new
evidence that the limited British beef approved for export is
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   To turn this mind-bendingly complex quarrel into some kind of
national crusade in which the froggies are hypocritical,
protectionists whose cows eat dung (they don't); and we are
obviously right, just because we are British, is absurd; puerile;
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the hypocritical French farmers DO feed their cows
sewage, don't they? The European Commission said so.
</P>
<P>
   No it did not. It said that some French manufacturers of animal
feed had illegally placed processed sewage sludge into the mix with
cereals and a score of other ingredients. In other words, there
were minuscule traces of treated sewage in some animal feeds,
mostly used for pigs and chickens, not cows.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is horrible and disgusting enough. It caused
consternation in France when it was revealed months ago. It is a
long way from what you can still read daily in tabloid and
broadsheet British newspapers and the mouths of Conservative
politicians: that French farmers willingly feed their cows dung.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of fault on the French side of the Channel.
French farmers, always game for a bit of tractor-borne aggro, are
threatening to block British trucks. A trial run by a few farmers
recently received an escort of French gendarmes as it trundled
through the Pas de Calais.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts strangely with the pompous and high-handed
reaction of French police to a dotty little demonstration by
British Euro MP's on the Champs Elysees and a British roast beef
lunch organized in Amiens by FRENCH farmers, sympathetic to the
British case.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have in France _ do we have to reach the
depressing conclusion that it is a more grown up country? _ are the
mindless insults and foreigner-baiting which are rife in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are real issues here but they are not truly issues of
Britain versus France, or British farmers versus French farmers, or
British consumers versus French consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues of food safety in a world in which some farmers
no longer know what they are feeding to their animals; they are
issues of agri-industry versus traditional farming.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues which cross national boundaries because food
crosses national boundaries, in huge quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They are not issues which can be solved by waving flags and
screaming insults in the name of half-understood science.
</P>
<P>
   Let the politicians and the lawyers and the scientists sort it
out. Let's, everyone, take a deep breath. It is time for common
sense, and a sense of proportion, to break out, on both sides of
the Channel. &QL;

OLDER AND WISER, BUT NOT AGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Questions have circled Evander Holyfield's career
like birds of prey poised to swoop down for the kill, but he has
always managed to survive.
</P>
<P>
   First, everyone wondered whether he could successfully move up
from cruiserweight to heavyweight in 1988. He did, in spectacular
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Following a third stirring fight with Riddick Bowe in 1995,
Holyfield was told by doctors that he had a heart ailment. He
overcame it and stunned Mike Tyson in an 11th-round technical
knockout on Nov. 9, 1996, ending speculation that Holyfield was in
mortal peril to enter the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Saturday night's heavyweight unification rematch
against Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion, at the
Thomas and Mack Center, the latest questions are whether countless
punches and advancing age have caught up with the 37-year-old
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1) is not going to call Holyfield (36-3-1) old or even
hint that the champion of the World Boxing Association and the
International Boxing Federation is shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never do that before a fight, because if you do and you
get knocked down, then he says, `This old fighter just knocked you
down,''' the 34-year-old Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The armor is chipping off Holyfield's well-chiseled body. He
weighed in at 217 pounds Thursday afternoon, while Lewis came in at
242.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has been through quite a few epic slugfests. He and
George Foreman pounded each other for 12 rounds in 1991. In his
next fight, against Bert Cooper, Holyfield was hammered until
scoring a seventh-round technical knockout. The next year, Bowe
slugged Holyfield for 12 rounds and Holyfield lost the unified
title on a decision. Oddly, that was the last time the heavyweight
title was unified.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two fights, Holyfield has not been at his best. On
Sept. 19, 1998, Holyfield was sluggish in a 12-round decision over
Vaughn Bean. In the first fight against Lewis on March 13,
Holyfield was not moving his head, his legs were leaden and he
could not get off punches. After the fight, Holyfield complained of
cramps in his legs and back, citing a stomach virus that had sapped
his fluids.
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield is not making any concessions to age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age is not catching up with me,'' he said. ``I am growing
older. That's just a fact of life. It's not what you lose, but what
you gain with age. I'm a lot wiser now, even though I was
courageous at a young age. Age was not to reason I had a bad
performance. I was just lackluster.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighters have a way of getting old in the ring. Sometimes it
happens gradually and sometimes it all happens suddenly in one
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, was once Holyfield's trainer.
He worked with Holyfield for the rematch against Bowe, which
Holyfield won on a hard-fought 12-round decision. Steward said it
would be a mistake to think Holyfield is over the hill. Steward has
been preparing Lewis to meet a fighter who is in top shape and not
making any concessions to Holyfield's age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa strikes out three times, then he had a bad day; but
if a fighter has a bad day, he's washed up,'' said Don Turner,
Holyfield's trainer, who does not believe Holyfield has aged to the
point of being ineffective in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think age would catch up to him if he was fighting
Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier. With Lennox Lewis, it's hard to
tell because Lewis does some things that aren't conventional.
Everybody is talking about Lennox Lewis, but they forget that he's
a world champion, too. Vaughn Bean was a better fighter than people
gave him credit for. He's only lost two fights, and they were both
championship fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he has very little to prove in the sport, having
beaten Tyson twice and fought all of his contemporaries. He will
not say when he will give up the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It may be more difficult for him to walk away because his wife
is suing him for divorce and is seeking $60 million. He will earn
$13.5 million for his fight against Lewis, who will earn $15
million. There are still some lucrative fights out there for
Holyfield: one against Tyson and one against Roy Jones Jr., the
undisputed light heavyweight champion. The question is whether
Holyfield will be fit enough to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I do and I do love where I'm at,'' Holyfield said.
``But I don't want to be where God doesn't want me to be. When I
get my departure papers I'll leave.''

<P>
   The stock-market joke about January is that it just keeps coming
earlier. This year it probably won't. It may even wait until
January.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger news is that when January does arrive it won't be
just small-company investors who are toasting their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to unusually extensive end-of-the-year selling, worries
about rising interest rates, and concerns about Y2K glitches, the
stock market is likely to get an even bigger and broader seasonal
bounce than usual this year.
</P>
<P>
   Will you portfolio be ready?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the famed January effect, of course. Every
January _ well, to be precise, 60 out of the past 73 _
small-company stocks outperform large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly why, although most experts believe the
phenomenon has something to do with the tax-related selling of
losing stocks that begins in October and with the end-of-the-year
portfolio-dressing money managers employ as they get ready to
defend their stock picks to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, betting on small-company stocks pays off
year in and year out. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, to take full advantage of the January effect,
investors have had to jump the gun. In fact, there hasn't been any
January effect at all in the past six Januarys.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, for example, the small-company Russell 2000
index climbed 1 percent while the large-company Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Stock Index scored a 4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say there wasn't a January effect last year.
It's just that the thing came early, as it generally has in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Russell 2000 soared 6 percent, matching the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. In 1996, the Russell beat the S&AMP;P by five
percentage points, and in 1994, it beat the S&AMP;P by two. (Like 1998,
1997 and 1995 were ties.)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of outperformance in December is especially impressive
when you consider that over the past 50 years December has been the
Standard &AMP; Poor's best month, with an average gain of 1.8 percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, many Wall Street gurus are predicting a
bigger-than-usual January effect. Their logic is pretty compelling.
Most stocks have taken a beating in 1999 _ although the performance
of a relative handful of big winners has made the indexes look
deceptively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as of Sept. 20 about 62 percent of stocks on the
New York Stock Exchange were down for the calendar year. That's
2,561 losers versus just 1,498 winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, about 50 percent of stocks were down for the year
_ even though the Nasdaq Composite index was up by almost 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All those losers mean lots of end-of-the-year selling to lock in
losses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers with big gains in Cisco Systems (up 47 percent
from Jan. 1 through Sept. 24), Sun Microsystems (up 111 percent),
or Red Hat (up 629 percent since it went public in August) will be
looking to sell Coca-Cola (down 23 percent in 1999), Philip Morris
(down 34 percent), or Just for Feet (down 91 percent).
</P>
<P>
   You might think those stocks are ready for a rebound, since
they're so cheap now _ and in normal circumstances that might be
the case. But they face more selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The selling will start as early as October _ since many mutual
funds operate on a fiscal year that ends on Oct. 31 _ and will
stretch into December as individual investors take a turn.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-the-year portfolio dressing will hurt many of this year's
downtrodden, too.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers don't want to have to defend a big position in
Family Golf Centers (down 89 percent for 1999 as of Sept. 24) or
uBid (down 78 percent) or Rite Aid (also down 78 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Better to dump those turkeys before the end of the year and hope
no one notices the way they dogged up the portfolio in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about additional interest-rate increases from the
Federal Reserve Board and about the effects of Y2K are also likely
to weigh on the market in the last quarter of the year _ and keep
depressed stocks from bouncing back too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of another 25-basis-point (100 basis points
equal one percentage point) hike from Alan Greenspan and company is
a great excuse to stay on the sidelines. After all, if rates
ratchet up further from here, then many stocks that have dipped $10
or $20 a share aren't as cheap as they look.
</P>
<P>
   And Y2K? It's a complete wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Could a computer glitch at midnight on Dec. 31 shut down the
world banking system or flight-control computers at the world's
airports? How about a supply-chain failure at a major automaker or
a collapse in sales at a computer-software company?
</P>
<P>
   All possible _ if unlikely _ and more reason to sit on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery, when it comes, should be even more robust than
usual. The pressure on stocks from tax-selling and
portfolio-dressing will ease with the end of the fiscal and
calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve either will have raised interest rates or
will have held off for several months _ in either case, the worry
will diminish. Y2K will start to get less scary well before Jan. 1,
as companies announce that they're seeing little or no effect on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on Jan. 1, happen what may, the market will be able
to put all this behind it. And because in 1999, for the first time
in a number of years, many large-company stocks have been hammered
along with small-company stocks, the January effect should take in
a very broad swath of the market.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors make it likely that the January effect will be
a very profitable seasonal trend to ride at the end of 1999, but
they also make timing the effect a little more uncertain than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the low in the market has come during
the first couple weeks of November.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who wanted to take full advantage of the
end-of-the-year gain sold into the fall rally (a dependable
phenomenon all decade) and then used that cash to build new
positions by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thanks to Y2K, the effect may play out a few weeks
later than that _ some investors will wait to see how the world's
computers seem to be reacting.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic strategy remains the same _ sell into the fall
rally (weak as it has been this year) and then redeploy cash in
November.
</P>
<P>
   And then trust that history will repeat itself. &QL;

phenomenon has something to do with the tax-related selling of
losing stocks that begins in October and with the end-of-the-year
portfolio-dressing money managers employ as they get ready to
defend their stock picks to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, betting on small-company stocks pays off
year in and year out. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, to take full advantage of the January effect,
investors have had to jump the gun. In fact, there hasn't been any
January effect at all in the past six Januarys.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, for example, the small-company Russell 2000
index climbed 1 percent while the large-company Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Stock Index scored a 4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say there wasn't a January effect last year.
It's just that the thing came early, as it generally has in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Russell 2000 soared 6 percent, matching the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. In 1996, the Russell beat the S&AMP;P by five
percentage points, and in 1994, it beat the S&AMP;P by two. (Like 1998,
1997 and 1995 were ties.)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of outperformance in December is especially impressive
when you consider that over the past 50 years December has been the
Standard &AMP; Poor's best month, with an average gain of 1.8 percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, many Wall Street gurus are predicting a
bigger-than-usual January effect. Their logic is pretty compelling.
Most stocks have taken a beating in 1999 _ although the performance
of a relative handful of big winners has made the indexes look
deceptively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as of Sept. 20 about 62 percent of stocks on the
New York Stock Exchange were down for the calendar year. That's
2,561 losers versus just 1,498 winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, about 50 percent of stocks were down for the year
_ even though the Nasdaq Composite index was up by almost 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All those losers mean lots of end-of-the-year selling to lock in
losses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers with big gains in Cisco Systems (up 47 percent
from Jan. 1 through Sept. 24), Sun Microsystems (up 111 percent),
or Red Hat (up 629 percent since it went public in August) will be
looking to sell Coca-Cola (down 23 percent in 1999), Philip Morris
(down 34 percent), or Just for Feet (down 91 percent).
</P>
<P>
   You might think those stocks are ready for a rebound, since
they're so cheap now _ and in normal circumstances that might be
the case. But they face more selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The selling will start as early as October _ since many mutual
funds operate on a fiscal year that ends on Oct. 31 _ and will
stretch into December as individual investors take a turn.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-the-year portfolio dressing will hurt many of this year's
downtrodden, too.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers don't want to have to defend a big position in
Family Golf Centers (down 89 percent for 1999 as of Sept. 24) or
uBid (down 78 percent) or Rite Aid (also down 78 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Better to dump those turkeys before the end of the year and hope
no one notices the way they dogged up the portfolio in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about additional interest-rate increases from the
Federal Reserve Board and about the effects of Y2K are also likely
to weigh on the market in the last quarter of the year _ and keep
depressed stocks from bouncing back too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of another 25-basis-point (100 basis points
equal one percentage point) hike from Alan Greenspan and company is
a great excuse to stay on the sidelines. After all, if rates
ratchet up further from here, then many stocks that have dipped $10
or $20 a share aren't as cheap as they look.
</P>
<P>
   And Y2K? It's a complete wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Could a computer glitch at midnight on Dec. 31 shut down the
world banking system or flight-control computers at the world's
airports? How about a supply-chain failure at a major automaker or
a collapse in sales at a computer-software company?
</P>
<P>
   All possible _ if unlikely _ and more reason to sit on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery, when it comes, should be even more robust than
usual. The pressure on stocks from tax-selling and
portfolio-dressing will ease with the end of the fiscal and
calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve either will have raised interest rates or
will have held off for several months _ in either case, the worry
will diminish. Y2K will start to get less scary well before Jan. 1,
as companies announce that they're seeing little or no effect on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on Jan. 1, happen what may, the market will be able
to put all this behind it. And because in 1999, for the first time
in a number of years, many large-company stocks have been hammered
along with small-company stocks, the January effect should take in
a very broad swath of the market.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors make it likely that the January effect will be
a very profitable seasonal trend to ride at the end of 1999, but
they also make timing the effect a little more uncertain than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the low in the market has come during
the first couple weeks of November.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who wanted to take full advantage of the
end-of-the-year gain sold into the fall rally (a dependable
phenomenon all decade) and then used that cash to build new
positions by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thanks to Y2K, the effect may play out a few weeks
later than that _ some investors will wait to see how the world's
computers seem to be reacting.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic strategy remains the same _ sell into the fall
rally (weak as it has been this year) and then redeploy cash in
November.
</P>
<P>
   And then trust that history will repeat itself. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, investment returns had two components: capital
gains and income. But after years of declining interest rates and
rocketing stock prices, the idea of investing to capture a stream
of interest and dividend payments seems frightfully old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for investors whose goals have changed from
accumulating wealth to spending it. We should all live so long.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who rely on their portfolios to spin off enough cash
to pay the bills soon discover how much has changed since the days
when electric utilities paid fat dividends and even Uncle Sam had
to pay double-digit interest rates to borrow money in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, utilities retain their cash to compete in a newly
deregulated environment, and the U.S. Treasury, with a lighter
financing burden, pays about 6.08 percent for 30-year money.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is the high cost of assembling a
diversified income-producing portfolio out of individual debt and
equity securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many bonds are issued in minimum denominations of $25,000 or
even $1 million, so mutual funds are the income investment of
choice for most people. But which funds?
</P>
<P>
   The income-fund universe has shrunk drastically in recent years,
but the database of Morningstar, the Chicago mutual-fund research
house, still lists more than 1,000 intermediate- to long-term bond
funds and about 200 funds composed primarily of income-producing
equity securities such as preferred stock and real-estate
investment trusts, or REITs.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the selection process, WORTH sought out funds that
consistently delivered above-average returns at reasonable risk. Of
course, risk tolerance varies from one investor to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors can tolerate wide swings in the value of their
principal as long as the income keeps flowing, while others give up
some yield for the assurance of stable principal.
</P>
<P>
   We found high-quality debt and equity funds at both extremes of
the risk/return spectrum, as well as those that fall somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   For the absolutely risk-averse, there is the money-market mutual
fund. Investing in the very shortest term borrowings of governments
and corporations, these funds usually yield much less than
longer-term bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the highest-yielding generally available money-market
fund is Strong Investors Money Fund (800-359-3379), managed by Jay
Meuller. It yielded 5.29 percent as of Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   To top the money-fund rankings, as it does regularly, Strong
charges a loss-leader 0.05 percent management fee. The firm can
raise the fee at any time, though it says it would do so only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Further out on both the risk and reward axes are
government-securities funds, which invest primarily or exclusively
in one- to ten-year securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and
various federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These securities carry little or no credit risk, but fluctuate
in price.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how volatile a fund might be, look at its
average duration. Although expressed in years, duration actually
measures how much the price of an investment must vary to produce a
one-percentage-point change in yield (remember, bond prices and
yields move in opposite directions).
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bond fund with a duration of five years must vary
in price by 5 percent for its yield to move up or down by one
percentage point. Generally speaking, the longer the duration, the
more volatile the security.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Government Obligations Fund (800-225-6265) charges a
4.75 percent load for its A shares but throws off a high yield _
7.36 percent as of Sept. 7 _ while keeping its duration to a slim
3.84 years, far less than lower-yielding funds that invest in
longer-term Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Susan Schiff concentrates the portfolio in the
obligations of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, two quasi-federal
agencies whose bonds yield more than Treasury bonds, as the
agencies are viewed as slightly more risky credits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can stomach more volatility should consider
high-yield corporate-bond funds. The managers of these funds spread
risk by mixing safer, higher-rated bonds with higher-yielding, more
speculative debt.
</P>
<P>
   With a payout of 10.72 percent as of Sept. 7, Scudder High Yield
Bond Fund (800-225-2470) is near the top of its category, and its
holdings have a below-average duration of 4.5 years.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping a portion of the portfolio in investment-grade bonds,
manager Kelly Babson maintains a fairly high average credit rating
of B.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should expect some fluctuation in the value of their
principal. The fund's standard deviation _ that is, its widest
likely variance from its average price _ is 7.66, compared with
7.87 for the average high-yield fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two funds that rely on equity for their income merit a mention.
Flaherty &AMP; Crumrine's Preferred Income Fund (626-795-7300), managed
by Peter Stimes, Robert Ettinger, Donald Crumrine, and Robert
Flaherty, invests in preferred stock _ shares whose dividend must
be paid before the issuer can pay a dividend on its common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred-share prices, like all share prices, will vary, but
they tend to follow the movements of bonds, not stocks. As of Sept.
7, Preferred Income yielded 7.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For good old-fashioned plump dividends, REITs are the investment
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   By law, these companies, which invest in or manage real-estate
properties ranging from apartment buildings to office complexes to
prisons, must pay out 95 percent of their income as dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-end Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Income Fund (800-330-7348),
managed by Martin Cohen, yielded 8.2 percent as of Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The downside: The value of REIT shares mirrors the health of the
real-estate market. Last year was a bad year for real estate and
REITs, whose composite price fell 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The picks in this story aren't right for every investor, but
they should convince skeptics that ``investing for income'' isn't a
contradiction in terms. &QL;

CONGRESS, ADMINISTRATION REACH AGREEMENT TO REVAMP SYSTEM OF ORGAN
DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS line in 11th graf about organs being donated nationally, 12th

conform; ADDS 4 grafs at end with background) 
(rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a last-minute plea by Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, members of Congress have
cleared the way for the Clinton administration to enact a
long-delayed regulation that will revamp the nation's system for
distributing donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal struck Wednesday night between Shalala and members
of the House and Senate who were ironing out details on health
spending, the regulation, first proposed in February 1998, will go
into effect 42 days after the spending bill is adopted. It should
be in place by late December or early January, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settles, at least for now, a bitter economic and
political feud over which patients should have priority in
receiving human organs, the nation's scarcest medical resource. The
United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit agency that
coordinates distribution of donated human organs, will now be
required to alter its policies so organs are shared broadly across
regional lines, with sickest patients being given first priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rule is an important one,'' said Dan Mendelson, associate
director for health at the Office of Management and Budget, who
took Shalala to Capitol Hill Wednesday night to press her case
before a conference panel of House and Senate appropriators, who
were considering a provision that would have delayed the rule at
least four more months. ``It's one where lives are truly at stake.
To see it come to fruition is really very exciting for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point, said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was that Shalala
agreed to give opponents of the plan a 21-day period for public
comment, and then take an additional 21 days to review those
comments. Until Wednesday, the administration had insisted that the
rule be put into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred a longer time,'' Young said, who had
earlier proposed a six-month delay, which he later reduced to four
months. ``My whole effort here was to guarantee an opportunity for
those who are professionals in the organ transplant field to be
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forcing broader sharing, the rule gives the
secretary of health and human services final authority over organ
allocation policy, a provision the network bitterly opposed.
Thursday however, a spokesman for the network said its board would
meet next week to figure out how to comply with the rule. ``We are
moving forward,'' said the spokesman, Bob Spieldenner.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Spieldenner and other opponents suggested that
the fight over who has final say over transplant policy might not
be settled. The National Organ Transplant Act, the 1984 law that
created the organ allocation system, expired several years ago, and
some members of Congress have indicated that they would use the
reauthorization process to try to strip Shalala of her authority.
Last week, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., introduced legislation that
would do just that; he was joined by more than two dozen
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental sticking point revolves around the secretary's
policy-making authority,'' said Martha Kendrick, a lobbyist for the
Patient Access to Transplant Coalition, a group of 31 small and
mid-sized transplant centers that are opposed to the new rule.
``That issue is ultimately not going to be resolved until Congress
finishes the reauthorization.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 62,000 Americans are now waiting for a heart, lung,
liver, kidney or pancreas, and last year alone, 4,000 people died
waiting. The dispute over who should receive donated organs is so
intense that when Shalala first proposed the overhaul last year,
some states responded by passing laws prohibiting organs from being
sent out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, patients are ranked according to the
severity of their sickness. The country is divided into 62 local
areas, which range in size from a few counties to entire states and
several states, and range in population from 1 million to 12
million. Those 62 areas are lumped into 11 regions. When an organ
becomes available, it is offered locally first. If a matching
patient is not found, it is then offered regionally and, in rare
cases nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala argued that the old system was not fair because waiting
times varied greatly from region to region. The mechanics of the
new system have yet to be worked out; by February, the organ
sharing network must propose a plan that meets Shalala's demand for
greater sharing. If not, the secretary can do so herself.
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately touched off a fight between large and small
transplant centers, with small centers insisting Shalala's rule
would put them out of business by steering organs to big-city
hospitals. So Congress stepped in, imposed a moratorium and ordered
the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, to investigate the organ sharing system.
</P>
<P>
   The institute looked only at livers, the scarcest organ. Its
report, issued in July, recommended widespread sharing, but not as
widespread as Shalala had initially proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it called for the country to be broken up into
regions of about nine million people each, with donated livers
going to the sickest patients in each region first. The authors
also urged that Shalala create an independent panel to advise her
on organ-sharing matters.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Shalala issued a revised rule that, Mendelson said,
took care to follow those recommendations. ``The new regulations
were dramatically different,'' he said. ``They responded to copious
comments, a year's worth of work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the rules now call for an advisory panel and that
they clarified a policy in the original rule that set ``medical
urgency'' as a criterion for which patients received organs first.
That requirement troubled some transplant specialists, who say
giving organs to patients in the most urgent need does not always
make sense because those patients may not be healthy enough to
survive their transplants, and then the organs are wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes, the new regulations have drawn opposition.
Spieldenner said the organ sharing network was dismayed that
Shalala retained sole control over who serves on the advisory
panel. And if the secretary does not approve of the network's new
organ sharing policy, she can issue one herself, a provision the
group also opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transplant community does not like to make radical
changes,'' Spieldenner he said. ``Every time we do something, it
affects patients. So we try to take smaller steps.''

DONALD G. OGILVIE: USERS MAY BE SHORTCHANGED IF BAN ON ATM FEES
STANDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note questions are for Donald G. Ogilvie, executive
vice president of the American Bankers Association. Questions may
be italicized).  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rising chorus of complaints about fees for using automated
teller machines, particularly those levied on withdrawals from
banks other than the customer's own, have inspired lawmakers to
intervene. At least two states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned
fees on such ``foreign'' transactions, which can result in two
charges, and several local governments have joined in or are poised
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday, as a ban approved in October by the Santa
Monica City Council in California was about to kick in, Bank of
America and Wells Fargo, which hold more than one-third of the
state's deposits, fought back. They said, in effect, if you won't
let us charge for the service, we won't provide it.
</P>
<P>
   People without accounts could not use 33 ATMs in Santa Monica
and the Bank of America warned it would do the same at 188 more in
San Francisco if a ban took effect there.
</P>
<P>
   Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American
Bankers Association, took time last week to discuss this issue,
which pits consumers seeking access to their money against bankers
who say that in a free market, they should be able to impose a
charge for convenience. Here are excerpts from the conversation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. How big a surcharge do people without accounts pay to make ATM
withdrawals? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. I think, on average among banks, it runs in the $1 to $1.50
range; you may be able to find some higher.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot of nonbanks that provide these machines _
it's something that almost nobody knows about. The third-largest
provider of ATM machines in the country is EDS, which is not a
bank. They put them all over the country and charge you to use
them. On balance, the bank fees are lower. And pressure on the EDSs
of the world to keep fees reasonable has just gone way down because
the ordinances apply only to depository institutions, meaning banks
can no longer compete with them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. A charge of $1.50 is fairly trivial. Why try to collect it when
it makes people so angry? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. It gets back to the old idea that no business should be
expected to provide free services to noncustomers. It's bizarre to
me that people think banks should do that. It's like saying that a
Burger King patron should be able to get a free Big Mac at
McDonald's or that a company shouldn't be able to charge more for a
Coke from a vending machine than at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we buy Cokes at vending machines is they happen to be
there, cold, when we want them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. Do you think consumers are irrational in seeking, after all, to
get their own money back, not buy a product? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. I think that's a lot of it, but what most people don't
understand is that the money that is theirs is being held and
managed in a bank that they're not a customer of and almost without
exception all their banks provide free service to their own
customers. If you're a customer of Bank of America you can use any
Bank of America ATM anywhere in the world for free, which is quite
extraordinary. When I was growing up the only way to get cash was
to go to your bank during the hours of 9 to 3. Now I can get it in
Paris or New York anytime. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Q. Banks seemed to do fine before 1996, when foreign surcharges
were first authorized. Are the costs all that high? &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A. Sure. The networks that have been set up since these
convenience fees have been in place have doubled the number of
ATMs. What that says to us is that customers want convenience, and
that they're willing to pay those extra charges that enable banks
to provide machines in places that unless noncustomers could use
them would not justify having a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody makes them use the machine, and it says in clear English
that there is a fee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there something you'd like Congress to do, perhaps setting
a reasonable national standard so banks won't have to deal with a
patchwork of law in different jurisdictions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, nothing. There's already legislation that makes these
municipal laws illegal. The comptroller of the currency, which
regulates national banks, has the authority and we believe will
intervene to overturn these ordinances violating the National Bank
Act. Efforts two or three years ago in Congress to bar these fees
did not get any traction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the courts decide to let the bans go ahead and the banks
restrict their ATMs, the consequence, which consumer groups have
not thought through, is that rather than get more convenience, more
choice and lower prices, they'll get less choice and higher prices
because there will be no competition for nonregulated providers.

DON I. TRACHTENBERG: BORN TO THINK TWICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DON I. TRACHTENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Money was always a struggle for my family. We had limited means
and lived in a community thought to be affluent, which only added
to my feeling of being economically deprived while growing up on
the western edge of Philadelphia at the end of the Depression and
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that my parents owned their tiny home and had a
station wagon _ and that we never wanted for food and other
necessities. My perceptions about money were skewed at an early
age; my genes were encoded with chronic poverty syndrome; DNA meant
``dollars not arriving.''
</P>
<P>
   My outlook has never quite changed, and despite a measure of
success, it has been my emotional fate to view everything I own as
belonging to me only by accident.
</P>
<P>
   My first financial awareness came at age 7, when my mother
explained bluntly to me what a mortgage was. I woke up that night
in a panic over the possibility _ maybe the probability _ that my
parents would not be able to keep up the mortgage payments on our
$4,500 row house. It was an episode that would be repeated many
times later in life, every time a mortgage question arose.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, and much to my wife's consternation, what she had
assumed would be our starter house has remained our primary home
for 30 years. I feared that I could not survive more than one
mortgage experience in a lifetime. Though I did buy a second home,
at the shore, it was only possible because I knew that failing to
make its mortgage payments wouldn't put us out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I saw financial institutions as holy places. Each
week, my classmates and I dutifully deposited our nickels into
school savings accounts. Somehow, the bank convinced us that once
we deposited our money, it was sacrosanct, never to be touched. It
acquired a soul of its own and would barrel along at 1.75 percent
interest a year.
</P>
<P>
   But that was all it did, because the virtue and goal had become
simply putting the money in. Fifty-plus years later, it still
disturbs me to take money out of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The need to plan for retirement has forced me to invest in
stocks, which, as you might expect, has been a big step for me.
Although I have found advisers who have proved to be good and
trustworthy, deep down I am convinced that they are far crazier
than I am.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic problem is that they think they know what they're
doing. I, on the other hand, using my well-developed economic
sense, decided amid the Asian economic crisis, the financial
troubles in Brazil and the House impeachment inquiry that it would
be a clever strategy to withdraw from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I listened to my gurus and stayed in. With perverse
logic, on the same day that the House of Representatives voted two
impeachment charges against President Clinton and the United States
was bombing Iraq, the market rose. Fortified with a renewed
understanding that my advisers have better Ouija boards than I do,
I continue to listen to them, albeit with spasms that exceed any
volatility in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But shouldn't my discomfort with the vagaries of stocks drive me
to invest more heavily in the relative safety of the bond market?
In fact, however, I can make little sense of bonds. When stocks go
up, bonds go down _ sometimes. When the economy is good, bonds are
bad _ sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   All I really understand about bonds is that as long as the
companies that issue them remain solvent, they will pay me the full
interest due. Further, if I retain the bonds to maturity, I will
also be sure to recapture the original investment. Therefore,
applying the lessons of the school savings account, I buy bonds
only with the idea of holding on.
</P>
<P>
   So here I am, an adult, investing in the market and possessing,
or possessed by, a financial planner, a market analyst and an
investment group. Life has certainly changed for me on the outside,
but not far below the surface I'm still the little kid who wakes up
in the middle of the night, in a panic over the mortgage we haven't
had for years. &QL;

THE BIG D NOW MEANS DETERIORATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys will forever remember this month as the one
in which their slow decline into mediocrity began gathering steam,
and now resembles a boulder rolling down a mountain slope. This
proud organization is in trouble. Worse. The Cowboys, as we know
them, are dead.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty is done and the signs of the demise are overt ones
in the form of the Cowboys' stars hobbling around, looking woozy,
old and vulnerable. This is not the Dallas team that throughout the
1990s terrified opponents, infuriated them, outsmarted them,
outclassed them and outspent them. Instead, in an almost startling
turnaround, other teams are beginning to feel sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to watch those guys go through all of those
injuries,'' Cris Carter, the Minnesota Vikings wide receiver, said
this week. ``It's sad in a way and you feel bad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter feels bad for the Cowboys. They used to spread fear, but
now they inspire pity parties.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the heart of the team, its triplets, are
ailing. After Dallas lost to Minnesota, 27-17, on Monday night, the
trio of Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman, winners of
four Super Bowls each, looked befuddled. Irvin is contemplating
retirement because of a congenital spinal condition that could
cause paralysis, Aikman suffered his sixth concussion in the
National Football League after his head slammed the turf while he
was trying to escape Vikings lineman Jerry Ball, and Smith broke a
bone in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is home against Green Bay this Sunday and for the first
time since the three future Hall of Famers were brought together in
1990, all of them will miss a game simultaneously. Aikman is the
latest scare. In Indianapolis on Oct. 31, he suffered a
helmet-to-helmet hit with Jeff Burris, causing him to have a series
of intense headaches. Only eight days later, in the second quarter
against Minnesota, Aikman's less serious contact with Ball caused
his latest concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman spent late Monday night and Tuesday undergoing tests that
included an MRI scan of his brain. He said he would not play this
week, but had no plans to retire. ``It's not something I'm thinking
about or even weighing as an option right now,'' he said of
retirement on Wednesday. ``I feel that in time I'll be fine and be
able to resume playing. I anticipate that will happen very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smith ripped two outstanding touchdown runs against
Minnesota, only to break his hand. He had a plate and screws
inserted into the hand on Tuesday, and is expected to be out two to
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cowboys have lost the soul of their team in those three
stars, one of them maybe forever in Irvin, a great talent and a
proven winner.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has been able to get consistent production for years from
three of the best players the league has seen. But the toll of
thousands of hits is showing on the bodies of Aikman, who turns 33
a week from Sunday; Irvin, who will be 34 in March; and Smith, the
youngster at 30, which is old in the NFL, especially for a running
back.
</P>
<P>
   Age and wear-and-tear are even showing on cornerback Deion
Sanders, Dallas' fourth future Hall of Famer and the team's best
athlete. Sanders, 32, has missed all or part of nine games over the
last two seasons with various injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stay in this league a long time, you get hit a lot,''
Dallas Coach Chan Gailey said. ``As age gets us all, we don't heal
as fast. I don't care who we are or what we do. That's true for
football players the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, has done the smart thing by
getting every ounce of effort and production from his stars, but
has made some tactical blunders along the way. He hasn't prepared
for the end of their careers by drafting and grooming their heirs.
Who is Aikman's replacement? Who is Smith's understudy? Where is
the young stud who can replace Irvin?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Dallas has also been ravaged by the losses to
free agency that hit every team at the top. Even as the Cowboys
developed superior talent, they lost some of it _ superb players
like Ken Norton Jr. and Alvin Harper _ because they could not keep
them aboard and stay under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Cowboys could still remain in the playoff mix.
If Aikman does come back in one or two weeks, if Smith returns
sooner rather than later and if, by some miracle, Irvin plays again
this year, Dallas could make a final push.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is clear that the era of Cowboy domination is gone.
Any dream of the triplets' hobbling onto the field this year, or
any year, and winning another Super Bowl is just that _ a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has overcome a number of obstacles, like drug arrests and
suspensions that rocked the franchise, free-agent losses and
injuries. There is something Cowboys players cannot conquer: the
way creaky bones become more brittle with each hit. Football
players do not age gracefully, they just wake up and notice the
other guy is faster or stronger.
</P>
<P>
   At some point soon, Aikman, Irvin and Smith will realize the run
is over. They may already have.

AT HEAVEN'S GATE, IN SILICON VALLEY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ I don't want to gloat, but I have pretty
good news for close friends, family and anyone else to whom I may
owe money. I will be a billionaire within the hour.
</P>
<P>
   I am about to enter the inner sanctum of Silicon Valley _ a
venture capitalist's office, where I will pitch my idea for an
utterly revolutionary Internet business, albeit one that I hashed
out in just a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a seat. Mr. Draper will be right with you,'' a
receptionist says calmly, seemingly unaware how drastically life
may soon change for me and my creditors. ``Have some Smarties while
you wait.''
</P>
<P>
   My audience is with Timothy C. Draper, managing director of
Draper Fisher Jurvetson. He and his partners have the power to
finance start-ups with millions of dollars in seed capital and
priceless clout _ effectively, to propel me down the road to
riches.
</P>
<P>
   Sucking on the proffered candy, I reflect that I am among a
lucky few who have the opportunity to wait in this foyer, hoping to
shed the banal trappings of daily life for really, really expensive
trappings. Draper Fisher receives 10,000 business plans a year but
has initial meetings with only 500. (Ultimately, it finances about
15 companies.)
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, I was accepted into the inner circle only because I
said I was writing an article about the experience. I started
thinking, however, that if Draper actually bought my pitch, my
article-writing days could be over.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the big picture, my emotions are mixed. On
one hand, there are worse things than becoming a billionaire.
(Becoming a millionaire, for example.) On the other, I am skeptical
about the entrepreneurial frenzy that makes this place so holy.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a guy can't order a smoothie without overhearing a
pitch for some venture that will use the Net, for example, to
deconstruct the business of selling pet shampoo. But do we really
want to live in a culture where we are so afraid of having our
ideas stolen that conversations start, ``I'm doing fine, Mom, but
before I say more, can you please sign this nondisclosure
agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Those who suffer from the entrepreneurial bug ``can't help it,''
Paul Saffo, a veteran Silicon Valley consultant, explained to me.
``It's like malaria. Once you have it, you can't get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As I wait, I realize that I haven't taken any precautions
against contracting the illness, like getting shots or reading
about the market crash of 1929. But before I can muse further, the
receptionist is ushering me back into a conference room and seating
me across the table from Draper. A smiling man with wayward hair,
he has returned his investors a billion dollars in profit from
ventures that started as pitches in these same offices.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's my turn. My business plan, I tell him, is for a Web
site called ``I told you so.net.'' It would bring together two
markets: people seeking answers to basic life questions (What
should I have for dinner? Where should I buy pet shampoo? Should I
break into the Watergate?) and people who like to tell other people
what to do. (Italian food. On the Web. Try going to the movies
instead.)
</P>
<P>
   For users, asking a question would be free. It would cost $1 to
propose an answer, thus creating a pot of money. The person whose
answer is chosen by the questioner would get 70 percent of the pot,
the questioner 20 percent and the Web site 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it, I explain, as a ``decision-making portal.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper hits me with a handful of basic questions, like whether
there are any barriers to the entry of competing sites. ``It's
interesting,'' he concludes abruptly, sounding like someone
politely turning down a date to the prom. He has Marcus Welby's
bedside manner, but my fate is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is learning to be done at this mecca, even if I'm
to be denied redemption. Draper explains: What he's looking for is
not necessarily the best business plan, but an obsessively inspired
entrepreneur. What turns him off immediately is someone whose
motivation is to get rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for someone who says, `This is what the world
should look like, and I'm not going to stop until the rest of the
world has this view, too,''' he said. There are unprecedented
opportunities these days for visionaries, he explains, though it is
not a bad time, either, to get plain old rich. ``You could probably
make money selling chocolate-covered ants on the Web,'' Draper
says.
</P>
<P>
   As he imparts these nuggets, I realize that my skepticism is
melting into unrestrained optimism. Am I contracting the Silicon
Valley flu? Perhaps, I think a bit feverishly, I'll be back here
again, ascending the mountain with a world-changing idea, one that,
purely incidentally, would make me a billion bucks. Getting rich, I
assure you, is the farthest thing from my mind.

   While the U.S. economy has been booming, averaging growth of a
little over 3 percent annually since 1991, our friends in the
United Kingdom have been doing nearly as well: Their economy has
grown an average of 2.8 percent a year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes and home values have risen, unemployment is low (4.2
percent), and inflation is weak (1.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found
that optimism among manufacturers is at a two-year high. By the
start of autumn, the pound sterling had climbed 7 percent against
major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even British culture is hot again: Reservations for good London
restaurants are now hard to get (they were hard to get five years
ago, too, but that's because there weren't any good restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in ``Cool Britannia'' is up. And Prince William _ ``His
Royal Hunk'' on Web sites _ is suddenly a teen heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Prime Minister Tony Blair want to fix what ain't
broken and ditch the pound for the floundering euro? Certainly not
for the sake of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Federation of Small Businesses,
nearly 60 percent of small British firms oppose monetary union. To
them it sounds like taxation without representation (I can just see
it: Londoners staging their own Boston Tea Party by pouring French
wine into the Thames).
</P>
<P>
   At a private dinner with former prime minister Margaret
Thatcher, I was struck by her ruthless comments: ``We British and
you Americans believe in equity and fairness _ traits not shared in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   She then reminded us, ``We saved Europe, defeated half _ with
America _ and rescued the other half. We won't get absorbed into
Europe now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher may be more of a national monument than a viable
political power these days, but her views reflect more than the
Tory right wing.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers routinely report the latest efforts from
Brussels to ``harmonize'' regulations and create industry standards
for almost every product. Many such edicts lend themselves to
mockery, including an alleged ban on curved bananas, restrictions
on transporting scotch whisky, and design requirements for coffins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most publicized ``standardization'' has involved
establishing uniform characteristics for the ``euro-condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair is drawn toward the continent for two main reasons.
Philosophically, he believes in a ``greater'' Europe. In this view,
the U.K. is more vulnerable in isolation than as part of European
Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.K. currently enjoys robust growth and low inflation,
those good times might not last; capital could flee across the
English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In a practical sense, Blair knows that large British businesses
like British Airways tend to support monetary union. Big
multinationals like General Motors and Toyota have made it known
they could be forced to cut back on their U.K.-based investments if
the U.K. stays outside EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal popularity and the near collapse of the
opposition Conservative Party, Blair faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether big business gets its way and triumphs over the little
firm will depend on how well EMU works for the continent. Blair has
pledged to hold a referendum before committing to the euro, and
that's not likely to happen before he could be reelected, probably
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Tory government shrewdly negotiated the possibility
of joining EMU after its 1999 launch, the U.K. can now stand back
and watch EMU sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, Blair and his followers can start preparing to
cross the chilly waters of the English Channel by donning their
euro-standardized swimsuits. But don't bet on it. &QL;

CITY UNIONS SHIFT STRATEGY ON BARGAINING 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unhappy with their current contracts, leaders of New
York City's municipal unions said Thursday that they would use new
bargaining tactics that they hoped would help them overcome the
Giuliani administration's past success in holding down wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The unions hope to negotiate their contracts one by one,
starting with the teachers and the police officers, two powerful
unions that are expected to make the strongest cases for large pay
increases. The strategy would break a practice known as pattern
bargaining, under which each of the city's municipal unions have
for the last quarter century agreed to accept the same annual wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the new approach _ developed by the Municipal Labor
Committee, a coalition of 75 unions representing nearly 300,000
city workers _ would improve the bargaining position of both large
and small unions. The teachers and the police would be able to
argue that big wage increases were needed to stem a debilitating
flight of their members to the suburbs, while the weaker unions
would try to piggyback on the stronger unions' success.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the city often maneuvered to begin talks with a
weak union or a political ally in the hope of granting only a low
wage increase that then set the pattern for all other unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with pattern bargaining,'' said Norman Seabrook,
president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, ``is
if the city grabs one union leader and that leader folds under
pressure, it can possibly ruin it for hundreds of thousands of
hard-working union people in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   City Hall officials said Thursday that they would reject the
union's new approach, insisting that the traditional practice of
pattern bargaining was fairest for the city and its unions.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine, who is the Mayor's chief labor
negotiator, asserted that a piecemeal approach could make it
extremely difficult for the city to reach agreements with every
union and could enrage unions that end up with smaller pay
increases than their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to engage in pattern bargaining _ that's the only
way that makes sense,'' Levine said. ``It's more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The municipal unions are calling their new approach
``coordinated bargaining.'' Under this strategy, while unions
negotiate individually, they would keep in close touch with other
union leaders, who would advise them on what is an acceptable wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coordinated approach is different from everybody going it
alone and it's different from coalition bargaining,'' said Randi
Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and
chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee. ``The city's unions
need to represent their members in different ways. Their members
have different needs. The teachers have competitiveness issues with
the suburbs. The police have competitiveness issues with the
suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of all 75 municipal unions are scheduled to hold
a conference in Princeton, N.J., this weekend to flesh out the
negotiating strategy and sketch out specific demands. One proposal
on the agenda is levying a special assessment on union members to
finance an advertising campaign that would seek to line up public
support for the municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, 20 municipal union leaders have signed what
they are calling a compact in which they pledge that when
negotiating individually, they will not accept certain
unsatisfactory terms. Probably the most important pledge in the
compact is to accept only contracts that contain a substantial
increase in base pay, which would not be linked to any increase in
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have suffered long enough, and their sacrifices
helped create the city's budget surplus,'' said Lee Saunders, chief
administrator of District Council 37 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents 125,000
city workers. ``The city is flush with money right now. What we're
trying to do is get a fair piece of the economic pot. And we want
to do that without having to tie an increase in base pay to
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE
</P>
<P>
   But Levine said the mayor would demand, as he has in the past,
that any wage increases be accompanied by union pledges to increase
productivity. ``The mayor,'' Levine said, ``has said over and over
again that our position going into these negotiations is raises
will be funded by labor productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions embraced the new strategy after many members felt
widespread disgust with the last round of contract negotiations,
which were led by Stanley Hill, a close ally of the mayor who was
executive director of District Council 37.
</P>
<P>
   Other unions criticized Hill for not only accepting a contract
that contained an unpopular two-year wage freeze but also for not
having stopped widespread vote-rigging, which clinched the
ratification of the unpopular contract and set a pattern for other
unions. Hill, who was ousted by his parent union, has denied
participation in or knowledge of the vote fraud, to which two of
his top aides have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The current five-year contract, which expires next year for most
city workers, contains an initial two-year wage freeze and a 13
percent raise over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New York, most American cities do not engage in pattern
bargaining. Normally the teachers negotiate one contract, another
is negotiated by the uniformed unions, including the police and
firefighters, and the union representing nonuniformed workers, like
social workers, negotiates still another. While the unions might
look to what the others get, the raises in their contracts are not
in lock step with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the lack of pattern bargaining has not
created major union frictions or political problems because unions
there do not expect carbon-copy wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weingarten said the new approach was intended to make sure
that city hall did not dictate how bargaining was conducted. It
also aims, she said, to accommodate weaker unions while giving
flexibility to larger unions that have fallen behind their suburban
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' she said, ``lock step rigidity has hurt
recruitment and retention not just with teachers, but with police
and librarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Several union leaders said they would not be surprised if the
new strategy were to turn into pattern bargaining, especially if
the first union to secure a contract obtained a hefty wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   One question that leaders of several smaller unions had was what
would happen if the city awarded the police a 16 percent raise over
four years to help them catch up with salaries for officers in the
suburbs while insisting on only an 8 percent increase over four
years for weaker, smaller unions.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Cheliotes, president of a Communications Workers Local
1180, which represents city middle managers, said, ``Then we'd say,
`You've established a pattern. You always said you wanted pattern
bargaining, so why are you now wanting to break pattern
bargaining?' We'd say, `If you don't match it, let's take it to
arbitration.' Historically, arbitrators have usually followed what
other unions obtained.''
</P>
<P>
   But, several unions leaders acknowledged, if the first union to
negotiate received a small wage increase, other city unions would
reject pattern bargaining.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The autumn has brought a wonderfully rich harvest of affordable
and accessible paperback books for fans of business history, a
genre whose volumes usually cost a bundle and weigh a ton.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, one of the new paperbacks _ ``Titan: The Life of
John D. Rockefeller Sr.,'' by Ron Chernow (Vintage Books, $16) _ is
still pretty hefty, even without a hard cover. But it is a rich and
enlightening tale, especially with the future of Microsoft in the
air. And its length only looks daunting: the story of Rockefeller,
the man who built the Standard Oil monopoly, races along with all
the ease and grace of a well-constructed novel.
</P>
<P>
   Graceful storytelling is also abundantly on display in two
additions to the splendid Wiley Investment Classics series from
John Wiley &AMP; Sons _ ``Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street
1920-1938'' ($19.95) and ``The Go-Go Years: The Drama and Crashing
Finale of Wall Street's Bullish 60's'' ($19.95). Both are by John
Brooks, a financial journalist and novelist who produced a small
shelf of delightful books before a stroke brought on his death in
1993 at the age of 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in Golconda'' opens with an explanation of its title:
``Golconda, now a ruin, was a city in southeastern India where,
according to legend, everyone who passed through got rich. A
similar legend attached to Wall Street between the wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a similar legend has attached to Wall Street today,
an excellent reason to absorb the gently told lessons drawn from
the frenzied prelude and agonized aftermath of the 1929 crash.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens on Sept. 16, 1920, when a bomb exploded in front
of the Manhattan offices of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., then ground zero in
the nation's financial landscape. The story closes in 1938 with
Richard Whitney, once the unassailable president of the New York
Stock Exchange, installed in a prison cell. It is a remarkable span
of time, well worth recalling amid today's stock market party.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Go-Go Years,'' Brooks sketches the psychedelic 1960s on
Wall Street. Colorful crooks, celebrity fund managers, corrupt
stock exchange officials and audacious corporate raiders added to
the surreal atmosphere as stock promoters extolled an atomic-fueled
future while back-office clerks labored in Dickensian conditions
against a rising tide of unprocessed paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, with shrewd foresight, notices by the end of his tale
that technology is wiping out the traditions of the Street.
``Already in the early 1970s,'' he writes, ``a significant
proportion of stock trading is being conducted not face-to-face on
a floor under a skylight but between men sitting in front of
closed-circuit television screens in offices hundreds or thousands
of miles apart.''
</P>
<P>
   We must forgive him for failing to see that those television
screens, soon to be replaced by computer monitors, were simply the
latest manifestation of the stock ticker that had transformed
trading nearly a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1867 when E.A. Callahan harnessed the new technology of
the telegraph to produce the first stock ticker. Improvements to
Callahan's model by Thomas Edison yielded the financial windfall
that paid for the workshop where he invented the phonograph and the
electric light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of the nuggets tucked between the slim covers
of ``The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph
and the 19th Century's Online Pioneers,'' by Tom Standage, a
science writer at The Economist in London. Now available in
paperback from the Berkley Publishing Group ($12), ``The Victorian
Internet'' puts a cool hand on the feverish face of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Standage writes: ``In the 19th century there were no
televisions, airplanes, computers, or spacecraft; nor were there
antibiotics, credit cards, microwave ovens, compact discs or mobile
phones. There was, however, an Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The telegraph, he writes, ``revolutionized business practice,
gave rise to new forms of crime and inundated its users with a
deluge of information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Romances blossomed over the wires,'' he adds. ``Secret codes
were devised by some users and cracked by others. The benefits of
the network were relentlessly hyped by its advocates and dismissed
by the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Governments and regulators tried and failed to control the new
medium. Attitudes toward everything from news gathering to
diplomacy had to be completely rethought. Meanwhile, out on the
wires, a technological subculture with its own customs and
vocabulary was establishing itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Standage asks: ``Does all this sound familiar?''
</P>
<P>
   One emerges from this delightful book both humbled and
heartened. The Victorians traveled, in a few short years, from a
world in which it took 10 weeks to communicate between London and
Bombay to a world in which it took 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the adjustments that the Internet requires of us
_ a generation born with a telephone in our hands, with children
who can scarcely remember the purpose of a postage stamp _ seem
almost comically trivial.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, all the grim predictions about the
telegraph's catastrophic effects did not come to pass, and perhaps
the same will be true this time as well. In any case, ``The
Victorian Internet'' provides a much-needed perspective on how new
technologies shape human society.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tripping exultantly through the restored Beaux-Arts
jewel of a City Hall, City Councilman Jack Evans took measure
Thursday of this local government's nearly stepping back toward its
sorry past as a political plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came so close,'' he exclaimed, bursting into one of the
baronial offices where early this century three federal overseers
ruled the city so autocratically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think of the desperation of our city to literally sell
its City Hall to stay afloat,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Savoring the unoccupied building, he pondered how, in municipal
hard times only four years ago, the City Council was unable to
repair its worn-out, seedy relic of a once glorious City Hall. So
the city moved out and reluctantly cut a deal to turn over most of
the space to the ever ravenous federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the federal government got its foothold, the city would
have been gone for good from its rightful place on Pennsylvania
Avenue,'' Evans declared in celebrating the news that after a
special plea to President Clinton, the city government had been
spared at the last minute from losing its 91-year-old showcase
three blocks west of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reversed Wednesday, only weeks before the
Environmental Protection Agency was to move into more than
two-thirds of the six-story building.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolically, the transfer would have been a galling one for the
city and its long-suffering cause of home rule. It was in this
building, Evans noted, that the city's first home-rule mayor,
Walter Washington, a black, ended Jim Crow vestiges 25 years ago
and invited African-Americans to upper floors long denied them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wept here in finally coming up,'' Evans said as he
confronted a new architectural barrier and denounced it as no less
repellent. It is a glass staircase wall freshly built to seal off
some token municipal space remaining on part of the ground floor
from the new federal warrens that were ready to roost above. The
thick glass barrier across the marble staircase implicitly declares
that ``thou shalt not pass'' to a city government that long chafed
at its role as a federal foundling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have a sledgehammer ceremony,'' enthused Evans, a
lean, long-legged man shaking his fist at the glass wall. ``Show
the mayor smashing down the glass wall,'' he said of Mayor Anthony
Williams, whose election last November galvanized a reversal from
fiscal despair to a state of budget surplus that has now made local
reclamation of City Hall possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe Plotkin _ yeah, Plotkin with a sledgehammer!'' Evans
continued in a Joycean riff that echoed through the handsomely
refurbished building. He referred to Mark Plotkin, this city's
unelected scourge and public broadcast booster, who first enlisted
Evans in the cause to never, ever surrender City Hall to the feds.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Plotkin, never at a loss for words and causes,
was generous in naming the officials who deserved special credit
for the turnabout. He began with Clinton, whom he had been
castigating for months as ``a stranger in our midst.'' The
president had walked the city's streets only once in seven years,
Plotkin regularly noted in arguing that Clinton's famous search for
legacy could do worse than to spare City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, finally speak about democracy and human rights and
apply these words to D.C.,'' Plotkin rather brazenly begged the
president in one of the broadcast essays heard earlier this year
amid the morning news that federal movers and shakers wake up to.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council approved the surrender of the building in 1995
as the only deal possible considering that dilapidation had
rendered the place unusable and that the city was too broke to save
it. ``The District is disgraced,'' Plotkin cried out back then.
``Call off the fire sale of our building and our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an intricate agreement, the federal government paid $52
million in renovation costs for a 20-year lease on most of the
building, which, in honor of a former member of the City Council,
is formally known as the John A. Wilson Building. But because of
the city's newfound surplus, the local government will instead
lease it back, at an estimated cost of about $8 million a year,
under a deal still to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Following the City Council's lead, the District's elected
delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, secured the deal with
EPA Administrator Carol Browner and Bob Peck, a former city
landmarks official who is commissioner of public buildings for the
federal General Services Administration. The EPA will search
elsewhere for space while the city government begins its victorious
return to City Hall from the Judiciary Square neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   For this, the hall's grand double staircase from Pennsylvania
Avenue will be reopened for the first time in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor gets one of these three big offices,'' Evans said,
standing in one of the prime corner spaces where the three
appointed federal administrators used to rule the city. The renewal
architect, Shalom Baranes, carefully restored the suite from
fireplace to oak paneling and cinnamon-colored walls. ``And the
City Council chairman gets the second one,'' the councilman said of
Linda Cropp, who helped lead the return.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the third? I don't know,'' said Evans, bounding down a
freshly polished marble corridor. ``I guess the haggling is about
to begin over who gets that one,'' he said. ``We should be
visionary about this,'' he insisted, but he was obviously delighted
that the District's politicians would once more be free to haggle
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, let's give it to Plotkin!'' Evans suddenly shouted,
grinning in the restored gleam of City Hall.

FELIX GALIMIR, 89, A VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT GENERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Felix Galimir, a violinist who was one of the last
links to the vital musical world of prewar Vienna, and a chamber
music player who was revered by several generations of
instrumentalists as a demanding and inspiring coach, died on
Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89 and had continued to
teach and advise young musicians until his health began to fail in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to overstate Galimir's centrality in
American chamber music life, but perhaps the best measure of his
influence is that at virtually any chamber concert today, at least
one musician on the stage is likely to have studied with, been
coached by or performed in an ensemble with him. He was, with the
pianist Rudolf Serkin, a guiding spirit at the Marlboro Festival in
Vermont, where for 50 years young musicians and experienced
colleagues have spent summers exploring the chamber literature.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work at Marlboro, a typical concert season
for Galimir included teaching commitments at Juilliard School and
the Mannes College of Music, both in New York, and the Curtis
Institute in Philadelphia _ he was on the faculty of all three _ as
well as at the New York String Orchestra seminar, a program for
young musicians. He was also a coach at the chamber workshops that
Isaac Stern conducts periodically at Carnegie Hall. He performed as
a member of New York Philomusica and appeared regularly with
Musicians From Marlboro, the touring ensembles that keep the
festival's name and work alive between summer sessions.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Galimir was such a compelling and authoritative
teacher is that in addition to his long experience as a quartet
player _ he formed the Galimir String Quartet when he was still a
teenager, in 1929, and kept it going with younger musicians until
1993 _ he knew and worked with many of this century's great
composers. The circle in which Galimir traveled early in his career
included the composers Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg and Anton
Webern _ the founders of Serialism _ as well as Ernst Krenek,
Alexander von Zemlinksy and other members of Schoenberg's Society
for Contemporary Music.
</P>
<P>
   Berg coached the Galimir Quartet in his Lyric Suite in 1931 and
inscribed the score of the 20-year old violinist, ``To Felix
Galimir, outstanding quartet leader, excellent violinist, splendid
musician, in remembrance.'' In 1936, when the Galimir Quartet
recorded the Lyric Suite and Ravel's String Quartet, both composers
were on hand to oversee the ensemble's rehearsals and recording
sessions. The recordings were awarded the Grand Prix du Disques.
</P>
<P>
   For his entire life, Galimir was an eloquent and passionate
champion of the composers he knew in his youth, and in discussing
Schoenberg, Berg and Webern, he always emphasized the soulfulness
he found in their works, rather than the austerity that many
listeners hear in the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berg asked for enormous correctness in the performance of his
music,'' Galimir told The New York Times in 1981. ``But the moment
this was achieved, he asked for a very Romanticized treatment.
Webern, you know, was also terribly Romantic _ as a person and when
he conducted. Everything was almost oversentimentalized. It was
entirely different from what we have been led to believe today. His
music should be played very freely, very emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher, he sought to instill a love for new music in
students, and he spoke wistfully of a time when that did not
require such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a student, it was understood that young people
played new music,'' he said in the 1981 interview. ``Now,
unfortunately, this is no longer so. I have difficulty asking my
students to play even the Bartok violin and piano sonatas. The
students want the best sellers. I would like to see that any young
group that plays Beethoven quartets plays something new also.
Somebody who is at the end of his life and plays only Beethoven and
Brahms, that's a different story. But a youngster, he should try
everything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Galimir was born in Vienna on May 12, 1910, and said in
interviews that he felt like an outsider from an early age.
Although his mother was an Austrian, his father was from Romania
and was considered an enemy alien during World War I. The fact that
the Galimirs were Sephardic Jews and spoke Ladino, a hybrid of
medieval Spanish and Hebrew, raised similar suspicions because it
sounded vaguely like Italian, and Austria and Italy were at war.
``I had to learn German very quickly,'' Galimir said later.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned the violin quickly. At 12, he entered the New
Vienna Conservatory, where he studied the violin with Adolf Bak and
chamber music with Simon Pullman. In the early 1930's, he continued
his studies with Carl Flesch. But by then he had already made his
public debut as a soloist in the Beethoven Violin Concerto and
formed the Galimir String Quartet, in which his sisters were the
other players.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Galimir was hired by the Vienna Philharmonic. In
``Felix Galimir in Conversation,'' a film by Ken Kobland that was
produced for the Bard Festival this year, he remembered himself as
an inexperienced musician at the time. ``I had never heard a Brahms
symphony until I played one,'' he said. It was also an increasingly
uncomfortable time for him as a young Jewish musician in a society
where anti-Semitism was increasingly open. In the film, Galimir
spoke about one performance at which, just as the lights went down,
the principal clarinetist called out, in a voice audible throughout
the theater, ``Galimir _ have you eaten your matzos today?''
</P>
<P>
   The following season he was barred from playing in a performance
at a resort outside Vienna, and then dismissed from the orchestra.
By then, his father and his older sister had left for Paris and
were urging him to follow. Instead, he and two of his sisters
accepted the invitation of Bronislaw Huberman to come to Palestine,
where Huberman was starting the orchestra that became the Israel
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Galimir emigrated to New York. He immediately played a
recital at Town Hall, formed a new version of the Galimir String
Quartet and had some freelance performing jobs at WQXR, the radio
station owned by The New York Times. He also played for several
years with Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s, though, Galimir had become increasingly
involved in chamber music, both with his own quartet, with the New
York Philomusica ensemble and at Marlboro, to which he was invited
by Serkin in 1952 after the death of one of the festival's
founders, the violinist Adolf Busch. And after 1954, when he joined
the faculty of the City College of New York, he devoted himself
increasingly to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   His affiliation with the Juilliard School began in 1962, and he
was appointed head of the chamber music department at the Curtis
Institute in 1972. In 1976 he began teaching at the Mannes College
of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Galimir was a short, genial man who held strong opinions and
delivered them in a Viennese accent that underscored both their
vehemence and the current of humor that sometimes ran through them.
Expressing his distrust of politics mixed into music, for example,
he remarked in ``Felix Galimir in Conversation'' that he had heard
the Shostakovich 11th Symphony a couple of days before the
interview. ``It was a disgrace,'' he said. ``Such noise. Stalin
decides who writes good music. Who was Stalin?''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said music was both his profession and his hobby, he
also enjoyed watching football, and he had a large collection of
clocks. His wife, Suzanne, died last year; there are no immediate
survivors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco _ King Mohammed VI succeeded to the throne in
July when his father, Hassan II, died after reigning for 38 years.
As crown prince, Mohammed had been dismissed by some as a bachelor
playboy.
</P>
<P>
   But in only three months, the 36-year-old king has emerged as a
powerful advocate of social change in a region that is witnessing a
generational shift in monarchies from Morocco to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Already popular among this country's 30 million people, Mohammed
VI, close-cropped and unshaven, looks more like a movie star than a
monarch. On a recent 10-day tour through the country's north,
hundreds of thousands lined the streets to cheer him. Schools
closed, ancient markets shut down and entire families trooped to
the roadsides to see the young king, who arrived wearing a white
suit and a black tie, standing up in a white Cadillac stretch
limousine with a sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here in the capital and ordinary people encountered in
cities and desert outposts from Marrakesh to Fez say the king has
quickly begun shaking up entrenched bureaucratic habits and ways of
doing things in his strategically situated country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept two lists while he was watching his father,'' one
diplomat said of the new king. ``There are some things he wants to
do the same way as his father, but there are clearly other things
he intends to do very differently.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, the king dismissed his father's longtime minister of
the interior, Driss Basri, in a move diplomats and officials saw as
signaling further change in political direction. Many people in
Morocco and abroad considered Basri the power behind the throne
when Hassan II was king.
</P>
<P>
   The king himself keeps saying that he wants to promote ``a new
concept of authority.'' He has done this with early, popular calls
to improve the lot of the majority of Moroccans, who live in
poverty, scratching an existence out of the rocky desert, and with
a series of conciliatory gestures that appear to signal a new
openness toward political opponents and estranged parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good man, he helps crippled people, and he will help
us, too,'' said Abdourrazak Abdelfadel as he boiled a pot of water
for tea over a propane gas cylinder in a mud hut in the oasis of
Tinerhir, at the edge of the vast Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   But popular expectations of the new king seem almost
unrealistically high, in a country where unemployment is above 20
percent. Bringing it down, officials say, will require nearly
tripling economic growth, to 7 percent a year, not an easy task in
an agricultural economy where the rainy season often produces only
shimmering mirages in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Years of drought have driven so many people to cities like
Rabat, Fez and Marrakesh that about half the population lives in
urban areas, where those without much education have little chance
of finding work. Even 117,000 of Morocco's university graduates, by
official count, could not find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   From abroad, much is expected of the king as well. When King
Mohammed's father died, President Clinton and scores of other
Western leaders came to the funeral. And like his father before
him, the new king is regarded by some Western leaders as a bridge
to the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of
France are already courting the king with personal visits to
Morocco, a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the new king's first official acts was to send an
emissary to France to negotiate terms for the return of one of the
kingdom's most famous political exiles: Abraham Serfaty, a Moroccan
Jew sentenced to life imprisonment for opposition activities and
expelled by Hassan II in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Serfaty, 73, flew back home on Sept. 30. Then, in mid-October,
the king gave permission to return from France to the exiled family
of Mehdi Ben Barka, another opposition figure kidnapped under
mysterious circumstances in Paris in 1965 and believed to have been
tortured to death at Hassan II's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had been muzzled as a condition of his return,
Serfaty told the French daily Le Monde, ``My positions are well
known, and I have not been asked to change them.'' He continued to
support autonomy for the Western Sahara territory, formerly under
Spanish rule, that was claimed by Hassan II for Morocco in 1975,
Serfaty said. But he had agreed ``not to hinder Moroccan
diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Western Sahara is one reason for continuing
tension between Morocco and Algeria, which supports the Polisario
Front independence movement in the territory. Though Morocco is
officially committed to letting the people of Western Sahara decide
the territory's future in a referendum next year, the prospect is
now fading, some diplomats believe, because of fears by Moroccan
officials that the vote could go against them and produce a
majority for independence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the king has also made changes at a level where
ordinary Moroccans can see them. One of the most dramatic was his
attempt to heal a rift with the country's north, where the
mountainous Rif region long resented his father for having led a
military expedition to put down a revolt there in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King Rehabilitates the Rif,'' read the headline in the
French-language weekly Le Journal, which like other newspapers
noted that the region's main economic activity has consisted of
smuggling locally grown marijuana and hashish, nearly 2,000 tons of
it last year, into Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Outside of China, few places these days can mobilize millions of
people to spend hours waiting in the hot sun for their leader to
pass by, as this kingdom did. But hundreds of thousands of people
in Fez, where Mohammed VI came after visiting the Rif region,
seemed happy to be waiting for him on his visit on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in the front row,'' said Lhoul Nezhro, a woman
who stood for four hours until the king finally arrived, in the
dark, at one of the main squares outside the amber ramparts of the
city. The square, like the others he passed through, had been
covered end-to-end with red, purple and saffron hand-woven carpets
_ at state expense, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will help students find jobs after they graduate,'' said a
14-year-old student, Mohammed Yassin el-Jazadi, who was lucky
enough to touch the king's hand after the king got out of his
limousine inside the Fez city walls and briskly strode up and down
at the edges of the crowd, bodyguards pushing away anybody who
tried to take his arm. At every stop, people in wheelchairs got a
personal greeting and a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, hope seemed as abundant as Morocco's problems.
Despite the presence of elementary schools even in desert villages
far from any road, 43 percent of the male population is illiterate.
Female illiteracy is even higher, since many rural families do not
send their daughters to school.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a break with tradition, Mohammed VI did not marry before
succeeding to the throne, according to government officials. Yet
such are the power of old ways here that many of his subjects
believe he must have taken a wife secretly.
</P>
<P>
   The status of women here is not as restricted as in some other
Islamic countries, and Morocco has also kept a tight lid on Islamic
militancy, given the example of Algeria next door where 100,000
people have died over the last decade in civil conflict between the
Socialist government and fundamentalist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social action, mobilizing all available resources to bring the
underprivileged classes back into the fold of society,'' Mohammed
VI told authorities here, ``have priority importance.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The king's spokesman, a young academic and former diplomat named
Hassan Aourid, said the king would work closely with the Socialist
government led by Abderrahman Youssoufi, a former political
prisoner twice Mohammed VI's age, in declaring a war on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim,'' Aourid said, ``is modernity.''

   RECOVERED-REMBRANDT (New York) _ A Rembrandt painting stolen
from a San Francisco museum is left at an Upper East Side gallery,
apparently by someone who dropped it off when the gallery was
offering free appraisals of artwork. The painting, called
``Portrait of a Rabbi,'' was stolen during the late 1970s by
burglars who lowered themselves down through a skylight. Federal
officials were trying to determine the authenticity of the work,
which was returned with two other stolen works by lesser-known
artists. By John Kifner.

CADILLAC IS REDESIGNING ITS IMAGE BEFORE ITS RETOOLED CARS APPEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J.)   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Cadillac has worked through an identity crisis and
come up with a sharpened brand image and radical designs for the
cars in its future. But years before any of the futuristic cars
have rolled out of factories, the flagship division of General
Motors plans an ad campaign promoting its new image.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac will start advertising the sizzle without the steak on
Monday. Marketing experts are divided about whether its approach
will work.
</P>
<P>
   A new ad campaign called ``The Power of &AMP;'' will make its debut
on Monday Night Football. The campaign, by Cadillac's longtime
advertising agency, the MacManus Group unit of D'Arcy Worldwide,
tries to represent Cadillac's new brand positioning, called ``art
and science.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``art'' refers to design. Cadillac has created a striking
new shape to represent the division, and it will be seen on each
freshly designed Cadillac. The futuristic form can now be seen only
on a car Cadillac built to take to car shows to stir interest in
the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Not until a year from now will the new design go on sale, as the
next generation of Cadillac's Escalade sport utility vehicle, a
vehicle that in its current cloak is simply a tarted-up Chevrolet
Tahoe. In 2001, a similar look will come through on the Catera, a
small Cadillac that now takes the shape of a nondescript sedan.
</P>
<P>
   By the ``science'' in ``art and science,'' Cadillac means that
its cars will come with gee-whiz technology, like night vision and
all-weather handling. Cadillac hopes to associate itself with the
confidence consumers around the world have in American
technological leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadillac used to rock and roll back in the 50s'' with daring
design elements like tailfins, said John F. Smith, Cadillac's
general manager. ``Art and science is the next-generation
expression of those values.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, which has been in the doldrums for years, is betting
big on the repositioning. No one knows whether consumers will like
the new designs, because it takes years to bring auto sketches from
designers' computers to factory floors, and none are on sale yet.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said Cadillac should not wait for the new designs to
roll out of factories to advertise its new positioning. ``A year
from now, the first vehicles from Cadillac that evoke that new-form
vocabulary become available,'' Smith said. ``I don't think I have
to apologize for the art or the science that is in showrooms today,
and it is only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Guarascio, GMs vice president for advertising and corporate
marketing, echoed his defense. ``You need to start someplace; you
need to put a stake in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But some outside marketing experts said Cadillac should not
advertise the new image until it has cars on sale that represent
the image shift.
</P>
<P>
   Running the ads now is ``a waste of money,'' said Clive Chajet,
chairman of Chajet Consultancy, a New York corporate identity
consultant. ``I would think that they would break that advertising
campaign when the cars become available.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree, and think the new ads could help change
Cadillac's direction, even if they do not increase sales soon.
``Cadillac has a tough transition ahead of it because they have to
retrain people in how to think about Cadillac,'' said Susan G.
Jacobs, president of Jacobs &AMP; Associates, an automotive strategic
planning company based in Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they adopt this campaign and stick with it for two or three
years, they should be pretty solid three to five years out,'' she
said. The ads ``probably will not hurt or help Cadillac sales this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Power of &AMP;'' ads try to express that the whole is more
than the sum of the parts in the case of Cadillac. The first two
television advertisements promote the Cadillac division, and use
diverse images _ night and day, stars and stripes, man and woman _
to convey what it labels the ``power of &AMP;.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice-over in one ad tells viewers: ``It's form that touches
our lives, and function that enlivens it. It's science that makes
us see and design that makes our eyes wide.'' The ads end with this
voice-over: ``The power of and. The fusion of design and
technology. Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads look quite different from any Cadillac spots now
showing. They are fast-paced and play peppy background music. ``It
is far more contemporary in its attitude,'' said Patrick J.
Sherwood, president of D'Arcy Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But they make another important change: in the past, advertising
created a distinct image for each car line, to differentiate an
Eldorado and a Seville, for instance. With the new ad campaign,
Cadillac is trying to create an umbrella image for all Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refused to disclose Cadillac's advertising budget, but
said advertising spending would be in line with past years.
However, he said, ``the effectiveness is going to be much greater''
because ads for each model will also bolster the entire division.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac spent $187.7 million last year and $247.6 million in
1997, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU,
which tracks advertising spending. In addition to the fairly
extensive television exposure, the new campaign will frequently be
seen in newspapers and magazines and similar images will be found
on Cadillac's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Separate spots will advertise each of Cadillac's five models.
The first, for the 2000 DeVille, is to begin on Nov. 29. It is a
good example of Cadillac's quandary. The ad shows a woman driving a
DeVille, as a computerized voice talks about the car's night-vision
capabilities, its Northstar engine and other high-technology
features. ``All systems go,'' the voice tells the driver as the ad
ends with ``the power of &AMP;'' signature.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever high-technology gizmos come with the DeVille, it is
still the barge of a car fondly stereotyped in mobster movies.
True, the 2000 model has been stripped of most chrome to give it a
more contemporary look, but it is years away from a redesign that
would allow it to be said to embody Cadillac's new, modern look. So
while it might represent the ``science'' in ``art and science,'' it
fails to represent the art. &QL;

<P>
   A small Texas money management company says it will let anyone
prepare and file an income tax return free next year on its Web
site, no matter how much the filer makes or how complicated the tax
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates can do his return for free at our site,'' said Herb
Vest, founder and chief executive of H.D. Vest of Dallas. The two
titans of the tax business, H&AMP;R Block and Intuit, offer free tax
preparation at their Web sites, but only for people with modest
incomes or simple tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The move by H.D. Vest, whose 8,500 registered representatives
prepare tax returns and sell investments like mutual funds,
illustrates how the tax preparation and investment advice
businesses are merging and how technology is driving down the cost
of income tax preparation.
</P>
<P>
   These changes pose challenges to Block, which prepares one of
every seven income tax returns and publishes Taxcut software, and
to Intuit, the publisher of Turbotax software. But executives of
the companies brushed off Vest's plans, saying the brand was barely
known and the company lacked the resources to market its free
service.
</P>
<P>
   From Vest's perspective, offering free tax return preparation at
its Web site, www.hdvest.com, is a low-cost strategy to expand its
base of 1.7 million clients. Each tax return represents a chance to
solicit a new investment client at a cost of less than $1 each to
process the return, Vest said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax software is being supplied by Basic Computer Systems, a
small, privately held company in Kaysville, Utah, that sells
Taxworks softare to income tax preparers. ``Tax return preparation
is just an excellent entry into the financial services arena,''
Vest said. Since its founding in 1983, his firm has specialized in
analyzing clients' tax returns as a first step in developing an
investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people do not understand that there is a wealth of
information in their tax return that they could use to improve
their life and their financial position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vest laid out his plans Thursday to 1,500 Vest representatives
in Dallas. Several of these representatives said they welcomed the
prospect of finding new clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you do your taxes at the Vest site, you will get a
letter asking if you want to have your 1040 analyzed,'' said Earl
Romero, a tax preparer and Vest agent in Manhattan. ``That will
have the name and telephone of the nearest Vest representative and
a picture of him. That's going to bring me new business.''
</P>
<P>
   Vest clients contribute about $3 billion annually, or an average
of $150 each a month, to their investment accounts, said Roger
Ochs, president of Vest.
</P>
<P>
   Vest is pursuing the same strategy as Block and Intuit, though
it is coming from the opposite direction. Vest is offering tax
services to attract new investment clients while Block and Intuit
are offering investment services to their tax clients, a costlier
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Block is buying Olde Financial Services, a discount securities
broker, for $847 million.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit is trying to leverage its Turbotax software, which
dominates the market, into a financial services business with
access to retail banking, mortgages, consumer loans and investments
through its Quicken.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Meighan, an Intuit vice president, said, ``We have seen
competitors come and competitors go, and we are not worried because
we know people want a tax product they can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark Ernst, the president of Block, research shows
that many people are uncomfortable having their tax data stored on
any hard drive but their own, which may limit the appeal of the
free service from Vest.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst said Block had also begun to eliminate what he said was a
small number of Vest agents among the 100,000 people who prepare
tax returns at Block offices.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Appleby, an analyst at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco
who follows Intuit, said that even though Vest would be giving away
what Intuit sells, he did not believe Intuit faced much of a threat
because Vest lacked the resources to mount a heavy marketing
campaign to draw customers.
</P>
<P>
   Vest shares closed Thursday at $6.125, up 68.75 cents. Block
closed at $39.9375, down 62.5 cents, and Intuit closed at $32.8125,
up 93.75 cents.

BANCO SANTANDER OF SPAIN WILL ACQUIRE 2 PORTUGUESE BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Banco Santander Central Hispano, the largest
Spanish bank, said Thursday that it would buy two banks in
Champalimaud Group of Portugal but would not achieve its earlier
bid for 40 percent of the group because of stiff opposition from
the Portuguese government.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Santander's co-chairmen flew unexpectedly to Lisbon
Thursday, trying to end a long-running dispute in which Portugal
defied European Union orders to permit the Spanish bank to pay 1.2
billion euros, or $1.25 billion, for 40 percent of Champalimaud.
</P>
<P>
   The financial group, Portugal's third-largest, is controlled by
Antonio Champalimaud, 81, one of the nation's richest people. The
Lisbon government insisted that there were irregularities in the
alliance that Banco Santander announced in June, but the dispute
was viewed more broadly, as a test case for cross-border bank
mergers in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise reached Thursday, Banco Santander will get
temporary control of the Champalimaud Group on the condition that
it sell all of its properties except two banks, Banco Totta e
Acores and the mortgage bank Credito Predial Portugues, a Santander
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the two banks and the deadline to sell the other
Champalimaud properties was not immediately disclosed. The
Portuguese state savings bank Caixa Geral de Depositos was named as
the likely buyer for Champalimaud's other major assets, including
the large insurer Mundial Confianca.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese minister of the economy, Joaquim Pina Moura, said
in Lisbon Thursday night that his government would withdraw its
objections, but he did not disclose the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether any stakes in the
Champalimaud Group would go to Banco Comercial Portugues, a leading
private bank that made a competing bid in June.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Santander Central Hispano, itself formed by a merger in
April, is the leading financial group in Latin America and has also
been contemplating expansion closer to home in Europe. In August,
it raised its stake in Societe Generale of France to 4.64 percent.
Banco Santander owns almost 10 percent of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, which is considering a bid for the National Westminster
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Santander's move into Portugal would make it one of the
largest banks there.
</P>
<P>
   European officials in Brussels, Belgium, said that the original
agreement respected European Union competition rules because it did
not create a dominant position, one exceeding 20 percent of the
Portuguese banking industry. But when Portugal maintained its
objections, Brussels announced last week that it would file suit
against Portugal at the European Court of Justice.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frank Ciotola, a restaurant owner in Columbus,
Ohio, is paying dishwashers $8 an hour nowadays, up from $6 two
years ago. And he is spending more money placing help wanted ads
than he is promoting the restaurant itself.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of his total costs accounted for by labor has
crept up to 29 percent from 24 percent during the last few years,
and though he has clamped down on other expenses as much as
possible, Ciotola said he had reached the point where customers at
his restaurant, Da Vinci, will have to pick up some of the tab if
wages keep rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just about as tight as it's going to get,'' Ciotola said.
``Any additional increases we face, we'll just have to pass along
in terms of menu prices or I'm not going to make any money.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's low and still declining unemployment rate _ it fell
to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest in almost 30 years _ has been
great news for Ciotola's 75 employees and workers in most
industries all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility
that upward pressure on wages could spur inflation, seem to be the
biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they
debate whether to raise interest rates a third time this year when
they meet on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, employment cost increases have remained remarkably
restrained despite the drop in unemployment. Moreover, to the
degree that those costs have surged, from such hot industries as
computer software and telecommunications to more traditional
sectors like retailing, businesses have proven remarkably
successful in absorbing them without sacrificing profits or raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons range from new trends in compensation, like the
rising use of stock options in the place of salary increases, to an
upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or each worker's output
each hour. The question is how long such forces can keep a lid on
the pressures that might force up wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity improvements can continue, one Fed official said
recently, ``but it defies all logic to assume you won't get
increases in prices and wages at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows precisely when that point will be reached, though,
making the decision about whether to raise rates next week a
particularly close call for the central bank, which pushed its
benchmark federal funds target rate up by a quarter of a percentage
point in August, to 5.25 percent, after an earlier quarter-point
increase in June.
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly a case for the Fed to remain on hold next week.
By most measures, inflation remains reasonably well contained. The
economy is showing some signs of slowing in response to earlier
interest rate increases. The stock market is down from its highs
this summer. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and
other Fed officials are increasingly convinced that the improvement
in productivity growth reflects structural changes in the way
businesses operate, not just a brief cyclical upturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do raise rates, I'd really like to know why,'' said
Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a
consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ``The only rationale is that
growth is strong, and I think the Fed has moved beyond the idea
that growth by itself is something to be afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   The case in favor of another rate hike next week is built
largely on the idea that the nation is running out of workers, and
that at some point a simple supply-and-demand situation will lead
to a surge in wages and then, perhaps, prices. In this view, the
Fed should stay ahead of the trend by slowing the economy a bit
more to keep the labor market from getting even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the absence of a rise in core inflation, developments
in the labor market are likely to result in the Fed instituting
more pre-emptive rate hikes,'' said Ian Morris, an economist at
HSBC Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last month, John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., took an in-depth look at the strains in the labor
market. He said that even the broadest measure of available labor _
including not just people who are officially unemployed but some
part-time workers and others who might be tempted back into the
labor market _ had declined steeply, to 7 percent in September from
7.6 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Joblessness among adults, 3.5 percent in October, is near a
three-decade low. Overall labor force participation is stagnant or
down, and the growth of the labor force is slowing somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Youngdahl concluded that there appears to be growing sentiment
at the Fed that it is ``not only the small size but the
inflexibility of the margin in labor supply that creates potential
for an appreciable upward shift in labor expense growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public appearances, Greenspan has alluded repeatedly to
tight labor markets. Speaking to a group of business executives
last month, Greenspan said that the number of people being drawn
into the work force beyond those due to normal population trends _
in other words, people who had previously chosen not to work _ was
accounting for roughly half a percentage point of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Greenspan said, the economy would have to revert
back to a growth rate reflecting normal labor force growth and the
long-term rate of productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the growth in gross domestic product cannot exceed
the sum of growth in structural productivity and in the working-age
population indefinitely,'' Greenspan said. ``Market pressures must
eventually emerge that work to contain such unsustainable growth.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of mounting pressures in
the labor markets. Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. said that in some cities it
has to pay cash bonuses to attract and even retain employees in its
stores, and that regional managers have discretion to raise wages
if needed.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls, a manufacturer
based in Milwaukee, said his company now often draws new employees
from lower-paying, less-skilled jobs in the service sector, and
must spend money and time training them. Moreover, Johnson's
customers in industries like automobiles demand decreasing prices
on some of its products, putting additional pressure for the
company to offset rising labor costs with productivity
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   And at the loftiest reaches of the employment scale, experienced
executives going into senior jobs at technology startups are able
to demand and get richer packages of stock and options in addition
to cash compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in the middle of an unprecedented
supply-and-demand imbalance,'' said David B. Kixmiller, a partner
in the Silicon Valley office of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the executive
search firm.
</P>
<P>
   To hold down labor costs in that kind of environment, companies
have become more imaginative. Some use one-time cash bonuses to
reward workers without permanently raising wage rates. Others are
offering more equity-based pay schemes like stock options that do
not show up in traditional measures of wage and salary growth.
Others are offering expensive gifts, extra time off and other
benefits in an effort to lure new employees and hold onto the ones
they have.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also think that workers themselves are less
aggressive in pushing for pay increases than they were in previous
business cycles when unemployment dipped to low levels. The reason,
they speculate, is that the combination of global competition and
the relentless corporate push to cut costs have left workers
somewhat insecure about their jobs _ even if they are relatively
confident that they could find another if they do become
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on labor costs could well ease if the economy is
indeed slowing. But the economy has repeatedly defied projections
of a slowdown, and at this point continued strong growth could send
unemployment down to levels the nation has not seen since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Morris of HSBC calculated recently that if labor force growth
remains at its current annual rate of roughly 1 percent, labor
force participation remains steady at around 67 percent and the
economy creates an average of 250,000 nonfarm jobs a month, the
unemployment rate will decline to as low as 3.5 percent by the
middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   If job growth averages 200,000 a month _ it has been running at
an average of 192,000 a month this year _ it would push the
unemployment rate down to as low as 3.9 percent by mid-2000, Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials will no doubt scrutinize new reports on retail
sales and productivity that are to be released on Friday, the last
major economic indicators before their meeting next Tuesday. And
while they have given few clues in the last few weeks as to their
thinking about the arguments for and against a rate increase, they
have made clear that they are very much on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should not assume that the business cycle is dead,''
William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
told reporters in Vienna Thursday after delivering a speech there.
``One should not assume that the American economy can keep growing
faster without inflation.''

ODOM: ONLY VICTORIES COUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By RANDY HILL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before Lamar Odom can be validated as the Pokmon
event for this NBA season, another telltale number must be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   And this bottom-line qualifier has not been lost on the Clipper
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing well as a team is the most important thing ... forget
about what I do,'' said Odom, whose knack for crowding the stat
sheet has generated more interest than the franchise has
experienced, well, maybe ever. ``The only thing that matters is
winning. We thought we'd be better than this so far.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but we certainly would hate to ponder Planet Clipper without
Odom.
</P>
<P>
   With him, the Clippers still have managed to lose four of five
games. But after Odom's clunker defined the team's Monday night
struggle against the Utah Jazz, he rallied with fairly big numbers
in Wednesday's loss to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at his line,'' Clippers coach Chris Ford said of
Odom's 16-point, 7-rebound, 3-assist performance, ``it's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another number that framed Wednesday's loss was 6, representing
Odom's foul production.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those whistles resulted in charging calls, the result of
wise opponents studying film to notice Odom's delight in attack the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rookie seemingly hasn't earned the right to foul
with impunity, he is averaging 11 free-throw attempts per game. And
after missing 7 of his 15 attempts in the opener with Seattle, he
has made 35 of his last 41 (85 percent).
</P>
<P>
   MIKE STEPS UP
</P>
<P>
   After producing a scoring-column doughnut in last Friday's
victory over Philadelphia, second-year center Michael Olowokandi
has contributed 10 and 12 points, respectively, in this week's
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's joust with San Antonio's David Robinson seemed to
bring out the best the 7-foot Olowokandi has managed this season a
dozen points, 9 rebounds and a relatively acceptable 2 turnovers.
Robinson, now beginning his second season as a self-appointed
co-star to Tim Duncan, made only 3 of 9 field-goal attempts,
finishing with 9 points and 6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a league that can batter a young player's confidence in short
order, playing well against a future Hall of Famer could provide
the boost Olowokandi needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really looked at it like that,'' he said, ``but it's
probably true. I just know I have to continue playing hard defense
and going strong to the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows his next test is Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves and
the Grizzlies, who will take on the Clippers Sunday at Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   After a solid game against Robinson, the true measure of
Olowokandi will be bringing the same type of effort against the
more pedestrian centers.
</P>
<P>
   FAST BREAKS
</P>
<P>
   With perimeter ace Eric Piatkowski (busied ribs) and point guard
Eric Murdock (sore knee) watching in street clothes, it's a fine
time to log a ``what if'' item. To pry Murdock away from the New
Jersey Nets, the Clippers traded Johnny Newman, another renowned
sniper, to the Nets. In New Jersey's last two games, Newman has
produced a combined 51 points. To the good, Brian Skinner has more
than replicated the productivity of free-agent goner Lorenzen
Wrigh. ... The Clippers had Thursday off. ... Former CBA teammates
Tyrone Nesby and Troy Hudson teamed up to make 2 of 19 field-goal
attempts against San Antonio; their teammates were 30 of 52.

NASCAR SWITCHES ITS DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nascar started planning its assault on network wallets a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The stock car racing monolith, which is owned by the ruling
France family, knew that its growth in attendance, ratings,
sponsorships and merchandising entitled it to more than $100
million a year in TV cash.
</P>
<P>
   So it took back from the tracks the right to make TV deals for
the Winston Cup and Busch Grand National series, played four
broadcast-cable partnerships against each other and after three
days of talks, announced deals Thursday that will quadruple its
television bounty beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nascar's maneuvering dealt in the Fox-FX and NBC-TBS teams _ for
roughly $200 million each per year. At $400 million annually,
Nascar will receive more than the $336 million that Major League
Baseball receives each year from NBC, ESPN, Fox, Fox Sports Net and
FX.
</P>
<P>
   But in receiving its new riches, Nascar cut out the ABC-ESPN and
CBS-TNN bidding groups, which will carry its races now only through
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled mightily with that, but we decided to take the
sport to a new level in the next millennium,'' said Bray Cary,
Nascar's vice president for broadcast and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Cary insisted that the deals were not about money, but in part
they were. Nascar is a money machine that emerged with the kind of
money it planned on snagging a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its leverage, Nascar knew it could get more than,
say, the $130 million a year that the CBS-TNN tandem offered.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS and TNN offered less because they couldn't guarantee
that two-thirds of the elite Winston Cup series would be shown on
the broadcast side _ the reverse of the current coverage. CBS,
which has been showing five Winston Cup races, offered nine slots
in bidding on the new deal. NBC will be closer to 15 or 16.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-ESPN pairing was more intent on preserving the current
order, in which ESPN gets most of the races (this year, ESPN has 14
Winston Cup races and ABC has 5), than in acceding to Nascar's
wishes, people involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed comfortable with the schedule we laid out and
didn't express any concerns,'' said John Wildhack, ESPN's senior
vice president for programming.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox and NBC could give Nascar what it wanted because the
former no longer carries National Hockey League games and the
latter no longer owns National Football League rights.
</P>
<P>
   And so, under an eight-year contract, Fox and FX will take a
20-week package of races from February to June. And NBC and TBS,
with six-year deals, will carry the July-to-November races. Fox and
NBC will alternate the highly rated Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answered all of Nascar's dreams,'' said Dick Ebersol, the
chairman of NBC Sports. Coincidentally, NBC will carry its first
Nascar race, the Pennzoil 400, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Television Group, said:
``I've watched in awe for 10 years as Nascar has gone from success
to success. This is a model for how a sport should be run and
promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will start its Nascar season after the NFL post-season, and
NBC will begin its half shortly after the National Basketball
Association finals. Nascar will then be a promotional vehicle to
start the NBA season on TBS.
</P>
<P>
   Of Nascar's new best friends, only TBS has carried stock-car
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to expand our relationship with Nascar and the
partnership with NBC let us do that in a robust way,'' said Mark
Lazarus, the president of Turner Sports, TBS' parent.
</P>
<P>
   But all of Nascar's TV partners will partake in the success of
the France family business, which has expanded far beyond its
Southeastern roots, even if Ebersol joked that he and Hill will
each get a still installed in their offices. With Nascar's
marketing skills, the stills would no doubt be sponsored, and
Ebersol and Hill would be turned into check-writing action figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nascar is the only major sport that has grown continuously
through the 1990s,'' Ebersol said. ``What makes all of us happy is
that this sport hasn't gone to Chicago, New York or Kansas City
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nascar is the second-highest-rated sport, trailing the NFL. The
appeal of Winston Cup races to men in the coveted 18-to-49-year-old
demographic is also second to the NFL's. Of all the major sports,
only Nascar's broadcast ratings have grown since 1995. And ratings
outside the Southeast are strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nascar felt that its races were unevenly promoted without
consistency in network coverage. The first seven races of the year
were carried, in order, by TBS, CBS, TNN, ABC, ABC, ESPN and CBS.
The consistency problem was resolved by splitting the season into
20-week halves and getting two-thirds of the races onto broadcast
TV.
</P>
<P>
   By staking its lot with Nascar for six years, NBC is signaling
that it will not get back into the Sunday afternoon NFL fray if the
league reopens the eight-year contract after five seasons.  &QL;

NOVARTIS PLANS NO BID FOR AMERICAN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland _ The chairman of Novartis AG of Switzerland
said Thursday that he now has no intention of making a hostile bid
for American Home Products, but added that the fate of the New
Jersey company was far from decided despite its pending agreement
to merge with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Many drug analysts and executives thought that Novartis might
try to take over American Home Products after Pfizer made a hostile
bid for Warner-Lambert last week. But Dr. Daniel Vasella, the
chairman and chief executive of Novartis, dismissed that theory in
an interview here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention currently of making a hostile bid for any
company,'' Vasella said. ``Novartis does not exclude making
corporate transactions as a way to achieve growth, but to make any
merger in haste would be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the chief executives of the British drug giants Glaxo
Wellcome and AstraZeneca, Vasella said he thought that Pfizer would
succeed in its bid to take over Warner-Lambert. But when it came to
commenting on the future of American Home Products, the Novartis
chief seemed oddly vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shareholders of American Home Products have choices,'' he
said. ``And with this merger with Warner-Lambert, they will have to
make that choice in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would leak the details of a merger with American
Home Products to a reporter, should his company try one if the
Warner-Lambert deal fell through, he smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When American Home Products is bought, there will be many
phone calls,'' Vasella said. ``It will not be a secret. It will be
open; you will certainly know it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Novartis has been linked by analysts and
some news reports as a possible merger partner with several
companies, including Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said Thursday that Novartis might seek to trade its
agricultural division for Searle, Monsanto's drug division, but
other industry executives dismissed that as unlikely because of the
antitrust issues raised in combining two large agricultural
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Vasella declined to say anything about Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting a policy now of saying no comment when
journalists call and ask if we are merging with this company or
that company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most drug companies are considering acquisitions to bolster
their drug development pipelines, but Vasella said Novartis was not
in that situation. The company has several blockbuster drugs for
which it is about to seek approval from the Food and Drug
Administration, including Zelmac for irritable bowel syndrome and
Starlix, a treatment for adult-onset diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have chided Novartis for being a poor marketer in the
United States, where Novartis _ the world's second-largest drug
company _ ranks ninth in prescription drug sales, according to IMS
Health, an industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the companies that are the best at sales
and marketing in the United States, Novartis is not among them, I
agree,'' Vasella said. ``But I don't have to do a merger for
research and development. I want to increase the company's
marketing capabilities in the United States and step up our sales
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have been skeptical that Novartis would make an
American acquisition because the company's shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange and its American depository receipts
are thinly traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange by the end
of next year,'' Vasella said. ``But that wouldn't stop us from
making a merger. I'm sure there are plenty of banks that would be
willing to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other chief executives, Vasella said he planned to
watch the fight for Warner-Lambert closely, but in the meantime,
would concentrate on bringing his new drugs to market.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces competition with Glaxo Wellcome, which is
expected to introduce Lotronex, its irritable-bowel drug, in the
next several months.

EXCLUSIVE: INDONESIA'S NEW PRESIDENT SAYS HE WOULD PARDON SUHARTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: This is an added starter on Page 1 of The New York Times)  
 (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new president of Indonesia said here Thursday
night that he had decided to pardon the nation's former leader,
President Suharto, if Suharto is convicted of crimes as a result of
an investigation into whether he and his family stole billions of
dollars from the government.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid insisted, however, that the
corruption investigation would go forward, that Suharto would be
pardoned only after a trial, and that the former leader's children
and friends would not be treated with similar leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he is found guilty in a court, then we will pardon him,
because he was our president,'' Wahid told a group of American
business leaders and diplomats. ``But not the rest of his family.
This is very important. Not the family and not the cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, a respected Islamic cleric who was elected in October
after the freest balloting in decades in the world's fourth most
populous nation, said he would also pardon his immediate
predecessor, B.J. Habibie, should Habibie be accused of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's comments came on the eve of a White House meeting with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 78, ruled Indonesia for 32 years. He and his children
have been accused of stashing billions of dollars overseas, a
charge that Suharto has denied. Still, corruption by the Suharto
family and its friends is widely believed to have distorted the
Indonesian economy, and allegations of such large-scale diversions
of riches contributed to a wave of public fury that drove him from
office in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision to pardon Suharto seems almost certain to be
criticized by human rights activists and others who have urged that
the former president be brought to justice, it could short-circuit
threats posed to Wahid's democratically elected government by
Suharto's remaining allies within the powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In characteristically blunt comments, Wahid acknowledged that
his relationship with the military was problematic. ``The idea of
the supremacy of the civilians _ this is very important,'' he said.
``But please remember, we are in a difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said he believed that Suharto had indeed hidden vast
amounts of money abroad. ``He is richer than the state even,''
Wahid said at a meeting organized by the U.S.-Indonesia Society and
the U.S.-Asean Business Council.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Suharto had been clever to hide his assets abroad
under the names of his children and his friends, suggesting that it
might be difficult to convict him of corruption. ``The problem is
that he stashed all the money abroad in the names of his cronies,
his family _ not himself,'' said Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's government announced in late October that it would
reopen the Suharto inquiry that had been dropped as one of the
final acts of Habibie's government.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment was given to the new attorney general, Marzuki
Darusman, a former human rights commissioner who was an opponent of
Suharto. The investigation is expected to focus on a complex of
purportedly charitable foundations controlled by the Suharto
family. Critics of the former president have long charged that the
foundations were used to launder billions of dollars in bribes and
other money stolen from the treasury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an apparent slip of the tongue, Wahid said, ``I have
instructed the attorney general to convict him,'' but then amended
that to say, ``to determine whether he's guilty or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid is one of the few prominent political figures in Indonesia
not tainted by allegations of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not say so explicitly, the new president seemed to
suggest that he still hoped to recover much of the money that may
have been stolen _ if not from Suharto directly, than through his
many wealthy children.
</P>
<P>
   ``His children are so rich they can pay the budget,'' Wahid
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting Thursday night with senior U.S. diplomats and
executives of prominent U.S. companies doing business in Indonesia,
Wahid said the Indonesian economy was in ``shambles'' as a result
of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ask Clinton for continuing economic assistance
and for help in establishing the rule of law in Indonesia, a nation
that has known corrupt authoritarianism for most of its modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were controlled by a government that looked after its own
interests, not the interests of the people,'' he said. ``We want to
say to the American people, please help us in obtaining a good
government _ an open one, an honest one.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
History comes to Madison, Wis., on Saturday in a package suitable
for the occasion. No frills. Nothing flashy. Little talk, but
plenty of action.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ron (Dayne) is what our program is all about,'' Wisconsin
coach Barry Alvarez said. ``Blue-collar, tough, hard-nosed, not
doing it the easy way, just doing what you have to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 99 yards separating him from the top spot on college
football's Division I-A all-time rushing list, Dayne again
undergoes scrutiny and appraisal. A Heisman Trophy favorite who
fell from grace early, he is back, and the new reviews are mostly
favorable as he closes in on the record (6,279) established by
Texas' Ricky Williams a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the key to their success,'' said Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz,
whose Hawkeyes have the unenviable task of trying to keep the man
of the hour under wraps before a sea of red-clad Dayne-worshippers
at Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday afternoon. ``I admire what
Barry has done with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stuck to their guns. They know who they are. They're
very comfortable with what they are philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the results speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, too, because Dayne isn't likely to have
much to say about all this. A man of few words, the Badgers
tailback has rolled up most of his 6,181 career yards without
comment _ colorful or otherwise. At last summer's Big Ten media
days, the kickoff for his would-be Heisman bid, Dayne was given to
the sort of mumbling and truncated responses that would make
Shaquille O'Neal look like a veritable Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Surly or quiet? Coaches and teammates insist it's the latter,
and Dayne's generosity in working with sick children and the Humane
Society speak to a gentler side.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has picked up a few critics, so much so that the
Wisconsin sports information department felt compelled to post a
``What's Myth and What's Fact?'' listing on its promotional Web
page. A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne hasn't gained yardage vs. quality opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Dayne and the Badgers have faced nationally ranked foes 15
times since 1996. His average rushing yards in those contests is
144.9.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne has had a disappointing 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Dayne has rushed for 1,618 yards, tops in the NCAA. Dayne
reached 1,000 yards faster in 1999 than in any of his previous
seasons despite sitting out six quarters in blowout victories.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne carries the ball on nearly every play.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Dayne has carried more than 40 times in a game only twice.
As a starter, Dayne has averaged 29.8 carries as a freshman, 23.9
as a sophomore, 26.8 as a junior and 27.6 as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne weighs too much to play tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Dayne reported to UW in 1996 weighing 275 pounds. He
completed fall camp in 1999 weighing just 248. Dayne currently
weighs 254 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne turns the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: In 1,159 carries, Dayne has suffered just nine fumbles
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne is a big back who is a short-yardage player.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Dayne has 4.5 speed in the 40. He has 176 carries (15
percent) of at least 10 yards during his career. Dayne's career
longest run is 80 yards (as a sophomore). He recorded a season-best
eight carries of longer than 10 yards in a win at No. 17 Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yes, there's the business about not playing hurt.
Wisconsin types counter by noting his performance with a torn
shoulder muscle against Penn State last season, with the ankle
sprain he endured in gaining a season-high 231 yards this year in a
loss to Cincinnati and with a dislocated finger with which he
played this year against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his image problems, the numbers say Dayne is pretty
good. In his quest for the record, he has 77 more career attempts
than Williams, who has declined comment on Dayne's accomplishment,
but will have played in one fewer collegiate game (44-43). His
average yards per attempt (5.68) trails Williams (6.21) but is
better than Tony Dorsett (5.66), Charles White (5.47) and Herschel
Walker (5.29). In average yards per game, Dayne's 147.2 trails
Walker (159.4) but leads Williams (142.7).
</P>
<P>
   You can debate whether Dayne is the greatest ever, but there is
no doubt he deserves mention among the best. Saturday should make
that official, if it isn't already.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long time coming, and it's nice to see the
light at the end of the tunnel,'' Alvarez said. ``He's worked
extremely hard. He's been a very consistent player for four years.
No one has meant any more to a program than he has meant to ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the excitement building, even Dayne can't help but get
caught up in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' he said after last week's 222-yard effort at
Purdue. ``As long as we're back home, in front of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fans will be ready. The record has been cause for
excitement, not to mention concern that Alvarez's refusal to
cheapen it by tacking on extra carries in games already decided
could leave their man a few yards short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said from the beginning that if Ron's fortunate enough to
break the record, there's some dignity in doing it the right way,''
the coach said. ``We felt it should be broken in the context of the
game, and if he's fortunate enough to break it, that's exactly the
way it'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, it will take place amid considerably less hoopla
than Williams' burst into history in last year's Texas-Texas A&AMP;M
game. Iowa-Wisconsin is receiving only regional television
exposure, and the national media haven't picked up the drumbeat
with the enthusiasm they did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem: Williams broke a record set by Dorsett in
the 1970s. Dayne is about to better a standard that is less than a
year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like hitting 70 home runs,'' Alvarez said. ``Coming back
and hitting 68 is no big deal. It was broken just last year by
Williams. If Ron is fortunate enough to break it this year, it's a
ho-hum deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in Wisconsin. The Badgers nurse hopes for a return to the
Rose Bowl and one last big stage for The Great Dayne, who likely
will have added a Heisman to his list of accomplishments by then.
The rest of the world might not be following every footstep, but
Alvarez says it might be some time before we see this new record
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see many teams running the football,'' he said.
``The trend now is to spread 'em out and throw the ball. To do
something like this, you pretty much have to be a four-year
starter. For a great player, it's very difficult. I think they're
reluctant to stay four years.''
</P>
<P>
   As his big moment approaches, Dayne says the Badgers have other,
more important items on the weekend agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a game to win,'' he said. ``The record comes at
the end, once the game is over. As long as we get the W, I'm happy.
The yards will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they always have, one step at a time.

COME ON, GET SAPPY: `PARTRIDGE' LAYS  EGG

<P>
   ``I couldn't sing or play the guitar,'' Danny Bonaduce says in a
voice-over at the beginning of ``Come on Get Happy: The Partridge
Family Story.'' ``But take it from me _ none of that mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   It still doesn't. But a lack of musical talent has never
prevented Bonaduce from getting more than his share of attention.
For instance, that time in Phoenix with the transvestite prostitute
. . . well, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do his shortcomings stop the ABC movie from telling the
story of the syrupy-sweet '70s musical sitcom family through
Bonaduce's eyes. Which may strike you as telling the story of
``Green Acres'' from Arnold the pig's point of view, but what the
heck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of the Partridges was a professional musician
and, famously, only Shirley Jones and David Cassidy actually sang
at all. But you knew that. After all, ``The Partridge Family'' was
one of the greatest television shows about one of the greatest
bands of the rock era, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. Which normally would beg the question: Why a movie
about the ``Partridge Family'' 25 years after its last season?
</P>
<P>
   But this is television, where an idea can't truly be considered
original unless three or four other networks have had it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Three movies about Jesus in the same season? That's
understandable. You've got to figure any story that's still going
strong after 2,000 years stands up to retelling.
</P>
<P>
   But two Partridge Family movies? (NBC has got one coming in
February.) How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very nostalgic time right now,'' says Randy
Robinson, an executive producer of ``Come On Get Happy,''
``because, I believe, we are heading into a new millennium, and
it's time for us to try to see what we've learned and glean
something from that and be able to move forward into the future
with something gained.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But ``Come On Get Happy'' isn't likely to send you
digging through your closet looking for old copies of ``Tiger
Beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The elements exist for an entertaining movie. The Partridge
Family was, after all, a totally corporate creation, so network
executives come in for some ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say rock 'n' roll, we're saying the Monkees, only less
threatening,'' one honcho says.
</P>
<P>
   And that's basically what they got. Though critically despised,
both the band and ``The Partridge Family'' were a hit (again, both
the band and the show).
</P>
<P>
   (Full-disclosure interruption: I joined the ``Partridge Family''
fan club in second grade. By the time the goods arrived in third
grade, the band and show were hopelessly uncool.)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to shrewd marketing and the phalanx of teeny-boppers who
followed the shaggy haired Cassidy around, ``I Think I Love You''
hit No. 7 on the charts before the first episode of the show even
aired.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what you would expect is here: the frustrations Cassidy,
who wanted to really rock, felt at being known as the leader of a
bubble-gum band (and a fake one at that), the difficulties of
working with child actors, the wages of fame, etc.
</P>
<P>
   What's unexpected is the point of view, and, oddly, the movie
suffers for it. Bonaduce is credited as a consultant for the film;
the idea for ``Come On'' ``Get Happy'' began as a script he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The only aspect of that script Robinson found interesting was
how Bonaduce sought solace from his real family _ he was terrorized
by a TV-writer father who beat him _ in his pretend one. Though it
may be a compelling story in its own right, dropped into the middle
of a movie about the most optimistically sugarcoated band
imaginable, the relentless family strife is woefully out of place.
As the movie bounds between the two, neither story receives worthy
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, man, that's even more interesting than the premises
for movies like ``Pleasantville'' or ``The Truman Show,''''
Robinson says, ``because those were movies that were based on
purely fictional incidents that were trying to examine the fine
line between fact and fiction or reality and fantasy. I thought:
Geez, this is an opportunity with a real-life story and a
fact-based story to be able to do something kind of cool,
questioning the same kind of fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   More interesting in theory perhaps. In actual practice, well,
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   One not worth telling again. &QL;

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The peace deal in Congo, never hardy even at
birth, is not dead yet, or so almost everyone involved says. But it
has been badly bruised in recent days, and both the government of
President Laurent Kabila and the rebels say it will not take much
for the fighting to flare once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the last attack, we are tired,'' Moise Nyaruzabo, vice
president of the biggest rebel group, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy, said Thursday by telephone. ``If he attacks our
positions again, we will start to fight on all fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days Nyaruzabo's rebels and another rebel group
have said that Kabila's troops bombed or invaded several towns in
remote areas of Congo, the big and volatile nation at Africa's
heart. A top Kabila official made the same assertions on Wednesday
about the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the fighting would represent major breaches in the
peace accord reached this summer through painstaking and complex
negotiations. But the fact is no outsiders seem to have the first
clue whether fighting has reignited or whether the claims are more
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   And this, many experts say, points out a major failure of the
peace accord so far: the United Nations has been unable to station
military observers inside the country to monitor the cease-fire, a
vital part of the agreement. While 39 observers are now in the
capitals of the six outside nations with troops in Congo, none have
been stationed in the distant areas where the fighting takes place.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of money has been one problem, and many specialists
question whether United Nations' members ultimately have the will
to commit the organization to a complex and potentially dangerous
peacekeeping operation in Congo. But more immediately, experts say,
the biggest block has been Kabila himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month he has kept his territory off limits to a U.
N. team charged with laying the groundwork for the military
observers _ assessing issues like safety, runway adequacy and
medical care availability. He said that the team needed to visit
only land held by the rebels, which includes much of the Congo's
north and east.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important now to find out what's true and what is not
true,'' said Hannelie de Beer, an analyst with the Institute for
Strategic Studies in South Africa. ``There is a mechanism for that,
and they should get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Thursday, after several days of negotiations involving
Mustapha Niasse, the U.N. envoy to Congo, was a plane with a survey
team allowed to take off from Kinshasa for five main cities in
Congo. Only one of those cities, Kananga, is held by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane just left,'' said Diane Bailey, a U.N. team member
who is based in Kinshasa. ``So that's a positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Intermittently for the last three years, Congo has been
embroiled in war. It began as a drive to depose Mobutu Sese Seko,
who for three decades was dictator of the country, then known as
Zaire. Kabila led the rebels in toppling Mobutu in 1997, but since
then three rebel groups _ including many of Kabila's old allies,
themselves divided _ have sprung up to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, Congo's neighbors to the east, back the
rebels. Three other neighbors _ Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia _
support Kabila. A sixth, Burundi, has acknowledged having troops in
Congo but says its sole interest is to protect its borders with
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   As in many conflicts in Africa, the fighting has taken place far
from international view, in towns with no telephones or decent
roads, with no way for outsiders to tell how many have died or who
is winning. Apart from occasional bombings, the fighting tends not
to be on a large scale but among relatively small groups
skirmishing in villages that have some strategic value.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the last of the rebels signed the peace accord at the end
of August, the combatants have largely remained in their positions.
The U.N. monitors are supposed to follow their progress as they
ultimately disengage. All sides agreed that some clashes were
inevitable until then.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is whether the combatants view the accord
as a road toward peace or whether it has simply afforded each side
time to regroup for more fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials noted a mood of increased militarism in
Kinshasa recently, with banners on the streets proclaiming the need
for people to sacrifice for their nation. The rebels have also
asserted that Kabila has received new shipments of arms since the
signing.
</P>
<P>
   On the rebels' side, Nyaruzabo, of the Rally for Democracy, made
clear that his group has not forgotten its military aims. He said
that if the fighting began again the target would be Mbuji-Mayi,
the diamond-producing city in southern Congo that is considered one
of the prizes of the war.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue is whether the outside nations _ whose greater
military and economic force has helped drive the war _ show signs
of retreating from the accord. At the moment all appear to be
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ugandan officials said recently that they
considered the peace accord intact, contradicting a Uganda-backed
rebel leader who called it ``null and void'' last weekend. The
rebel, Jean-Pierre Bemba, based his assessment on a claim that his
forces had driven 300 of Kabila's troops from a northeastern Congo
town. But Ugandan officials publicly questioned Bemba's strong
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said right from the time that we signed the peace
accord in Lusaka that it was the best way forward,'' said John
Nagenda, a Ugandan spokesman. ``Nothing will change that.'' Lusaka
is the capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba, in a telephone interview this week, moderated his tone,
saying he did not consider the deal over _ at least not yet. ``Any
attack by Kabila,'' he said, ``will be responded to heavily.''

BIAGIO DILIETO, 76, MAYOR OF NEW HAVEN FOR A DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TINA KELLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biagio DiLieto, a former New Haven, Conn., mayor and police
chief who helped breathe new life into the city during his 10 years
in office, died Monday at a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, a funeral home spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, DiLieto, a Democrat who was known as Ben, lay in state
at City Hall, the first mayor to be honored in such a way, a city
spokeswoman said. As a crowd of about 750 filed by in the
afternoon, people remembered him as a true neighborhood politician
and one of the last legs of the city's ethnic political machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben will always be remembered for the friendships he made
doing the two toughest jobs _ police chief and mayor,'' said
Richard Lee, a former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   DiLieto worked to improve the sometimes tense relations between
the city and Yale University and fought the development of suburban
malls, seeing them as a threat to the merchants of downtown New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   His administration took the lead in the renovation of the
Shubert Theater, Union Station and the downtown Chapel Square Mall.
It promoted the New Haven Jazz Festival, the Artspace gallery and
the Audubon Arts District, and saw the seedy environs of Yale turn
into a fashionable area of bistros and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be remembered for the walls he broke down, with all
aspects of the inner city and the college,'' said Jennifer Daddio
of North Branford, who came to City Hall Thursday to pay her
respects.
</P>
<P>
   John Sawyer, who worked in the DiLieto administration as a
development administrator, remembered the mayor's friendship with
A. Bartlett Giamatti, the former Yale president, and how they would
amicably test each other on the meaning of words. ``The only one
who knew more words than Bart Giamatti was Ben DiLieto,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiLieto was born in New Haven and graduated from the University
of New Haven and Yale Law School. He also attended the FBI Academy.
He joined the New Haven Police Department in 1948 as a patrolman.
</P>
<P>
   He served 29 years on the police force and was criticized for
his role in the department's illegal telephone tapping operations
in the 1960's. DiLieto admitted to authorizing one of the illegal
taps when he was police chief.
</P>
<P>
   DiLieto was a defendant in a suit in which the city agreed to
pay $1.75 million to 1,238 people whose phones were tapped by the
police between 1964 and 1971. The operation was most active in
1971, when Vietnam War protesters converged on New Haven to support
the Black Panthers, eight of whom were on trial there in a murder
case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, after five two-year terms as mayor, he stepped down,
saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rose Greco DiLieto; four sons,
Biagio Jr., of Tryon, N.C.; Robert, of Branford; Edward, of East
Haven, Conn.; and Anthony, of Bridgeport, Conn; three sisters,
Fortunata Cicarrelli, Jennie Fiorillo and Eleanor DiLieto, all of
New Haven; two brothers, Anthony, of New Haven, and Thomas, of
Guilford, Conn.; and seven grandchildren. His funeral is planned
for 10 a.m. Friday at St. Bernadette's Church in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Williams, a West Haven resident who works at the salad
bar at a Stop and Shop near City Hall, said she remembered the
mayor's sincerity. She looked at the crowd at City Hall Thursday
and said, ``They say your turnout when you die shows the way you
live.''

AS BRAVES LEARN, PRICE FOR GRIFFEY IS STEEP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One insight into why Ken Griffey Jr. was not traded during the
general managers' meetings in Dana Point, Calif., this week comes
from examining the asking price: the Seattle Mariners, the moving
party, asked the Atlanta Braves for Andruw Jones, Kevin Millwood
and Ryan Klesko, an executive of another club said Thursday. He
said the Braves, who had been the favorite before the meetings to
win the Griffey sweepstakes, replied with a polite no, thank you,
pronounced themselves out of it and went about their business.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is understandable; he would replace Griffey in center
field in Seattle. But Millwood was the Braves' most consistent
starting pitcher this year and, at 24, is also their youngest, and
Klesko was their primary first baseman. Thus, the Braves' reaction
was similar to that of the Cincinnati Reds, whose general manager,
Jim Bowden, tried diligently this week to find the right
combination but could not induce Pat Gillick to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, the Reds, St. Louis and Houston are the only teams
that have acknowledged talking to the Mariners about Griffey, but a
baseball official said Thursday that he understood two others were
involved _ Boston and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the third and final trade made at the meetings, the Toronto
Blue Jays showed Thursday how far the value of a former Cy Young
award winner had plunged. They traded Pat Hentgen to the St. Louis
Cardinals and added a second pitcher, Paul Spoljaric, for a package
of three players, none a front-liner. The Blue Jays received Lance
Painter, a journeyman relief pitcher; Alberto Castillo, a backup
catcher, and Matt DeWitt, a minor league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen won the Cy Young as a 20-game winner in 1996, edging the
Yankees' Andy Pettitte, a 21-game winner. But Hentgen has won 38
games in the three seasons since, falling to an 11-12 record this
year.

<P>
   Boggs Retires With 3,010 Hits
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs is the most recent player to reach 3,000 hits, and
now he is the most recent 3,000-hit player to retire. After 18
years, Boggs put aside his Tampa Bay uniform Thursday for a job in
the Devil Rays' front office in which he will scout and evaluate
young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an easy decision,'' Boggs said at a news conference
in St. Petersburg, Fla., ``because an athlete can always look in
the mirror and say OK, I can still play. Deep down inside, probably
I thought I still could. But why not go out out on top? I've always
said, `I'll never embarrass myself in this game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs finishes his career with 3,010 hits. When he reached 3,000
on Aug. 7, he became the only one of 23 players to do it with a
home run. Only 118 of his hits were home runs. Although he played a
career-low 90 games last season, he batted .301, marking the 15th
season he finished with a .300 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   He won six American League batting titles and is the only player
in this century with seven successive 200-hit seasons. He played
his first 11 seasons with Boston, the next five with the Yankees
and the last two with the Devil Rays in his hometown.

   One insight into why Ken Griffey Jr. was not traded during the
general managers' meetings in Dana Point, Calif., this week comes
from examining the asking price: the Seattle Mariners, the moving
party, asked the Atlanta Braves for Andruw Jones, Kevin Millwood
and Ryan Klesko, an executive of another club said Thursday. He
said the Braves, who had been the favorite before the meetings to
win the Griffey sweepstakes, replied with a polite no, thank you,
pronounced themselves out of it and went about their business.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is understandable; he would replace Griffey in center
field in Seattle. But Millwood was the Braves' most consistent
starting pitcher this year and, at 24, is also their youngest, and
Klesko was their primary first baseman. Thus, the Braves' reaction
was similar to that of the Cincinnati Reds, whose general manager,
Jim Bowden, tried diligently this week to find the right
combination but could not induce Pat Gillick to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, the Reds, St. Louis and Houston are the only teams
that have acknowledged talking to the Mariners about Griffey, but a
baseball official said Thursday that he understood two others were
involved _ Boston and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the third and final trade made at the meetings, the Toronto
Blue Jays showed Thursday how far the value of a former Cy Young
award winner had plunged. They traded Pat Hentgen to the St. Louis
Cardinals and added a second pitcher, Paul Spoljaric, for a package
of three players, none a front-liner. The Blue Jays received Lance
Painter, a journeyman relief pitcher; Alberto Castillo, a backup
catcher, and Matt DeWitt, a minor league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen won the Cy Young as a 20-game winner in 1996, edging the
Yankees' Andy Pettitte, a 21-game winner. But Hentgen has won 38
games in the three seasons since, falling to an 11-12 record this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs Retires With 3,010 Hits
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs is the most recent player to reach 3,000 hits, and
now he is the most recent 3,000-hit player to retire. After 18
years, Boggs put aside his Tampa Bay uniform Thursday for a job in
the Devil Rays' front office in which he will scout and evaluate
young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an easy decision,'' Boggs said at a news conference
in St. Petersburg, Fla., ``because an athlete can always look in
the mirror and say OK, I can still play. Deep down inside, probably
I thought I still could. But why not go out out on top? I've always
said, `I'll never embarrass myself in this game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs finishes his career with 3,010 hits. When he reached 3,000
on Aug. 7, he became the only one of 23 players to do it with a
home run. Only 118 of his hits were home runs. Although he played a
career-low 90 games last season, he batted .301, marking the 15th
season he finished with a .300 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   He won six American League batting titles and is the only player
in this century with seven successive 200-hit seasons. He played
his first 11 seasons with Boston, the next five with the Yankees
and the last two with the Devil Rays in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Williams Honored
</P>
<P>
   Without Mo Vaughn, whom they let leave as a free agent a year
ago, the Red Sox were expected to fire popguns instead of bazookas
and finish well down in the standing this season. But they won the
American League wild-card spot. For his role in the Red Sox
success, Jimy Williams was named AL manager of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-member panel of the Baseball Writers Association of
America gave Williams 20 first-place votes and a total of 115
points. Art Howe of Oakland finished second with 5 and 85, Joe
Torre of the Yankees third with 21 points, Johnny Oates of Texas
fourth with 1 and 18 and Mike Hargrove of Cleveland fifth with 2
and 13.

OPINION CALLS INDEPENDENT WEB SITES VOLUNTEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators said on Thursday that Web sites created by
independent supporters of a candidate do not count as campaign
contributions, partly clearing a murky area of election law.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission said it would consider homemade
Web sites to be a form of volunteer activity. Links from an
independent site to an official campaign site are also not
considered contributions unless the manager of the independent site
normally charged for links, the commission said in an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion was a response to an inquiry from the presidential
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The Bush campaign raised
the questions out of concern that if links and Web sites built by
supporters qualify as contributions, then those expenses could
cause the campaign to be fined for exceeding contribution limits.
The Bush staff had been discouraging supporters from building such
sites in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a lawyer for the Bush campaign, called the
opinion ``a very sane and rational way to approach this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will allow people who want to help the campaign to help the
campaign,'' Ginsberg said. ``It will let political participation on
the Internet gain strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also exempted individuals whose online activities
were unknown to the campaign, and the opinion stated that the
campaign had no obligation to police the Internet to track that
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tracked the commission's approach to Internet
campaigning said the decision shows a more relaxed approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news for us,'' said Michele Hoferitza of Syracuse,
Utah, who has organized a group of Web sites built by Bush
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   While the opinion makes clear that campaigns are not responsible
for the Internet activities of supporters, the legal status of
those same people who create sites encouraging the election or
defeat of a candidate remains uncertain. In past interpretations,
the commission has ruled that such people could be required to
register as political action committees if they spend at least
$250. That issue remained beyond the scope of the questions placed
before the commission by the Bush committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have yet to address the individual who is doing this and
spending large sums of money,'' said Joe Sandler, a Democratic
lawyer who specialized in election law. From the perspective of the
commission, Sandler said, ``some guy sitting at home sending e-mail
or building a home page, we're going to treat him as a volunteer
and not worry about.''

TALKS ON CHINA TRADE DEAL IN PERIL, U.S. SIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update and rewrite throughout; totally reverses angle of
earlier story.)  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ American officials expressed a sudden pessimism Friday
that they could reach a long-sought deal to get China into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a curt statement issued to reporters Friday morning, Charlene
Barshefsky, the chief negotiator for the United States, said: ``We
came hoping to make progress. We are discouraged that progress has
not been made at this point. The clock has nearly run out.''
</P>
<P>
   The turn came the morning after Chinese officials asked
President Clinton's negotiators to remain in Beijing at least one
more day to continue discussions on how far China must open its
markets to qualify for membership in the global trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before they issued the statement, American officials
had sounded upbeat about the previous two days of talks here, which
they described as far more detailed and substantive than any
conducted with the Chinese in many months.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Ms. Barshefsky issued the
severe statement as a last-minute pressure tactic or whether the
talks were collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks this week, after detailed discussions of
specific trade issues in working groups, the United States
presented China with an overall package of proposals. Earlier
Friday, American officials expressed frustration with delays in the
Chinese response, which may have led to the dramatic public
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have all along been reluctant to lower tariffs and
open industries to foreign ownership as fast as the United States
and other Western countries demanded, especially fearing the
short-term unemployment and dislocations that outside competition
could bring.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, a senior government economist, Ji
Chongwei, said: ``If the United States can lower its demands this
time, then there is likely to be an agreement. I hope the United
States can be patient and understand the reality in China, instead
of imposing excessive demands.''
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton is under pressure from Congress and
American companies to hold China to stringent requirements for
opening its markets, as well as to protect American textile
producers from sudden increases in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   Up to Friday morning, both sides in the talks had been
tight-lipped. Clinton, speaking at the White House on Thursday,
said: ``When I know we have got an agreement or whether we haven't,
I'll let you know.'' Clinton was described by aides as deeply
involved in the talks, which are being held here by Ms. Barshefsky
and the director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fumbling efforts, China and the United States,
for political as well as economic reasons, now wanted to achieve
China's entry into the WTO, which sets trade rules and adjudicates
trade disputes among countries. A breakdown now would probably cast
a sour note in bilateral relations, as China accuses the United
States of holding it to punitive standards.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was nearly struck in April, but President Clinton decided
that China's concessions at the time were insufficient to pass
congressional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Now the negotiations appear to be down to a handful of major
issues, including the rights of American companies to take majority
stakes in Chinese companies, American restrictions on the import of
Chinese textiles and questions about whether the United States
could unilaterally ban some Chinese products if it concludes that
China is violating its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, staff-level working groups met here on specific
topics, such as the right of foreign businesses to invest in _ and
take control of _ Chinese banking, telecommunications and other
companies. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji offered such openings in
April, but the Chinese government has been under pressure since
then to back off on some of the concessions to protect local
industries and workers.
</P>
<P>
   China hopes to gain entry soon into the trade organization _
which now has 134 members _ so it can participate in a new round of
global trade talks that begin Nov. 30 in Seattle. It must first
reach bilateral accords with major trading partners and admission
by that date is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the April negotiations, the American trade office
released a description of Zhu's concessions, apparently hoping to
build support among American businesses. The release did elicit
such support, but in China it caused a firestorm, in part because
some affected ministries had not signed off on Zhu's concessions.

   BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES DEFEND USE OF GENETIC CROPS
</P>
<P>
   Worried about growing resistance to genetically modified foods,
some of the world's biggest biotechnology companies have decided to
begin a campaign to counter their critics and combat what they fear
is a rising wave of anti-biotechnology hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centers on a technology that can alter the genetic
code of crops and create varieties that can do everything from
repel insects to create more nutritional foods. Some scientists and
environmental advocates, however, say the technology may have
harmful effects on humans and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ROOM FOR APPEAL SEEN FOR MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Although mostly solid, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings
in the Microsoft antitrust trial may have been so sweeping as to
leave the company room to chip away at them on appeal, some leading
antitrust experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agreed to spotlight its Internet products and services
within Tandy's Radio Shack stores. As part of the deal, Microsoft
will invest $100 million in RadioShack.com.
</P>
<P>
   NOVARTIS NOT JOINING BIDDING
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Novartis, Dr. Daniel Vasella, said that he
currently has no intention of making a hostile bid for American
Home Products but added that the fate of the company was far from
decided despite its merger agreement with Warner-Lambert. Many drug
analysts and executives had thought Novartis might try to take over
American Home Products after Pfizer made a hostile bid for
Warner-Lambert last week. But Vasella flatly dismissed that theory.

   WEB SITE TO PREPARE TAXES FOR FREE
</P>
<P>
   H.D. Vest, a small Texas money management company, says it will
let anyone prepare and file an income tax return free next year on
its Web site, no matter how much the filer makes or how complicated
the tax return.

   NASDAQ HITS NINTH RECORD IN 10 DAYS

   The Nasdaq composite index rose to its ninth record in 10

Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to
1,381.46, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.44 points,
to 10,595.30.

<P>
   SPANISH BANK IN CROSS-BORDER DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Banco Santander Central Hispano, the largest Spanish bank, said
that it would buy two banks in the Champalimaud Group of Portugal
but would not achieve its earlier bid for 40 percent of the group
because of stiff opposition from the Portuguese government. The
dispute was viewed as a test case for cross-border bank mergers in
the European Union.

   DELL PROFIT MEETS REVISED FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   After warning last month of an earnings squeeze because of
rising memory chip prices, Dell Computer reported third-quarter
earnings that met analysts' revised estimates. But the company's

L.H. STONE, 94, A DEFENDER OF 8 WHO TRIED SABOTAGE IN `42 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lauson Harvey Stone, a lawyer and civic leader who
was assigned by the War Department to be a defense lawyer for eight
Nazi saboteurs who were tried in Washington in 1942, died on Sunday
at a Brooklyn hospital. He was 94 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, a son of Harlan Fiske Stone, the chief justice of the
United States from 1941 to 1946, retired in 1980 after practicing
corporate law in Manhattan for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of New York City's Board of Higher Education, a
trustee of the Brooklyn Public Library, and chairman of the boards
of trustees of Long Island College of Medicine in Brooklyn and
Columbia University's Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was an Army major when he was added to the saboteurs'
defense staff in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before, the German-born eight had landed by night from
German submarines, some near Amagansett, N.Y., on Long Island, and
some near Jacksonville, Fla. They had orders, and equipment, to
blow up production and transportation targets. The Long Island
group soon ran into the Coast Guard, became rattled and gave the
whole plot away. All eight were in hands of the FBI within two
weeks of their arrival, and without doing damage.
</P>
<P>
   In July, their largely secret trial began before a military
commission, at President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's behest. They
were charged with being agents of the German Reich. During a
recess, the U.S. Supreme Court held a special session, at the
defense's insistence, to determine whether Roosevelt was within his
rights in keeping the case out of civil courts, and whether the
trial was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   During the session, the defense argued that the eight had made
their submarine trips simply to escape Nazi Germany and had never
intended to carry out the sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court affirmed that Roosevelt had the power to order
the military trial, and the military commission found all
defendants guilty. Six were electrocuted, and two were given prison
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, a native of Manhattan, received a bachelor's degree in
1925 from Harvard and a law degree in 1928 from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Jane; two sons, Harlan II, and Peter;
and two grandchildren.

LLOYD E. ROZEBOOM, EXPERT ON MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASES, DIES AT 91
</HEADLINE>
   (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lloyd E. Rozeboom, an authority on mosquito-borne diseases, died
on Oct. 31 at a nursing home in Columbia, Md. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Rozeboom was emeritus professor of molecular microbiology and
immunology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. His
research on how insects transmit diseases took him to Panama, the
Philippines and other tropical areas, and led to discoveries that
significantly affected worldwide control of insect-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Rozeboom was born in Orange City, Iowa, on Oct. 17, 1908. He
earned a bachelor's degree from Iowa State University and a
doctoral degree from Johns Hopkins University. After earning his
doctorate, he was an associate professor for two years at Oklahoma
State A&AMP;M College, where he studied the role of horseflies and
ticks in the transmission of anaplasmosis, a parasitic disease in
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Rozeboom joined the faculty at the Johns Hopkins School
of Public Health. In 1941, though, he was sent by the Army to
Trinidad to determine which insect species near the new aviation
bases under construction there were carriers of disease. He also
taught courses in parasitology to medical officers in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   From 1954 to 1955, Rozeboom taught at the University of the
Philippines and started a program on the filariasis parasite,
discovering that people were being infected with it by a species of
mosquito that also transmitted malaria. He then went to Calcutta,
where he studied how dengue and other arboviruses are transmitted
from insects to humans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Rozeboom was named an associate professor of
parasitology at Johns Hopkins, and, in 1958, he became a full
professor of medical entomology. He retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Rozeboom, who served in the Naval Reserve for 24 years, retiring
with the rank of captain, was president of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1974. He held a Guggenheim
Fellowship in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Mae, died in March. He is survived by a daughter,
Carol Wike of Boise, Idaho; a son, Kenneth Rozeboom of Crockett,
Calif.; four granddaughters; and one great-granddaughter.

A MODIGLIANI SELLS HIGH, BUT AUCTION FALLS SHORT OVERALL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Auction fatigue set in at Sotheby's Thursday night on
the week's fourth consecutive evening auction. The atmosphere in
the Manhattan salesroom reflected tired buyers' determination to
control the proceedings and not get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly edited hourlong auction ended with strong results,
but not as strong as the auction house had hoped. Sotheby's managed
to sell $144.2 million worth of Impressionist and modern art, less
than its low estimate of $150.3 million. Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's
chief executive worldwide, said it was Sotheby's highest total
since 1990. Of the 45 works offered, 36 sold.
</P>
<P>
   The sale's star painting was Modigliani's ``Nude Sitting on a
Divan (The Beautiful Roman Woman),'' a 1917 portrait in which the
sitter is provocatively sitting with her legs crossed. Three
bidders vied for the painting, which sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $16.7 million, just above its high estimate of
$16 million. The price was a record for the artist, eclipsing his
``Portrait of Jeanne Hebuterne,'' sold at Christie's last year for
$15.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's sale was a true test of the art market, experts
said, since it included more works expected to bring at least $5
million than any other sale at either Sotheby's or Christie's since
the peak of the late 1980s. But as prices rose, the number of
bidders grew noticeably thinner. Several times, the evening's
auctioneer, Tobias Meyer, seemed just to squeak past a work's
reserve (the secret minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the
auction house) to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was keeping a tight top on what they were prepared to
bid,'' said James Roundell, a partner of Dickinson Roundell, which
has galleries in both London and New York. David Norman, head of
Sotheby's Impressionist and modern department in New York, noted
that this season ``people don't want to jump in; they have a more
reserved approach to bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   While the sale lacked the single blockbuster painting that both
Christie's and Sotheby's had on Tuesday and Wednesday nights with
their $40-million-plus Picassos, some of Thursday night's offerings
came with particularly interesting provenances.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Modigliani, and several other works in the
sale, was Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan of Brunei,
whose well-publicized financial troubles forced him to sell some of
his prized collection. The trouble is, he had bought all of the
works on offer at the top of the market. Still, they were among the
best works being auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Modigliani, he was selling ``In the Meadow,'' an
1876 Monet that depicts the artist's wife, Camille, reading in her
garden. The painting was estimated at $16 million to $20 million _
cheap, considering that the prince had paid $24 million for it at
Sotheby's in London 11 years ago. Only two buyers bid on the
painting, which ended up selling for $15.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The prince was also selling Degas' ``Young Dancer at 14,'' a
posthumous cast from 1922 of a dancer with a creamed-colored
grosgrain silk bodice and a tulle-and-gauze tutu. In 1988, Prince
Jefri bought the sculpture for $10.1 million from the collection of
William Mayer Goetz, a founder of 20th Century-Fox, and his wife,
Edith, at Christie's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the sculpture carried an estimate of $9 million
to $12 million. Five bidders tried to buy it before it finally sold
to an unidentified telephone bidder for $12.3 million. The price
was a record for a Degas sculpture. Another cast of the same
sculpture, sold at Sotheby's by the Shelburne Museum in Vermont in
1996, brought $11.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Cezanne became the evening's second most expensive painting.
``Earthenware Jug,'' a still life of fruits and a pitcher from
1893, sold, but barely. Estimated at $18 million to $25 million, it
went to an unidentified bidder for $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cover art on the sale catalog was Monet's ``Three Poplars in
Gray Weather,'' an 1891 landscape painted at the artist's home in
Giverny. It is one of a series of 24 poplars paintings. Estimated
at $10 million to $15 million, it sold for $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Picassos were up for sale. None were of the quality of the
portraits that sold for $45 million at Christie's on Tuesday and
$49.5 million at Sotheby's on Wednesday, and they produced mixed
results. One of the evening's biggest disappointments for Sotheby's
was ``Boy in a Circus Costume,'' a 1905 gouache portrait of a boy
in a circus costume with his hand on his chest, estimated at $10
million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer opened the bidding at $7.5 million, and when few bidders
responded, he stopped at $9.2 million. The work was on the market
not so long ago: it brought $12.1 million at Christie's in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture market has been strong this season. Thursday
night, Henry Moore's ``Draped Reclining Woman,'' a bronze cast in
an edition of six in 1957 and 1958, was expected to fetch $2.5
million to $3.5 million; it brought $2.7 million from an
unidentified telephone bidder.
</P>
<P>
   At Christie's on Tuesday night, an earlier ``Draped Reclining
Woman'' from 1969 sold for $4 million, $1 million above its high
estimate. A smaller Moore sculpture, ``Mother With Child on Lap''
(1985), had several interested takers Thursday night. Roundell
bought it for $838,500, above its $700,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the bidding so often seemed thin, Charles S. Moffett,
co-director of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art
worldwide, said: ``If the stakes are high, people wait to bid. Many
of them said they never got a chance to put their hands in the air
because the bidding went right by them.''

FOX EATS UP KIMMEL N' BITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ CBS had Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has Jimmy ``The Geek'' Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   With a 19-6 record for his on-air NFL picks over the last six
weeks, Kimmel should be planning some sort of elaborate moon-walk,
herky-jerky, end-zone dance.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the former ``Sports Guy'' from KROQ-FM (106.7) who
continues to lumber his way through a pretty nice TV career would
rather smirk at the fact that, despite early predictions from the
critics, he's still on the air. His three-minute sit-com each
Sunday morning about 15 minutes into Fox's popular NFL pregame show
not only has made Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth
new targets of verbal jousting, but gets them out of the rut of
rehashing injury reports and forced opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picks are the only part I take serious,'' explained
Kimmel, who recruits the help of his cousin, Sal, a fantasy
football junkie who also lives in the basement of his Lake
Hollywood home where the weekly segments are taped. ``The rest of
it is funny for me because I'm this jackass on the show who no one
knows what to make of.''
</P>
<P>
   It only took a week into the season before Kimmel's bits drew
the ire of who we've been led to believe are the country's most
influential media critics. USA Today's Rudy Martzke, for example,
labeled Kimmel the ``worst hiring of the decade,'' which is
possible since Martzke's hiring at his paper occurred during the
'80s. The Washington Post's Leonard Shapiro wrote that Kimmel was
``mostly making a mockery of the valuable time being afforded to
him on an otherwise first-rate show.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel expected the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox brought me on to appeal to a younger crowd _ like 11-to-13
year-olds _ but these (critics) were probably sportswriters before
there was an NFL,'' said Kimmel, who'll turn 32 this weekend.
``It's a trend for me. They hate me at first, then I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   With the initial reaction, Fox pregame show producer Scott
Ackerson, who hired Kimmel based on hearing his routine during his
KROQ run of six years, started an online poll after the second week
to ask viewers to decide if Kimmel should stay or go. From more
than 10,000 voters at the Fox Web site, 75.7 percent said he was
worth keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``A critic can be a powerful voice, but the reality is that it's
just one opinion,'' Ackerson explained why he had the poll
conducted. ``I didn't believe what I read. And I didn't want to
have people who aren't in the demo we're looking for (males aged
18-34) here to lead the charge to get him off without trying to
find out if he was in fact working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured Jimmy would push a few buttons with his type of
humor. They'll be some who ask, `How can they do that?' I don't
think it's unbelievable. Since people haven't tried it before,
they're more likely to stay with what's safe and working. Making a
change is a risk, but that's what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has the Brooklyn-born Kimmel _ the Emmy Award-winning
sidekick on ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' and co-host with Adam Carolla
on ``The Man Show,'' both on Comedy Central _ been doing that's so
offensive?
</P>
<P>
   He gave his picks to the Fox set one week (when the crew was in
Dallas on remote) wearing !ital!only!off! a hat that said ``Howie
Can't Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hats he has worn have read ``Terry Is Bald'' and ``Cris Is
On 'Roids.''
</P>
<P>
   For Halloween, Kimmel dressed up in what he thought would be the
scariest costume he could find _ a Bradshaw makeover _ and
exchanged ``mamma'' jokes with him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he spoofed the network's upcoming bass-fishing show
by having a not-so-live trout give his picks on location at the
Kern River.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away this Sunday's plot line, it promises to put
off those who are squeamish around Three Stooges-type humor.
</P>
<P>
   From a ratings viewpoint, Kimmel's contribution has helped the
show to a seven percent increase for the first half hour over last
year, said Ackerson. While Kimmel turns the Fox attitude up a notch
with the wedgie-giving, chain-jerking frathouse banter, he's also
forced the studio crew to stay on their toes each week. Ackerson
doesn't tell them what Kimmel's piece will be about, so they're
seeing it for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the barbs are directed toward Bradshaw, who had
him on his KXTA-AM (1150) radio show recently for a very humorous
exchange, Kimmel says it's open season on anyone, including the
innocuous James Brown or even Weather Channel guy who comes on now
for his own segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never run out of cheap shots; there's a bottomless
well of them,'' said Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Left holding the tailpipe:!off! What did ESPN, The
Nashville Network, ABC and CBS do so wrong that NASCAR felt it had
to take a $2.4 billion bid from Fox and NBC and drive away with a
new six-year TV package?
</P>
<P>
   Probably nothing. It's just the same thing that happens when one
network takes a sports property that another network brought into
popularity _ it offered an insane amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN may have laid the groundwork _ it has more than 300 hours
of NASCAR stuff a year _ while TNN, ABC and CBS provided top-notch
coverage as well. But somehow the others put the pedal to the
metal.
</P>
<P>
   Fox (with its Fox Sports Net and FX channel) and NBC (partnered
with TBS) will split the NASCAR February-to-November season
coverage after coughing up about $400 million a year _ or four
times what NASCAR got from having each of its own 21 tracks
negotiate TV rights deals through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, which also does its first NASCAR race Sunday with the
Pennzoil 400, this gives it more non-NFL programming for the years
to come. For Fox, it strengthens the cable network exposure.
</P>
<P>
   As if ESPN isn't feeling jilted enough, Fox Sports News anchor
Keith Olbermann reported on Wednesday's show: ``Dick Trickle is
ours now, baby!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   Fox's scaled-back ratings for its Sunday bass-fishing telecast,
which probably means we won't have to worry about getting lured
into watching anything like this again. Preliminary overnight
numbers from the major markets released Monday had the show
weighing in with a 2.5 rating and 5 share, which was somewhat
impressive since that's what NBC had for its Saturday Breeders' Cup
telecast. But by Thursday's measurement, which factors in all the
other markets, the actual rating was down to 1.8, closer to what a
rerun of ``Diagnosis Murder'' would get on the Pax Network. New
York (2.8/6) and Los Angeles (2.6/6) were actually better than
average, but thankfully nowhere near the whopper from St. Louis
(6.4/14). &QL; 
The NHL slapped Detroit Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman with a $1,000
fine for his role in an altercation with a cameraman between
periods of the Detroit-Tampa Bay game last Sunday. The league,
however, didn't punish Detroit players Steve Yzerman or Martin
Lapointe, also accused of trying to grab the guy's camera and
threatening to spit on him. ``The truth is, I would never spit on
somebody,'' Lapointe said Tuesday. ``I would punch him first.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman's spin on why his Shark Shootout is leaving Sherwood
Country Club in Thousand Oaks after 11 years. ``CBS had a lot to do
with our move,'' Norman said this week. ``We couldn't get live
coverage on television while the tournament was on the West Coast
because of NFL coverage. With the football doubleheaders, there was
no way our event could be televised live.'' That, and the fact
Norman wanted to move the tournament to his backyard in Florida. &QL; 
Rick Reilly's new book, ``Slo-Mo!,'' and the fact it got a
favorable review in, of all places, the current issue of Sports
Illustrated. Forget the fact we couldn't get past the first 50
pages without feeling as if we were reading another rejected script
for HBO's ``Arli$$.'' But what about the magazine for which he
writes a weekly column giving it a big thumbs-up in a review? Is
that kind of a conflict of interest? What if the reviewer hated it?
Would that review have run instead, or would it have been passed to
another reviewer? If The Los Angeles Times sports section can get
away with giving up space to review its own company-published book
on Jim Murray without catching any flack, maybe this is just the
way things are done. &QL; 
A $49.95 price tag to watch Lennox Lewis beat up on Evander
Holyfield again. A $4.95 price tag would have been too much as
well.

 &HT;    Ohio raps 12 abortion clinics
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The Ohio Department of Health has found that 12
abortion clinics across the state, including the two in the Dayton
area, are operating ``illegally'' because they are not licensed to
perform outpatient surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The health department inspected 21 Ohio abortion clinics last
month on a complaint from a Cleveland-based anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors found that 12 are not licensed as ``ambulatory
surgical facilities,'' those that perform outpatient surgeries, as
required under a 1996 state law, said Randy Hertzer, spokesman for
the health department. The clinics were sent letters Wednesday
stating that they must apply for a license or contact the health
department within 10 days of receiving the notice.
</P>
<P>
   If the clinics don't apply for the license nor challenge the
state's finding in an administrative hearing within 30 days, they
could be shut by the Ohio Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The two Dayton-area clinics have been notified, as have four
abortion clinics in Akron, two in Columbus and one each in
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Toledo and Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the licensing problem, Hertzer said, the health
department inspectors found no evidence that women were in danger
of being harmed at the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion clinic officials say the state did a poor job alerting
them to the new licensing requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about this until (the health officials) came in
here,'' said Dreama Booher, director of the Dayton Women's Center,
which has been performing abortions since 1981. ``We wish we were
notified sooner. We are licensed by the state and have a
board-certified surgeon on staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Booher said her clinic will apply for the state license.
Officials for the Women's Med Center in Kettering were unavailable
for comment.

 &HT;    Trial of third man accused in Jasper dragging death focuses on
him as driver
 &HT;    By Jerry Jordan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Testimony in the murder trial of Shawn Allen
Berry, the third man accused of dragging James Byrd Jr. to his
death, centered Thursday around evidence pointing toward Berry as
the driver of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to believe Shawn Berry,'' Jasper County Sheriff Billy
Rowles said. ``Instead of believing him, all of a sudden there was
a big question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said in the beginning he thought Berry might have been
telling the truth during statements to officers, but as evidence
came in and Berry's statements changed, he began to think Berry was
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray is painting
a picture to jurors of Berry being a liar and the driver of the
truck that dragged Byrd three miles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Rowles and Robinson, prosecution witnesses included
three FBI agents and two Jasper detectives who collected crime
scene evidence; a nurse who drew blood from all three suspects; and
Mary Verrett, Byrd's sister, who described the clothes he wore the
evening before his death and her final conversation with her
brother.
</P>
<P>
   During Rowles' testimony Thursday, he talked of shoeprints in
the sand along the logging road where John William King, Lawrence
Russell Brewer and Berry had taken Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   King and Brewer have already been convicted and sentenced to die
for their involvement in Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said tracks in the sand made him believe that Brewer and
King were on the passenger's side of the truck, and Berry was
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Imprints of the sandals worn by King were clearly visible in the
sandy area where the truck stopped before heading back onto Huff
Creek Road where Byrd's head, right shoulder and neck were found a
mile from the rest of his body, Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's attorney, Lum Hawthorn, asked Rowles if it was possible
that King got out of the truck on the driver's side and walked
through an area that might not have shown shoeprints to get to the
passenger's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible,'' Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   As Rowles began telling of the gruesome sight of Byrd's body,
prosecutors handed out booklets to jurors containing photos of the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The group of nine photos discussed by Rowles showed Byrd's body
as it was positioned on June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first photo shown to jurors revealed that Byrd's upper torso
had fewer drag marks on the back of the head than the rest of the
body. Prosecutors said that was because Byrd was trying to hold his
head up and keep it from being injured during the dragging.
</P>
<P>
   Other photos showed Byrd's heels, head, face and elbows that
were ground down by the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   As jurors looked through the photographs, they showed little
emotion. One man on the jury was wringing his hands after looking
through the photos, and another sat with his hands clasped
together, resting his chin on his thumbs. Other jurors simply
looked stone-faced at Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said it appeared to him that Byrd's ankles had each been
secured by an end of the chain. He also said that Byrd's pants and
underwear had been pulled down before the chain was attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared that one end of the logging chain was tied to each
ankle and the middle was looped over something,'' Rowles said.
``That's my opinion. That's the way I think it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy, who has
said in previous statements that he thought Berry ``was the worst
of the bunch,'' said Thursday that the shoeprints had never played
a role in the previous trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important factor in this trial that he was driving,''
Hardy said. ``I think his driving makes him the worst of the bunch
on this night.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said he doesn't buy the story that King had threatened
Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill King had never been in a fight in his life,'' Hardy said.
``They just said a few words to him; Berry said on CBS that he
could have left. His whole defense is based on things that don't
make common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors introduced several dozen pieces of evidence during
questioning, including Byrd's pants, underwear, two shirts, wallet,
shoes and keys.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence from Berry's truck that was found along the logging
road where Byrd was beaten by King and Brewer also was shown to
jurors. Those items included several tools that had the word
``Berry'' inscribed on them, plaster casts of tire tracks, a ladies
watch, a can of spray paint and a package of Marlboro Light
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has not been discussed in open court, prosecutors
filed an amended notice of extraneous offenses this past week. The
notice outlines alleged assaults and other crimes by Berry.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1998 _ one month before Byrd was killed _ Berry is
accused in the notice of assaulting Christie Marcantell at the
Timber Apartments in Jasper. Marcantell is now assisting Hawthorn
in Berry's defense and has said she and Berry are engaged to be
married. The couple have a 21-month-old son together.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion outlined in the notice, Berry was again
accused of assaulting Marcantell while at her grandfather's home in
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the notice gives 18 accounts of various crimes believed
to have been committed by Berry from December 1989 to June 1998.
Prosecutors said the purpose of filing the notice was to attempt to
have Berry's previous criminal record shown to jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, prosecutors could wrap up their case, giving Hawthorn the
opportunity to present his defense witnesses to the jury. Hawthorn
has said on numerous occasions that Berry will take the stand in
his own defense.

EDITORIAL: PAKISTAN ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 12:
</P>
<P>
   After seizing power in Pakistan last month, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf has been disturbingly slow in presenting his timetable
for a restoration of democracy. This week his military government
took an alarming step backward by filing charges of treason,
hijacking and kidnapping against the ousted prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif. A conviction could lead to a death sentence. Executing
Sharif would undercut the chances for progress in Pakistan and
poison relations with the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan would do well to heed the lessons of one of the darkest
chapters of its recent history. In the nation's last military coup,
Pakistani generals overthrew Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and later tried
him on murder charges. Bhutto was hanged in 1979, provoking
worldwide condemnation and a backlash at home. A decade later,
partly as a result, Pakistanis voted Bhutto's daughter, Benazir,
into power. She is now in self-imposed exile pending corruption
charges against her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the latest allegations against Sharif is murky.
Musharraf asserts that the coup was inspired by the prime
minister's efforts to remove him as the nation's military chief.
The specific provocation, he says, was an order by Sharif's
government blocking the general's commercial plane from landing in
Karachi, a move he likens to kidnapping and threatening his life.
So far no evidence has emerged that Sharif or the others charged in
this case personally ordered the diversion of the plane. At a
minimum, Pakistan needs to guarantee that Sharif and the others are
given a fair trial, with full access to lawyers and the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's strategy is becoming all too clear. If elections are
held soon, Sharif and Ms. Bhutto will once again be the most likely
winners, since they are the only politicians who preside over big
political organizations. Musharraf apparently wants to make sure
that neither is on the scene if elections occur. He is allowing the
corruption charges to proceed against Ms. Bhutto and is also
pressing a corruption investigation against Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that there is reason to pursue corruption charges
against both politicians. Indeed, Musharraf's pledge to rid
Pakistani politics of its systemic thievery was greeted positively
even by his critics. But any investigation cannot become an excuse
for rushing a political rival to execution.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has shown some willingness to listen to his critics,
most notably by withdrawing troops who were stationed near the
border with India to ease military tensions there. Nevertheless
President Clinton, who is visiting the subcontinent next year but
has reportedly all but ruled out stopping in Pakistan, must make
clear that the United States will not tolerate savagely punitive
behavior by the generals, especially those who declare that they
espouse democracy and justice. &QL;
