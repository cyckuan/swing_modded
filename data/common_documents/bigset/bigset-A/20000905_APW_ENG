<HEADLINE> Austin Powers Car, Speed Racer Sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ind. (AP) -- An Austin Powers ''Shagmobile'' and a
prototype of the futuristic Mach 5 from the 1960s cartoon ''Speed
Racer'' were sold at auction for $225,000 to the founder of a Los
Angeles auto museum.
</P>
<P>
   The cars topped the list of celebrity wheels sold at the 30th
annual Kruse International Auto Auction, the company announced
Monday. More than 5,000 vehicle were to be auctioned off during the
weeklong event, which ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other vehicles: The 1990 Chevrolet Lumina driven by
Tom Cruise in the movie ''Days of Thunder'' sold for $38,000, a
bulletproof Chevrolet Suburban made for Sylvester Stallone went for
$31,500, and Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland
Sanders' 1939 Lincoln limousine went for $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Mach 5 ''Speed Racer'' prototype, complete with a hydraulic
system for jumping and swinging saw-blade cutters for chopping down
obstacles, was built last year and sold during the auction to
benefit the Child Safety Network.
</P>
<P>
   ''This car is sure to bring back childhood memories for those
who watched the show as well as pique the curiosity of younger
automobile enthusiasts,'' said former publishing magnate Robert E.
Petersen.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old chairman emeritus of Petersen Publishing Co. led
the drive to start the 5-year-old museum. He and his wife have
provided more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen paid $180,000 for the ''Speed Racer'' car and $45,000
for the 1998 Volkswagen Beetle that Mike Myers drove in ''Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana-based Kruse International is the world's largest
collector car organization. The company was bought last year by the
online auction company eBay Inc.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Three high-tech companies have teamed up to provide online
businesses with a common language for finding each other and conducting
transactions over the Internet. Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp. and Ariba Inc. teamed
up to create the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI)
protocol, which is due to be released at the end of the month. A formal
announcement is expected Wednesday. Under this proposal, each business would

Bush Taunts Gore Over Debates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Opening his fall campaign, George W. Bush taunted
rival Al Gore Monday for rejecting his offer of three presidential debates.
''All of a sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything,'' Bush told
a Labor Day rally. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney together opened a campaign
push through six Midwest battlegrounds, with Illinois and Michigan first. The
Gore campaign held open the possibility of negotiations over three more widely

Montana Land Reopening

<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Nearly 20 million acres of forests and grasslands in
Montana will reopen to the public tomorrow because cool, rainy weather and
increasing numbers of firefighters have helped to lessen the danger posed by
wildfires, state and federal officials announced. The U.S. Forest Service said
Monday it was lifting closures on all national forest land in the central,
northwest and southwest areas of Montana -- those hit hardest by this summer's
wildfires. There were some exceptions to the reopenings, and fire-danger
restrictions such as limiting campfires and smoking to designated areas and
restrictions on off-road vehicles remained in force.

Report: Gulf Air Jet Didn't Slow Down

sea off Bahrain, killing all 143 people aboard, failed to slow down during his
landing attempts or gain altitude afterward, despite warnings from his co-pilot
and cockpit alarms that the plane was moving too fast, investigators said
Monday. The actions described by investigators indicated the crew was having
trouble controlling the plane and that it appeared to have accelerated rather
than reduced speed after the warnings. Those problems could be attributed to the
control systems, the crew's abilities or a combination of both, according to Jim
Burnett, a U.S. aviation expert not involved in the probe.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Vow To Work on Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The leaders of Japan and Russia failed to resolve a
decades-old territorial dispute in two days of talks, but promised
Tuesday to keep up negotiations toward completing a World War II
peace treaty this year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the
disagreement over four Russia-controlled islands north of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We confirmed that we will continue negotiations for a peace
treaty by resolving the issue the sovereignty over the four
islands, based on all the negotiations in the past,'' Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also pledged closer cooperation in regional
security and economics, with Putin emphasizing that he wanted Tokyo
and Moscow to tighten their strategic relationship and ensure
stability in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope in the near future we will keenly feel that both
countries are vital to the other,'' Putin said at a joint news
conference at the ornate State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Mori-Putin talks this week were the latest round in a series
of efforts over the past decade to overcome the enmity of the war
and five decades of Cold War hostilities. Tokyo and Moscow
established diplomatic relations in 1956, but have never signed a
treaty ending World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The major roadblock to a treaty has been the dispute over four
islands north of Japan that Soviet troops occupied in the closing
days of the war. Tokyo is insisting on its claims to the islands,
but Russia has so far refused to relinquish them.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute mixes economics with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The islands -- called the Kurils by Russia and the Northern
Territories in Japan -- are surrounded by rich fishing grounds, and
the islands' location in the northern Pacific makes them strategic.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also see the issue as one of national pride. Russian
leaders are loathe to lose another piece of the former Soviet
Union, while Tokyo still smarts from the forced evacuation of
10,000 Japanese from the islands in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   While Mori and Putin held talks on Monday, right-wing extremists
circled the venue in black sound trucks, blaring martial music and
demanding a return of the islands.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has proved so intractable that many doubt
declarations that Russia and Japan will be able to conclude a
treaty this year. Moscow has pushed for signing a treaty without
resolving the island dispute, but Tokyo has stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said Tuesday that the deadline was not set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is not setting up a deadline, but that
both countries have good faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks this week made no progress on the issue, with both
sides outlining previous stances. Tokyo, for example, is pushing a
two-year proposal to allow continued Russian administration of the
islands in exchange for recognition of Japanese sovereignty. Moscow
has not accepted that idea.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, the two sides signed agreements including a
program on developing trade and economic relations, joint efforts
to aid the economic development of the Kurils, cooperation in
energy, Japanese assistance in dismantling Russian nuclear arsenals
and strengthening cooperation between the two nations' border
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was to leave later Tuesday. At the end of Monday's talks,
Mori presented Putin with a robot dog that barks out Russian tunes.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's PRI Appears Ahead in Vote  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   XALAPA, Mexico (AP) -- After stunning losses that cost it the
presidency and a key governorship, Mexico's long-ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party on Monday won a clear majority in
municipal elections in a core support state.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's elections in
Veracruz state, election officials said the PRI held onto most of
the seats in the state legislature and won 120 of the 210 city
halls, the government news agency Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   It also won back three key mayorships held by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI toppled the leftist Democratic Revolution Party in
Minatitlan and Coatzocoalcos, two of the most important cities in
Mexico's oil industry. In the coffee and farming center of Orizaba,
the PRI defeated the National Action Party of President-elect
Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position on the political landscape isn't for nothing,''
said the PRI's leader in Veracruz, Raul Ramos. ''It is owed to
intense work on the part of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Action Party of President-elect Vicente Fox won 31
municipalities, including the capital of Xalapa and the port city
of Veracruz. The party was leading a tight race in two others,
Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's largest leftist party, Democratic Revolution, won 23,
while minor parties won the remaining municipalities, Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was low -- 40 percent, according to estimates by two
major parties. Officials blamed heavy rain and a lack of
campaigning for many of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   There was also scattered violence in the south of the state.
Three people were arrested and at least 10 opposition activists
were injured in clashes at several polling places, election
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI needed a strong showing in Veracruz to prove that it
retained strength in at least one of its strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Recent elections have seen the party's power erode since Vicente
Fox's stunning victory July 2 that booted the PRI from the
presidency after seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the PRI lost the strongest of its strongholds --
the state of Chiapas, where an opposition coalition won the
gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI started losing its hold on Veracruz in 1997 when
opposition parties won 107 of the 210 counties. Many had speculated
opposition parties would gain more ground Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders accused the PRI of resorting to old tactics
to maintain power, and election officials admonished state
government officials for touting public works projects in the media
before the polls opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''This takes away from the transparency of the elections by
stooping so low,'' said Uriel Flores, a Democratic Revolution
representative.
</P>
<P>
   The state is governed by Miguel Aleman, a powerful, former top
executive of Mexico's Televisa TV network and son of an
ex-president whose last name recalls an era when the party ruled
almost without opposition.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo teachers won't rule out job action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Members of the Buffalo Teachers Federation
voted Monday to authorize their executive board to do ''whatever it
takes'' to secure a contract - including strike.
</P>
<P>
   The BTF, which represents about 4,000 teachers, and the Board of
Education are scheduled to meet Tuesday with a negotiator, The
Buffalo News reported. Any decision on a job action could come as
soon as Tuesday night with the action to begin Wednesday - the
first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers have been without a contract since June 1999 and
BTF President Philip Rumore said the latest offer from the Board of
Education calls for no pay increase the first year, a 1 percent
hike the next, followed by pay increases of 2 percent, 1.5 percent
and 2 percent the final year of a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are also being asked to work an extra two days a year
with no additional pay and the Board of Education wants retirees to
accept a cut in their health benefits, Rumore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very angry group of people,'' Rumore said. ''They
feel they have been treated shabbily by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers have suggested that they begin so-called
''rotating strikes,'' Rumore said. In rotating strikes, all the
teachers at randomly targeted schools would fail to report to work
on specified days.
</P>
<P>
   But under the state's Taylor Law, striking is illegal for public
employees. And for every day spent on strike, teachers would be
fined an additional day. The teachers have a strike fund of more
than $5.5 million in place.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing not to ''cave into BTF demands,'' Board of Education
President Paul Buchanan called the BTF action part of a strategy to
pressure the board.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Buchanan, an agreement may be close at hand on
back pay. That settlement would give the teachers $25 million,
although that issue is separate from the current contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that he assumes - and hopes - that any action the
teachers take would involve such things as informational picketing,
but not a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''There comes a point in time when the two sides have to
negotiate,'' Mike Eagan, a special-education teacher and a member
of the executive committee said. ''This is an inappropriate way for
public officials to act. They're not negotiating.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Hits Budget Issue  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Al Gore is returning to his core budget
message, hoping to capture the fiscal high ground in his bid for
the White House and paint rival George W. Bush as leading a charge
back to trillion-dollar deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is looking to spend the week burying voters
in tons of budget projections and fiscal arguments, betting that
the electorate is now tuned in enough to absorb such detail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's finally starting to focus on specifics, and I love
that,'' Gore said Monday. ''They want to hear specifics, they don't
want to hear personal attacks, they don't want to hear inside
baseball and political strategy. They want to know how it affects
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to offer a new wave of budget details Wednesday. In
the meantime, his senior economic aides were laying out a detailed
critique of Bush's proposals, which they claimed would lead to huge
budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   In their analysis, Gore aides assign numbers to various Bush
proposals and the latest projections of the nation's budget surplus
to claim the Texas governor's approach would create a
''trillion-dollar (deficit) problem'' over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is estimating the nation's
non-Social Security budget surplus at $2.17 trillion over the next
10 years if spending for most federal programs grows at the rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said the tax cut plan offered by Bush would
cost $1.321 trillion over that stretch, and another $249 billion in
interest earnings would be lost, setting the final tab at $1.569
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush has offered a $132 billion health package, $45
billion in new defense spending, $8 billion in new farm programs
and $7 billion for housing assistance. For his part, Gore's
proposals have included $500 billion in targeted tax cuts over 10
years, plus large increases in health care and education spending.
</P>
<P>
   While few details have been released, Bush also wants to end the
so-called marriage tax penalty, as well as shore up the Social
Security and Medicare systems, both of which will need big cash
infusions when the Baby Boom generation begins to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides challenged the Gore campaign's assumptions and
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has outlined a very specific and balanced
budget,'' spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ''Why should people be
expected to believe his (Gore's) math calculations of Governor
Bush's budget proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said similar reviews of Gore's budget plans shows he
spends the surplus as well. ''We welcome the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was offered at an awkward time for Bush, because
he's on the verge of announcing details of a plan to provide
prescription drugs for seniors. That's a very expensive proposal,
however it's structured. Gore, for instance, has unveiled a plan
spending $253 billion over 10 years. Bush has said he will focus on
a more modest plan to get prescription drugs for low-income
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prescription drug program he will offer will fit within a
balanced budget,'' said Bartlett. ''The credibility gap in this
campaign is with Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he would allow a relatively quick retirement of
the $5.6 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan he'll announce Wednesday, the national debt would
be lowered to $500 billion by 2010, and retired completely by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore planned to highlight that difference, but
arguing that ending deficit spending and wiping out debt has led to
low interest rates that have been one of the keys to the nation's
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore began to focus on his economic basics, he was taking
that message to key battleground states. He was flying from
Louisville to Ohio Tuesday, where he was scheduled to deliver the
speech Wednesday in Cleveland, with an intermediate stop Tuesday in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an affirmative presentation of my economic plan,'' said
Gore. ''It will certainly deal with what the surplus is and how it
should be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said they expected Gore to spell out no new broad policy
initiatives in his budget speech, but argued that the details of
his plan would offer a sharp contrast with Bush.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Talking Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
is trying to convince middle class voters in the Midwest that Al
Gore's plans for targeted tax cuts are better for them than an
across-the-board tax cut proposed by Republican rival George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Connecticut senator, was holding a roundtable
with some Illinois families at a local coffee house on Tuesday to
discuss the Democratic ticket's plans for tax cuts to help with
child care, elder care and college tuition. He was holding a
similar town hall meeting later in the day with families in the St.
Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's $500 billion plan for selected tax relief includes a
$3,000 tax credit for people who need or provide long-term care at
home, $2,400 to help poor families pay for child care and a
provision making up to $10,000 in college tuition tax-deductible
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut plan would reduce all income tax
rates, with lowest rate dropping to 10 percent and highest to 33
percent. He also would double the child tax credit to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lieberman told some 700 people, most of them union
workers, in Detroit that he would keep pushing for a place for
religion in public life. Lieberman is the first Orthodox Jew ever
to run for vice president on a major party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you see men and women as created in the image of God, then
you will not treat them as extensions of machines, as pure things
to take advantage of, and that is what the labor movement is about,
justice to people, fairness to people,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman raised eyebrows last week when he asserted in a speech
at a Detroit church that religious faith should have a greater role
in American public life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave kind of a sermon and some people objected to it because
I talked about the place of faith in American life,'' he told the
union rally. ''Some people say, 'Don't say that.' I'm going to keep
saying it because I believe that's what most Americans believe. It
unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman pledged that he and Gore would fight for workers'
rights, saying they respect working men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can say that the labor movement was built on values that
come from faith, that were enshrined in the Declaration of
Independence, all of us are created equal. Where did that equality
come from? It was an endowment of our Creator,'' he said.

Gore Hits Budget Issue
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Al Gore is returning to his core budget message,
hoping to capture the fiscal high ground in his bid for the White House and
paint rival George W. Bush as leading a charge back to trillion-dollar deficits.
The vice president is looking to spend the week burying voters in tons of budget
projections and fiscal arguments, betting that the electorate is now tuned in
enough to absorb such detail. Gore plans to offer a new wave of budget details
Wednesday.

   TOKYO (AP) -- The leaders of Japan and Russia failed to resolve a decades-old
territorial dispute in two days of talks, but promised Tuesday to keep up
negotiations toward completing a World War II peace treaty this year. Russian
President Vladimir Putin met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday
and Tuesday to discuss the disagreement over four Russia-controlled islands
north of Japan. The two leaders also pledged closer cooperation in regional
security and economics, with Putin emphasizing that he wanted Tokyo and Moscow
to tighten their strategic relationship and ensure stability in Northeast Asia.

Record-Setting Heat Continues in Texas

   DALLAS (AP) -- Record-setting heat continued to bake the region Monday as
northern Texas entered its 66th day without rain. Dallas hit 111 degrees -- an
all-time high for the day and the highest temperature ever recorded in the city
in September, the National Weather Service said. The previous record was 108,
set in 1980; the highest ever was 113, set in June the same year. Temperatures
have been 100 degrees or higher on 42 days so far this year, well above last
year where there were 33 days in the triple digits.

Bush Taunts Gore Over Debates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Opening his fall campaign, George W. Bush taunted
rival Al Gore Monday for rejecting his offer of three presidential debates.
''All of a sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything,'' Bush told
a Labor Day rally. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney together opened a campaign
push through six Midwest battlegrounds, with Illinois and Michigan first. The
Gore campaign held open the possibility of negotiations over three more widely
televised prime-time debates.

a parade and then a rally at the speedway in Louisville, Ky.

Montana Land Reopening
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Nearly 20 million acres of forests and grasslands in
Montana will reopen to the public tomorrow because cool, rainy weather and
increasing numbers of firefighters have helped to lessen the danger posed by
wildfires, state and federal officials announced. The U.S. Forest Service said
Monday it was lifting closures on all national forest land in the central,
northwest and southwest areas of Montana -- those hit hardest by this summer's
wildfires. There were some exceptions to the reopenings, and fire-danger
restrictions such as limiting campfires and smoking to designated areas and
restrictions on off-road vehicles remained in force.

World Stocks Are Mostly Higher
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- World stocks were mostly higher on Monday, with the exception
of Japanese markets, which finished down for the fifth straight session on
profit taking. The dollar was mixed against major world currencies and gold was
unchanged. A strong showing by technology and telecommunications stocks helped
most European markets close higher. U.S. financial markets were closed for the
Labor Day holiday.

   BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez struck out 11 -- and didn't hit anybody -- and
Nomar Garciaparra snapped a 15-game RBI slump Monday as the Boston Red Sox
celebrated Carlton Fisk day by beating the Seattle Mariners 5-1. Making his
first start since sparking last Tuesday's brawl with Tampa Bay by hitting the
first batter of the game, Martinez allowed six hits and one walk in eight
innings before Derek Lowe pitched the ninth.

<HEADLINE> Australia Plane Crash Kills Eight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A pilot and seven passengers apparently
lost consciousness and their twin-propeller plane traveled hundreds
of miles across Australia on autopilot before running out of fuel
and crashing Tuesday. Authorities said all aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the Beechcraft King Air 200 lost cabin
pressure minutes after taking off from Perth in western Australia,
causing those aboard to black out because of a lack of oxygen,
aviation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was similar to one in October in which two-time U.S.
Open golf champion Payne Stewart and five others died when their
Learjet drifted on autopilot for hours before running out of fuel
and crashing in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian chartered flight traveled 1,760 miles over six
hours along a fairly straight line before crashing near Mount Isa
in northwest Australia, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear as though the airplane was on autopilot,
certainly on heading hold and it would have maintained a constant
heading until the aircraft ran out of fuel,'' said Barry Sargeant,
deputy director of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Two planes took off from central Australia to track the stricken
aircraft, which was taking seven miners to the western Australian
gold town of Leonora, but both failed to establish radio contact
with the pilot, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Flying Doctors Service pilot Steve Patrick, one of those
pilots, said he was unable to detect any movement or light in the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane was slowly descending the whole way and then it
descended into the ground,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio. ''There was an explosion on impact and there was a fire
straight after.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of Gwalia, one of Australia's largest gold producers,
had chartered the plane.

<HEADLINE> Girl Accused of Murdering Her Mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- A 13-year-old girl was charged with
first-degree murder Monday in the death of her mother, who had been
stabbed repeatedly as she sat in her car.
</P>
<P>
   Je Taun Walters, 34, died after she was stabbed with a kitchen
knife Saturday outside her apartment in this northwestern Chicago
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Police filed a juvenile petition seeking murder charges against
the daughter after she ''made statements implicating herself,''
Sgt. Paul Rizzo said. He declined to say whether she had confessed
or if police knew of a motive.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager initially told officers she and her mother had
left their apartment to run an errand, according to police. She
said that her mother had forgotten something and told her to go
back for it, and that when she returned 10 minutes later, her
mother was slumped over on the blood-stained passenger seat, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The youth was treated at a hospital for minor injuries, which
she said she suffered while trying to pull her mother from the car.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said Monday that ''certain things just didn't make sense''
about the girl's account of events, and she had the types of
injuries that ''might lend themselves more to an offender than a
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't rule out that possibility that another person could
be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Police were alerted to the stabbing by tracing two 911 hangups
to the slain woman's apartment -- apparently placed by young
cousins.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Whalers Bring Home Blubber  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- By the outside world's standards, Kujiraya's menu
is as politically incorrect as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   In a boisterous atmosphere steeped in cigarette smoke and the
smell of beer, diners start off with such hors d'oeuvres as whale
jerky or whale bacon. After that, there's boiled whale stomach,
whale on a stick, deep-fried whale chunks, whale sashimi, tongue of
whale, whale fluke soup.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sanctions threats grab little notice here. Whaling ban or
not, Kujiraya and others are doing a booming business, cashing in
on a nostalgia among Japanese baby boomers who remember the taste
from school lunches, or younger people just out to try something
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get all kinds, from babies to old ladies,'' manager
Kiyohiko Tanahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sale of whale meat at restaurants and supermarkets has
made Japan an environmental outlaw in the minds of those who
question whether killing of hundreds of whales each year is in the
interests of science -- as Tokyo has repeatedly claimed -- or merely
an excuse to keep putting blubber on the table.
</P>
<P>
   And with a Japanese whaling fleet now plying the northwest
Pacific, the issue is threatening to boil over yet again.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in more than a decade, Japan's fleet has
since late last month killed two sperm whales and five Bryde's
whales, along with 22 of the much more abundant and smaller species
they hunt each year, the minke.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet is to return to Japan at the end of this month, and
head out again next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Joji Morishita, in charge of whaling for Japan's Fisheries
Agency, said Japan added the sperm and Byrde's whales to its catch
list to study their impact on fish populations in Japanese waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sperm and Bryde's whales together eat 20 times more than
minkes,'' he said. ''We need to study how they affect Japanese
fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Morishita said research indicates both kinds of whale are
multiplying sufficiently for Japan to take 10 sperm and 50 Bryde's
whales on its current hunt without endangering them.
</P>
<P>
   Japan estimates there are 100,000 sperm whales and 22,000
Bryde's whales near its northeastern waters, and that they are
eating so much that they are biting into the livelihoods of
Japanese fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision has not gone down well internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeline Albright has told the Japanese the
United States is deeply troubled by the decision to expand the
hunt, and said Washington, which lists both species as endangered,
would not hesitate to impose penalties.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the United States announced it would boycott several
meetings in Japan dealing with science and the environment in
protest at the expansion of whaling. Britain and New Zealand have
also voiced strong concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the purpose of the hunt is purely research, it should not
start with hurting the whales, but with observing them,'' said
Junko Sakurai of Greenpeace Japan. ''If you do research on monkeys,
deer or pandas, you don't begin by killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace and other critics argue that research is only a
pretext, and that selling the meat is the true objective.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't against the culture of eating whale meat,'' she
added. ''But most of the whale meat in Japan comes from the
southern hemisphere and the waters there are open sea. If the
international community is against hunting, then it's wrong for
Japan, as a member of the international community, to keep doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials here make no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   All Japanese whaling boats are captained by investigators from
the government-linked Cetacean Research Institute, which analyzes
data gathered from the hunts.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is also in charge of marketing the meat and other
byproducts, such as oils used in cosmetics and perfume, once the
data are collected. The proceeds help fund the research.
</P>
<P>
   The sales average about $27-36 million a year, according to
Morishita. Most of the meat comes from minkes, 400 of which
Japanese whalers killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   An adult minke would bring the equivalent of about $100,000 on
the market. Most expensive is its fluke, at about $40 a pound,
while red meat fetches around $20 a pound. Kujiyara's whale dishes
are expensive, but not outrageously so, at $20 for lunch and $40 or
more for a full-course dinner.
</P>
<P>
   IWC rules, officials say, require the meat and byproducts of
whales killed for research to be processed commercially, because of
a stipulation against merely wasting the whale.
</P>
<P>
   The research ''is not a 'loophole' or 'illegal' or 'commercial
whaling in disguise' as the anti-whaling rhetoric suggests,'' said
Masayuki Komatsu, a senior fisheries official.
</P>
<P>
   Komatsu says the U.S. measures are tantamount to India
threatening sanctions on the United States for eating beef: ''A
provocative and inappropriate attempt to impose values on others by
force.''

<HEADLINE> Argentina President in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- With a vote-buying scandal brewing at home,
Argentina's embattled president left on an 11-day political trip
that is being billed as a chance to hoist the country out of its
recession.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua arrived in Mexico on Monday, where
he was to meet with President Ernesto Zedillo and President-elect
Vicente Fox for informal talks about commercial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been interested for the past two years in an alliance
with Mercosur, the Latin American free trade bloc made up of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Bolivia and Chile are
associated members.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua will also visit Canada, China and the United States,
where he will attend the United Nations Millennium Summit and meet
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, showing signs of emerging from a 16-month recession,
is seeking new markets for its exports, particularly in China. De
la Rua also may hope to encourage investment in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua leaves behind a federal investigation of accusations
that his administration bribed a string of senators with hundreds
of thousands of dollars to ensure passage of a labor reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Carlos Liporaci has demanded eight senators be stripped of
their congressional immunity so they can be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   It was unlikely De la Rua and Mexican officials would discuss
the case of former intelligence officer Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, who
has been implicated in Argentina's so-called ''dirty war'' against
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo, wanted by criminal judges in Spain, France and Italy
for alleged human rights abuses during the 1970s and early 1980s,
was arrested Aug. 24 in Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> Man Portrays Presidents' Wives  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN DIMAURO
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Florence Kling Harding was the first woman
to vote for her husband in a presidential election. She enjoyed
entertaining at the White House. And she loved to wear black.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Schermer knows her style well: nose-pinching spectacles, a
black choker, white blouse, black jacket and a long black skirt
with matching heels, gloves and hat. Dressed as the first lady of
the early 1920s, he recently guided about a dozen women through the
Saxton McKinley House, which houses the National First Ladies'
Library.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only is Schermer, 52, considered an expert at the library
located in the former family home of President William McKinley's
wife, Ida -- he portrays several women whose lives are documented
there.
</P>
<P>
	   Schermer impersonates about 10 first ladies, including Lucretia
Garfield, Ida McKinley and Helen Taft, earning as much as $150 when
he gives library tours.
</P>
<P>
	   ''He has a following. We absolutely love him,'' said Mary Anne
Wittich, who coordinates senior citizen bus trips to the museum.
''He immerses himself in the characters. If you listen to him
lecture, you can almost feel it in the air.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schermer became enamored with first ladies as a boy growing up
in the Cleveland suburb of University Heights when he saw a photo
of Abraham Lincoln's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   ''When I was 8 years old, I fell in love with Mary Lincoln,'' he
said. ''I read my first adult biography of her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schermer, a history student at John Carroll University in
Cleveland in the 1970s, started collecting photos, autographs and
other first lady memorabilia about 15 years ago. He has lent much
of his collection and about 400 books to the library.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1977, he joined the Brigade of the American Revolution and
participated in re-enactments as a British soldier. He gave
speeches to students and social organizations about the war and
historical figures, including first ladies. But it wasn't
originally his idea to actually dress as a president's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   ''With my mother's help, I sort of came on to doing this sort of
thing,'' Schermer said.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother, who died in 1998, suggested that her son use his
expertise to impersonate first ladies. She taught him to apply
makeup, and accompanied him when he purchased his first costume: a
high-necked, long-sleeved black silk dress similar to what Florence
Harding once wore.
</P>
<P>
	   His debut performance was in 1993 for a women's church group in
Cleveland Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ''That was the first time I had a man walk into the men's room
and say, 'Excuse me ma'am, but I think you're in the wrong room,'''
Schermer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Above all, Schermer strives for authenticity. During a tour
Wednesday, he demanded to be addressed as Mrs. Harding and only
allowed references to himself in the third person.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Krider, executive director of the National First Ladies'
Library, said Schermer is her main source when researching first
ladies. She considers his characterizations a bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   ''At first it's strange,'' she said. ''But if you let your mind
go, it's really interesting. When theater first started, men
performed all the parts.''
</P>
<P>
	   All of Schermer's first lady characters have been outfitted by
Shirley Wolf, owner of Stitches in Time, a vintage and antique
clothing store.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I thought it was great,'' she said. ''It's not strange -- not
in my business. I thought what he was doing was wonderful because
it's educational. It's entertaining, yes, but you're learning
something. I find his program fascinating because he has a wealth
of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schermer said his hearing -- not his gender -- presents the
toughest obstacle in portraying presidents' wives. He wears two
hearing aids and relies upon lip reading to understand people's
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he hopes to add Grace Coolidge, who taught the deaf, to
his repertoire ''when I find the right dress.''

<HEADLINE> Two Hospitalized After Napa Quake  </HEADLINE>
By KIM CURTIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Even in earthquake-prone California, the
sharp jolt that caused millions of dollars in damage in the Napa
Valley caught residents and experts alike off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Two people remained hospitalized Monday, one in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 5.2 tremor struck at 1:36 a.m. Sunday about 6
miles northwest of Napa near the small town of Yountville -- an area
that seismologists hadn't even mapped for faults.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we know now, it's a previously unknown fault,'' said
Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park. ''It shows that we don't know it all. Mother Nature
still has surprises for us.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was probably an offshoot of the San Andreas Fault.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt shock threw Gary Price out of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We woke up and there was glass everywhere,'' said Price, 43,
who has lived in the area for almost 20 years. He expects he'll
have to pay at least $1,500 to replace his broken television,
videocassette recorder and other property.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate quakes can strike anywhere in the seismically volatile
Bay Area, geologists said. But the Napa Valley is far down the list
of places where they're expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody would have put a magnitude 5 out
there,'' USGS geologist Steve Walter said. ''It occurred in an area
of fairly sparse seismic activity. That whole region north of the
bay is much less active than the South Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter was three miles from the northern end of the
nearest previously known fault, the West Napa, Jorgenson said. But
the West Napa, although well-documented and considered active,
hasn't produced a significant earthquake since the late 1800s, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last strong quakes near Napa hit in October 1969. The
quakes, magnitudes 5.6 and 5.7, were centered in Santa Rosa, 35
miles west, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sunday's jolt shouldn't have been a total surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though that area north of San Francisco Bay is not nearly
as active as the areas right around the bay, it's not devoid of
earthquakes,'' Jorgenson said. ''Most areas in California within
100 miles of the coast have an earthquake history.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorgenson said the area where Sunday's quake occurred would be
researched and mapped and possibly given a name. It has the
characteristics of a strike-slip fault, in which one huge chunk of
land slides by another one, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the kind of quakes the San Andreas fault produces.
All these faults are offshoots of the San Andreas fault,'' she
said. ''If you took a board and ripped it vertically, you would get
a lot of splintering along the edges. Sunday's quake probably
occurred on one of the slivers of the San Andreas fault 50 miles
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The last similar-sized earthquake to hit the Bay Area measured
magnitude 4.8 in the Marin County town of Bolinas on Aug. 18, 1999.
That quake also occurred on an unrecognized fault, but was west of
the San Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated the quake caused $5 million to $15 million
in damage. About 100 to 150 buildings had structural damage,
including collapsed chimneys and broken windows. Seventy-one people
spent Sunday night in a Red Cross emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old boy remained in critical condition Monday with a
broken pelvis, arm and shoulder caused by 40- to 50-pound blocks
that fell from a fireplace. A woman was in stable condition with
leg injuries.

<HEADLINE> Museum To Show Film on Baja Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Swimming in the glowing blue waters of the Sea
of Cortez, Iliana Ortega watches giant sharks pass by. ''You know,
humans are much more dangerous to sharks than they are to us ...
but you must command their respect. They are always testing,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again the great gray shapes swim past on the giant
IMAX screen in the new film ''Ocean Oasis,'' which will have its
world premiere Sept. 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   The massive six-story tall screen pulls the viewer into the
film, featuring Mexico's 700-mile long Baja California peninsula
and the Gulf of California that it encloses.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Baja ''is like walking 1,000 miles through sand and
finding water ... it's an oasis for the heart,'' says Ortega, a
naturalist from Mexico City who has been studying the ocean life
there for years.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis for the heart it is, and much more for wildlife adapted to
the hot, dry land and cold, nutrient-rich waters that characterize
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sights in store for the IMAX audience:
</P>
<P>
   --Male elephant seals the size of trucks battling on the beaches,
smashing their great bulk together until the loser rushes off in
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   --Terns executing an exotic mating dance before ornithologist
Enriqueta Velarde. Tango music added to the film scores a bit of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   --Giant manta rays swimming placidly in the sea, allowing Ortega
to rub their bellies.
</P>
<P>
   --A seagull tugging sharply on the wing of another gull, which
seems to cry ''ow'' with each pull.
</P>
<P>
   --A whale surfacing gently beside a boatload of tourists,
seemingly happy to have then rub its skin.
</P>
<P>
   Naturalist Exequiel Ezcurra narrates most of the 38-minute film.
He's a man who clearly loves this place and wants to share it with
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The film was made under the guidance of the San Diego Natural
History Museum, with the aim of drawing attention to the Baja
region and raising money for its conservation needs,
producer-director Soames Summerhays said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government has been quite progressive in protecting
the area, Summerhays said in an interview, but funds are not always
available.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mexicans were full partners in making the film, said
Michael W. Hager, director of the San Diego museum.
</P>
<P>
   During development of the project Hager called in experts in
large-format film to discuss how best to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all said, find people doing research in the area and let
the public see the place through their eyes, so that's what we
did,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The large-format IMAX screens provide stunning reality to
moviegoers, but making these films comes with its own set of
problems -- such as a noisy 350-pound camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like steering a Volkswagen underwater, to get those
close-up, intimate shots. We made the decision early on we wanted
it eye to eye, for people to see it as if they were there,'' said
Hager.
</P>
<P>
   Added Summerhays: ''It took a lot of patience, accommodating the
animals to what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some little sergeant major fish along the reefs were very
territorial and became belligerent, pecking at the camera lens, he
said, but generally the filmmakers were tolerated well.
</P>
<P>
   Even the massive elephant seals ignored them on the beach --
though one making a fast retreat from a losing battle ran into the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   While Summerhays wants to raise consciousness of the Baja area
and its ecosystem, the film doesn't have a blatant conservation
message, simply letting the beauty of nature speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   After premiering in Washington -- where it will run for at least
six months -- the film will also have openings in Mexico City and
Baja. It will open at the San Diego museum next April when that
facility launches its own IMAX theater.

<HEADLINE> Spain Premier Predicts Long Battle  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain's prime minister says the Basque
terrorist group ETA and its supporters are ''Nazis'' and that
prospects are slim for peace -- or even negotiations -- with the
group blamed for an upsurge of separatist killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a long road,'' Jose Maria Aznar said in an
interview Monday with The Associated Press. ''We're faced with
terrorism, pure and simple. And in the European Union and modern
democracies of this century there can be no room for terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Aznar spoke upon returning to his Moncloa Palace residence in
Madrid after nearly a month in his seaside home in eastern Spain --
a holiday interrupted by funerals for five of the eight people
killed this summer in car bombs and shootings blamed on ETA.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victim was Manuel Indiano, a town councilor for
Aznar's Popular Party gunned down in his candy shop. The killing
brought to 10 the number of Popular Party councilors whose deaths
are blamed on ETA. Aznar embraced Indiano's sobbing relatives
during the burial last Wednesday in the Basque town of Zumarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had better Augusts,'' Aznar said bitterly Monday. ''I
hope to have better ones in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiano's death was the 12th since ETA ended a 14-month
unilateral cease-fire in December and unleashed one of its most
brutal offensives ever in what many see as a desperate attempt to
force the government into negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque
provinces in the north. It envisions an independent state that
would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
   ETA was particularly active toward the end of the dictatorship
of Gen. Francisco Franco and the first few years of Spain's
transition to democracy following his death in 1975. The violence
subsided slightly under the socialist government that ended in 1996
with Aznar's first election as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural
identity and language. For some, ETA's fight is a legitimate battle
for sovereignty. But the majority of Spaniards oppose their goals,
pointing out that under Spain's democratic constitution, the
Basques enjoy more autonomy than any other region in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terrorism is just another expression of tyranny,'' Aznar said.
''They are Nazis, those people who support terrorism in the Basque
Country.''
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire was ETA's longest in its 32-year-campaign that
has been blamed for 800 deaths. A single round of negotiations
failed to get either side to budge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never accept Spanish democracy or liberties in Spain
being sacrificed on the altar of some negotiations that might prove
justification for the terrorists,'' said Aznar, a survivor of a car
bomb attack in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does the possibility of negotiation exist?'' he asked. ''I
rule it out from the start. The day democracy yields to terrorism
it will be dealing a killing stab not just to this democracy but to
others too.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence brought an end to any political honeymoon for Aznar
after winning a second term in office with a landslide victory in
the March elections. At the time he was hailed at home and abroad
as representing a new and dynamic Spain whose centrist policies
were fueling a thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the country's Basque conflict is beginning to
seriously tarnish Spain's image and undermine Spanish morale.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar rules out any fresh initiatives and insists the government
will persist in maintaining law and order, boosting police
efficiency and seeking greater international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perseverance is what brings victory,'' he said ''Nobody has a
magic wand for a solution.''

<HEADLINE> Boyfriend charged with killing woman, 2 children in apartment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - A 23-year-old Yonkers man was charged
Monday with stabbing to death his live-in girlfriend and two of her
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Salvador Alvarez was charged with three counts of
second-degree murder in the killings of Patricia Torres, 28, Ashley
Dominguez, 4, and William Santiago, 7, who were found dead in their
apartment Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   After stabbing his girlfriend and her children several times
each with a penknife, Alvarez stabbed himself in the neck and chest
but survived, police said. He was arraigned while in stable
condition in a St. Joseph's Medical Center bed and was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the woman's children, Vincent Torres, 9, also was
stabbed in the neck and chest but managed to climb out a window of
the first-floor apartment and scamper to his grandparents'
apartment next door, family members said. The boy was hospitalized
in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez and the girlfriend he allegedly stabbed to death had a
history of violent domestic disputes, Westchester County District
Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez began dating Torres last year and soon moved into the
apartment she shared with her children, all from previous
boyfriends. Another of Torres' children, Rodolfo Torres, 10, lives
with his grandparents.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Opinion on Lee Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The twisting case of a Los Alamos
scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets has ensnared two
new and surprising disputants -- federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, whose bail-release order was signed by U.S. District
Judge James Parker, had his Labor Day weekend homecoming plans
canceled after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals superseded
Parker's order Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers planned to make another run Tuesday at the appeals
court, hoping to spring their client from the Santa Fe County jail,
where he has been kept since December in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had issued a memorandum explaining his bail decision,
saying the government failed to present convincing arguments for
keeping Lee jailed pending trial, scheduled for Nov. 6. Bail was
set at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer clear, Parker said, that the materials Lee is
accused of mishandling were the ''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear
technology, as the government contended.
</P>
<P>
   The government later filed a formal petition for a stay with the
10th Circuit -- after that court had already issued a stay, without
hearing from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court's decision even surprised Parker, who said
he had been about to refuse the prosecution's bid for a stay when
he was handed the 10th Circuit order. The defense, which had
arguments prepared, was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your honor, this isn't the way the judicial system is supposed
to work. It just isn't,'' defense attorney John Cline told Parker
on Friday. Cline had notified the prosecution Thursday of its
obligation to give him advance notice of any petition for a stay.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis, who initially filed
his appeal with Parker's court, said he had been unaware that the
Justice Department had already contacted the appeals court -- or
that the appeals court had acted -- until Parker read the stay order
from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Cline said Monday the defense would file a response to that
petition Tuesday. He said he received no response during the
weekend from the Circuit Court to Lee's Friday petition for
reconsideration of the stay.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Taiwan-born scientist, a naturalized U.S.
citizen, allegedly downloaded restricted data about nuclear weapons
to unsecure computers and tapes at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all 59 counts, Lee could face life in prison.
Supporters say Lee is being singled out because of his race, which
prosecutors deny.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had set strict conditions on Lee's release, including
electronic monitoring, video surveillance, a phone tap,
restrictions on travel and severe limits on the number of people
with whom Lee could communicate.

<HEADLINE> Series of Quakes Jolt Western India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Two moderate earthquakes and seven
aftershocks jolted parts of the western Indian state of Maharashtra
early Tuesday, causing walls to crack in a mosque and in houses of
several villages, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No casualties were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The first quake of 5.0 magnitude hit the city of Warna, 135
miles southeast of Bombay, at 6:03 a.m., the Meteorological
Department said. The second, measuring 3.5 in intensity, hit at
6:39 a.m. southeast of Warna.
</P>
<P>
   ''The earth was shaking and people ran out of their houses,''
said Varsha Shegde in Kohlapur, a city in southern Maharashtra.
''It lasted about half a minute or so. Then it was all normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some houses in the city were cracked, said state government
spokesman Prahlad Jadhav.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are quite used to tremors. This area is prone to them,''
said Shegde. ''But this was stronger than the previous one,'' a 3.5
magnitude quake on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Shock waves from the earthquake were felt in Bombay, India's
financial hub and the capital of Maharashtra, the Press Trust of
India said, but there were no immediate reports of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The temblors were located within a seven-mile radius of the
Tandoli and Koyana dams, but there were no reports of damage, the
United News of India said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Accuses West of Instigating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar went on the offensive Tuesday
against its critics over the latest crackdown on pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, saying foreigners are meddling in its
affairs and instigating unrest.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the iron-fisted military government accused
Britain's ambassador, John Jenkins, of overstepping ''universal
diplomatic norms'' by trying Monday to get to the house of Tin Oo,
the deputy chairman of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy
party.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Oo, Suu Kyi and seven other NLD party leaders have been kept
indoors under virtual house arrest since Friday night. No visitors
have been allowed and the gates of their homes have been padlocked
from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   In separate comments published Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt,
Myanmar's chief of military intelligence, accused ''two Western
countries'' of instigating unrest in the country. He was apparently
referring to the United States and Britain, which have blasted the
treatment of Suu Kyi and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are creating unrest in the country by agitating a handful
of disruptive and subversionist groups who will follow their
dictates,'' Khin Nyunt, the No. 3 man in the ruling hierarchy, said
in a speech Monday. It was reported by all the state-run
newspapers, including the Kyemon daily and the New Light of
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's government statement said a plainclothes security
officer blocked Jenkins' path to ''prevent the diplomat from
forcing his way'' into Tin Oo's house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to understand why a foreign ambassador was so
adamant to intrude into the internal affairs of an independent and
sovereign nation,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The statements indicated a hardening of the government's stand
in the face of international condemnation of its political
tug-of-war with Suu Kyi, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
The government said the restrictions on the NLD are an issue
between it and a local political party, adding: ''The people who
are involved are purely Myanmar citizens and not British.''
</P>
<P>
   The military rulers' latest confrontation with the NLD began on
Aug. 24 when security forces blocked Suu Kyi, Tin Oo and 12 youth
workers as they tried to drive out to the countryside for political
work.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to return to Yangon, Suu Kyi and her followers camped
out in the open near their vehicles for nine days before being
forcibly returned to Yangon on Friday night. Since then, the NLD
leaders have been forced to stay inside their homes. The government
says the leaders are not under house arrest, but have merely been
''requested'' to stay indoors during a police investigation into
the party's alleged terrorism links.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win met with a
group of foreign diplomats to justify the restrictions. Britain and
the United States were not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Khin Maung Win claimed that NLD youths had conspired with rebel
groups to try to smuggle five remote-controlled bombs into the
capital for terrorist activities in August and September. U.S.
charge d'affaires Priscilla Clapp, contacted from Bangkok,
Thailand, dismissed the claim as a ''malicious fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi has led Myanmar's pro-democracy movement since 1988,
keeping up her struggle despite six years of house arrest that
ended in 1995. The NLD won national elections in 1990 but the
military government has refused to hand it power.

<HEADLINE> CBS Reality Shows Compared  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hours before 51 million Americans sat down to
watch Richard Hatch win $1 million on the final ''Survivor'' last
month, a small plane buzzed over a house set on a Hollywood stage.
</P>
<P>
   It towed a banner with a message for the remaining inhabitants
of the CBS ''Big Brother'' household: '''Big Brother' is worse than
you think. Get out now.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the plea has been ignored. At the very least, the timing
of the people who hired the plane neatly illustrated the yin and
yang of the CBS summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' were paired in most people's
minds before each went on the air. They were CBS' twin attempts to
see if the so-called reality TV craze was real and if the network
could make some money with cheap, voyeuristic programming during
the months most TV viewers yawn through reruns.
</P>
<P>
   One show became the compulsively entertaining cultural event of
the summer, minting new celebrities and making television history.
The other is excruciating to watch. Most viewers wish ''Survivor''
didn't end, and can't wait until ''Big Brother'' does.
</P>
<P>
   How did one go so right and the other so wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Blame the execution more than the idea. ''Survivor'' gave us
people we could care about, a place we wouldn't mind visiting and
stories everyone could relate to. So far, ''Big Brother'' has
failed on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very much about the casting on the front end and creating
the environment in which the people will live,'' said John Murray,
producer of MTV's ''Real World'' for the past decade. ''Then you
spend a lot of time on the back end looking at the material and
figuring out how to tell the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray sympathizes, to some extent, with producers of ''Big
Brother,'' who essentially have 24 hours to craft programs from the
raw tape they've gathered in the house. There are days when nothing
happens at the ''Real World'' house, he said, ''but we don't show
the audience that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' creator Mark Burnett had much more time to craft
the narrative and create heroes and villains. Remember how annoying
Hatch seemed in the very first episode and how you itched to vote
him off yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had more in common with 'Dallas' than 'Big Brother,''' said
Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University. ''It was a good, old-fashioned
cliffhanger and soap opera. And it had a guaranteed payoff at the
end of every episode.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' had characters that Hollywood fiction writers
couldn't, or wouldn't, create. There was a black man who toys with
stereotypes about laziness. A politically incorrect Navy veteran
who spouts homophobic views yet aligns with a gay man. A caustic
female truck driver. And Hatch, who schemes his way to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hawk's tribal council speech, comparing Hatch to a snake
and Kelly Wiglesworth to a rat, was ''downright Shakespearian,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollywood writers are worried that these shows are going to
take their jobs away during a strike,'' he said. ''They also ought
to worry that some of these people can write better than they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' has some interesting characters: the combative
black man creating racial tensions, the former stripper, the
Midwestern wife whose marriage was teetering on failure.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather, it HAD these characters. All were among the first
few contestants booted from the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' castaways were sent to an exotic island where they
fended off, and ate, rats and insects. ''Big Brother'' houseguests
are in an antiseptic house crawling with cameras, fending off
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' characters swam to save their island futures. They

   ''It's like watching a hamster on a wheel,'' said Jeff Oswald, a
video technician from Charlotte, N.C. ''The environment is not
exciting. They've set it up so the only thing that could possibly
have any entertainment value is sex and conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   And since sex is still verboten on CBS, the options are even
more limited.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald isn't just bored by ''Big Brother,'' he thinks it's
cruel; that producers are playing mind games with participants in a
stressful atmosphere. He and some friends who met while chatting
about the show online took up a collection to pay for the airplane
that flew the banner over the ''Big Brother'' house. They've sent
subsequent planes, too.

<P>
   CBS isn't unhappy with ''Big Brother,'' at least not publicly.
Its ratings are more mediocre than bad and probably suffer unfairly
in comparison with ''Survivor.'' And, who knows, maybe the raft of
imitators to come will be even worse.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty Reports on Palestinians  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority routinely
arrests those who oppose its policies, creating an atmosphere
hostile to free expression, Amnesty International said in a report
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing an ''established pattern'' in a 15-page report, the
London-based human rights watchdog said: ''The Palestinian
Authority has detained dozens of human rights defenders,
journalists, religious figures, writers, government officials,
trade unionists and academics solely for exercising their
legitimate rights to freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty said it had chronicled 13 cases of ''prisoners of
conscience'' in 2000 so far. Many are detained without charges for
weeks or even months, it said; some reported being tortured.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Attorney General Khaled Qidreh said he did not
receive a copy of the report, so he could not comment. Amnesty
officials said the report was sent to Qidreh's office and other
officials a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, Amnesty said the PA has not responded to its
concerns. On the few occasions it has, it has justified detentions
on the grounds of ''security,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty suggested that the arrests create an atmosphere of
intimidation. ''Perceived criticism of PA officials and
institutions, in particular the president and members of the
various Palestinian security forces, is a dangerous area,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bassam Eid, the director of the Palestine Human Rights
Information Campaign, said the report appeared accurate -- and he
said conditions were not about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, it's going to continue, because human rights
are not on the Palestinian Authority agenda,'' said Eid, himself
the target of arrests in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists told Amnesty investigators that they now practice
self-censorship because they fear retribution. Others targeted
included clerics who had preached against regime policies, and
union activists who led strikes. The only improvement the report
noted was that human rights workers were no longer targeted --
apparently following heavy international criticism prompted by a
number of arrests in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent among Amnesty's case histories were the 20 influential
residents who signed a November 1999 petition that held Arafat
directly responsible for corruption in the authority.
</P>
<P>
   That broke a taboo against directly criticizing Arafat. Some
were jailed and others were placed under house arrest. Arafat
threatened to lift the legislative immunity of lawmakers who signed
the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Sattar Qassem, a 56-year-old political science professor
who had circulated the petition, was held for the longest period --
from Feb. 18 this year until July 28. The Palestinian High Court
ordered his immediate release on July 6, but it was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Such disregard for other branches of government was typical, the
report suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Arafat has failed to ratify a 1996 law passed by the
Palestinian Legislative Council that would guarantee freedom of
expression.

   PRATTELN, Switzerland (AP) -- A Swiss fireman has been arrested

said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old, who was not identified, admitted setting the
fires, mostly in wooden sheds and in the basements of apartment
buildings, beginning in September 1998. He was caught at the end of

<HEADLINE> Labor Party's Audrey Wise Dies at 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Audrey Wise, a Labor Party member of Parliament
who remained a rebellious left-winger as the party shifted to the
center, has died of a brain tumor at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Wise died Saturday at the home of her son, the family said.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected in 1974, but lost her seat in Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative landslide in 1979. She was defeated again
in 1983, but finally returned to Parliament in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Labor Party's National Executive Committee
between 1982 and 1987, she was prominent in opposing leader Neil
Kinnock's efforts to purge the party of the ultra-left ''militant
tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first term in Parliament, she co-authored an amendment
which forced James Callaghan's Labor government to link tax
allowances for the elderly to the rate of inflation. It was a major
defeat for the government and its Treasury chief, Denis Healy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chancellor went ballistic in Cabinet when he realized that
two mere backbenchers had altered a principal provision in his
budget,'' said Tony Benn, the veteran left-winger who was part of
that Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Wise had remained fiercely independent,
frequently voting contrary to the party line in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband John, a daughter, a son and four
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Friends Build Newlyweds a Road Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- While Tore and Hanne Sandberg were
exchanging wedding vows on Saturday, friends got busy building
their wedding present: a new road.
</P>
<P>
   The couple from Fauske, in northern Norway, bought a house 18
months ago but couldn't afford to improve an often impassable,
rough dirt track leading in from the highway, the Nordlands Fremtid
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So Tore's colleagues from a construction company turned up with
back-hoes, dump-trucks and graters to make sure the newlyweds first
journey together on the road of life was a smooth one.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the gift table, ... there were two pictures of men at work
and construction machines in front of our house,'' the bride was
quoted as saying. ''At first I didn't understand, but then the
tears came when I realized that we got a new road.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the road is just 200 feet long, it is now graded,
graveled and properly drained.
</P>
<P>
   The newest street in Fauske, about 620 miles north of the
capital, Oslo, already has a name -- Bridal Way.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-American Sentenced to Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- A Vietnamese-American lawyer has been
sentenced to death here for killing his wife, a court official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Dinh Xung, 60, of Los Angeles, received the sentence in a
one-day trial last Thursday in Ho Chi Minh City, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Xung has 15 days to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the sentence was not reported
for five days.
</P>
<P>
   Xung told the court that he stabbed his wife, Le Thi Thanh Xuan,
48, in a Ho Chi Minh City hotel in June 1999 because he believed
she had had extramarital affairs after they came to Vietnam to meet
her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel workers found Xuan's body in the room. She had been
stabbed 29 times. Xung was arrested in Vung Tau, 80 miles southeast
of Ho Chi Minh City, where he had fled on a hydrofoil.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Xung moved to the United States 20 years ago and
divorced his first wife. Xuan, whom he married in 1997, was a widow
with two children.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently eight other Americans in Vietnamese prisons,
according to the U.S. Embassy. Four more Americans were recently
released as part of a mass amnesty marking Vietnam's National Day
Sept 2.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Rejects Equality of Religions  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican rejected Tuesday what it said
are growing attempts to depict all religions as equal, accusing
some Catholic theologians of manipulating fundamental truths of the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that ''one religion is as good as another'' endangers
the church's missionary message, said the 36-page declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is true that the followers of other religions can
receive divine grace, it is also certain that objectively speaking
they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those
who, in the church, have the fullness of the means of salvation,''
said the declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, the guardian of church orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has made inter-religious dialogue one of the
principal goals of his 22-year papacy, but the document made clear
that for the Vatican equality refers to the ''personal dignity'' of
individuals and not to religious doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second recent document by the congregation warning
against abuses by Catholics in dealings with other religions and
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Italian media have reported the congregation also has warned
against the phrase ''sister churches,'' saying that it contradicts
the Catholic church's identity as ''mother'' of all churches. That
document has not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's document, and remarks by the congregation's head,
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, at a news conference repeatedly referred
to a trend toward a ''religious relativism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger said the ''principle of tolerance and respect for
freedom'' promoted by the reforms of the Second Vatican Council are
today being ''manipulated' and ''wrongfully surpassed.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't name any of the errant theologians.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding other Christians, the document said ''there exists a
single church of Christ, which subsists in the Catholic church,
governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it said ''baptism'' in other denominations ''tends per se
toward the full development of life in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of unity among Christians is certainly a wound for
the church,'' the document said, saying it hindered ''the complete
fulfillment of her universality in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, a complex theological document, was titled ''On
the Unity and Salvific Universality of Jesus Christ and the
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   It underlined that it was only reiterating long-held teaching,
citing a Second Vatican Council declaration that ''We believe that
this one true religion continues to exist in the Catholic and
Apostolic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's missionary activity has come under fire in some
parts of the world. During a trip to India last year, where he
faced protests by some Hindus, the pope called for religious
tolerance but said the church had the right to spread its message.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore, who is active in dialogue
with American Jews, said he didn't expect any problems from the
reiteration of the church position. He attended the news
conference.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Face Winter in Exile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Some 170,000 Chechen refugees are facing a second
winter in exile in neighboring Ingushetia, and increasing numbers
risk eviction from their temporary homes, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''No significant numbers of people have gone back to Chechnya
because of the obvious instability there,'' UNHCR spokesman Kris
Janowski said. The agency is ''digging in and preparing for the
winter,'' building a tent city for 12,000 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are signals that some of the Chechens might
have outstayed their welcome in Ingushetia, Janowski said. Over the
past week, he said, 26 people were evicted by host families or from
occupied premises, while another 216 face ''immediate threat'' of
eviction.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR is negotiating with hosts or finding alternative
accommodation in tents, Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops returned to Chechnya last fall to suppress the
republic's separatist government after being driven out at the end
of a 1994-96 war. The Russian military controls large areas of
Chechnya but appears to be far from defeating the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The small neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia took in
most of the estimated 250,000 refugees who fled Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The influx strained the area's limited resources. Aid convoys
will continue through the winter ''since it's unlikely that any
significant number of people will go back,'' while a project is
under way to repair the republic's crumbling water system, Janowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported that Russian
forces have lost 23 military helicopters in the war in Chechnya
since fighting began about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The report, citing unidentified Defense Ministry officials,
marked the first time the military gave a total figure for the
number of helicopters destroyed in the war, although some
individual losses have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of 23 helicopters would be a major drain for the
cash-strapped military, which rarely receives new weapons. Military
spokesman in Moscow declined to comment on the Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Russian officials decided this week to
move the republic's pro-Russian administration to Grozny by Oct. 15
from its temporary base in Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city
18 miles to the east, Izvestia newspaper reported Tuesday. Grozny
is the republic's traditional capital.

<HEADLINE> China Dissident Asks Clinton's Help  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In a message purportedly smuggled from prison,
one of China's most prominent political prisoners asked President
Clinton to urge China's president at a U.N. summit this week to
enact democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Wang Youcai appealed to Clinton to impress upon
President Jiang Zemin that he and the Communist Party he heads have
the power to bring about orderly political reform in China. The
presidents are to meet Friday on the sidelines of the U.N.
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mr. Jiang Zemin can establish democratic, constitutional
government in China during his term, he will be publicly recognized
as a great man by people in all of China and the world,'' said the
letter. If not, he will become ''an obstacle to China's melding
with the world and to its advance toward democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, if authentic, would be among the first from Wang
since he was jailed nearly two years ago for organizing the
opposition China Democracy Party. Dissident colleagues of Wang's in
New York sent the letter to news organizations Tuesday, although
its origins were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to dissident Shi Lei, a woman believed to be in the
Chinese police force contacted Xie Wanjun, a fellow Democracy Party
organizer who now lives in New York. She instructed Xie to change
his e-mail address because his was blocked by China's Internet
police, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, a typed version of the letter, dated Aug. 24,
arrived in Xie's new e-mail box. Shi said Xie believed the letter's
contents were consistent with Wang's ideas and he discussed it with
Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone, Hu said the letter's tone sounded like
Wang, but he never mentioned it on July 15, her last visit to
Quzhou prison, 120 miles from their home in the eastern city of
Hangzhou. However, she, said, their visits are very supervised.
</P>
<P>
   The letter carried a supposed prescript from Wang hinting at its
passage from prison: ''If this letter to U.S. President Clinton
makes it over the wall, it shows that the opposition force of the
China Democracy Party has already gained the active support of
democratic people within the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents in New York sent the letter to the White House and
the U.S. Congress, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
   Wang was a respected and effective organizer within China's
persecuted dissident community. A student leader of the 1989
democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, Wang
publicly launched the China Democracy Party in June 1998, vowing to
challenge the Communist Party's political monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Activists set up party organizations in 24 provinces and
attracted 200 members, according to New York-based Human Rights
Watch. But within six months, Wang and two other veteran organizers
were convicted of subversion. All told, at least 34 members of the
China Democracy Party have been imprisoned. Wang was sentenced to
11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of China's impending entry to the World Trade
Organization, the letter noted that it would be impossible for
China to use its current political system and ideology to block
change.
</P>
<P>
   The letter called on Jiang to end controls on the media and stop
trying to block the Internet. He also appealed to Clinton to
maintain political, economic and cultural contacts with China.

   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) -- Police dug up 2,530 pounds of hashish
buried in the sand of a beach at Spain's southern tip, authorities

</P>
<P>
   Much of the hashish that enters Spain comes on boats from

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower Tuesday, as investors
returned from a holiday weekend to a market with little news to
influence trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 28.49 to 11,210.29.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was off 31.67 at 4,202.66, The

</P>
<P>
   With no big news to provide a clear direction for trading, the
market drifted in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks closed higher Friday after a day of low-volume trading as
many left for the Labor Day holiday. Unemployment and productivity
figures released Friday, while containing mixed figures, seemed to
indicate that inflationary pressures are under control.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and
total payrolls fell by a bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the
month, the largest drop in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.

<HEADLINE> China Heaps New Criticism on Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China heaped new criticism on Taiwan's leader
Tuesday and warned that his refusal to bend to Beijing's demands
could lead to open conflict.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 100 days in office, Chen Shui-bian has moved
further toward formal independence for Taiwan and away from
Beijing's goal of unification, said Zhang Mingqing, a spokesman for
the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is extremely dangerous,'' Zhang said, accusing Chen of
lacking sincerity and flip-flopping on his approach to relations
between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, however, did not indicate that any new actions -- military
or otherwise -- were being planned. He instead reiterated that
Beijing would continue to scrutinize Chen's words and deeds, a
strategy announced soon after Chen won election in March and became
Taiwan's first opposition president.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang repeated Beijing's demand that Chen must recognize that
Taiwan is a part of China before dialogue can begin. Chen has
repeatedly offered to open talks with China but without
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei, a senior aide to Chen told reporters that Chinese
leaders have misunderstood the president's overtures but that he
would persevere in improving relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge the other side to understand the president's sincerity
and goodwill,'' the aide, Chen Che-nan said.
</P>
<P>
   China has threatened to attack if Taiwan declares independence
or drags its feet on unification. The sides divided amid civil war
in 1949, and there is little support on the vibrantly capitalist
and democratic island for unification with the harshly
authoritarian and economically developing mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at rare media briefing by the communist government's
top office on Taiwan affairs, Zhang denied reports that the Chinese
leadership and Chen's Democratic Progressive Party have a channel
for contacts.
</P>
<P>
   China will not deal with anyone in Chen's party, Zhang said,
until it scraps support for Taiwan independence -- something that is
part of the party's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   While snubbing Chen's party, China has attempted to pressure the
new president by building contacts with his Taiwanese political
opponents. In response to a question, Zhang praised a document
issued by Taiwan's opposition People First Party that rejected the
language of state-to-state ties.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that is expected to anger China, Taiwan's outspoken
vice president plans to pass through the United States on her trip
to Central and South America, a Taiwanese official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is expected to agree to Annette Lu's transit through
Los Angeles or New York Sept. 24, an aide said, on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Her trip follows President Chen Shui-bian's visits to the
Caribbean and Central America last month. Chen's 16-hour stopover
in Los Angeles drew protests from Beijing, which warned that the
brief stop could severely damage U.S. ties with China.

<HEADLINE> Expand Kids Health Care to Parents?  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House presented two reports Tuesday
that support expanding children's health care programs to parents
and portray the use of tax credits as an inefficient way to improve
the health of elderly Americans. The reports came out as George W.
Bush was spelling out his ideas to improve Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has supported a tax credit of up to $2,000 per family to
help low-income working people buy health insurance but one of the
reports, prepared by the White House Council of Economic Advisers,
called that an expensive method. The report favored expanding
existing programs -- an approach Bush's Democratic rival for
president, Al Gore, also supports.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush program would cover the cost of Medicare premiums for
seniors whose income is as much as 35 percent over the poverty line
and would subsidize the cost of prescription drug coverage for
seniors whose income is as much as 75 percent over the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear the program the Republicans and Bush have laid out
will not cover all the seniors who need a prescription drug
benefit,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bush issued the details of his program after a
Republican ad attacking Gore's health proposals started running on
television, Lockhart said, ''You always have to be a little wary of
a policy that went out after the ad went on the air. ... That
doesn't necessarily demonstrate a deep commitment to providing
prescription drugs for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   A study from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
found that allowing parents to apply for aid under the government
health programs for children makes it more likely that their
children will be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a White House review of various studies on the
subject concludes that expanding existing coverage or federal
support for health care programs was superior to offering parents
tax deductions or credits for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering legislation to expand coverage or
provide additional tax breaks for health care programs. Most
Republicans favor tax breaks, while most Democrats favor a bill
that would expand eligibility under existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most poor children are eligible for health care through either
Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP
was created in 1997 to help kids whose families earn too much to
qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. Congress
has been considering legislation to expand these programs to other
family members.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 7 million children remain uninsured, although they
are eligible for health care assistance. Leighton Ku, who wrote the
center's report, said some parents don't know about the programs,
while others don't take the time to apply for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, Hawaii and Tennessee, which expanded Medicaid
coverage to parents in 1994, coverage of eligible children 6 or
younger rose from 51 percent to 67 percent from 1990 to 1998, an
analysis of census data found. In states that didn't expand their
programs, the proportion of children insured increased only 3
percentage points to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you make the program broader so the parents can join or
maybe some older siblings can join then they say it becomes
worthwhile,'' Ku said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the District of Columbia and nine states --
California, Connecticut, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Rhode Island and Wisconsin -- approved or carried out
expansions to their Medicaid programs to cover more low-income
families, including parents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The second report, a summary of various studies compiled and
released by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, concluded
that tax credits would encourage some individuals to pay for group
insurance or even the more expensive individual insurance. But this
is still less of an incentive -- and is more expensive for the
government -- than expanding existing programs or using a
combination of the two, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach supports a tax credit of up to $2,000 per family
to help low-income working Americans buy health insurance and an
expansion of tax-free medical savings accounts that can be used to
pay for health expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore favors expanding coverage for children and parents and a
tax credit so uninsured people can purchase individual health
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ku said his findings support the passing of a bipartisan bill
proposed last month that would spread $50 billion across the
country during the next 10 years so states could insure parents
whose children are enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would let states set up insurance programs for
legal immigrant children and pregnant women, allow people leaving
welfare for work to keep Medicaid coverage for one year and expand
outreach programs to enroll more people. Those programs would cost
an estimated $12 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans oppose the plan. They would rather see the
government provide tax breaks so parents could choose a private
insurer. The measure fell nine votes short of Senate approval when
it was initially offered in July.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders Exam on Siamese Twins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British appeals court gave permission Tuesday
for additional scans on Siamese twins whose parents are fighting
against having them separated.
</P>
<P>
   A judge previously ruled that the twins should be separated to
give the strong one a chance at a normal life. If not separated,
the judge said both twins would die.
</P>
<P>
   The parents have objected to medical interference in what they
see as God's will.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, an attorney representing the Official Solicitor,
told the three-judge panel in the Court of Appeal Tuesday that a
pediatric cardiologist was joining a surgeon to examine the twins
later Tuesday at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester. They expect to
report back to the court by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the surgeon, from the Great Ormond Street Children's
Hospital medical team which has separated other twins, had said
there might be a need for further scans.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court requested a second medical opinion before
making a life-and-death decision about the fate of the
four-week-old Siamese twins.
</P>
<P>
   That request came Monday at the start of legal action by the
girls' parents to block a High Court ruling that would mean certain
death for one of their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert Johnson ruled last month that Jodie -- the stronger
of the twins -- should be separated from her sister Mary, who is
reliant on her sister's lungs and heart to survive. If they are
separated, Mary will die, medical experts said. But without the
surgery, both twins are likely to perish within three to six months
because of the extra strain on Jodie's organs. Mary and Jodie are
not the their real names, and the family has not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were born joined at the lower abdomen on Aug. 8 in
Manchester. Judith Parker, a lawyer assigned to represent the
stronger twin, said medical experts believed that she would not
face significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must look at it not that something is being done to Mary to
hasten the end of her life, but that something is being done to
Jodie in order to restore to her own integrity and bodily system,''
Parker told the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the parents say they do not want one of their children
''actively killed''.
</P>
<P>
   Their barrister Simon Taylor told the appeal court they had come
to the ''heartbreaking'' decision that they could not kill one of
their daughters to allow the other to survive as, in their view,
that was not God's will.
</P>
<P>
   They also feared that Jodie would face a life of suffering if
she were to survive and return home with them, where there was
concern over local attitudes to disability and no real access to
high-level care.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in Australia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With its pilot and seven passengers
apparently unconscious, a twin-propeller plane continued to fly
across Australia on autopilot for six hours before it ran out of
fuel and crashed Tuesday, killing all eight.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe those on board blacked out from lack of
oxygen when their Beechcraft King Air 200 lost cabin pressure
shortly after taking off from Perth in western Australia, aviation
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar crash in South Dakota in October killed two-time U.S.
Open golf champion Payne Stewart and five others aboard a Learjet
that drifted on autopilot for hours before running out of fuel and
crashing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of Gwalia, one of Australia's largest gold producers,
had chartered the plane that crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other planes took off from central Australia to track the
stricken aircraft, which was taking seven miners to the western
mining town of Leonora, but both failed to establish radio contact
with the pilot, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Flying Doctors Service pilot Steve Patrick, one of those
pilots, said he was unable to detect any movement or light in the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane was slowly descending the whole way and then it
descended into the ground,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio. ''There was an explosion on impact and there was a fire
straight after.''
</P>
<P>
   The chartered flight traveled 1,760 miles during six hours along
a fairly straight line before crashing near Mount Isa in northwest
Australia, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear as though the airplane was on autopilot,
certainly on heading hold and it would have maintained a constant
heading until the aircraft ran out of fuel,'' said Barry Sargeant,
deputy director of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Diana Bodyguard Takes UN Timor Job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard who survived the
car crash in which Princess Diana died, has accepted a job with the
United Nations in East Timor, his lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rees-Jones, a former paratrooper, was appointed deputy head of
security in the town of Suai, attorney Ian Lucas said. He arrived
in Timor on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's someone with experience of Army life and he will cope
with it manfully,'' Lucas said. ''He's just getting on with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver Henri Paul
died Aug. 31, 1997, when their Mercedes slammed into a pillar in a
traffic tunnel in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Rees-Jones, who has said repeatedly that he does not remember
the car crash, suffered severe facial injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, the 32-year-old has remained mostly quiet
about the events of that day, though he did write a book, ''The
Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he remembers nothing after Paul, who was legally drunk,
pulled away from the Ritz Hotel and sped toward the tunnel where
the accident occurred, with photographers in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Rees-Jones had been working in the security business in his
hometown of Oswestry, northwest England, before applying for the
one-year U.N. posting earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, he will be working alongside U.N. peacekeepers
from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of two international security officers in Suai,
supervising 12 local officers and responsible for the safety of
U.N. staff and equipment, according to Manoel de Almeida e Silva,
deputy U.N. spokesman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor was hit by a wave of violence by anti-independence
militiamen a year ago, after the majority of its people voted in a
U.N.-supervised ballot to end 24 years of Indonesian occupation.

<HEADLINE> MTV Awards Try To Top Last Year  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Quick quiz: Who's won the most MTV Video Music
Awards? Bonus question: Who won the most awards last year?
</P>
<P>
   Question three: Who cares? Awards are never really the point of
the Video Music Awards, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The show's real purpose is to create those pop culture moments
that make you cringe or laugh out loud, preferably both. You're
much more likely to remember Michael Jackson's creepy kiss with
Lisa Marie Presley (1994), Busta Rhymes making time with Martha
Stewart (1997), Prince's butt-less pants (1991), the first
post-arrest sighting of Pee-wee Herman (1991), or Howard Stern's
''Fartman'' descending from the rafters (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Pop music's annual outrageous party returns to New York's Radio
City Music Hall this week, shown live on MTV at 8 p.m. Eastern on
Sept. 7. Marlon and Shawn Wayans, hot off their ''Scary Movie''
collaboration, are the hosts.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tough act to live up to. The 1999 Video Music
Awards, with Chris Rock as host, had the highest ratings in the
show's 16-year history and, with 12 million viewers, was the
top-rated entertainment program in cable history.
</P>
<P>
   Just because MTV's airtime is now dominated by such young acts
as Britney Spears and 'N Sync, don't expect a G-rated slumber
party.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still a tremendous expectation on behalf of our
audience to completely surprise them, shock them, take risks and do
things that nobody else would do,'' said MTV president Van Toffler.
''That hasn't changed even though the composition of the music has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Toffler believes the openness of young fans to different forms
of music is one of the factors driving up viewership in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having all of these stars, the biggest stars from all these
genres of music, tends to bring in a bigger audience than we might
typically get when we were doing just a rock show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees for year's best video reflect the diversity: rapper
Eminem, punk rockers Blink 182, soul star D'Angelo, boy band 'N
Sync and veteran rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Except for D'Angelo, each of those artists is scheduled to
perform, along with Sisqo, Christina Aguilera, DMX, Janet Jackson,
Rage Against the Machine and Spears. Presenters include Dr. Dre,
Chris Rock, The Rock and Sting.
</P>
<P>
   And, since he has been just about everywhere else, ''Survivor''
winner Richard Hatch will appear.
</P>
<P>
   Toffler said he is hoping to persuade Rock (that's Chris, not
The) to join Red Hot Chili Peppers onstage. He said viewers can
expect Aguilera to be joined by someone unexpected onstage -- which
could mean rival Spears or, if she really wanted to push the
envelope, Eminem. The rapper joked on his latest album about
Aguilera performing a sex act on him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've been pioneers in trying to take what's happening
in culture at the moment and trying to flip it on its head and
bring it to people in our awards show,'' Toffler said. ''People
have tried to imitate us, but you can't really plan for these kinds
of moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure you can. Toffler remembers MTV executives ''doing
back-flips'' after they persuaded Herman to show up after he had
been arrested for indecent exposure and utter the memorable line:
''Heard any good jokes lately?''
</P>
<P>
   If you do care, Eminem and 'N Sync both scored the most
nominations this year with six apiece. Red Hot Chili Peppers,
Metallica, Sisqo and Aguilera had five each.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and to answer our own quiz: Madonna, with 18 awards, is the
all-time queen. Lauryn Hill won four last year.

<HEADLINE> India May Grow World's Hottest Chili  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Indian scientists say they have proven
that the hottest chili on Earth grows in the northeastern hills of
Assam, rather than the farms of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tests by a team of experts here have confirmed that Naga
Jolokia, a specialty from the northeast, is now the world's hottest
chili,'' said S.C. Das, deputy director of the Defense Research
Laboratory in the garrison town of Tezpur.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday that the Naga Jolokia, or capsicum frutescens,
surpasses the tongue-burning ability of the Red Savina Habanero, a
Mexican chili that has been known as the world's hottest.

<P>
   Das said that the researchers at the lab 110 miles north of
Assam's capital, Gauhati, had measured the pungency of the two
chilis in Scoville units -- the international gauge for food
spiciness.
</P>
<P>
   Das said the Naga Jolokia measured 855 Scoville units, compared
to 577 for the Habanero in the tests, completed last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Naga Jolokia grows to about 2 inches long and to a thickness
of about half an inch in the hilly terrain of Assam. The native
people have been eating them for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   India exports 38.5 tons per year of all varieties of chili. The
Naga Jolokia retails for about $1 to $1.50 per pound, depending on
the quality.

<HEADLINE> This Fall: Mechanical Cockfighting!  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three things you will learn from watching the
new series ''BattleBots'':
</P>
<P>
   1) San Francisco is ''the Mecca of robot fighting.'' (Who
knew???)
</P>
<P>
   2) Bottle-blond hair with a dark goatee is not a good look.
</P>
<P>
   3) A 210-pound robot topped by a whirring spinning wheel of
death can cause an awful lot of damage in just 46 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   These truths will become self-evident at 10:30 p.m. EDT
Wednesday with the latest edition of ''BattleBots'' on Comedy
Central. The contest -- think mechanical cockfighting -- pits
homemade robots in a fight to the ''death.''
</P>
<P>
   Death, in this case, involves a lot of flying sparks, dangling
wires and dismembered wheels as two robots enter the
Plexiglas-encased BattleBox. Only one emerges as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The robots are divided by weight class, as in boxing. But
overall, this sport bears little resemblance to any other.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the 48-foot-by-48-foot BattleBox, the contestants are
subject to random attacks that are part of the game:
tungsten-tipped buzz saws and spikes that pop up from the floor,
disappearing ramps dubbed ''hell-raisers,'' slamming sledgehammers.
</P>
<P>
   The matches are (1) held in San Francisco. They are (2)
co-hosted by Bill Dwyer. And in one upcoming match, a robot dubbed
The Mauler (3) demolished an overmatched challenger named Nightmare
in under a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to restoring your faith in uncensored acts of
extreme violence,'' the goateed Dwyer says at one point -- his
hyperbole nowhere near as distracting as his near-white hair.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer teams with ex-NFL quarterback Sean Salisbury to announce
the 3-minute matches, which are mixed in with behind-the-scenes
looks at the robots and their creators.
</P>
<P>
   The show was arranged as a single-elimination tournament -- no
surprise, since losers sometimes end up looking like a piece of
battered stereo equipment at a trailer-park yard sale. The winner
collects a $5,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   The robots' creators, most of them disturbingly normal-looking,
operate their machines by remote control. Their electronic spawn
conjures visions of something strange -- say, Charlie Manson with a
really twisted Erector set.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Winters, 14, of Monona, Wis., appears with her creation
Tentoumushi -- a robot with an exterior designed to look like a
ladybug and an interior highlighted by a tiny, killer buzz saw.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's The Mauler. The 210-pound robot resembles an
oversized tuna fish can run amok; instead of a lid, it features a
wildly whirring horizontal buzz saw.
</P>
<P>
   Bzzzz! Bzzzz! In barely 46 seconds, it sheared off the wheels of
its challenger and won its match. Celebrating were The Mauler's
inventors: Charles Tilford and his two sons, Morgan and Henry.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of 21st-century family values, Dad uses a pre-fight
interview to explain the clan's intentions: ''Total robotic
domination worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy father's day, eh?
</P>
<P>
   The names of the robots often suggest the violence to come:
There's Vlad the Impaler, Dead Blow, Killerhurtz, Diesector. The
show's announcers gleefully celebrate the carnage, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight, right before your very eyes, you're going to see real
live robots fight to the death,'' Salisbury intoned two weeks ago
in a special preseason show dubbed ''Prelude to War.''
</P>
<P>
   It's over-the-top, yet tongue-in-cheek. Ringside interviewers
Donna D'Errico (''Baywatch'') and twins Randy and Jason Sklar
provide most of the latter attribute.
</P>
<P>
   In one snippet, D'Errico talks to a contestant with a British
accent so broad that it seems he's singing ''God Save the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's that accent?'' she asks. ''Are you from England?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm from Oxford,'' the interviewee responds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Awesome,'' she rejoins.
</P>
<P>
   Looking strangely out of place, in a bow tie and black vest, is
technical expert Bill Nye ''The Science Guy.'' But make no mistake,
this new show is not about anything deeper than killer robots going
head-to-head.
</P>
<P>
   The program is somewhat marred by gratuitous vulgarities that
occasionally (and inexplicably) pop up from time to time. Better
just to let Salisbury and Dwyer, in a style copped from the WWF,
sound off about their game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Catchy phrases don't win fights,'' color commentator Dwyer
advises at one point. ''Nasty, maniacal weapons win fights.''
</P>
<P>
   And if this crack by Dwyer isn't the official cry of the
BattleBots, it certainly should be:
</P>
<P>
   ''When sparks fly, robots die!''
</P>
<P>
   Rest in pieces.

<HEADLINE> At The Movies: 'Nurse Betty'  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Nurse Betty'' is the year's most enjoyable -- and most
surprising -- fairy tale. Its heroine is a modern-day Don Quixote, a
romantic living out her fantasies more than even she could have
imagined. The director is Neil LaBute, who seemed cold to romance
of any kind -- much less a fairy tale -- in ''Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors''.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Zellweger stars as Betty Sizemore, a diner waitress from
Fair Oaks, Kan. She's bored with her job and not too excited by her
husband (LaBute favorite Aaron Eckhart). When two hit men (Morgan
Freeman and Chris Rock) destroy her home for good, she lives out
her version of the American Dream: Get in your car, drive West and
prepare to meet a man who doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The intended is Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), the handsome
lead character of ''Reason to Love,'' a daytime drama Betty watches
with unnerving attention. To meet him, she has reinvented herself
as a nurse from Ravell's hospital, an old fiancee back in town to
reclaim her lost love. It's her great fortune, and ours, that the
makers of ''A Reason to Love'' mistake her for a particularly
dedicated method actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nurse Betty'' is a model for how the fairy tale should work;
you know it couldn't happen in real life, but you believe it could
happen in this movie. Every strange plot turn is justified by the
writing -- and by the actors. When performers refer to their work as
''magic time,'' they're thinking of movies like this.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute didn't write the script; a good thing since Betty would
have never made it out of Kansas. Instead, honors go to John C.
Richards and James Flamberg. Their screenplay is funny,
tough-minded, graceful. It has all the best qualities of LaBute's
work and a generous spirit the director never summoned on his own.
For the first time in his films, a woman isn't punished for having
a good heart.
</P>
<P>
   The script works even better when these performers read the
lines. Zellweger's husky-squeaky voice is the closest thing we have
to Jean Arthur these days. She's an ideal comic actress, glamorous
but down-to-earth, believable as the eye in the storm and the storm
itself. In ''Jerry Maguire'' and ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' Zellweger
played the sanest person in the movie; the ultimate good sport. In
''Nurse Betty,'' she's quite the opposite, single-minded to the
point of madness.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's part is smaller, but just as satisfying. He's a gifted
actor often typecast in ''dignified'' roles. This time, as an aging
crook, he plays a far richer character: tired, compromised, but
still yearning. He has dignity, too, but it's not imposed by the
filmmakers; it comes from within.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood hasn't looked kindly upon the obsessed fan. The
classic image is Kathy Bates in ''Misery'' -- lonely, lethal and,
the biggest sin in show business, unattractive. But ''Nurse Betty''
taps a wand on the head of its title character and invites her to
the dance. LaBute, a cynic on holiday, was clearly taken by her
story. None of us should feel ashamed of being charmed as well.
</P>
<P>
   A Gramercy Pictures release, ''Nurse Betty'' was produced by
Gail Mutrux and Steve Golin. The running time is 112 minutes and
the rating is ''R,'' with violence and adult situations.

<HEADLINE> At The Movies: 'The Way of the Gun'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you learn early on in ''The Way of the Gun'' that the main
characters go by the names ''Parker'' and ''Longbaugh,'' you know
serious trouble will find them in the end, probably someplace bleak
and desolate.
</P>
<P>
   Film buffs will recognize that Parker and Longbaugh were the
real names of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. That's a perfect
reference for ''The Way of the Gun,'' a Western thriller with a
contemporary black spin.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher McQuarrie, who won a best screenplay Oscar for
1995's ''The Usual Suspects,'' directs for the first time and
writes the script. Too bad he doesn't know when to cut himself off.
The story and dialogue are often clever, but McQuarrie drags out
the ending with not one, not two, but three big gun battles, each
more generic and tedious than the last.
</P>
<P>
   The 90 minutes leading up to those shootouts are creative and
full of surprises, though. Every character in this thing is dirty,
and no one is what he or she seems.
</P>
<P>
   Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio del Toro) are
career criminals who simply have chosen not to function in normal
society. ''A plan is just a list of things that don't happen,''
Parker philosophizes, instead choosing to live day-to-day with his
buddy through sheer survival.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing they're broke, the two kidnap Robin (Juliette Lewis),
the surrogate mother of a wealthy Southwestern couple who is to
receive $1 million when her child is born. They also force her
physician (Dylan Kussman) to come along to deliver the baby.
</P>
<P>
   But as the motley group makes its way to Mexico, several twists
and turns arise involving family ties, double-crosses and hidden
agendas. A lot of them are way too coincidental to be believable,
but for the most part, McQuarrie's writing is so enthralling, he
makes it easy to go along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Strong performances from an all-star ensemble cast also keep the
movie humming until nearly the end. James Caan is excellent, gets
the best lines and steals most every scene he's in as a moneybag
man for the wealthy father-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe has a breakout performance as Parker. After seeing him
play pretty boys in ''54'' and ''Cruel Intentions,'' it's great to
watch him pull off the bad guy routine with finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs have some darkly funny moments as
slick, well-dressed bodyguards assigned to protect Robin, but who
get tangled up in far more violence than they anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the setting, the production design also gives ''The Way
of the Gun'' a retro Western feel. McQuarrie and director of
photography Dick Pope chose to wash out the scenes in gritty grays
and browns. So even when the plot falls apart, the movie still
looks good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Way of the Gun,'' an Artisan Entertainment release, is
rated R for language, strong violence-gore and some sexuality.
Running time: 119 minutes.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Turn It Up'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of things happen in the span of just 87 minutes in ''Turn
It Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Our hero, an aspiring rap star named Diamond, loses his mother.
At her funeral, his estranged father returns after abandoning him
12 years earlier, but eventually he dies, too. His girlfriend tells
him she's pregnant. The owner of the studio where he records his
music is raising his rates.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and he gets involved in a number of botched drug deals
and shootouts, despite his yearning to escape his former life in
the Brooklyn projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Prakazrel ''Pras'' Michel of the hip-hop band The Fugees,
who plays Diamond, reacts to all these tumultuous events with the
same indifferent expression and monotone line delivery.
</P>
<P>
   His performance isn't the movie's only problem. No, no, no, far
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the title. At one point in the life of this
film, it was called ''Ghetto Supastar,'' which is certainly a lot
more intriguing. ''Turn It Up'' could easily be confused with the
cheerleader comedy ''Bring It On.'' Imagine a 13-year-old girl
making that mistake at the multiplex!
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the character development -- or lack thereof.
Writer-director Robert Adetuyi, in his debut effort, tells us so
little about Diamond that it's hard to care when bad things happen
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts.
There's no explanation why the main villain, an Australian drug
dealer known as Mr. B, is evil incarnate. Other bad guys are
stereotypes, with slick clothes, thick gold chains, heavy foreign
accents and garden-variety scowls.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few interesting moments when Diamond and his father
(Vondie Curtis Hall), a pianist, get reacquainted by sharing their
music. The movie would have had much more depth and emotional
impact (or any, for that matter) had it focused more on this
dynamic and other musical aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Adetuyi relies too easily on drug deals and gun
battles. Anyone could do that.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's big climax scene is nothing more than a generic
shootout, which conveniently takes place inside the recording
studio because it looks and sounds cool when the bullets shatter
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, for a movie about music, the sound is lousy. Some
of the songs sound distorted because they have so much bass. In
other moments, the dialogue is so low, it's hard to understand what
the characters are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Hall does the best he can as Diamond's father, bringing wisdom
and warmth to his role.
</P>
<P>
   Tamala Jones is also a sporadic bright spot as Diamond's
pregnant girlfriend who doesn't completely trust him but wants to
start a family. It's impossible to understand why she stays with
him, though. She -- and all the other women in this movie -- are
treated as property, verbally abused and neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Pras should stick to rapping, because acting apparently is not
his forte. The scenes in which he's performing onstage or in the
recording studio are the only ones that are interesting on any
level.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turn It Up,'' a New Line Cinema release, is rated R for strong
language and violence and some drug content.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were slightly lower Tuesday, as investors
returned from a holiday weekend to a market with little news to
influence trading.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 14.06 at 11,224.72.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 70.99 to 4,163.34. The Standard

</P>
<P>
   With no big news to provide a clear direction for trading, the
market drifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will be a very slow week,'' said Eugene Mintz, a
financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. He said
the economy appears to be slowing, but many investors aren't sure
what that means for their portfolios. Barring any major corporate
announcement or other financial news, Mintz said it might take time
for the market to find direction.

<P>
   ''It looks pretty much like people are just sitting back and
saying, 'We'll wait and see for a while before doing anything,'''
he added.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Urges Cluster Bomb Halt  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The Red Cross is urging governments to suspend the
use of cluster bombs -- like those NATO dropped on Kosovo last year
-- because they can kill and maim long after a war ends, an official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the International Committee of the Red Cross
found that, compared with land mines, those injured or killed by
cluster bombs were 4.9 times as likely to be children under the age
of 14.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-page report focused on the aftermath of NATO's 78-day
bombing of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Children are especially at risk because the bombs are usually an
eye-catching yellow with little parachutes attached, said Peter
Herby, an ICRC specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think they are duds because they didn't go off at
first, but they are highly unstable and can be set off easily,''
Herby added.
</P>
<P>
   The ICRC found that cluster bombs killed 50 people and injured
101 in Kosovo during the first year after the bombing ended in June
1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, land mines, mainly left by Serb forces, killed 30
people and wounded 169.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of land mines often survive, although they may lose feet
or legs, but cluster bombs generally kill anyone near them when
they explode.
</P>
<P>
   Herby said the ICRC, charged with enforcing the Geneva
Conventions on the conduct of war, has sent governments its study
with an appeal for a new international law on the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of cluster bombs should be suspended until an
international agreement on their use and clearance has been
achieved,'' said a message to diplomats in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Although cluster bombs were used in the Gulf War and the
Indochina war in Laos, Kosovo provided the Red Cross with its first
chance to study their long-term impact, Herby said.
</P>
<P>
   A single cluster-bomb canister, dropped to destroy airfields or
tanks and soldiers, typically scatters 200 to 600 bomblets over an
area the size of a football field.
</P>
<P>
   On average 10 to 15 percent of the bomblets fail to explode
immediately, but for decades they can be detonated by the slightest
disturbance, even a change in the weather, Herby said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing cluster bombs is more dangerous than clearing mines, he
added. Even a two-way radio signal between clearers can set off
cluster bomblets.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimated that 30,000 cluster bomblets remained after
the Kosovo conflict. U.N.-supervised clearers had removed 4,069 by
the end of May, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. operation also reported the clearance of 3,448
anti-personnel mines, 3,784 anti-tank mines and 6,639 other
unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   The ICRC also urged governments to ban the use of cluster bombs
against military targets in populated areas and require those who
use cluster bombs to clear them afterward.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Accuses Iraq, Afghans  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A State Department report released Tuesday
says a significant percentage of the world population does not have
the right to religious freedom, and it names Iraq and Afghanistan
among the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much of the world's population lives in countries in which the
right to religious freedom is restricted or prohibited,'' the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   The situation exists even though 144 countries belong to an
international covenant that acknowledges the right of all citizens
to religious freedom, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Congress required the State Department to issue an
annual report on the state of religious freedom worldwide. The 2000
report covers the period from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000 and
includes reports on 194 countries and territories.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq -- For decades, the government has conducted a ''brutal
campaign of murder, summary execution, and protracted arbitrary
detention against religious leaders and adherents of the majority
Shiite population.'' Security forces murdered senior Shiite
clerics, desecrated mosques and holy sites, arrested tens of
thousands of Shiites and forcibly prevents Shiites from practicing
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan -- The government has engaged in persecution and
killing, particularly against the Shiite minority. ''The Taliban
enforced its strict interpretation of Islamic Shari'a law, and,
according to reports, public executions, floggings, and amputations
took place weekly against those who violated the law.''
</P>
<P>
   China -- Government respect for religious freedom in China
deteriorated as the persecution of several religious minorities
increased. While membership in many faiths grew rapidly and
government supervision of religious activity was minimal in some
regions, ''government officials in other regions imposed tight
regulations, closed houses of worship, and activity persecuted
members of some unregistered religious groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar -- The government continued to repress systematically
members of both minority faiths and the majority Buddhist
population. ''Buddhist monks who promoted human and political
rights were arrested, and some Buddhist monasteries were destroyed.
Government security forces frequently employed coercion to induce
Christian members of the Chin ethnic minority to convert to
Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also found varying degrees of repression in communist
countries such as Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam. Among countries
friendly to the United States, the report said religious
discrimination exists in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded there were ''significant improvements'' in
Azerbaijan and Laos. In Azerbaijan, the report traced the changed
situation to a presidential pledge last November to improve the
status of religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Laos, the government released in mid-June a large number of
Christians who had been imprisoned because of their faith, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that there were noteworthy improvements in 31 other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Won't Swap Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding an American
hostage in a southern Philippine jungle refused Tuesday to exchange
him for a suspected guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schilling, 24, of Oakland, Calif., ended a hunger strike
and is being held in a heavily guarded bamboo hut, said a
government envoy who visited the rebel camp. Schilling's legs are
tied because he tried to escape, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police said they had arrested a 73-year-old man
suspected of belonging to the Abu Sayyaf rebels and accused him of
taking part in kidnappings on Basilan island.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya identified the man as his
grandfather, but refused to swap him for Schilling, who was
kidnapped Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels will not release Schilling for ''even 10, even 100 of
my grandfathers,'' Sabaya told the Radio Mindanao Network.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who say they are fighting to establish an Islamic
state in the southern Philippines, have insisted that the arrested
man, Ahmad Opao, be freed before they begin talks for Schilling's
release.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who became a Muslim in 1994, was taken hostage when
he visited the Abu Sayyaf's camp on Jolo island, 580 miles south of
Manila. The rebels seized him after he angered them in a debate
about religion and politics, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is holding six Europeans -- four from a group abducted
April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort and two French journalists
-- and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who came to pray for the
hostages in July.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the six Europeans will be freed later this week
after the return Tuesday of Libyan negotiator Rajab Azzarouq, who
is leading talks for their release. Libya reportedly paid $6
million for last week's release of six other foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling has been living in Zamboanga since March with a Muslim
Filipino woman, Ivi Osani. The couple married several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Osani, Sabaya's second cousin and the widow of a rebel killed in
fighting several years ago, said she and Schilling were invited by
Sabaya to visit the Abu Sayyaf camp.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the rebels rejected the government's choice of a
local official to negotiate for Schilling's freedom and demanded a
national government official instead.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials refused to replace negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not for them to determine who the negotiators for the
government are going to be,'' said presidential executive secretary
Ronaldo Zamora. ''If they don't want to negotiate, then there will
be no negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora said Schilling was apparently responsible for his own
capture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike the European hostages who were taken by force without
their consent in another country and brought to the Philippines,
Schilling walked into the Abu Sayyaf camp. We don't really have to
do anything about it,'' he told the government radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf faction which abducted Schilling also kidnapped
about 50 children and teachers on Basilan in March.
</P>
<P>
   Two teachers were beheaded after the United States ignored the
group's demand for the release of Arab terrorists held in U.S.
jails. The faction also killed a Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   The group has not announced its demands for Schilling's release,
although Sabaya privately demanded $10 million last week,
negotiators said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Minimum Wage Is Priority  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring Democrats ''committed to breaking
the legislative logjam,'' President Clinton huddled Tuesday with
his party's leaders to plot strategy for a fall congressional
session destined to be dominated by the presidential campaign's
final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The president sat with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to discuss
how Democrats will deal with, among other things, Republican
efforts to push through election-year tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the highest priority for Congress should be passing
a $1 increase in the hourly minimum wage, rather than trying to
corral enough votes to override his veto of a bill repealing the
estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got a right to try to override any veto that I make.
That's the way the Constitution works,'' Clinton said. ''But I wish
they'd try just as hard to muster up the two-thirds to raise the
minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have promised to pursue the veto
override -- and, if the override fails, to argue that the estate tax
would itself die if George W. Bush is elected. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said the White House is confident that the
estate tax veto and Clinton's previous veto of a tax cut for
couples will be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended the vetoes, saying they were necessary to stave
off tax cuts that would eat away at projected budget surpluses
without taking into account the costs of whatever spending programs
the Republicans plan to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to breaking the legislative logjam,'' Clinton
said. ''Unfortunately, the strategy pursued by the Republican
leaders in Congress, I believe, would squander (the surplus) on
massive and reckless tax cuts for the privileged few. This isn't
fiscally responsible. It isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle noted that, during the Republican National Convention,
GOP lawmakers called for passage of a patients' bill of rights and
prescription drug coverage for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to give our Republican colleagues a chance to make
their rhetoric match their record,'' Daschle said. ''If they really
believe in these things, all they have to do is stop blocking them.
We will support them and the president said today, again, he will
sign them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Republican lawmakers have said little about the
large tax cut that they touted last year, because they discovered
that most people were skeptical about it. Rather than drop the idea
of a big tax cut, he said, they have now ''carved it up into teensy
slices'' in an attempt to get it passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans were dogged. They kept at it and they refused
to take no for an answer,'' Clinton said. ''That, in a nutshell, is
what brings us to the current endgame. We have a lot of work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton -- with no campaign of his own and little
time left in office -- is willing to devote his full attention to
budget negotiations, even if they spill over into the campaign's
final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Congress can't get their work done by Oct. 1, we're not
going any place,'' Lockhart said. ''We'll stay here through
Election Day if need be.''

<HEADLINE> North Korean Cancels U.N. Trip  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- North Korea's No. 2 leader called off
a trip to the U.N. Millennium Summit on Tuesday after his
delegation was allegedly ordered to undergo a strip search during a
security check as they transferred to an American Airlines flight
in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Nam, head of the communist country's parliament, was to
have met in New York with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, just
two months after his historic summit meeting in Pyongyang with
North Korea's paramount leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Nam would have been the highest-ranking North Korean
official to attend a U.N. meeting since both Koreas joined the
world body in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation members claimed the search Monday was ordered by
U.S. security officials, and North Korea's vice foreign minister,
Choe Su Hon, told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference
at Frankfurt airport that North Korea has demanded an apology from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a rude and provocative act,'' Choe said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines issued a statement Tuesday apologizing for the
search, but denied that the diplomats were asked to strip. No U.S.
government agencies participated in the search, American Airlines
spokesman John Hotard said from Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This involved a 'pat down' and removal of only an outer
garment, such as a suit jacket, and their shoes,'' the airline said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sorry for the inconvenience caused Monday to the North
Korean diplomatic delegation,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said, ''It appears that the
procedures at the airport caused an unfortunate situation that we
deeply regret.'' An official said the department will have more to
say when additional information about the situation is received.
</P>
<P>
   Choe said the search was ordered as the delegation members were
transferring to an American Airlines flight in Frankfurt, where
they arrived Monday after a stopover in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. security officials turned up, opened suitcases and
handbags of each member of the presidential entourage, forced them
to take off their clothes and shoes and thoroughly searched each
and every sensitive part of the body,'' Choe said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the incident showed ''one aspect of the insidious and
cunning double-faced stratagem of the United States,'' which he
called the ''paragon of a rogue state.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire North Korean delegation will fly back to North Korea
later Tuesday, Choe said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung left Tuesday for the
Millennium Summit, where he is to discuss positive developments on
the divided Korean peninsula with world leaders and had also been
expected to meet the North Korean deputy leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a chance for another meeting, but right now
the chance is lost,'' Choe said. ''I think this matter has nothing
to do with North-South Korean relations, which are improving quite
favorably at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il agreed to
promote reconciliation and reunification during the June summit,
the first since the 1945 division of the peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Next Missile Defense Test in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon probably will postpone the next
test of its national missile defense by a month or two so that
officials can more fully analyze the last test's failure, officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The expected delay, to January, is not directly linked to
President Clinton's decision last week to abandon a 2005 target
date for deploying a national missile defense, Air Force Lt. Col.
Rick Lehner said. He is spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, the Pentagon office in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was not sufficiently confident of the technical
feasibility of a national missile defense to commit the United
States to deploying the weapon system now, but he ordered the
Pentagon to ''continue a robust program of development and
testing.'' His decision effectively removed 2005 as a target date
for deploying a missile defense, although Clinton said he believed
it was still possible by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The key to determining the feasibility of missile defense is a
series of flight tests of the missile interceptor -- a booster
rocket and a ''kill vehicle'' it carries into space to collide with
an incoming warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Each flight test costs about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The last two tests, in January and July, were unsuccessful. The
Pentagon was planning another try in October or November, although
shortly after the July failure Defense Secretary William Cohen told
Congress that it might slip to December.
</P>
<P>
   No firm date has yet been set, Lehner said, but ''more than
likely'' the next flight test will be in January. He said the
missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific is closed
much of December. Officials do not expect to finish analyzing the
reasons for the July test failure until October, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision means the Pentagon will not award contracts
this year for initial construction work on a new missile-tracking
radar in the Aleutians. That would have put the United States on a
path to missile defense deployment in the face of stern opposition
from Russia and China and doubts among U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from deferring work on the radar, Clinton's decision
had little immediate impact on the technical work under way or on
the enthusiasm of those involved in the project, Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no real sense of disappointment,'' Lehner said.
''This was the president's decision. We'll keep pressing forward
with the test program.''

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Work on Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The leaders of Russia and Japan pledged Tuesday to
press on toward a peace treaty, despite failing to resolve a
territorial dispute that has blocked a pact for more than five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
ended two days of talks without progress over claims to four
islands off northern Japan that Russia seized at the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all they could do to agree to continue peace treaty
talks, giving us a glimpse of how far apart they are in their
views,'' the national Yomiuri newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hopes for signing a peace treaty this year, Putin backed
off, saying: ''The important thing is not setting up a deadline,
but that both countries have good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori said: ''We confirmed that we will continue negotiations for
a peace treaty by resolving the issue the sovereignty over the four
islands, based on all the negotiations in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The islands -- known as the Kurils in Russia and the Northern
Territories in Japan -- have stood in the way of a peace treaty that
would formally end more than 50 years of hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has not accepted Tokyo's suggestion of putting the
islands under Japanese sovereignty while letting Russia continue to
administer them.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo stands firm against Moscow's earlier suggestion that they
formally end their hostilities without resolving the island
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Pride and emotion are entwined in the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is unwilling to relinquish its control over the islands
because Russian leaders are loathe to lose another piece of the
former Soviet Union. Also, the islands are surrounded by rich
fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo still smarts from the forced evacuation of 10,000 Japanese
from the islands in 1945 when Russian soldiers took the islands.
</P>
<P>
   While Mori and Putin held talks Monday, right-wing extremists
circled the meeting site in black sound trucks, blaring martial
music and demanding the return of the islands.
</P>
<P>
   With little progress in the dispute over the islands, the two
leaders turned their attention to improving relations by
cooperating in regional security and economic matters.
</P>
<P>
   Putin emphasized that he wanted Tokyo and Moscow to tighten
their strategic relationship and ensure stability in northeast
Asia. He also invited Mori to visit Russia, but no date was set.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides signed agreements including a program on
developing trade and economic relations, joint efforts to aid the
economic development of the Kurils, cooperation in energy, Japanese
assistance in dismantling Russian nuclear arsenals and
strengthening cooperation between the two nations' border guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope in the near future we will keenly feel that both
countries are vital to the other,'' Putin said at a joint news
conference before leaving on Tuesday evening for New York to attend
the U.N. Millennium Summit.

<HEADLINE> More People Can Get Food Stamps  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A heart attack knocked Lorraine Smith out of
work in June, making her more dependent than ever on food stamps.
But the benefits are fast becoming more trouble than they are
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Meager allowances -- Smith was getting just $35 in stamps per
month -- plus state regulations intended to cut down on fraud and
errors are among the reasons the program's enrollment has declined
by one-third since 1996, say hunger relief groups America's Second
Harvest and Food Research and Action Center.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than 17 million people were on food stamps
nationwide in May, the latest month for which data are available,
compared with 17.9 million in May 1999 and 25.5 million in May
1996. Seven states, led by Delaware, Texas and Maryland, have seen
caseloads drop by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is due partly to the booming economy and a 1996 ban
on benefits to immigrants, but federal officials say many poor
people don't know they are eligible for the stamps or left the
program because of bureaucratic red tape. The government estimates
that 37 percent of people eligible for food stamps aren't getting
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to do as much as we can at the federal and state
levels to ensure that working families get the easy access to
nutritional assistance that they need,'' said Andy Solomon, a
spokesman for the Agriculture Department, which administers the
program.
</P>
<P>
   USDA analysts say the good economy accounts for 28 percent to 35
percent of the decrease in participation since 1996. Some 935,000
legal immigrants, less than 5 percent of the 1996 caseload, lost
their food stamp eligibility under a federal welfare system
overhaul that year. Congress later restored benefits to 250,000
elderly, disabled and minor immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, food banks report demand is as strong as ever, and
the government estimates that 10 million families, or about one in
10 U.S. households, don't get enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recently was told her stamps were about to be eliminated
because she hadn't gone to the local welfare office to have her
benefits recalculated, a step Maryland requires of food stamp
recipients every four months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no income, no nothing right now. On top of that I have
a special diet,'' Smith said as she waited this summer in a church
food pantry for a bag of free groceries.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they have been forced to expand their
applications and recalculate benefits more often to prevent payment
errors and satisfy USDA auditors. Error rates last year ran as high
as 17.6 percent in Michigan. Twenty-two other states had rates over
10 percent. Maryland's was 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one hand, it's a topdown overregulated program focused on
correct benefit delivery. On the other hand, it tries to be an
accessible customer-oriented delivery program. Neither the Congress
nor the Department of Agriculture has determined what it wants it
to be,'' said Richard Larson, a Maryland Department of Human
Resources policy director.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the states and the District of Columbia have
applications of 10 to 36 pages long, demanding information about
everything from burial plots to income from blood donations, and
nearly all require a 12th-grade reading level, says a study by
America's Second Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is the only state with an application requiring
only a fifth-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   Larson also said benefits are so meager, as low as $10, that
some people don't bother. The average benefit is about $70 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 45-year-old grandmother, said she spent most of her $35
in food stamps in one shopping trip, spending $33 for fish, beef,
liver, oil, flour and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ''You used to be able to into a store and buy anything you
wanted without going over the limit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has relaxed eligibility rules over
the past year and initiated a public education campaign to
encourage poor people to sign up. The administration has asked
Congress for $10 million for more outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials also held public meetings in seven cities this
summer to find out what it could do to increase enrollments.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman urged the nation's governors to
identify poor people who are eligible for food stamps but not
getting them.
</P>
<P>
   States could help by reducing paperwork and keeping offices open
longer hours, advocacy groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There does tend to be a feeling on the part of state
administrators that the most important thing to get right is the
payment accuracy,'' said Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research and
Action Center.

<HEADLINE> Speaker's top spokeswoman to leave at end of year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's top
spokeswoman and strategist said Tuesday she is stepping down at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch said spending more time with her family after
seven years in the high-pressure job with Silver is one of her main
priorities. She has children ages 9 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time, it's just time,'' Lynch said. ''It has been a
phenomenal seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, 42, has been in and out of government since first taking
a job with former Democratic state Sen. Howard Nolan of Albany in
1978. She also worked for the Democratic minority in the state
Senate and Democratic U.S. Reps. Nita Lowey and Nydia Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   She makes $110,000 a year in the Assembly, where she heads a
large public relations staff for majority Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said she would seek to become a public relations
consultant and lobbyist in state and New York City politics.
</P>
<P>
   She said she first told Silver that this would probably be her
last year in Albany before the 2000 legislative session, which
turned out to be Silver's most turbulent year as speaker. In May,
Democratic Majority Leader Michael Bragman openly challenged Silver
for the speaker's post - a challenge Silver fought down after days
of feverish lobbying among Democratic members.
</P>
<P>
   A major complaint of the dissidents was that Silver was isolated
from rank-and-filers by staffers such as Lynch, who emerged as the
speaker's most influential aide when former counsel Fred Jacobs
left in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Silver did appear to adopt a more open and member-friendly
attitude toward Democratic assemblymen following the coup attempt.
If he wins re-election to the Assembly in November as expected,
Silver must still be re-elected as speaker by his colleagues to
retain his top leadership position for two more years.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the past few years, the speaker and Republican Gov.
George Pataki showed an increasing willingness to work together on
major legislation. Though the Pataki and Silver camps were still
often antagonistic and always wary of each other, they did
compromise on a new state health care financing system in 1999 and
on a host of bills in 2000 which would have prompted political
sparring in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch insisted that her impending departure has nothing to with
Silver's fight to remain speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anything, if it were not for the coup I would have
announced earlier,'' she said. ''Between now and the end of the
year my only priority is to re-elect the speaker as speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch lives in Chappaqua, Westchester County, not far from the
new home of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her impending departure was first reported in Tuesday's New York
Post.

<HEADLINE> Pope Down on Non-Producing Couples  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Marking the third anniversary of Mother
Teresa's death, Pope John Paul II on Tuesday praised the nun's
generosity and took to task couples who decide to remain childless.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with adoptive families and nuns from the
Missionaries of Charity, the order founded by Mother Teresa, John
Paul was lavish in praise for her.
</P>
<P>
   After Mother Teresa died in 1997 at 87 after a life spent caring
for outcasts in the slums of Calcutta, John Paul waived the
customary five-year waiting period to start the process leading to
possible sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to us that we still see her passing through the world
in search of the poorest among the poor, always ready to open new
places for charity, welcoming all as a true mother,'' the pope
said. He made no mention of prospects for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul decried that, in the face of many children who don't
have parents, ''there are so many couples who decide to remain
without children for reasons not rarely selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the pope took to task those who ''desiring to
have their 'own' child at all costs, go beyond the legitimate help
that medical science can assure procreation, pushing themselves
toward morally reprehensible practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has repeatedly condemned such techniques as in vitro
fertilization, insisting that the only way approved by the Catholic
church to have children is sex between husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, while praising the concept of adoption, seemed to be
closing the door to that possibility to single people or unmarried
couples.
</P>
<P>
   When a family is ''solidly joined by marriage, it assures the
child that serene environment and that affection, both paternal and
maternal, which he needs for full human development.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian lawmakers recently wrestled with proposals to allow
unmarried people to adopt but decided to leave unchanged the
obligation to be married.

<HEADLINE> Ethical Dilemma With Siamese Twins  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Jodie may live, but only if Mary dies. Doctors
want to operate, but the parents prefer to trust the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the fate of Siamese twins from Eastern Europe is in the
hands of doctors and appeals court judges, who are struggling with
the ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mary, the twin whose less-developed body depends on
her sister for oxygenated blood, Lord Justice Henry Brooke asked
Tuesday: ''What is this creature in the eyes of the law?''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer appointed to represent Jodie argued that ''there are no
best interests in preserving what is unfortunately a futile life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodie and Mary -- false names used by the court to preserve the
girls privacy -- were born Aug. 8 at St. Mary's Hospital in
Manchester and are joined at their lower abdomens. Mary's brain and
body are less developed than Jodie's and the Manchester medical
team says it is highly probable that if left unseparated, both
twins will die within six months as Jodie's heart fails.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who have not been identified, are appealing the
Aug. 25 decision by a High Court judge to allow surgeons to
separate the twins.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' fate is in the hands of English law because the
parents came here for the birth to give their daughters ''the very
best chance in the very best place,'' says their attorney, Simon
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the compelling ethical issues, it has been a subdued
case -- one with no faces. The parents have not been photographed or
interviewed, their home country has not been disclosed and the
public has not seen pictures of the twins.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, which has asked two specialists from London
to travel to Manchester to review the case, granted permission
Tuesday for additional scans if needed. The specialists are to
report back at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, already is deep into the ethical conundrums
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Parker, a barrister appointed to represent Jodie's
interests, said Jodie would have a good quality of life and the
possibility of a normal life expectancy if she were severed from
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jodie is expected to have a normal brain and is of normal
intelligence,'' Parker said. ''She might be able to go home two to
three months after separation.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor in charge of the twins was identified in court only
as Dr. B. He said in court Monday that Mary, who once had been
completely passive, now opens her right eye occasionally and had
begun to suck, although she could not feed. Her brain was
''extremely primitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital said it has been bombarded with protests from the
public because of the doctors' determination to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the parents, who are Roman Catholics, had decided
that they could not kill one daughter to allow the other to live.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to England to give our babies the very best chance for
life in the very best place,'' the parents said in a statement read
in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now things have gone very badly wrong and we find ourselves in
this very difficult situation. ... We believe that nature should
take its course. If it's God's will that both our children should
not survive then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents fear Jodie would suffer and require continuing
special care that is not readily available to them, and they are
concerned about local attitudes toward disability, their lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges asked whether Jodie and Mary should be regarded as
''one life'' in the legal sense -- a concept that could clear the
way for surgery to save Jodie. Taylor argued that the staff at St.
Mary's considered the twins as separate individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Alan Ward asked whether the child could be
described as ''a person in being,'' since she could not live
independently.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the parents could arguably be guilty of the
manslaughter of Jodie if they did nothing -- or guilty of the
manslaughter of Mary if they consented to surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Whitfield, an attorney representing Central Manchester
Healthcare National Health Service Trust, which operates the
hospital, argued that the law had to ''balance the conflict of
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant, he said, that the surgery should be allowed because
Jodie has more to lose ''in terms of the net gain of life.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Shelton woman's death blamed killing on drug dealers  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The man charged with murder in the 1998
death of a Shelton woman claims she was killed by drug dealers who
were after him because of an old debt, the arrest warrant shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory McArthur could not identify for police the men who
allegedly attacked him before going after Annmarie Cusano, an
escort he had hired for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses told police they helped McArthur home after
finding him walking in the north end of Hartford that night with
stab wounds to the back and leg. But they say McArthur never
mentioned that a woman had been attacked with him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the warrant, police believe McArthur killed Cusano,
the mother of teen-age twin daughters, during a robbery the night
of Jan. 3, 1998, and was injured in the attack. A few hours later,
at a time when McArthur claimed to have already left the state, he
''rented'' Cusano's car to an acquaintance in exchange for crack
cocaine, police said.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur, the last person seen with Cusano, on Saturday led
police to her remains in a wooded area of Suffield. He was
arraigned in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities will not say whether McArthur changed his story and
confessed, or how and why he led police to the body. McArthur, a
suspect since the beginning, had refused to cooperate with police
until he agreed last month to return to Connecticut from a
Massachusetts jail where he is serving up to 15 years on unrelated
theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant for his arrest in connection with Cusano's death was
issued in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Chief State's Attorney John Bailey said Tuesday that McArthur
had not been offered a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. McArthur voluntarily gave the location and the charges
have not been reduced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur, 39, is charged with murder, felony murder and robbery.
He is scheduled to return to court Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected to feel more hate, rage and anger,'' John Peters
said after getting his first glimpse of the man accused of killing
his sister. ''It's an emptiness. I really don't know what to
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who sat quietly in the courtroom with Cusano's
daughters, said McArthur's arrest brings them closer to closure.
</P>
<P>
   It has also spurred fresh reports about Cusano's part-time work
for an escort service.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano, 42, supplemented her secretarial job at a Milford firm
by working as an escort for Gabriel Gladstone, a 71-year-old
Roxbury man serving 20 years in prison for running an extensive
prostitution ring, the arrest warrant shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone told police that Cusano had gone to McArthur's
Hartford boarding house the night of Jan. 2, 1998, but called her
employer just after midnight Jan. 3 and said she was ending the
date.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses reported seeing McArthur, suffering stab wounds,
between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Jan. 3. The residents offered aid to
McArthur, who said he had been robbed but refused to call the
police because he had outstanding warrants against him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the area where McArthur was found injured is not far
from Keney Park, where he had been accused three times of trying to
rob women at knifepoint. McArthur has been convicted 22 times, 12
times on felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. on Jan. 3, McArthur allegedly rented
Cusano's car to an acquaintance in exchange for drugs. The
acquaintance contacted police when he learned of Cusano's
disappearance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Mideast Accord  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to relaunch
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but his national security adviser
Tuesday said he saw little chance of a ''meeting of the minds''
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see that happening this week,'' Sandy Berger told
reporters at the White House. He said progress is possible, but
added that ''it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine'' a peace
agreement emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is warning that he will give a settlement with Arafat only
a few weeks to be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   With those assessments before Clinton's separate meetings
Wednesday with Barak and Arafat in New York on the fringes of a
Millennium Summit, the deadline of Sept. 13 set last year for an
agreement by the two Mideast leaders will likely be missed.
</P>
<P>
   And the October calendar isn't much brighter, Berger said. A
series of Jewish holy days will interrupt any negotiations between
the two sides. Toward the end of the month, the Israeli Knesset
will convene for what could be a vitriolic debate.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half the Israeli parliament is ardently against many of
the concessions Barak offered at July's Camp David summit --
particularly a willingness to give the Palestinians local control
of a few neighborhoods and suburbs of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli lawmakers are expected to try toppling Barak, but if he
somehow manages to have a treaty with Arafat in hand by then he
could seize the initiative and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. drive opens Tuesday night with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright calling on Barak at his New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said it is up to the Palestinians to compromise, and
Israel's Foreign Ministry said Monday the prime minister was not
planning to present new ideas to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit collapsed, Barak had offered virtually the
entire West Bank to Arafat for a Palestinian state. The main
stumbling block was Jerusalem, which the prime minister has vowed
never to redivide.
</P>
<P>
   Israel gained control of the entire city in the 1967 Mideast
war, ousting Jordanian troops from the eastern portion they had
occupied since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian refugees posed another hurdle, with Arafat insisting
Israel recognize a ''right of return'' for hundreds of thousands
now in neighboring Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   The senior U.S. mediator, Dennis B. Ross, presented undisclosed
compromise proposals to Barak and Arafat last week, said a senior
Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult issue on the agenda is Jerusalem, with Arafat
insisting on sovereignty over all of the eastern part of the city,
including holy shrines sacred to Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Berger made plain the focus is on the Palestinian leader. The
White House official said Arafat had ''some very hard decisions to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   In another downbeat assessment, Berger virtually ruled out a
three-way ''mini-summit'' with Clinton, Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was a bit more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the two parties have ever been closer than they
are today,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Camp David made major strides, and I hope we would be
able to capitalize on that process and reach an agreement,'' Annan
said. ''But, of course, there is also the question of time. I don't
think there is too much time for any of the parties in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is scheduled to leave New York in time to attend a
meeting with the Central Council of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in Gaza City on Saturday, Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia Lost 23 Helicopters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces have lost 23 military
helicopters in the war in Chechnya since fighting resumed about a
year ago, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, citing unidentified Defense Ministry officials,
marked the first time the military gave a total figure for the
number of helicopters destroyed in the war, although some
individual losses have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of 23 helicopters would be a major drain for the
cash-strapped military, which rarely receives new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Military representatives in Moscow declined to comment on the
Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops returned to Chechnya last fall to suppress the
republic's separatist government after being driven out at the end
of a 1994-96 war. The Russian military controls large areas of
Chechnya but appears to be far from defeating the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Military helicopters buzz above roads and forest paths in
Chechnya seeking rebel forces to attack, and are used to escort
military columns and transport troops.
</P>
<P>
   The losses comprised 11 heavily-armed and armored Mi-24
helicopter gunships and 12 Mi-8 multipurpose helicopters, the
report said. About half the losses were caused by enemy fire and
half by pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops sealed off Chechnya's capital, Grozny,
and the southern city of Shali to ward off anticipated attacks on
the anniversary Wednesday of Chechnya's 1991 declaration of
independence. Special units were sent to guard roads and all
civilian transport was restricted Tuesday, Russian news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Two trucks were blown up by land mines in Grozny on Tuesday
morning, a riot police commander, Lt. Col. Sergei Mochalov was
quoted by ITAR-Tass as saying. Rebel attacks also were reported in
Shali in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Roads around Grozny and all major Chechen towns are already
riddled with military checkpoints, but rebels have proved agile at
slipping past them to stage attacks well inside Russian-controlled
territory.

<HEADLINE> Report: China's Repression Up  </HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious repression in China increased over
the past year, says a new State Department report, which also found
that violations of religious freedom are a global phenomenon,
particularly in communist and Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Tuesday, said government respect for
religious freedom in China deteriorated in the past year as
persecution of several groups of believers increased.
</P>
<P>
   While finding that government supervision of religious activity
was minimal in some regions, the study said Chinese officials in
other regions ''imposed tight regulations, closed houses of worship
and actively persecuted members of some unregistered religious
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Congress asked the State Department to submit annual
reports on the state of international religious freedom. This is
the second such report and covers the period July 1, 1999, to June
30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much of the world's population lives in countries in which the
right to religious freedom is restricted or prohibited,'' the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   The situation exists even though 144 countries belong to an
international covenant that acknowledges the right of all citizens
to religious freedom, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses Iraq of having conducted a ''brutal campaign
of murder, summary execution and protracted arbitrary detention
against religious leaders and adherents of the majority Shiite
population.'' Security forces murdered senior Shiite clerics,
desecrated mosques and holy sites, arrested tens of thousands of
Shiites and forcibly prevents Shiites from practicing their form of
Islam, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, the report said the Taliban government, which
rules most of the country, has engaged in persecution and killing,
particularly against the Shiite minority. ''The Taliban enforced
its strict interpretation of Islamic Shari'a law, and, according to
reports, public executions, floggings and amputations took place
weekly against those who violated the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of China comes at a politically sensitive time,
with Congress due to vote this month on legislation to provide
permanent normal trade relations with China. It would eliminate
annual congressional reviews that linked normal trade ties with
China's human rights performance.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of China's record on religious freedom is not new.
Last October, China was among five countries described by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright as being ''particularly severe''
violators of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report said persecuted groups in China were subject to
''harassment, extortion, prolonged detention, physical abuse and
incarceration in prison or in 're-education through labor' camps.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There were credible reports of religious detainees being
beaten and tortured,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights from the report on other countries:
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, also known as Burma -- The government continued to
repress systematically members of both minority faiths and the
majority Buddhist population. ''Buddhist monks who promoted human
and political rights were arrested, and some Buddhist monasteries
were destroyed. Government security forces frequently employed
coercion to induce Christian members of the Chin ethnic minority to
convert to Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also found varying degrees of repression in communist
countries such as Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam. It found similar
problems in Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt,
Israel, Pakistan and Sudan. Meanwhile, the Arab population in
Israel was subjected to ''various forms of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that ''significant improvements'' have
occurred in Azerbaijan and Laos. In Azerbaijan, the report traced
the changed situation to a presidential pledge last November to
improve the status of religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Laos, the government released in mid-June a large number of
Christians who had been imprisoned because of their faith, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that there were noteworthy improvements in 31 other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Marines Osprey Aircraft To Fly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps V-22 Osprey aircraft that
were grounded Aug. 25 have been cleared to fly again, officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 11 Osprey aircraft resumed flying over the weekend
and the rest are expected to be back in the air by mid-September,
after they have been inspected, the Naval Air Systems Command
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Ospreys, which take off and land like a helicopter but fly
like an airplane, were grounded after one made a precautionary
landing at Camp Lejeune, N.C., on Aug. 24 and a subsequent
maintenance inspection revealed that a coupling on the aircraft's
drive shaft had come loose.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Ospreys are being checked for proper torque on
the coupling assembly, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey fleet had been out of operation for about two months
after one crashed in April during a training flight in Arizona,
killing all 19 Marines aboard. Investigators said the crash was
caused by mistakes made by the pilot and co-pilot, not a mechanical
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is built by Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the Ospreys were grounded the Marines also took
out of operation all 165 of their CH-53E Super Stallion transport
helicopters, based on findings from an investigation into the Aug.
10 crash of a Navy MH-53E mine-sweeping helicopter off the coast of
Corpus Cristi, Texas, in which four people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. David Nevers, a Marine spokesman, said Tuesday that the
Super Stallions remain grounded and that no date has been set for
their return to flight.
</P>
<P>
   A third type of Marine Corps aircraft -- the AH-1W Cobra attack
helicopter -- also was grounded on Aug. 25 because of a concern
about that some older rotor blades may be susceptible to cracking.
Most of the Cobras returned to flight within a few days.

<HEADLINE> USDA, Inspectors Spar Over Plants  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department sparred Tuesday
with representatives of its meat inspectors over whether a new
system for overseeing packing plants has improved the safety of
beef, pork and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives, who have long criticized the 4-year-old
science-based system, said it has given companies too much power to
police themselves and allowed unsafe meat to reach American
households.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not working and shows no sign of working in the
future,'' said Arthur Hughes, a spokesman for the National Joint
Council of Food Inspection Locals.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection system, supported by major consumer groups,
requires companies to identify potential hazards in slaughterhouses
and processing plants and implement controls for food-borne
pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, companies relied on USDA inspectors to find
contaminated meat by poking and sniffing it. The inspectors' jobs
now are to ensure that the plants follow their sanitation plans and
to do some microbial testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question'' that meat is safer under the new
system, said Thomas Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection Service. ''We have seen remarkable improvement, and we
expect that to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   A report released in June by USDA's inspector general agreed
that meat is safer but said Billy's agency had ''reduced its
oversight beyond what was prudent and necessary for the protection
of the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general said plants should be required to do more
testing of meat, and USDA's enforcement actions are inconsistent
and often ineffective in preventing repeat violations of federal
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Two advocacy groups that support the position of the inspectors'
union, the Government Accountability Project and Public Citizen,
released results of a survey that was distributed by union leaders
to about 2,340 of the 3,850 inspectors trained to oversee the new
system.
</P>
<P>
   Of those queried, 451 inspectors responded, and 210 reported
instances when they had not taken ''direct action'' after spotting
contamination such as feces on carcasses, something they would have
done under the old system. Inspectors also said they were
threatened with lawsuits by processors.
</P>
<P>
   Some inspectors also said that while they support the system in
concept, they don't think USDA has implemented it properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meat industry has been able to call the shots because of
their enormous political clout,'' said Wenonah Hauter of Public
Citizen, a group founded by Green Party presidential candidate
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Billy attributed the complaints to disgruntled inspectors but
said the survey results ''indicate we need to provide further
training and education for our employees.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Practices Judo in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin took time out Tuesday
from political talks in Japan to practice judo -- accepting flowers
from a 10-year-old Japanese girl who tossed him to the mat.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a black belt in the sport, visited a session for athletes
heading for the Sydney Olympics at the Kodokan Sports Palace with
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I am on a judo mat, I feel at home, not on a visit. When
I am with other people practicing judo, I feel as though I am with
close relatives,'' Putin said in remarks carried on Russian
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, the trim, 47-year-old Putin did a few traditional
stretches and then rumbled with one of the athletes. He then faced
the 10-year-old, who threw him to the floor to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   Putin left later Tuesday for the Millennium Summit at the United
Nations after two days of talks with Mori that failed to resolve a
prickly territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands, seized by the
Soviet Union at the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 7; Nasdaq Falls 73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech and pharmaceutical stocks fell amid
earnings warnings from analysts Tuesday, while the broader market
drifted in lackluster trading.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 7.40 at 11,246.18.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 73.01 to 4,161.32. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 14.45 to 1,506.32.
</P>
<P>
   With no big news to provide a clear direction for trading, the
market meandered, with indexes alternating between positive and
negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''September has typically been a very unclear month for the
market and after the very nice run we had in August, we've got some
profit-taking and maybe some developing concerns about reports for
third-quarter earnings,'' said Bill Barker, an investment strategy
consultant with Dain Rauscher Inc. in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions were the pharamceutical and tech sectors, which
fell overall.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $4.88 to $69.06 in early trading after a U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray analyst downgraded the computer chip maker's stock to
''buy'' from ''strong buy. Ashok Kumar said he was concerned that
continued weakness in demand could result in unit growth ''well
below consensus expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker stocks also fell, with Gateway dropping $4.59 to
$64.09 and Dell off $2.66 at $40.41.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical stocks fell slightly after Banc of America
Securities downgraded Merck to ''market perform'' from ''strong
buy'' and, at the same time, reduced estimates for the overall
pharmaceutical sector.
</P>
<P>
   Merck traded at $67.75, down $1.44. Pfizer was down $2.34 at
$40.81.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues trailed decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchanges, where volume came to 559.60 million shares.

<HEADLINE> Syria May Aid Ex-Lebanon Leader  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
chances of regaining his old job rose with his landslide
re-election to parliament, but neighboring Syria may have final say
over whether he takes back the post.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri, a billionaire who made his fortune in construction in
Saudi Arabia, said Tuesday he has not made up his mind whether he
wants to be prime minister again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's premature to talk about it now. It is a big mistake to
say that I am running for the post of the prime minister,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which dominates Lebanon militarily and politically, has
not made its position clear. Hariri is a friend of Syrian President
Bashar Assad and has economic investments in Syria. But Syria also
firmly supports Emile Lahoud, Lebanon's president and Hariri's
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1989 Arab-brokered peace plan that ended Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war, the president must name a prime minister after
polling the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two rounds of parliamentary elections for the
128-member legislature ended Sunday, more than 50 lawmakers were
reported to have voiced support for Hariri. Lahoud's choice,
current Prime Minister Salim Hoss, failed to win a seat in
parliament after a divisive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri extended an olive branch to Lahoud at his news conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hand will be extended to cooperate with political and
national leaders in the country and all legislators to reassert
Lebanon's presence on the Arab, regional and international map,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud vehemently opposes Hariri, who stepped down as prime
minister in 1998 after a power struggle with the president. If
Hariri seeks the post and his legislative allies support him,
Lahoud would have few options but to appoint him prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Sarkis Naoum, a political analyst for Lebanon's leading
newspaper, An-Nahar, said Hariri is waiting for the outcome of
discussions between Lahoud and Syria on the choice of prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Syria is seeking to reconcile conflicting Lebanese viewpoints
so as to ensure that the premiership issue will not lead to a
government crisis,'' Naoum said.
</P>
<P>
   Syria once did little to hide its hand in appointing Lebanese
leaders. Since Assad took over Lebanon policy for Syria in recent
years, open intervention has subsided -- in part because Syria has
the loyalty of every leading Lebanese politician.
</P>
<P>
   Assad became Syrian president earlier this year following the
death of his father, Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Syria is positively and optimistically looking at the results
of the Lebanese elections, which the Lebanese state has
accomplished peacefully,'' wrote Al-Baath newspaper, mouthpiece of
Syria's ruling Baath Party, in an editorial Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud has more than a month to begin consultations on naming a
new prime minister and the Hoss government does not have to resign
until the departing parliament's four-year mandate expires on Oct.
15.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1992-98 tenure, Hariri launched a multibillion-dollar
plan to rebuild Lebanon from the devastating civil war. He was
criticized harshly by the Hoss government for saddling the country
with $20 billion in debt and wasting public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss' failure to deliver on pledges to deal with Lebanon's
economic recession led voters to turn back to Hariri.

<HEADLINE> Woman charged with stealing from dead granddaughter's benefit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A woman is accused of stealing money
from a fund-raising event for her dying granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's attorney, Ronald R. Benjamin, called the charge
bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson City police on Monday charged Karen J. Horton, 53, of
Union, with fourth-degree grand larceny. Horton was released
following arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The charge stems from an Aug. 12 benefit for 5-year-old Felicia
Miller, who had terminal leukemia, said Detective Mark Wallikas.
The girl has since died. About $1,600 was raised at the event,
Wallikas said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles Club of Johnson City, where the benefit took place,
gave the check to Horton, an Eagles Club member. But instead of
sending all the money to her daughter, Samantha Spencer who is
Felicia's mother, Horton pocketed $1,400 of it, Wallikas said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallikas said Johnson City police began an investigation last
week after receiving a complaint from Spencer in Ocean Isle Beach,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   However, Horton told police she held the money because she was
going to take care of bills and because her daughter owed her, and
her husband, $800.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin called Horton's arrest ''outrageous.'' The $1,400 went
to pay medical and other bills for the dead girl, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin also said police should never have filed the charge
because Horton held on to most of the money with the permission of
the Eagles Club's board of directors. The board decided Spencer was
not responsible enough to handle the money herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Briggs, vice president of the Eagles Club, confirmed that
the board gave Horton responsibility for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these charges are bogus,'' Briggs agreed. He said Horton
had ''100-percent backing'' of the Eagles Club.

<HEADLINE> Court upholds Spitzer in Internet child porn investigation  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's highest court Tuesday upheld the
right of the state attorney general's office to seize an Internet
provider's records and make its employees testify before a grand
jury in an Internet pornography investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the Court of Appeals upheld lower court rulings
in the case against BuffNet of West Seneca. Prosecutors in Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer's office are seeking the records as part of
the investigation which began with an inquiry into ''Pedo
University,'' a virtual ''college'' which prosecutors allege was
formed for the exchange of pornographic photographs of preteen
children.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen people have been arrested in the United
States, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden as part of the pornography
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   BuffNet is one of several Internet providers that prosecutors
are looking into. BuffNet and employees of the Internet service
provider, which operates under the corporate name Marketing and
Advertising Services Center Corp., have not been accused of any
wrongdoing in the case in Erie County Court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling upholds a decision by the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court in Rochester. Those judges ruled in May that
the attorney general has ''broad investigative and prosecutorial
powers'' to look into child pornography on the Internet when cases
are referred to his office by the state police.
</P>
<P>
   BuffNet's lawyer had argued that the attorney general's power is
limited and that to allow him access to BuffNet corporate records
and employees' testimony would give him virtually unfettered
prosecutorial power in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Robin A. Forshaw, an assistant state attorney general, said the
case represents the first time that a ''protocol'' the attorney
general's office has worked out with the state police for such
referrals and prosecutions had been challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that has been happening for a while,'' she
said. ''We don't anticipate that this is going to open the
floodgates in getting us involved in all kinds of criminal
prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer spokesman Darren Dopp said the prosecution of child
pornography is nothing new, but when the illegal materials are
transmitted over the Internet authorities need new methods to
combat it.
</P>
<P>
   BuffNet's lawyer was not immediately available for comment. When
the company lost in May at the appellate division, company
executive Michael Hassett said BuffNet was only an unwilling
conduit for the transmission of pornographic materials. It would be
impossible to screen the traffic over the thousands of newsgroups
operating over BuffNet's service to weed out criminal activities,
Hassett said.
</P>
<P>
   In other rulings Tuesday by the Court of Appeals:
</P>
<P>
   -The judges agreed to decide a ''certified question'' for a
federal appeals court. The court will give its opinion on whether a
county can lay off partial liability on an inmate in its jail who
beat another inmate he had accused of informing on him.
</P>
<P>
   The injured inmate said there was a notation in his file which
told guards at the Nassau County Jail not to place him in a
situation where he could be accosted by the other inmate, who ended
up beating him severely with a broom handle. The county, hit with
an $800,000 judgment, is trying to make the attacking inmate also
liable.
</P>
<P>
   -The court refused to hear an appeal of a case absolving New
York City's board of education of responsibility for the beating a
student received on a city subway at the hands of some schoolmates.
The student had tried to contend that since the dispute originated
in school, the subway was essentially an extension of school
grounds and the board of education can be held liable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CASERTA, Italy (AP) -- With its marble-encrusted walls and its
frescoed rooms, the sumptuous Royal Palace was designed to be home
for the Spanish kings of Naples in the 18th century. On Tuesday, it
was occupied by a queen ---- along with Jedi Knights and the numerous
otherworldly creatures imagined by ''Star Wars'' director George
Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   The American director is in Caserta, 18 miles north of Naples,
for a two-day shoot of ''Star Wars: Episode II,'' the fifth movie
of the saga that started in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun to be directing again,'' Lucas said at a news
conference in the court theater inside the palace, which will serve
as a backdrop for Queen Amidala's planet, Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Episode II'' starts off about a decade after the end of ''Star
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' Anakin Skywalker, grown
into a teen-ager, learns the ways of the Force from Jedi Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor) and falls in love with
Natalie Portman's character, Amidala, the future mother of Luke and
Leia.
</P>
<P>
   Their love is doomed as Anakin begins his journey toward the
Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas says the film is a ''romantic story'' and ''basically a
fairy tale, but there's a lot of action, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the live-action scenes for ''Episode II,'' which is due
for release in 2002, will be shot using digital, high-definition
camcorders instead of film cameras. With ''Episode I,'' Lucas
pioneered digital projection in a few theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advance of cinema into the digital world is just a normal
transition that's taking place, an addition to the tools'' we use
to make movies, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   He likened it to the transition from frescoes to oil painting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oil painting freed the artists up to change his mind, go home
... and know that the colors they're using are going to stay
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of digital cameras also has been a time-saver on
numerous parts of the production. The first phase of the shooting
ended in late August in Australia; other locations for the
$150-million-movie include London and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Palace, nicknamed the ''Versailles of Naples'' for its
splendor, was completed in 1774 from plans by Italian architect
Luigi Vanvitelli. It is considered one of the greatest -- and last --
achievements of Italian Baroque architecture. Some scenes from
''The Phantom Menace'' also were filmed there.

<HEADLINE> New rules could lead to more use of video in civil trials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Videotaped testimony may soon become more
common in New Jersey courtrooms - and many attorneys are taking a
dim view of that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   They believe juries pay more attention to live witnesses and
that more videotaping could lead to increased costs.
</P>
<P>
   Videomakers, however, smell a bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   The potential windfall is courtesy of a committee of the state
Supreme Court, whose new rules making it harder for lawyers to
delay civil trials took effect Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to get lawsuits to trial more quickly. Lawyers now
get one postponement if an expert witness is unavailable, compared
with about six under the old rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a rule that's going to speed things up but at a cost,''
Teaneck lawyer Samuel L. Davis told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Tuesday's editions. He said videotaping costs could affect the
potential for settlement in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I risk not having (an expert), or do I invest what might be
half the value of a case (in videotape)? That's the dilemma,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaped testimony has been allowed for 20 years under certain
circumstances, such as the unavailability of an expert or the
illness of a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Such testimony resembles pretrial depositions but edited to
exclude statements a judge later rules are inadmissible
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in a civil trial are deposed beforehand, a proceeding
in which lawyers for all sides can attend and ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers routinely videotape these sessions, which provide much
of the work done by video companies such as IVP New Media of
Montclair.
</P>
<P>
   IVP president Michael R. DeCheser said the new rules will
''absolutely'' mean more business.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to add six videographers to the 12 he already uses
and purchase up to six more sets of video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To help lawyers keep costs under control, DeCheser said Tuesday
that IVP will offer streaming video of depositions on a secure Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   That will save travel costs: If three lawyers in a firm are
working on a case, two could stay in the office instead of spending
a day or week at a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules were written by the Committee of Presiding Civil
Judges, in an effort to speed litigation and create uniformity in
the state's trial courts, which are spread among the 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unavailability of expert witnesses is one of the most common
reasons for adjourning a trial and one of the greatest impediments
to providing trial date certainty,'' the judges said in a report
explaining the reasoning for the rule on adjournments caused by
expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The civil case backlog at the end of July stood at 52,513, down
8 percent from 57,288 a year earlier, according to the state's
Administrative Office of the Courts. A civil case is considered
part of the backlog if it is more than a year old.

<HEADLINE> Lazio manager thinks President Clinton may attend wife's first debate </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The campaign manager for Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Republican opponent in New York's U.S. Senate race said
Tuesday he has a ''sneaking suspicion'' President Clinton will show
up for his wife's first debate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that possibility, a spokesman for the first lady's
campaign, Howard Wolfson, would say only that the president's
schedule ''has not yet been determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, Rep. Rick Lazio's campaign manager, also said he
expects the first lady to be a ''formidable debater'' and that the
congressman spent half of his four-day vacation in the posh
Hamptons on the east end of Long Island last week ''in full debate
prep.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're up against somebody who's going to be a formidable
debater, has had seven years on the national stage under intense
pressure and has performed,'' Dal Col added. ''So, when we have to
go up against somebody like that, I want to make sure our candidate
is well prepared and he will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and Lazio are scheduled to have their first
debate on Sept. 13 in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a sitting president who's kind of bored. That's
been kind of obvious. He's trying to find things to do,'' said Dal
Col, who served as campaign manager for millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes' two failed attempts to win the GOP presidential nomination.
''Obviously, the Democratic nominee (for president) doesn't want
him around much ... (so) I got a sneaking suspicion he will be
there'' at his wife's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col also said he expects if the president does show up, ''he
will be working 'spin alley,''' the area where reporters covering
the debate would be working.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing a close race, both Clinton and Lazio are
looking to the first debate to give them a boost. The first lady,
who has never before been a candidate or in a political debate, has
also begun debate practice sessions, according to aides.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the two have already agreed to at least three debates.
</P>
<P>
   A possible downside for the first lady to having President
Clinton show up at the first debate is that it could overshadow her
performance. That, of course, could be an upside if she turns out
to lack debating skills.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there is some speculation, even within her own camp,
that she may want her husband on hand for moral support.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possible downside for the first lady of having
her husband attend or not, Dal Col said, ''I wouldn't want to get
into their family chemistry.''

<HEADLINE> Suspected Rebels Free Priest  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected guerrilla kidnappers have
freed a Catholic priest whose niece is leading polls to become
Colombia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Gerardo Sanin, 74, was released late Monday after six days
in captivity. He says he was abducted by members of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's
largest guerrilla insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have neither admitted nor denied their responsibility
in the kidnapping, whose motive remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Sanin is the uncle of former foreign minister and presidential
candidate Noemi Sanin, an independent candidate preparing for a new
presidential run in 2002. His kidnapping prompted an outcry from
the Roman Catholic Church and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after being freed, the white-bearded and bespectacled
Sanin celebrated an emotional Mass on Tuesday at his parish in a
working-class Bogota neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would forgive his captors, but nearly broke into
tears when recounting how he was forced to sleep on the chilly bare
earth while tied to a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Sanin said guerrillas walked him for hours down the mountains to
where they handed him over to fellow priests early Tuesday in
Zipaquira, a town 24 miles north of Bogota. He was abducted in the
same area Aug. 30 while on an errand to buy wood for repairs to his
parish.
</P>
<P>
   Sanin said he was in good health despite the difficult trek and
uncomfortable nights. He recalled being saved at one point from
tumbling into a steep ravine by rebel soldier who grabbed his arm
and prevented the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC is believed responsible for more than a fourth of the
roughly 3,000 kidnappings committed annually in this South American
country, mainly for ransom. The group concedes it kidnaps people to
finance its decades-old insurgency, though it rarely admits
responsibility in specific cases.

<HEADLINE> Politics professor asks state to reject Senate campaign  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A politics professor on Tuesday asked the
state Elections Enforcement Commission to declare Joseph
Lieberman's Senate campaign ''frivolous'' and order him off the
state ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president, had
already announced his intention to run for re-election when Al Gore
selected him to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has since said he will continue both campaigns.
Although the decision has drawn sporadic criticism from both
Republicans and Democrats, officials - including Secretary of the
State Susan Bysiewicz, a Democrat, and Gov. John G. Rowland, a
Republican - have said state law allows Lieberman to conduct the
simultaneous campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Fairfield University Professor John Orman contends in a
complaint hand-delivered to election regulators Tuesday that
Lieberman's candidacy is illegal because he would not serve in the
Senate if elected to both offices.
</P>
<P>
   Orman also contends the dual candidacies give Lieberman an
unfair advantage in fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein said Tuesday ''there is nothing
frivolous about Senator Lieberman's campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the situation is unusual - the last similar
case was in Texas in 1988, when Lloyd Bentsen ran for vice
president and the Senate - Gerstein said Lieberman welcomed debate
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Lieberman ''takes his responsibilities as a senator
and as a candidate very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing in the world he would do is take the people of
Connecticut for granted,'' Gerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Orman, who has been with the Roman Catholic university since
1978, said the commission has a statutory duty to remove frivolous
candidates from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Lieberman's two candidacies ... qualify for the label of
'frivolous' because his Connecticut senatorial campaign lacks
seriousness and it is irresponsibly self-indulgent,'' Orman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The implicit agreement between any candidate and the
Connecticut electorate is that the candidate who runs for office
must first say, 'I promise, if elected to the office for which I
run, I will serve,''' he wrote. ''Without this implicit guarantee,
the candidacy would be a joke!''
</P>
<P>
   Orman also said Lieberman's vice presidential campaign promotes
his Senate campaign as well, even though the campaigns are funded
separately.
</P>
<P>
   ''This violates the intent of campaign finance laws and confuses
the voter,'' Orman said.
</P>
<P>
   The elections commission will decide this week whether it has
jurisdiction in the matter, said the panel's deputy director,
Albert Lenge. If so, it will hold a hearing on Orman's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its effect on presidential politics, Lieberman's Senate
race has implications for the balance of power in the Congress. If
Lieberman were elected to both jobs and resigned from the Senate,
it would fall to Rowland to appoint a replacement who would serve
until the next statewide election in 2002. Rowland has said he will
appoint a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, considered the prohibitive favorite over Republican
Philip Giordano, the mayor of Waterbury, could drop out of the
Senate race as late as Oct. 27 and still be replaced by a
Democratic Party nominee.

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers to world leaders: why all those cars?  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The world has literally converged on Manhattan.
New Yorkers can understand why more than 150 world leaders and
heads of state wanted to fly in for the United Nations Millennium
Summit, but why do they need all those cars?
</P>
<P>
   City officials spelled out the bad news last week - expect up to
175 motorcades featuring 1,300 vehicles per day during the summit
that runs Wednesday through Friday. TAKE THE SUBWAYS, the mayor
begged.
</P>
<P>
   Then the death knell was sounded when police announced this
doozy: streets will be closed willy-nilly if dignitaries need to be
moved.
</P>
<P>
   And with the VIPS staying in 34 hotels and private residences
all over Manhattan, many residents could be affected, like Tara
Oliver, who lives near the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Her usual two-block walk to the subway turned into an
eight-block journey as she had to negotiate around blocked off
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''How long are they in town?'' Oliver asked wearily during her
lunchbreak in downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Long enough, Tara, for the police to come up with ''Stage 1''
and ''Stage 2'' levels of street closures. The list is specific and
vague at the same time. Specific: First Avenue will be closed to
vehicular traffic between 34th Street and 49th Street beginning
Wednesday at 6 a.m. through Friday at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Vague: You cannot stand or park on 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th,
39th, 40th, 42nd, 44th, 45th, 46th streets between the East River
and Second Avenue from Wednesday at 6 a.m. through Friday at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But parking or standing on 41st Street is OK?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crazy, but the cops have been pretty patient, trying to
explain all the rules,'' said Bart Grishom, who lives in one of the
summit's no parking, no standing zones.
</P>
<P>
   It's crazy for a reason. Although much of the summit's business
is taking place at the U.N., there's also several receptions being
held in a variety of places. It doesn't help that President Clinton
is attending AND hosting several receptions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton and his entourage are staying at the
Waldorf-Astoria at Park Avenue and 50th Street. He and his
motorcade then must travel to the U.N. at First Avenue (the complex
runs from 42nd to 48th streets). Back and forth, back and forth.
Open streets, closed streets.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Clinton is holding a reception for
world leaders at the Metropolitan Museum of Art at Fifth Avenue and
82nd Street. What this means is road closures all over Manhattan's
East Side as all those motorcades converge on the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the 91 planned demonstrations near the U.N. police
will have to close streets for. They have to do to the same for the
unplanned ones as well.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a bright side to all of this. During Oliver's
meandering walk to the subway, she discovered a restaurant she'd
like to try. After all, the summit ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be worse,'' she said. ''At least we have the subway.
I don't expect to see any world leaders down there.''

<HEADLINE> French Genetic Food Fight Case Opens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOIX, France (AP) -- Four advocates of traditional farming went
on trial Tuesday in this southern French city on charges of
destroying a field planted with genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 activists rallied in support of the four who are
accused of tearing up a rapeseed field last year to protest
genetically modified foods that they say pose health risks.
</P>
<P>
   The rapeseed field, destroyed in June 1999, was the site of
research carried out by a center under the country's Agriculture
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Jouffret, director of the CETIOM research group, said the
field was intended merely for crop safety research and posed no
health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The controlled experiment was designed to provide information
on controversial genetically modified products, and it's
regrettable that the (field's) destruction caused us to lose
time,'' Jouffret told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The activists on trial said they were protesting ''complicity
between public research and multinational companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to genetically modified foods has been very strong in
France, where only a few such crops are authorized for planting.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four on trial, three are members of the Green Party and
the fourth is a member of a radical farm group.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Look At IRA, 401K Plans  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman William
Roth, namesake of the popular Roth IRA, unveiled legislation
Tuesday that would create a similar 401(k) and raise contribution
limits for individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite a roaring economy, many Americans still are not saving
enough money for retirement,'' said Roth, R-Del. ''We need to make
it easier and more appealing for Americans to save for retirement,
both through their employers and through their own individual
retirement accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, similar to a measure the House passed overwhelmingly
in July, would raise annual contribution limits to 401(k) plans
from $10,500 to $15,000. For IRAs, the limits would rise from
$2,000 to $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A new 401(k) option would be created that, like the Roth IRA
embraced by millions of people, would let people contribute
after-tax dollars that could later be withdrawn tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   There also would be a ''catch-up'' provision for people over 50
to contribute up to $7,500 a year to an IRA, aimed primarily at
women who left the work force to raise children and haven't been
able to keep pace with their retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which opposed the House bill, reacted coolly to
the latest measure as well but has not issued a veto threat.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the bill could make it
easier for businesses to provide pensions for top executives while
not helping rank-and-file employees and lower-income people who
don't have retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the highest priority needs to be on helping those who
don't take advantage of any tax-favored savings right now,''
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore support creation of
retirement savings accounts for lower-income people in which the
government would provide a match in the form of a tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Democrats in Congress support the concepts in the Roth
legislation, which will be brought to the Senate floor this month
under budget rules that limit debate and amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many of these provisions have Democratic sponsors,'' said
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. ''I am optimistic we can arrive at a
bipartisan consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the bill could become a vehicle for several other
end-of-session tax provisions as Congress searches for concrete
accomplishments to show voters. Other candidates include repeal of
the 3 percent telephone excise tax and a 10-year, $76 billion
package of business tax breaks coupled with a $1 increase in the
$5.15 minimum wage over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Democrats would
consider the overall cost of all these tax cuts in deciding whether
to support Roth's retirement package.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much are we going to spend on tax cuts when you add up all
these bills?'' Daschle said. ''We've got to look at the cost in
addition to the policy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth's retirement measure would also:
</P>
<P>
   --Create a tax credit to offset the first three years of costs
for small businesses that start new retirement plans for their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   --Reduce from five years to three years the time it would take an
employee to be fully vested in an employer's retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   --Require a company to provide workers with a written notice,
including examples and explanation of rights, when a pension plan
is converted to a ''cash balance'' or other hybrid program that
could reduce their long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>

   The House bill is H.R. 1102.

<HEADLINE> US, ASCAP, Agree on Music Order  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department and the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) agreed Tuesday
to modernize a 59-year-old court order to bring the licensing of
music for performances into the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   The original court order, entered in 1941 and amended several
times including in 1950, requires ASCAP to provide performance
licenses to music users upon request and to distribute the fees
from those licenses to its members.
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in New York, ASCAP grants licenses and collects
fees for the use of music written or published by its members.
ASCAP currently licenses about half of all musical performances in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The department said the revisions were the product of extensive
negotiations with ASCAP. The department's antitrust division has
been reviewing the music performance rights industry, including the
ASCAP court order and a similar decree covering Broadcast Music
Inc. (BMI). The government the review of the BMI order is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   After half a century of dramatic change in the music industry,
the government and ASCAP agreed on four modifications to improve
competition in music licensing and update procedures for settling
fee disputes. They would:
</P>
<P>
   --Expand and clarify ASCAP's obligation to offer certain types of
music users, including background music providers and Internet
companies, a genuine alternative to a blanket license;
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminate many detailed restrictions on ASCAP's relations with
its members;
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that ASCAP members can switch to another performing
rights organization with penalty, and
</P>
<P>
   --Streamline license fee determination proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed modifications should increase competition in the
licensing of music performance rights, reduce unnecessary
administrative burdens and improve music users' ability to resolve
rate disputes with ASCAP,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel I.
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   The original court order resolved an antitrust case brought by
the division charging that ASCAP and certain of its members agreed
to restrict competition in licensing of performance rights and
discriminated against certain members in managing those rights.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed modifications were filed in U.S. District Court in
White Plains, N.Y. The government asked the court to allow 60 days
for public comment before implementing any revisions.
</P>
<P>
   The government also asked the court to consolidate into any
revised decree the provisions of a second court order, filed in
1947, that govern ASCAP's relations with foreign performance rights
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Girl Athletes Told To Watch Diet  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Girl athletes should be watched closely to make
sure that their training doesn't include poor eating habits that
could result in damaging bone loss, the American Academy of
Pediatrics says.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, coaches and parents also should be alert for missed or
delayed menstrual periods, which may result from inadequate food
intake, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment to solve such problems may involve taking a break from
sports, the academy said in the September issue of the journal
Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of calories, weight and body fat may throw the
reproductive system off-kilter, disrupting the production of sex
hormones and resulting in low estrogen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Because estrogen helps maintain bone density, such girls run the
risk of stress fractures and are more prone to developing
osteoporosis in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that as many as 66 percent of women in some
sports stop having menstrual periods for several months, another
effect of low estrogen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the prevalence is not known, anecdotal evidence suggests
it affects many girls ranging from participants in school sports to
those training for the Olympics, said Dr. Miriam Johnson, a sports
medicine specialist and member of an academy committee that wrote
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment may include establishing healthy eating habits,
quitting sports until gaining weight and hormone supplements in
older teens and young women, the academy said.

<HEADLINE> Mayor conditionally supports casino gambling in city  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday he would
support casino gambling in the city as long as a portion of the
revenue stayed in the city and the casinos were kept free of
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that if they allow casino gambling in New
York, then New York City should be a part of that, because it would
be just another way of diverting money out of the city,'' said
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the mayor supported building a gambling casino on
relatively isolated Governors Island, but his comments Tuesday were
the first time he has publicly backed such gambling ventures in
other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made his remarks in response to a question about
developer Donald Trump's plans to team with a Native American tribe
in order to open a casino on the west side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the operation of a casino would have to be carried
out ''in a controlled and sensible and regulated way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two things to be careful of with casino gambling,''
said Giuliani. ''Organized crime, so you have to create a thorough,
very tough commission that keeps organized crime out ... (and)
there's the second thing, (that) the money should find its way into
the local community as well as going to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added: ''You accomplish both those purposes, then I
would be in favor of casino gambling. Donald Trump or anyone
else.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns on Circumcision Clamps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors should examine carefully two popular
surgical clamps used for circumcising newborns, the Food and Drug
Administration warned, after it received reports that worn-out or
misassembled clamps have injured some infants.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is rare, said the FDA alert e-mailed to doctors'
groups. Since 1996, the FDA has collected 105 reports of injuries
linked to the two clamps, out of the 1.2 million circumcisions
performed annually. The injuries ranged from bleeding to urethral
damage. In four cases, the tip of the penis was amputated, which
required surgical repair or reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern was these could be ... prevented,'' FDA's David
Daly, who investigates problems with medical devices, said Tuesday.
''Even though the number isn't extensive, we feel it's important''
to warn doctors.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are two types of clamps widely used to hold the
foreskin away from the penis so doctors can cut it: the
Gomco/gomco-type and Mogen/mogen-type clamps.
</P>
<P>
   Among the FDA's recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   --Doctors should examine each clamp before each circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   --Discard any clamp that has nicks, stripped threads or misshapen
parts.
</P>
<P>
   --Be careful to reassemble clamps properly after cleaning and
ensure the original manufacturer sends the right part if a
replacement is needed. Misassembled clamps, or those reassembled
using parts from different manufacturers, have failed. Despite
visual similarities, clamp parts are not always interchangeable.

<HEADLINE> Ohio prosecutor says 'Dr. Death' to plead guilty  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Former physician Michael Swango is
expected to plead guilty to federal charges Wednesday in New York
that he killed three patients at a Long Island veterans' hospital,
prosecutors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A nine count federal indictment handed down July 11 charged
Swango with three counts of murder, one count of assault, three
counts of making false statements and two counts of scheming to
defraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's admitting to what he's charged with and that's it,''
Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's admission to making false statements will lead Franklin
County to charge him with aggravated murder in the poisoning of
Cynthia Ann McGee on Jan. 14, 1984, at Ohio State University's
hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The expected admission to making false statements gives
prosecutors in Ohio enough evidence to pursue the charge, O'Brien
said. The only evidence available previously was circumstantial, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse at the hospital had told investigators she witnessed
Swango taking a syringe into McGee's hospital room about an hour
before McGee's death, O'Brien said. Swango had said he was going to
draw blood but never did, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the kind of thing he has done before that followed
him wherever he went,'' O'Brien said. ''We had suspicions about all
of the deaths. What we were missing is a level of evidence. We
could not bring charges against him in the McGee case without an
admission from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Swango, a former intern at Ohio State University Hospitals, in
July had pleaded innocent in the 1993 deaths at the Veterans
Affairs Hospital in Northport.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New York said Swango was expected in
court Wednesday. A court order prohibited them from commenting
further.
</P>
<P>
   Swango also is suspected of poisoning patients in Zimbabwe and
spent time in prison for poisoning co-workers in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   While Swango had been charged with only three murders, the
indictment alleged he was responsible for McGee's death and the
poisoning of another victim, Rena Cooper, at the OSU hospital in
February 1984. Cooper survived but was paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said charges will not be pursued in Cooper's case
because too much time has passed under Ohio law.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was accused of the New York killings July 11, just days
before he was to be released from a federal prison in Colorado on
charges that he lied about his criminal past to get his job at
Stony Brook, the medical school that ran the VA hospital where the
deaths occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of injecting the three patients with toxins. In
two of the cases, he told hospital staff the patients' families had
issued ''do not resuscitate'' orders, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth patient also died of suspected poisoning, but
prosecutors said they had evidence only for an assault charge in
that case.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was in the Colorado prison after admitting he failed to
disclose to Stony Brook officials that he had spent 30 months in
jail and lost his medical license in 1985 for poisoning six
co-workers in Quincy, Ill. No one died in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also suspect Swango may have poisoned patients at
hospitals in Zimbabwe, where he worked in 1994 after being fired by
Stony Brook.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Are Applying to Med School  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of applicants to the nation's 125
medical schools fell for the third straight year in 1999, in part
because of the booming economy and the changing face of medicine,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The 38,529 applicants for last year's freshman class represent a
6 percent decline from 1998, when there were 41,004 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   And despite gains over the years, blacks and Hispanics are still
underrepresented among applicants, students and admissions
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were contained in studies published in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drop in applicants -- 9.1 percent -- was seen among
men, while the number of female applicants fell 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Barzansky of the AMA's undergraduate medical education
division, who led the overall enrollment study, suggested the
economy has been so strong that potential applicants might be
choosing other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Also, doctors are having more trouble finding practices, and
medicine has changed so much, with increased paperwork and
insurance regulations, that many doctors say they would not enter
the field again, Barzansky said. She also said the average medical
school graduate last year was $90,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   While schools in the past decade have begun programs to increase
racial diversity, attacks on affirmative action programs in some
states have created a more hostile climate for minorities in
medicine, the researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
   One study found that the number of black, Hispanic and American
Indian applicants fell by nearly 7 percent last year, from 4,487 in
1998 to 4,181. Of last year's first-year class, 7.9 percent were
black, 6.9 percent were Hispanic, 19.4 percent were Asian or
Pacific Islander and 0.7 percent were American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. population is 12 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic, 4
Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.7 percent American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is a lack of blacks and Hispanics on
admissions committees, researchers said. Of 85 medical schools
surveyed, half had two or fewer minorities on their committees and
11 had none.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers speculated that recruitment of minority
admissions officers could promote diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 87 percent of the committees had at least one minority
member, a substantial gain from just 55 percent in 1972, said the
researchers, Drs. Douglas Kondo of the Menninger Clinic and
Victoria Judd of the University of Utah. The committees had an
average of 16 members.

<HEADLINE> SmithKline, House Dispute Documents  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SmithKline Beecham and a House committee
investigating drug prices remained at odds Tuesday over how many
documents the company will give the panel.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee spokesman Peter Sheffield said
SmithKine had agreed to provide two of the 11 requested documents,
adding that the panel is considering ''all the legal options
available,'' including subpoenaing the remaining documents.
</P>
<P>
   The committee wants the information so it can determine if the
company is overcharging the Medicare system for Kytril, a drug that
prevents nausea in cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline spokesman Jeremy Hymsfeld declined to discuss the
negotiations but said the company has ''already produced a
significant volume of responsive documents.'' He said the company
believes the disputed documents are ''protected by attorney-client
privilege, which is at the heart of the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee had given SmithKline, whose American headquarters
is in Philadelphia, until noon Tuesday to produce the 11 documents.
Previously, the firm had submitted several boxes of documents in
response to a May request by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline is one of seven companies the committee is
investigating after a Department of Health and Human Services
Report alleged that Medicare could have saved $447 million if drug
prices had been lower.
</P>
<P>
   HHS' Office of Inspector General concluded that the Health Care
Financing Administration pays more for 22 drugs, including Kytril,
because those companies charge higher-than-wholesale prices to
physicians being reimbursed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline announced Thursday that it would sell Kytril to Roche
AG, of Switzerland, for $1.23 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture is part of an effort to win regulatory approval
for SmithKline's pending $75 billion merger with another British
drug maker, Glaxo Wellcome PLC. That deal, approved by shareholders
of each company, is scheduled to close on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome markets Zofran for chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fears Year-End Budget Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bothered by the election-season leverage
wielded by President Clinton, Republican leaders expressed worry
Tuesday that Democrats will try to provoke a year-end budget
standoff as Congress rushes to finish its annual spending work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned the White House wants to create a mess at the
end of the session for political purposes,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters as lawmakers filtered back to
the Capitol after their August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and
other Republicans said they would not let such brinksmanship
escalate into a federal shutdown, such as two that wounded the GOP
in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Republicans said they believe Democrats will try to
grind Congress' work to a crawl to minimize GOP accomplishments,
highlight Democratic demands for gun safety and other popular
issues and keep Republicans from going home to campaign for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said ''we have no
interest'' in forcing a closure of federal agencies just before the
elections. Indeed, with close races for control of the White House
and House and an outside shot at winning a Senate majority,
Democrats must be careful to not press their hand too far and risk
a public backlash.
</P>
<P>
   With the election so near, ''I don't think either side is going
to want to rock the boat'' with a budget standoff, Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said.
</P>
<P>
   But with just two of the 13 spending bills necessary for the
coming fiscal year signed into law -- covering most defense accounts
-- Clinton and Democrats are saying little to ease the worries of
many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With fiscal 2001 beginning Oct. 1, both sides know the GOP will
have to yield to most of Clinton's demands for billions in extra
domestic and foreign aid spending before remaining bills can be
signed and lawmakers can return to their districts. The two sides
also have numerous policy differences, such as how to spend extra
education dollars that will be provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to breaking the legislative logjam,'' Clinton
said after discussing legislative strategy at the White House with
Democratic leaders Tuesday morning. ''But we have to move forward
with fiscal responsibility, with responsible tax cuts and with
public investments that give all our people a chance and fuel our
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's comments generally underlined what Democrats'
demands would be, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was
more succinct about their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going anywhere until we're satisfied,'' Daschle told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 incomplete bills cover the budgets of 13 Cabinet level
agencies from the Agriculture Department to Veterans' Affairs, plus
spending for Congress, the courts and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Though spending legislation will be Congress' chief focus in its
remaining five scheduled weeks, lawmakers also will devote time to
other items. These include some measures that have virtually no
chance of becoming law but will allow one party or the other to
make political statements in time for the presidential and
congressional elections, now just nine weeks off.
</P>
<P>
   The House plans to vote Thursday to override Clinton's veto of a
bill phasing out estate taxes. That effort and one next week
against Clinton's veto of a bill cutting taxes for many married
couples are virtually sure to fail but will let Republicans argue
that taxes would go down with a Republican in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope, however, to pass tax bills this year expanding
the amounts people can contribute to IRAs and 401(k) plans,
repealing the 3 percent telephone excise tax and providing $6
billion in tax breaks over five years to spur investment in poor
urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope for small business tax breaks that they have
attached to a bill designed to meet Clinton's demand to boost the
$5.15-an-hour minimum wage by $1 hourly by Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Daschle said Democrats will continue trying to force
votes on issues they want to spotlight for the elections, such as
increased rights for managed-care patients, gun safety and the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for approval this session of broad new prescription drug
coverage are all but dead, amid partisan differences over the
program's scope and the desire by some Democrats to keep the
dispute as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans already are discussing a scaled-down,
$25 billion to $40 billion version over five years that would give
states money to cover some low-income senior citizens, which they
think would let the GOP argue it had at least advanced something on
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That would be far smaller than the $158 billion, 10-year plan
that GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush proposed Tuesday or
the $253 billion version supported by Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also seems likely to provide final legislative
approval next week to a bill that would permanently extend normal
trade relations to China.

<HEADLINE> National Grid buys Niagara Mohawk in $3 billion deal  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - National Grid Group, the world's largest
independent electric transmission company, will pay more than $3
billion in cash and stock to acquire Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The power company that serves 1.55 million electricity customers
in New York state would eventually merge with another electric
system that National Grid owns and operates in three New England
states.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting company will be the ninth largest utility in the
United States with more than 3.3 million customers over
29,000-square miles.
</P>
<P>
   For Niagara Mohawk customers, there will be few visible
differences, except for possibly lower rates, said William E.
Davis, chairman and chief executive of Niagara Mohawk.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will really be very little change. Customers will call
the same numbers. They will get the same call center. The call
center will deploy the same crews in the same trucks,'' Davis said.
He will become chairman of National Grid USA and will join National
Grid's board as an executive director for two years after the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the longer term, for the average person, we should see the
opportunity to create efficiencies and synergies that will keep
reducing our cost structure ... and lead to more stable and reduced
prices,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk will continue to operate under its own name and
keep its headquarters in Syracuse, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This transaction is in the best interests of our shareholders
and will yield significant benefits for our customers, employees
and the communities we serve,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning that, the chair of the state Assembly's energy
chairman called for ''an unprecedented level of scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While this acquisition is promising a 37 percent premium on
equity for NiMo's shareholders, there is no such guarantee for the
consumer under the equation,'' said Democratic Assemblyman Paul
Tonko, of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Tonko said the proposal failed to address consumer investment in
NiMo infrastructure, intentions for NiMo's natural gas division,
the effect on NiMo's work force and what the deal would mean for
stranded cost recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state is enduring under the cloud of an energy price
crisis,'' he said, ''I again call on the governor and my colleagues
in the Senate to come to the negotiating table and solve the energy
price crisis in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk is the third U.S. utility purchased by National
Grid, a London-based company created in 1990 following the breakup
of Britain's state-owned power system. National Grid builds, owns
and operates electric transmission and telecommunications networks
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, National Grid spent $3.2 billion to purchase
the New England Electric System, a utility with subsidiaries in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. New England
Electric, in turn, bought Eastern Utilities Associates, which
operates in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, for $642 million. The
merged companies became National Grid USA.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid USA expects that within four years it will save as
much as $90 million annually through consolidation and improved
efficiency across its New England and New York operations as a
result of the merger, said Richard Sergel, president and CEO of
National Grid USA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, all customers benefit if you can move the power
around and get the lowest-cost power being generated at any time,
Sergel said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed deal, which must receive approval from
shareholders of both companies as well as state and federal
regulators, Niagara Mohawk shareholders will receive about $19 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk stock opened the day trading on the New York
Stock Exchange at $17 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion represents a premium over the Niagara Mohawk's
market value of about $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which doubles the size of National Grid USA, is
expected to be completed by late 2001.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid USA will have a work force of approximately 10,000
once it absorbs about 6,200 Niagara Mohawk workers.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk will continue to search for a buyer for its two
Lake Ontario nuclear plants, which employ roughly 1,300 people.
Sergel said National Grid is not interested in the nuclear plants,
which are to be sold before completion of the acquisition. Over the
past two years, Niagara Mohawk has sold off all its fossil fuel and
hydro power plants as it transforms itself from an energy producer
into an energy supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Sergel said National Grid USA expected to reduce its overall
work force by between 500 and 750 workers over a four-year period
following completion of the purchase. He said the company expected
it could achieve those cuts through attrition and voluntary
programs and could avoid layoffs, although officials declined to
guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   When it acquired New England Electric and EUA, National Grid USA
trimmed approximately 300 jobs without layoffs, Sergel said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is part of a trend as the country's energy industry
restructures itself.
</P>
<P>
   New York's largest power company, Con Edison, also is in the
process of being bought out by Connecticut-based Northeast
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp. recently announced the acquisition
of GPU Inc., which owns utilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
And Entergy Corp. of Louisiana recently announced a merger with FPL
Group, the parent of Florida Power &AMP; Light, to create the nation's
largest electric company.

<HEADLINE> Lost at sea: Five days later, still no sign of F-16 wreckage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIGANTINE, N.J. (AP) - Five days after it plunged into the
Atlantic Ocean, an F-16 fighter jet remained missing Tuesday,
eluding a salvage contractor scanning the ocean floor in search of
the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Tow, a marine salvage company based here, has been hired to
recover the jet, which is believed to be sunken in waters 1.5 miles
east of Brigantine.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of witnesses - including lifeguards, beachgoers and
others - watched Thursday as an Air National Guard pilot ditched
the plane in the water and ejected safely after developing engine
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the $18 million jet centered on a one-square mile
area of the ocean, according to Col. John Dwyer, spokesman for the
New Jersey Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''They went to all those places where people said it crashed,
and we haven't located it. They're back out today,'' said Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   The jet, one of four planes from the 177th Fighter Wing on
training exercises over the ocean, was steered out to sea after the
pilot decided not to try a landing at Atlantic City International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, whose name hasn't been released, parachuted into the
ocean and was rescued unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the downed plane began Friday, with state police
divers setting out to map the debris field and determine the number
and size of the wreckage pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But it hadn't been found as of Tuesday afternoon, Dwyer said. He
compared the search to looking for a sunken pickup truck in a
square-mile area of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Tow officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Homes Lobby for Funds  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government efforts to trim the growth of
Medicare payments are wreaking financial havoc on the nation's
nursing homes, industry leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, five of the nation's 10 largest nursing home chains
have filed bankruptcy, nursing home advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bankruptcies among skilled nursing facilities have reached an
alarming figure,'' Dr. Charles Roadman II, president of the
American Health Care Association, told the Senate Special Committee
on Aging. ''This is just the tip of the iceberg. Our long term care
community is facing a squeeze with the real potential for absolute
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders are lobbying the government to increase the
Medicare payments homes receive for patient care.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the
committee, said he is unconvinced the nursing home industry needs
more money. President Clinton has proposed increasing Medicare
nursing home payments by about $1 billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said there is little evidence that patient care has
been jeopardized by Medicare reforms that took effect in 1998 and
established fixed payments for services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nursing home industry blames the government for its
financial problems and wants more money,'' Grassley said. American
taxpayers contribute $39 billion annually in federal money to
nursing homes through Medicare and Medicaid, Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some nursing home companies are suffering from bad business
decisions based on past practices where many Medicare
reimbursements from the government were essentially unlimited,
Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their investors and bankers gambled on a vision of
ever-growing government largesse,'' Grassley said. ''They got hurt
because this vision wasn't based on reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dummit, associate director of health financing and public
health issues for the General Accounting Office, said her agency's
study found that the new payment plan provides ''sufficient -- and
in some cases, even generous -- compensation for services furnished
to Medicare beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 17,000 nursing home in the United States. The five
companies that have gone bankrupt in the last two years -- Vencor,
Genesis Health Ventures, Sun Health Care, Integrated Health
Services and Mariner -- operate about 1,800 of those homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, about 75 nursing home advocates rallied on the Capitol
steps to urge Congress to pass more funding. They complained of
staffing shortages and severely ill patients, who might require
expensive treatments, being turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm out on the front line,'' said Karen Shelangoski, a nurse
from Davenport, Iowa. ''They (lawmakers) don't know what it's all
about.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico President Digs Up Past  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Soldiers open fire on thousands of peaceful
demonstrators. A presidential candidate is gunned down on a
campaign stop. The government spends $100 billion to buy overvalued
bad loans, some from its own supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has a lot of dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   During the 71 years that Mexico in effect had one-party rule,
the secrets lay buried. But now the Institutional Revolutionary
Party is out of office, and the new president, Vicente Fox, is
pledged to eradicate the corruption that pervades Mexican society.
</P>
<P>
   He says that one of the first things he will do after he is
sworn in Dec. 1 is have Mexico's Congress set up a ''Transparency
Commission'' to start digging into the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is essential for Mexico's new democracy,'' said Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, a senator and key member of Fox's transition team.
''But this is a very difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be the sternest test of Fox's credentials as a
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the commission -- including how many cases it would
take on and what subpoena powers it might have -- have yet to be
worked out. But among the cases Congress could consider:
</P>
<P>
   --A banking scandal in which loans to ruling party supporters
were never repaid -- and then were absorbed by the government as
part of a $100 billion, taxpayer-funded bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   --Lingering suspicions that shadowy, still-unidentified figures
might have played a part in several high-profile murders, including
that of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio,
who was gunned down at a campaign stop in Tijuana in March 1994,
and that of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, who
died in a fusillade of bullets at Guadalajara's airport in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   --The stunning assault on a peaceful democracy protest Oct. 2,
1968, in Tlatelolco Plaza in Mexico City that killed hundreds. The
exact number of dead remains unknown, and it is unclear who ordered
a security battalion to open fire on the unarmed crowd of mostly
university students.
</P>
<P>
   Other unhealed wounds include the disappearance of hundreds of
leftists during an army crackdown on guerrilla bands in the 1970s,
the unsolved killings of hundreds of opposition party activists
over the past 12 years, and the work of domestic intelligence
agencies that opposition parties have long accused of political
spying.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that a war on big corruption will set an example
that will stamp out the petty corruption which people tend to take
as a harmless fact of everyday life. Motorists avoid a traffic
ticket by forking over a few dollars to the cop as casually as they
would tip a waiter. Bar owners slip an official a few hundred
dollars for a liquor license rather than take on the bureaucracy.
Some journalists support themselves with the money they receive for
writing favorable articles, and government purchasers pocket up to
10 percent of any contract.
</P>
<P>
   Delal Baer, a Mexico specialist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, sees a risky balancing act
ahead, lest the housecleaning become ''a witch hunt'' that could
bring the whole house down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexico is in a bind,'' she said. ''You need to be careful not
to destroy your entire establishment because much of that
establishment is also good. But by the same token you need to meet
people's expectations that rule of law is not an empty promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that such a commission under the control of Congress
could get bogged down in politics and end in failure, dragging
Fox's administration down with it.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans aren't encouraged by the Italian example, in which a
sweeping corruption cleanup implicated so many politicians,
businessmen and bureaucrats that the courts were clogged and
accusations were made that the investigation had turned political.
</P>
<P>
   But Aguilar Zinser said Mexico's cleansing must involve all
political parties -- including Fox's National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the fear that given Mexico's record of political
violence, the deeper the investigators dig, the greater the
physical risk to them will be. ''Obviously this is going to be a
dangerous task,'' Aguilar Zinser said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jesus Zambrano, secretary-general of the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, said an investigation is ''absolutely necessary
and indispensable in proving that the new government wants to
combat corruption and impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, everyone seems to welcome the idea, even the outgoing
government, which sees it as a means of regaining credibility. And
anyway, the plan is so popular that it would be political suicide
for anybody to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he is sworn in, Fox's transitional team will hand
Congress a detailed proposal laying out the groundwork for the
investigation, including the constitutional reforms needed to give
lawmakers the legal muscle to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will appoint the commission's members and choose the
cases to be investigated. An overhauled, more independent agency
modeled on the FBI will aid Congress and take on investigations of
private individuals who participated in government corruption,
Aguilar Zinser said.
</P>
<P>
   He said all cases with enough evidence will be handed over to
the courts.

<HEADLINE> Study says workers' comp rates up for manufacturers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Workers' compensation rates for
manufacturers were considerably higher in New York than the rest of
the nation during the last two years despite a state government
campaign to lower premiums, a business group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that in the year ending Jan. 1, 2000, workers'
comp rates paid by manufacturers were just under 30 percent more
than the national average. New York's charge ranked 36 out of 45
states whose premium systems were comparable.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous year, which ended Jan. 1, 1999, New York
manufacturers paid workers' comp rates that were 20.9 percent
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The national study is performed independently each year by
Actuarial &AMP; Technical Solutions of Ronkonkoma on Long Island and
its New York state numbers were analyzed by the Business Council
lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Business Council President Daniel Walsh said the statistics show
''we are moving in the wrong direction compared to competing
states'' on workers' comp rates. That is despite an effort begun in
1996 by Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature to cut
workers' comp costs by improving workplace safety, limiting some
benefits, shifting premium costs onto higher-risk employers and
better fighting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh called on government leaders in New York to take further
steps to cut workers' comp costs for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the report Tuesday, Pataki said he had not seen it
but will ''take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to continue to look at ways to reform the
Workers' Compensation system,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has announced that as of Oct. 1, workers' comp
rates overall to be paid by all employers will fall by an average
of 2.5 percent, pushing the total reduction in New York rates to
almost 40 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Actuarial &AMP; Technical Solutions reported in 1996, before the
state's reform efforts, that workers' comp rate for manufacturers
were 57 percent above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Business Council spokesman Matthew Maguire said it is valid to
compare the workers' comp costs paid by manufacturers because they
have traditionally been such an important provider of jobs to New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently about 880,000 manufacturing jobs according
to the state Labor Department, or just over 10 percent of the
state's private and public job force.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that other states are doing better than New
York at lowering workers' comp costs for manufacturers, Maguire
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether we're not doing enough here and other states are doing
more, the fact is we are losing ground to the national average,''
Maguire said. ''If New York state's workers' comp costs improved,
but other states' costs improved more, then our relative position
suffers. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that New York benefits were 38th best out
of 50 states, almost 27 percent higher than the national average.

<HEADLINE> Activists: No evidence NYC lawyer among Indonesian dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Human rights activists renewed their efforts
Tuesday to locate a New York lawyer-activist who vanished in
Indonesia a month ago, saying there is no evidence his was among
five bodies discovered there over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The five decomposing corpses - all with stab wounds - were found
Sunday by villagers in a ravine in the country's North Sumatra
province, where Jafar Siddiq Hamzah was last seen on Aug. 5.
Hamzah's family was allowed to examine the bodies, but did not
recognize any, the activists told a Manhattan news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're counting on him being alive,'' said Robert Jereski of
the International Forum on Aceh, a group founded by Hamzah.
</P>
<P>
   Jereski and others fear Hamzah, 35, of Queens, may have been
kidnapped by Indonesian military or paramilitary troops during a
visit to Medan, Indonesia's third largest city. He had recently
returned to his native Aceh, on the northern tip of the island of
Sumatra, where his work on human rights issues drew death threats.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, activists called on both U.S. and Indonesian
officials to conduct a ''high-level civilian investigation'' of the
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leaving the investigation entirely in the hands of the
Indonesian police, given their record of severe human rights
violations in Aceh and elsewhere, seriously compromises its
integrity and transparency,'' the East Timor Action Network said in
a statement issued Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues Ex-Dodger for Diet Ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is suing former
baseball player Steve Garvey for acting as host of a diet drug
advertisement that federal regulators contend was deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last month, builds on an April suit that alleged
Enforma Natural Products Inc. and two of its principals, Andrew
Grey and Fred Zinos, made ''false and unsubstantiated'' claims
about ''The Enforma System.'' The company claimed in television and
Internet ads that users could lose weight without dieting or
exercise, regardless of how much they ate.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, who spent most of his career with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, was the host on an Enforma infomercial and appeared on the
company's World Wide Web site. In a statement listed in the
complaint, Garvey said, ''Look at all these delicious supposedly
forbidden foods: barbecued chicken and ribs, buttered biscuits.
Foods you can eat when you crave them without guilt, without worry,
and it's all because of a few little capsules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enforma System consists of two diet supplements. One
prevents absorption of dietary fat, and the other increases the
body's capacity to burn fat, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Enforma Natural Products already settled the FTC suit against it
with an agreement to return $10 million to customers. Another
Enforma infomercial host, Lark Kendall -- identified in the ad as
Kendall Carson, nutritionist -- also agreed to a settlement,
surrendering her talent fee and accepting an order not to
''misrepresent her professional status'' or repeat claims she made
about Enforma.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's management company, Garvey Management Group Inc., also
was named in the August suit along with the infomercial producer
and executives of the production company.
</P>
<P>
   A first baseman, Garvey played in nine All Star Games and was
the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Enforma System purchasers seeking refunds can
complete forms from the FTC's Web site, http://www.ftc.gov, or call
202-326-3123.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 22; Nasdaq Falls 91  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A poor outlook for technology and pharmaceutical
stocks prompted heavy selling in those sectors Tuesday, the only
notable activity in an otherwise lackluster session.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily concentrated in
technology issues, fell 91.15 to 4,143.18, giving back nearly half
its 191-point gain of last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.83 at 11,260.61,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 13.69 to 1,507.08.
</P>
<P>
   With no big news to provide a clear direction for trading, the
market meandered. Indexes alternated between positive and negative
territory throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''September has typically been a very unclear month for the
market and after the very nice run we had in August, we've got some
profit-taking and maybe some developing concerns about reports for
third-quarter earnings,'' said Bill Barker, an investment strategy
consultant with Dain Rauscher Inc. in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions were the pharmaceutical and tech sectors, which
declined overall.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $4.69 to $69.25 after a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
analyst downgraded the computer chip maker's stock to ''buy'' from
''strong buy. Ashok Kumar said he was concerned that continued weak
demand could result in lower-than-expected sales growth. He was
also concerned about the potential for oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker stocks also fell on the news, with Gateway
dropping $4.71 to $63.97 and Dell off $2.06 at $41.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see the Nasdaq is down hard,'' said Peter Anderson,
chief investment officer at American Express Financial Advisors in
Minneapolis. ''The tech stocks have been the favorite. They've had
big runs. What you're witnessing is some type of a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical stocks fell slightly after Banc of America
Securities downgraded Merck to ''market perform'' from ''strong
buy'' and, at the same time, reduced estimates for the overall drug
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Merck fell $1.13 to $68.06. Pfizer, one of the most actively
traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, was down
$2.16 at $41.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these stocks have been pretty strong performers and I
think there is some concerns about the political rhetoric,''
Anderson said. The cost of prescription drugs and Medicare coverage
for them have become issues in this fall's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Other active stocks Tuesday included Intermedia Communications.
Its shares rose $8.61, or 37.6 percent, to $31.48 after WorldCom
said it was acquiring Intermedia for $3 billion in stock and cash.
The deal also includes Intermedia's controlling stake in Digex, a
leading operator of computer centers that run Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Scientific International's shares jumped $9.63, about
43.9 percent, to $31.56. The company announced late Friday its $800
million plan to buy PSS World Medical, another medical products
distributor, had fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Niagara Mohawk Holdings rose $1.88 to $15.75 after
British-based National Grid Group announced it was buying the
utility for $3 billion in cash and stock. Niagara Mohawk is the
second-largest electric and gas provider in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a small margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 836.26 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.89 to 539.02.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.41 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.67 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.67 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.95 percent.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Woes in Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- After a day of disrupted telecommunications and
a nationwide cutoff of energy supplies, Israeli telephone and fuel
pipeline employees went back to work on Tuesday, ending brief
strikes that threatened to cripple the country.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's labor unrest stems from the government's drive to sell
off state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential labor conflict loomed as the transport
minister said he may lift the ban on flights during the Jewish
Sabbath for Israel's national airline, El Al, which also is a
candidate for privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Bezeq, the state-owned telephone company, went back
to repairing damaged phone lines after agreeing with management
over a severance pay arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement cleared the last obstacle to privatizing the phone
company, a day after Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
signed an order allowing competition in phone services here for the
first time, ending Bezeq's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Objecting to another privatization plan, workers for the
state-owned fuel pipeline company cut off supplies to the whole
country, except the military, for a day. They agreed to go back to
work Tuesday night after the government agreed to reexamine the
plan, under which the company would be split and half would be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden strike threatened to black out the country and ground
civil aviation. Workers gave the government ten days to rethink its
position.
</P>
<P>
   Also pledging that workers would not be harmed, Transport
Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said a ban on flights by El Al on the
Jewish Sabbath could be lifted before the company is sold to
private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 1983 ban, El Al planes are grounded from sundown
Friday to sundown Saturday. The ban has cut into the company's
profits, and airline officials say it has made the company less
attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting the ban wold require a Cabinet decision, said Transport
Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadia.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin-Shahak said he is studying the matter. At a news
conference, he said, ''There is a possibility that El Al will fly
on the Sabbath even before it is privatized.'' In the past, El Al
workers have gone on strike whenever privatization was on the
agenda, charging that jobs and benefits would be lost.

<HEADLINE> Commission Rejects Reagan Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to reserve a site on the national
Mall for a memorial to former President Reagan was rejected Tuesday
by the National Capital Memorial Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''They unanimously opposed it,'' said Chairman John G. Parsons,
representing the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission was set up to advise the
administration. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee, has introduced legislation that would direct
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt or his successor to name a site
for the Reagan memorial, order a design and create a commission to
raise the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons and other members said that memorials could be added
inside the capital's new Ronald Reagan Building and the recently
renamed Ronald Reagan National Airport, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said that the Young bill would contradict the
14-year-old Commemorative Works Act, which says no memorial to an
individual may be authorized until 25 years after the person's
death. Another member pointed out, however, that the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was authorized well before
the 25-year period expired.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, now 89, left office 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted the bill would authorize an exception to an agreement
last year by the commission and two others -- the Commission on Fine
Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission -- to disapprove
new monuments along the grassy Mall between the Capitol and the
Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the Reagan monument appeared Tuesday in advance of
the commission's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just my personal opinion but I don't think we ought to
reserve space for a memorial to someone who's still alive,'' said
Charles Carpenter, executive director of the Fine Arts Commission.
''I think every generation should get a shot at deciding who ought
to have a memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial to World War II was approved before the agreement but
is still opposed by some groups, which last month urged Babbitt to
disapprove it. A monument to Martin Luther King Jr. has also been
approved for the area but not yet begun.

<HEADLINE> Cops on duty at West Indian parade suspended for drinking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two police officers were suspended for allegedly
drinking beer while on-duty at this year's West Indian American Day
Parade, the first year alcohol was banned from the event, police
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officers Anthony Zayas, 36, and Kevin Kryzak, 39, both assigned
to the 44th Precinct in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx,
were suspended without pay for a maximum of 30 days for consuming
alcohol while in uniform. Zayas has been on the force for 14 years,
Kryzak for 15.
</P>
<P>
   The officers had been assigned to work the parade detail Sunday
from 6:40 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., but were held over on overtime. Around
9:30 p.m., the sergeant in charge of the officers' sector smelled
alcohol on their breath, and watched as they walked into the
Rodriguez Grocery Store on Bedford Avenue, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant went into the store and saw the officers in a
backroom allegedly holding half-full bottles of Corona beer, police
said. Three empty bottles were strewn near them, but it was
uncertain if the officers had consumed them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parade had officially ended at 6 p.m., there were
still many people milling about the area, attending various
festivities at 9:30 p.m. Nearly 2 million revelers attended the
annual parade, a New York City tradition since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   There was little trouble - police issued 95 summonses, most for
alcohol-related infractions. They made 10 arrests - two men were
arrested for groping women at the parade and two other men were
arrested for fighting along the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration ordered a series of safety measures
at this year's parade after two children and an adult were struck
and killed last year by floats.

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues Ex-Dodger for Diet Drug Ad  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is suing Steve
Garvey for acting as host of a diet drug advertisement that federal
regulators contend was deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last month, builds on an April suit that alleged
Enforma Natural Products Inc. and two of its principals, Andrew
Grey and Fred Zinos, made ''false and unsubstantiated'' claims
about ''The Enforma System.'' The company claimed in television and
Internet ads that users could lose weight without dieting or
exercise, regardless of how much they ate.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, who played for Los Angeles from 1969-82 and San Diego
from 1983-87, was the host on an Enforma infomercial and appeared
on the company's World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement listed in the complaint, Garvey said, ''Look at
all these delicious supposedly forbidden foods: barbecued chicken
and ribs, buttered biscuits. Foods you can eat when you crave them
without guilt, without worry, and it's all because of a few little
capsules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enforma System consists of two diet supplements. One
prevents absorption of dietary fat, and the other increases the
body's capacity to burn fat, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Enforma Natural Products already settled the FTC suit against it
with an agreement to return $10 million to customers. Another
Enforma infomercial host, Lark Kendall -- identified in the ad as
Kendall Carson, nutritionist -- also agreed to a settlement,
surrendering her talent fee and accepting an order not to
''misrepresent her professional status'' or repeat claims she made
about Enforma.
</P>
<P>
   While Garvey's lawyers could argue that he was just reading
lines, an FTC official said the commission believes he was
personally vouching for the product. Under FTC rules, he needed to
have a basis for an endorsement, Joel Winston, the FTC's assistant
director for advertising practices, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a number of claims that purported to be his own
opinions and his own conclusions. In effect, he was asking
consumers watching the show to believe what he was saying and buy
the product based on his credibility,'' Winston said. ''Under those
circumstances, an endorser has a responsibility to make at least a
reasonable inquiry into the truth of what he's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston noted other celebrities including actors Lloyd Bridges
and George Hamilton have been sued in the past for making allegedly
fraudulent claims about a product.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's management company, Garvey Management Group Inc., also
was named in the August suit along with the infomercial producer
and executives of the production company.
</P>
<P>
   A first baseman, Garvey played in nine All Star games and was
the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Enforma System purchasers seeking refunds can
complete forms from the FTC's Web site, http://www.ftc.gov, or call
202-326-3123.

<HEADLINE> Miami Boasting Receiving Talent  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Clinton Portis led No. 4 Miami with 133 yards
rushing in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, he's the third-string tailback.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore's success magnifies a pleasant problem that hounds
Miami coach Butch Davis as each game nears -- how to distribute the
ball to the Hurricanes' talented skill players.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly there's guys that we want to have the ball,'' Davis
said. ''But defenses can dictate who you go to. Our talent makes
defenses honest because they can't just try to shut down one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has already announced the starting tailback for this
Saturday's game against No. 15 Washington, and it isn't Portis.
James Jackson, Miami's starter for its last two season-openers,
will get the nod in the Hurricanes' first real test of the season
after a 61-14 drubbing of I-AA McNeese State on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not yanking running backs in and out to have some kind of
fictitious rotation,'' Davis said. ''We plan to always have a fresh
guy in there, always keeping them in long enough to allow them to
get a feel for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Portis stepped in for Jackson last season while he nursed ankle
and shoulder injuries. Portis led Miami with 838 rushing yards as a
freshman, but he is still stuck behind Jackson, a senior, and
junior Najeh Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to watch from the sidelines when you know that
you can get it done,'' Portis said. ''I try to do the best I can on
every play, just in case I don't get another crack at it for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is fourth on the Hurricanes' career rushing list and has
started 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of good backs on the team and that's good,''
said Jackson, who ran for 58 yards against McNeese State. ''Right
now I believe I'm getting the job done. Clinton's time will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Ken Dorsey, who will be making his fifth
career start, and first on the road, against the Huskies, said he
loves having these tools at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Santana Moss is Miami's most dangerous threat with a
combination of flashy moves and 4.3 speed. Against McNeese State,
the senior scored on a 77-yard punt return and a 75-yard reverse
for a total of 204 yards offense in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Wayne, a senior, is third on the Hurricanes career
receiving yardage list, behind Michael Irvin and Lamar Thomas. He
caught two touchdowns passes against McNeese State.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Jones and Andre Johnson are third and fourth receiving
options that could likely start for many other college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and offensive coordinator Larry Coker say they don't
decide ahead of time how many touches Moss or Wayne should get, or
how many carries the backs will receive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get the ball to our playmakers, but the key is
balance,'' Coker said. ''Most any defense can prepare for a team
that only runs or only passes.''

<HEADLINE> FDA: Plant Margarines Heart Healthy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those much-touted anti-cholesterol margarines
are getting the government's blessing to take their advertising a
step further -- and say they really can lower the risk of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration let the margarines Benecol and
Take Control begin selling last year, but never explicitly endorsed
the products' claims that they ''promoted healthy cholesterol''
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Now the FDA has concluded that ingredients in the two margarines
actually can lower cholesterol enough to reduce the risk of heart
disease. It will let the products' labels bear that coveted health
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a much stronger claim'' than the two margarines have
been making, FDA food chief Joseph Levitt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol, made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, works through an
ingredient called plant stanol ester, derived from pine trees.
Lipton's Take Control contains a soybean extract, plant sterol
ester.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA reviewed several studies of the products to determine
that eating at least two servings a day -- totaling 1.3 grams of
sterol ester or 3.4 grams of stanol ester -- could significantly
reduce cholesterol, as long as they're part of a low-fat diet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data presented a strong case,'' Levitt concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's decision also clears the way for any competing foods
that add the right amount of either ingredient to make similar
heart-healthy claims.

<HEADLINE> Castro's U.N. Visit First Since '95  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK AP) -- With much security but little fanfare, Cuban
President Fidel Castro arrived in the United States on Tuesday for
the first time in five years for this week's U.N. Millennium
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was seen arriving in a black limousine at the Cuban
Mission in midtown Manhattan shortly after 1 p.m. where he is to
stay during the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said Castro immediately went into a meeting with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He then went to China's
U.N. mission nearby for a meeting with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. No details of either meeting were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's arrival had not been announced and there were no
protesters stationed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere in Manhattan, a prominent Cuban-American exile,
Jose Basulto, met with FBI officials to file a report on the 1996
shootdown of two unarmed civilian airplanes belonging to Basulto's
Miami-based Brothers to the Rescue organization.
</P>
<P>
   Basulto was in a separate aircraft that wasn't hit by Cuban MiGs
in the shootdown, but four people on board the two aircraft were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our purpose is to file a report that lets the authorities know
the perpetrator of the crime is now here in the city of New York,''
said Basulto's attorney, Robert Villasante.
</P>
<P>
   He said there wasn't anything preventing U.S. authorities from
detaining and interrogating Castro and then determining that the
Cuban leader doesn't enjoy diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Castro arrived in the United States three months after winning a
major victory over his political enemies in this country with the
return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was the subject of a protracted custody fight between his
relatives in Miami, who fought to keep him in the United States,
and his father and grandparents, who battled to have him returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was obliged to grant Castro a visa under a
1947 U.N. rule that requires the host country to grant visas to
officials attending U.N. meetings. Castro last spoke in New York at
the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sen. Jesse Helms, a Republican, demanded Friday
that neither Castro nor any other high-ranking Cuban official be
allowed in the country for the summit.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Guiliani criticized Castro in a speech to
the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami on Thursday, saying
''a dictator (like Fidel Castro) who oppresses people is someone
who should be ostracized by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani snubbed the Cuban president in 1995 when he visited New
York City, excluding him from a dinner and concert. During that
trip, Castro blasted unilateral trade embargoes, such as the U.S.
sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule for this trip has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   This is Castro's fifth visit to the United States since the
Cuban revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's best-known American visit was in 1960, when he arrived
as a 35-year-old revolutionary leader in power just one year.
Castro stayed at a hotel in Harlem, and Soviet Premier Nikita
Khruschev dropped by to introduce himself.

<HEADLINE> Corzine begins air war as Franks ducks questions about campaign finances </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jon
Corzine has launched his TV advertising, a blitz that will probably
cost as much in its first week as his Republican opponent has
raised so far for his whole campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine campaign spokesman Tom Shea refused to provide any
details on how much was being spent on the TV spots, although he
did confirm they started running Monday on both New York and
Philadelphia network-affiliated TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine typically spent $1 million to $1.5 million a week on TV
spots during the Democratic primary campaign on the road to
defeating former Gov. Jim Florio. The $36.7 million he spent to
beat Florio set a national record for spending in any race for
Congress in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer last week reported the spending on TV
ads would be about $1 million this week. Rider University political
analyst David Rebovich said it was logical Corzine would spend at
least that much since some recent polls have shown Franks gaining
ground on him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would he scale it down now'' compared with the primary,
Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks refused Tuesday to comment on published reports that his
fund-raising had been less than expected, but campaign manager
Charlie Smith said it had surpassed $1 million. Franks would not
say when he would or could begin buying time on TV, and Smith said
such fund-raising and spending details would be withheld until the
campaign is required to make them public Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's TV spot is warm and biographical, showing Corzine
meeting and laughing with a variety of voter groups while
campaigning. The ad summarizes the candidate's promises on an array
of issues in 60-second and 30-second versions. It does not mention
Franks nor contain any harsh language about disputes in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' staff fired back anyway Tuesday, charging the Corzine
ads say he is the only candidate in the race promising to protect
Social Security, help seniors afford drugs or help pay for college.
Franks' staff noted the congressman's voting record in support of
measures for all of those steps.
</P>
<P>
   While Corzine took to the air Tuesday, Franks was on the
Statehouse steps with officials of the Fraternal Order of Police,
the state's second-largest police union, who endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is scheduled to appear at the Statehouse Wednesday to
accept the endorsement of the Sierra Club, which had backed Florio
in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the FOP endorsement, president Richard Whelan
praised Franks for his accessibility to them during eight years in
Congress. Whelan complained Corzine had been unwilling to meet
personally with union officers who wanted to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan could not say if members of the police union find any of
Corzine's proposals objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, however, energetically denounced Corzine for his
opposition to the death penalty. ''There is nothing soft or
ambiguous about my position on crime,'' Franks said, adding he
believes New Jersey voters want murderers who prey on the young,
for instance, to face execution.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said, ''Jon has a strong philosophical opposition to it,
and he thinks enough of the voters of New Jersey that even if they
don't agree with him on the issue, they will respect the fact that
he is willing to take a principled stand on something he believes
in strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks boasted of his votes on the 1994 Crime Bill to toughen
criminal laws and fund the hiring of new police officers. Shea said
Franks in 1995 voted on a Republican bill to repeal that same
funding for police officers.

<HEADLINE> It's a Caddie Shuffle on PGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- In the past month, David Duval has
parted ways with caddie Greg Rita, Justin Leonard split with Bob
Riefke, and Vijay Singh ended his successful run with Dave Renwick.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton understands why player-caddie relationships don't
last forever. He has been with Freddie Burns for most of his
career, but not without glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fired him like two or three times. We patch things up and
get back together,'' Sutton said Tuesday. ''Other than being with
your wife, you have no closer relationship with anybody than your
caddie, and you want to hear something different. You want to add
some pizzazz, and when you hear the same thing every day, you're
not getting that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sutton says change can be good, it still comes down to the
player.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just don't look in the mirror enough,'' he said. ''We don't
want the responsibility of doing it ourselves. We always want
somebody else to fix it for us. That's one thing that's great about
golf. Nobody can fix it for you.''

   DARRELL SURVEY: Want to use the equipment preferred by the
pros? That information is now available in a book by the Darrell
Survey, the company that takes inventory of every bag on the PGA
Tour, LPGA Tour and Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Darrell Survey has been around since 1932 and distributes a
weekly report to manufacturers. This is the first time the company
has put together its information in a book for public sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''The book provides golfers everywhere with a comprehensive view
of the equipment that consumers and the pros use,'' said Susan
Naylor, president of the Darrell Survey. ''It's a permanent record
of golf history that everyone can enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   There's only one catch. The Darrell Survey does not disclose
which player is using a specific ball or club, only how many
players are using a particular product. It also lists the
consumers' choice, based on thousands of interviews with everyday
players.

   MR. PERSONALITY: When it comes to how well he is known, how
much he is liked and how much credibility he carries, Arnold Palmer
is still ''The King.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was the clear-cut No. 1 in the Golf Personality Index
ranking, a study commissioned by Golf World Business magazine for
its September issue. The survey of 559 avid golfers was designed to
measure attitudes toward the game's most prominent figures, and to
quantify the different factors that form those attitudes for the
golf industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The GPI gives the golf industry a tool to quickly measure
who's connecting with the golf public,'' said Tim Murphy, editor of
Golf World Business.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, Palmer connects.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who turns 71 on Sunday and earlier this year signed a
12-year endorsement deal with Callaway Golf, finished first or tied
for first in all three categories -- familiarity, likability and
credibility. Jack Nicklaus finished second in total points,
followed by Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, Nicklaus, Phil Mickelson and Fred Couples were the only
ones who finished in the top 10 in all three categories. While
Woods tied with Palmer and Nicklaus in the familiarity category, he
tied for 19th in likability.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez was the highest ranked woman at No. 11, while Johnny
Miller (No. 22) had the highest rating among television analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   JOB WITH A VIEW: Tiger Woods' impact on golf is clearly
evident at tournaments like the Buick Open last month and the
Canadian Open this week, where tickets became scarce as soon as
Woods announced he was playing.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods is bringing in new fans to the game, he also has
created a buzz about those charged with keeping order -- the
marshals.
</P>
<P>
   During the pro-am at the Buick Open, marshals on just about
every tee brought disposable cameras and asked Woods to pose with
them. During the tournament, they usually watched Woods, instead of
watching the gallery for untimely movement and unauthorized use of
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour publishes a tournament guide that includes a
section for marshals -- such as where to stand, how to control a
crowd and the importance of facing the gallery, not the field of
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you every marshal does it by the book,'' said
Henry Hughes, chief of operations for the PGA Tour. ''Our crowds
are up, and it's more of a challenge for the marshals. But marshals
are human, too. When something exciting happens, it's human nature
for them to become spectators. It's not what we want, but it
happens.''

   EYE ON THE BALL: While Nike Golf touted Tiger Woods as
validation for its ball, so did Bridgestone, which manufactures the
Nike ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone noted that five of the top 10 players at the PGA
Championship used its solid-core, injection-molded urethane covered
balls -- including Woods and Notah Begay, whose ball has a swoosh,
not a Precept label.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nike is coming out with a new ball, and it's making
clear that this is not the ball Woods used to win three consecutive
majors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not a ball that anyone would want to play.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is celebrating its top client's historic achievements this
summer with a ''Tiger Woods Collector Series Golf Ball'' tins.
Suggested retail price is $40. The collector items will be
available Nov. 15.

<HEADLINE> Corzine's friendly ad reintroduces him, his issues to voters  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   EDITOR'S NOTE: One of a series looking at commercials
run in the
campaign for U.S. Senate in New Jersey.
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE: Democrat Jon Corzine
</P>
<P>
   AD FIRM: Shrum, Devine &AMP; Donilon, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   FORMAT: 60-second television ad.
</P>
<P>
   TEXT:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ''From diners to the Shore to senior centers to our
schools, he's sat with us, listened to us, talked with us, and told
us what he'd do. Jon Corzine. He's the candidate who says we have
to put Social Security in a lock box where the politicians can't
touch it. He's the one who supports a guaranteed prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, and a real patients' bill of rights for all
our citizens. He's the one who favors universal preschool and
setting higher standards in our schools. He's had the courage to
call for licensing and registering all guns, and to stand up to
protect the rights of us all. He has the fiscal discipline of a
successful businessman, and the faith in the American Dream of
someone who had to work for everything he's gotten in life.
Standing with us. Fighting for us. Jon Corzine in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO:
</P>
<P>
   Corzine moves around rooms, sits with voters and pumps a fist,
usually in casual dress, as issue points are printed on a bar
designed to not interfere with the picture. In two scenes children
and police are seen as the text addresses preschools and gun
licensing.
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGY:
</P>
<P>
   Seeks to reintroduce voters to Corzine and to show he has been
actively campaigning. Implies Corzine is the only one seeking to
protect Social Security and to win drug benefits for seniors, not
GOP opponent Bob Franks. Ad does this without mentioning Franks,
which would give the opponent free name recognition. Deletes ''bold
ideas'' slogan of the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   FACT-CHECK:
</P>
<P>
   Since the June 6 primary Corzine has remained largely outside
the public eye except at the Democratic National Convention, where
he was prominent. For that matter, so has Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Franks in his campaign also has been promising to protect Social
Security and provide drug benefits to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine did not inherit family money, but at Goldman Sachs he
was fortunate enough to be awarded posts that earned him fabulous
wealth as the firm expanded. He spent $6 million more to win the
June primary than any congressional candidate in American history
had ever spent in a whole year, which could make it difficult for
some to link him with the phrase ''fiscal discipline.''

<HEADLINE> Environmental group endorses Clinton over Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - In a major disappointment for the
Lazio campaign, the Sierra Club, an important environmental group,
endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton for Senate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio has been viewed as an ally in the past by other
groups like the League of Conservation Voters for his work on
cleaning up Long Island Sound and fighting strip-mining. But Sierra
Club official Rhea Jezer said he ''has dropped the ball on many key
environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jezer, conservation chair of the Sierra Club's Atlantic Chapter,
which includes New York, added: ''Although he has a few
environmental achievements, Rep. Lazio's overall batting average
puts him in the bottom third of our state's delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lazio, at a Manhattan press conference, said: ''I'm
very proud of my environmental record as an author of major
environmental legislation, as somebody who has voted against both
Republican and Democratic anti-environmental riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Tuesday, while campaigning in Rochester, Lazio said he
''can't think of a single time when Mrs. Clinton has ever
forcefully spoke out on any environmental issue.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign manager Bill Dal Col pointed out his fights to
enforce the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and questioned
Clinton's commitment to environmental issues. The first lady has
made education, health care and abortion rights among the major
themes of her campaign but has focused less on environmental
issues. Dal Col also noted that Lazio was named one of the League
of Conservation Voters' 10 ''Environmental Heroes'' in 1998, and
that the Sierra Club endorsed him in 1996. ''The fact is that Mrs.
Clinton has no identifiable environmental record,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmentalists cited a series of votes by Lazio that
they disagreed with, including votes against amendments to
strengthen cleanup standards at toxic waste sites covered by the
Superfund program; against a bill that would allow local officials
to request cleanup of a site without their governors approval; and
against an amendment to curb suburban sprawl by protecting open
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Senate, New Yorkers will be able to count on Hillary
Clinton to do what's right to protect our families from toxic
pollution. With Rep. Rick Lazio, we don't have that confidence,''
said Robert Cox, national president of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's New York leaders conducted lengthy separate
interviews with each candidate before making their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This endorsement is extremely important. I know I was not
alone in seeking it,'' said Clinton, appearing with Sierra Club
officials at Five Islands Park, an inlet off Long Island Sound in
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Clinton over Lazio, the group's officials cited her
commitment to cleaning up Long Island Sound, the Hudson River,
reducing pollution from power plant smokestacks, and conserving New
York's watershed lands to avoid filtration plants.
</P>
<P>
   Jezer also complained that Lazio ''just doesn't seem to be aware
of many of the local issues,'' and cited the controversy over
whether a filtration plant is needed as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan pointed out that the organization
has not endorsed a Republican in a statewide election in at least a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dal Col went to Albany to unveil a new television
spot attacking an earlier Clinton ad that featured comments from
people who had been described as randomly chosen New Yorkers. It
turned out a woman featured in the ad is a former employee of a
Democratic state Assembly member. The Lazio ad, titled ''Ringer,''
ends with the line, ''Another phony ad from Hillary Clinton. You
just can't trust her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col also was in Albany to speak to the Republican State
Committee, an attempt to calm fears among GOP leaders that the
congressman hasn't been campaigning enough. Lazio took a four-day
vacation with his family in the posh Hamptons on the east end of
Long Island just before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to answer the criticism up front is Rick's done
enough that we raised $10.7 million in the last 58 days ... If you
don't have the resources to take on the onslaught that she's put
together, we'd get buried,'' Dal Col told Albany's WROW-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio raised more than three times what Clinton pulled in during
July and August.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio aide also promised that over the next several weeks,
''You'll see him come forward with some bold proposals on
education, health care (and) Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lazio appeared in Manhattan with Gov. George Pataki and
U.S. Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Nita Lowey and Carolyn Maloney to call
for the release of 10 Jews who were convicted in Iran of spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Lazio visited the home of a Republican couple
with two young children in Greece, a Rochester suburb, to talk
about his tax plan, which he estimates will save an average family
$1,200 a year in payroll taxes alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't ever save money ... we get so little back,'' Rebecca
Caracci, a 27-year-old elementary school teacher, told the
congressman.

<HEADLINE> Firm Buys Ads for Labor, Candidates  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has cleared the Democratic
Party and labor unions of illegally coordinating their 1996
campaign activities, and the firm that played a key role in that
investigation is back to buying TV ads for both unions and
candidates, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based Media Strategies and Research bought almost $16,000
worth of advertising time on a Charlotte, N.C., television station
in July for the AFL-CIO. The union ran ads urging Republican Rep.
Robin Hayes to support legislation imposing new regulations on
managed-care health organizations, according to copies of checks
provided by the National Republican Congressional Committee. A
month later, the company spent almost $8,000 buying ads for Hayes'
Democratic challenger, Mike Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes defeated Taylor by just 3,000 votes in 1998, and the
rematch is one of the fall's most competitive contests.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's media producer, Jim Duffy, said the firm was no longer
placing labor ads in the congressional district now that it is
working for the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC singled out Media Strategies as part of its
investigation because the firm placed ads for the AFL-CIO in the
districts of three candidates the company worked for in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission said there was no evidence of illegal
coordination because AFL-CIO officials made their own decisions as
to where and when to run the ads and didn't know that the media
firm also was working for the congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ran counter to an FEC ruling in 1980 which said
that an outside group's ability to make independent expenditures
was compromised if it shared a media buying firm with a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission said it was being guided by a 1999 U.S.
District Court decision that threw out most of its case against the
Christian Coalition. Judge Joyce Green rejected arguments that the
group improperly coordinated its activities with candidates by
alerting them in advance to the voter guides its distributed and
telephone get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FEC noted that the AFL-CIO regularly met with
Democratic Party officials and reviewed plans for the fall
campaign. But the commission said the practice violated no laws
because neither the Democrats nor their candidates asked the
AFL-CIO for any specific activities on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news here is that the FEC dismissed all of the charges,''
AFL-CIO Political Director Steve Rosenthal said. ''As long as there
have been coordinated campaigns, there has been a review process
here at the AFL-CIO. As major contributors to these campaign plans,
we decided years ago that it made sense to review them and make
suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   NRCC spokesman Jim Wilkinson criticized the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''All along, we thought the Democrats worked with the unions,''
Wilkinson said. ''We had no idea that the Democrats worked for the
unions. Democrats clearly think they're above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important because outside organizations can make
unlimited independent expenditures, but are severely limited as to
how much they can spend if they coordinate their actions with a
candidate or political party.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said there was nothing wrong with sharing media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a limited number of firms that do this work and do
it right,'' Rosenthal said. ''How about firms that do work for the
NRCC and Republican candidates and the NFIB (National Federation of
Small Business) and the Chamber of Commerce and the various
citizens' groups that pop up all the time on their side of the
aisle?''

<HEADLINE> Senators Probe Clinton's Fire Role  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western senators said Tuesday they will
examine whether the Clinton administration was adequately prepared
to fight wildfires and whether administration policies have put
more public land at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, questioned whether the administration
underfunded fire prevention to secure money for acquiring lands for
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that at the time the president had money taken from
these fire budgets he didn't understand that his lands legacy would
be millions of acres of charred trees and lost wildlife habitat,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he would hold hearings on the administration's role
in the fires in coming weeks in the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee's forests and public land management
subcommittee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said there is no evidence that
administration policies have caused the fires.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan congressional report last week showed little or no
connection between wildfires and the decline in timber harvests on
federal land, Agriculture Department Undersecretary Jim Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politicizing the situation and trying to turn it into a debate
over administration policies is not conducive to our working
together,'' said Lyons, who oversees the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture and Interior departments as early as next week
are expected to ask President Clinton to request roughly $1.2
billion from Congress to repair lands damaged by the fires this
year and prevent fires next year.
</P>
<P>
   Western senators made the criticisms on the Senate floor during
their first day back from more than a one-month recess.
</P>
<P>
   The senators told of going home to their states and seeing smoke
from fires that have burned nearly 6.6 million acres across the
nation. Some said Clinton policies, such as a proposal to ban road
building in 43 million acres of national forests, would only worsen
the fire threat in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to express my deep concerns over the mismanagement of
the national forest system that's led to one of the worst fire
systems in the history of the United States of America,'' said Sen.
Michael Enzi, R-Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the administration has made no
plans to reduce the thick growth of trees and brush to reduce the
fire risk in forests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a fear that if you clean this up, you're logging,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists accuse the GOP of trying to use the fires to
boost national forest logging levels, which have declined about 70
percent over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington state environmental group, the Pacific Biodiversity
Institute, released a study Tuesday that found only 38 percent of
the land that was burned was in roadless or wilderness areas.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey accountant admits he stalked ''Suddenly Susan'' actress  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A New Jersey accountant admitted in court
Tuesday that he stalked actress Brooke Shields and made terrorist
threats against her, then entered a plea of no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bailey was ordered to leave California and return to his
home state, where he will remain on probation for five years. He
had already served nearly a year in jail. With credit for good
behavior, he is eligible for immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   He was also ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling twice a
week, to take medication as prescribed by his doctor and to report
to a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must not harass or molest the victim or threaten use of
force or violence against anyone,'' Superior Court Judge Maureen
Duffy-Lewis told him.
</P>
<P>
   She told Bailey he may not have contact with Shields, her
agents, family or representatives for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shields has said Bailey harassed her for 15 years - sending her
nude photos of himself and letters threatening her with harm.
</P>
<P>
   Shields, who did not attend Tuesday's court hearing, submitted a
statement which was read in court expressing her gratitude to the
district attorney's office and saying, ''I believe that no one in
our society should have to live in constant terror and fear. ... I
simply seek only peace of mind and personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Scott Gordon said the prosecution
agreed to a plea bargain only after adding a charge of making
terrorist threats. That qualified Bailey's plea as a first strike
under California's three-strikes law and would subject him to
stronger penalties if he is convicted again.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, 41, has two prior convictions involving Shields, one for
trespassing at her New Jersey home in 1985 and another for making a
terrorist threat against her in 1993. But the three-strikes law was
not in effect at the time of either crime.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested Jan. 10 after detectives said they saw him pull
a handgun out of his pocket while looking at his reflection outside
a building in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that when Bailey was taken into custody he had
two letters he was about to mail to Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Lisa Polansky said
outside court that Bailey understands he must submit to psychiatric
and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to address the problem which seems to be
treatable through medication,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shields, 35, recently became engaged to producer Chris Henchy.
She was previously married to tennis ace Andre Agassi. NBC canceled
Shields' show, ''Suddenly Susan,'' earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Panel Seeks Clinton License Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A prosecutor for a court committee that
wants to revoke President Clinton's law license is seeking a
December hearing date.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Bernarde Miller of the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct said Tuesday she made the request in a recent
letter to Circuit Judge Leon Johnson and in earlier court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has not set a hearing date or commented on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The committee says Clinton gave misleading testimony under oath
about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky
during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and that the
misstatements make him no longer fit to be an Arkansas lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said stripping him of his law license is too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   The president was earlier found in contempt of court over the
testimony. He did not fight the citation and paid $90,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed on behalf of the committee, Miller said the
president lied to spare himself embarrassment. Clinton's lawyers
acknowledged last week that the president acted to save face.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Peca May Look Elsewhere  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Captain Michael Peca and the Buffalo Sabres
are far apart in contract talks three days before the team opens
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a difference of opinion. The distinction is
substantial,'' Peca's agent, Don Meehan, said Tuesday. Meehan said
he might explore ''other options'' depending on how negotiations
go.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's considering demanding a trade, the agent said,
''We're not there yet. I won't speculate until we get to that point
in the future. It's better to comment on those options once we've
exhausted our discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca, a restricted free agent, is seeking a two- to four-year
deal worth about $4 million annually, more than double the $1.65
million he made last season.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres general manager Darcy Regier hoped a deal can be reached
within days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a great surprise to anybody, but the
biggest difference is money,'' Regier said. ''We've got a lot of
things on the table, and we've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca is coming off a subpar season, with 20 goals and 41 points
in 73 games. In 1997, he was named the NHL's best defensive
forward, and in 1998-99 he was credited for helping lead the
Sabres' drive to the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres have four other unsigned restricted free agents:
backup goalie Martin Biron, forward Erik Rasmussen, forward Denis
Hamel and defenseman Jason Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Regier said he's also had numerous talks this week in trying to
re-sign unrestricted free agent Vladimir Tsyplakov, who was
productive for Buffalo -- six goals and 19 points in 34 games --
after being acquired in midseason from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sabres have settled on a one-year deal to renew
their affiliation agreement with the American Hockey League's
Rochester Americans. Regier said the club is looking for a
longer-term deal with the Americans, who have been the Sabres'
minor league farm team for 21 seasons -- pro hockey's longest
affiliation.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Defense Falters in Opener  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Just like last season, the St. Louis Rams have
no problem scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing against this offense instead of watching it is very
hard,'' said Denver Broncos strong safety Billy Jenkins, who played
for the Rams last year. ''Those guys are some of the most elusive
guys in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   But in their season-opening 41-36 victory over the Broncos on
Monday night, the Rams had to make plays to compensate for a
defense that sprung several leaks. The Rams rolled up 513 yards,
had scoring plays of 86, 72 and 80 yards and had three 100-yard
receivers in the same game for the first time since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have high standards on offense,'' first-year coach Mike
Martz said. ''I think we approached those standards.''
</P>

   Yet they beat the Broncos by only five points. Blame it on a
defense that ranked fourth in the NFL in points allowed last year,
giving up 15 points a game, and lost one player from that unit.
</P>
<P>
   Martz wasn't concerned the day after the Rams allowed 424 yards,
partly because it was the opener and partly because the Broncos
have a high-powered attack. He said he had no trouble getting
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me tell you this, that's a good offense, that's a real
good offense, and they'll score a lot of points,'' Martz said of
Denver. ''That's not to say we're not a good defense. We're going
to be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   They will be without tackle D'Marco Farr for about a month after
he tore knee cartilage against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, who has started every game since the Rams moved to St.
Louis in 1995, was injured in the fourth quarter. He will have
surgery Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rams players felt Jenkins was a big part of their problem
because he knows the defense so well. The Broncos didn't do much
exotic on offense, but were able to find the holes in the St. Louis
zone all night.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos quarterback Brian Griese was 19-of-29 for 307 yards and
two touchdowns. He hit Ed McCaffrey seven times for 115 yards and
Rod Smith three times for 88.
</P>
<P>
   ''Denver got us in a couple situations where they knew exactly
what we were doing and just attacked the weakness,'' cornerback
Todd Lyght said. ''Obviously, we have a lot of things we have to
work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Martz said the linebackers and secondary share the blame. Middle
linebacker London Fletcher, who had two sacks and nine solo
tackles, said he was out of position when the Broncos got a 38-yard
pass play to tight end Byron Chamberlain on third-and-16 from the
Denver 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my bust,'' Fletcher said. ''I was trying to do too
much. That's something I've got to continue to work on, staying
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos also muted the Rams' pass rush, which tied for the
league lead in sacks last year, until late in the game when they
sacked Griese twice and Grant Wistrom hit him as he delivered his
final pass on fourth-and-33 from the Denver 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams weren't able to blitz as often as Martz would have
liked because they respected the Broncos' running game. Denver
stayed with two wideouts and two tight ends most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always that threat that ball is going to be handed
off,'' Martz said. ''If there's a crease, there's nobody back
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was the third straight nail-biting finish for the
Rams, who edged Tampa Bay 11-6 in the NFC championship game and got
a overtime-saving tackle a yard-and-a-half away from the end zone
by Mike Jones in their 23-16 Super Bowl victory over the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Those three games were nothing like most of last season for the
Rams, who won by an average of 33-15 while scoring the
third-highest point total in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready for some more blowouts,'' Wistrom said. ''I'm tired
of these tight games.''

<HEADLINE> Drug maker accuses competitor of antitrust violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) - Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. alleged in a
lawsuit Tuesday that rival Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories violated
antitrust laws and furthered a monopoly of its drug Premarin by
undercutting sales of Duramed's competing Cenestin.
</P>
<P>
   Both prescription drugs are designed to relieve symptoms of
menopause, including hot flashes and night sweats.
</P>
<P>
   Duramed accused Wyeth-Ayerst of making contracts for sales of
Premarin and setting prices and discounts on the condition that
health plans not buy Cenestin.
</P>
<P>
   That conduct has substantially reduced competition, helping
Wyeth-Ayerst maintain a monopoly and more than $800 million in
annual U.S. sales of Premarin, Duramed said in the lawsuit filed
Tuesday in Cincinnati federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst also cost Duramed millions of dollars with a
misleading political and public relations campaign to stall federal
approval of Cenestin for five years, Duramed's lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Duramed, based in Cincinnati, asked the U.S. District Court for
an order to stop Wyeth-Ayerst's alleged wrongdoing. The company
also asked for unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst spokeswoman Audrey Ashby, at the company's suburban
Philadelphia headquarters, declined to discuss the lawsuit.
Wyeth-Ayerst is a division of American Home Products Corp., which
is based in Madison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Premarin is derived from the urine of pregnant mares. Duramed
contends that its plant-derived Cenestin would have created market
competition as a less expensive alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst has made Premarin since 1942. Duramed said
Wyeth-Ayerst increased the price of Premarin 12 percent - 5&AMP;frac12; times
the rate of inflation - between January 1999 and January 2000 and
raised it again by 6 percent on March 29 of this year.

<HEADLINE> Skelton Calls for Navy Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smaller, lighter, faster ships are the future
of the U.S. Navy, a senior House Armed Services Committee member
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that some find it hard or even distasteful to imagine a
Navy with smaller ships,'' Missouri Rep. Ike Skelton, the panel's
senior Democrat, said Tuesday in prepared remarks. ''But it is
harder and more repugnant to imagine a Navy rendered irrelevant by
a focus on yesterday's missions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army is under fire on Capitol Hill for proposing a similar
initiative to retain heavy forces while giving light forces more
punch. Both service branches are facing the same challenge, Skelton
said: ''The force we have today and the missions we are actually
taking on do not match.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were a major policy statement from Skelton, one of
the Navy's most influential supporters in Congress. The 12-term
lawmaker spoke during a dinner hosted by Business Executives for
National Security and attended by senior Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
   '''In close' is where the threat lives today -- the missiles that
threaten our battle groups, the speedboats and small lighters used
for hit and run raids, the many light craft now used to place
mines,'' Skelton said.
</P>
<P>
   In shaping its future, the Navy is spending a lot of money
studying the wisdom of such an approach, said Cmdr. Brian Cullin,
spokesman for Navy Secretary Richard Danzig.
</P>
<P>
   While many argue that defense spending is more than adequate,
the same critics are the first to call for intervention in crises
around the globe, Skelton said. Yet the overall fleet will sink
below 300 before the decade is out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Demand for naval forces hasn't gone away with the Cold War; it
has increased,'' Skelton said. ''If we're missing missions today,
how dire will the situation will be with a 200-ship fleet?''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy forces should be maintained to safeguard the ''blue
water'' deep at sea, but smaller, lighter, faster platforms are
needed to take the fight to shore, Skelton said. The military has
building plans for medium and large ships, he said, but the most
efficient way to build numbers in the fleet and meet the presence
requirement is to start a class of smaller hulls.

<HEADLINE> Miami Boasts Receiving Talent  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Clinton Portis led No. 4 Miami with 133 yards
rushing in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, he's the third-string tailback.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore's success magnifies a pleasant problem that hounds
Miami coach Butch Davis as each game nears -- how to distribute the
ball to the Hurricanes' talented skill players.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly there's guys that we want to have the ball,'' Davis
said. ''But defenses can dictate who you go to. Our talent makes
defenses honest because they can't just try to shut down one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has already announced the starting tailback for this
Saturday's game against No. 15 Washington, and it isn't Portis.
James Jackson, Miami's starter for its last two season-openers,
will get the nod in the Hurricanes' first real test of the season
after a 61-14 drubbing of I-AA McNeese State on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not yanking running backs in and out to have some kind of
fictitious rotation,'' Davis said. ''We plan to always have a fresh
guy in there, always keeping them in long enough to allow them to
get a feel for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Portis stepped in for Jackson last season while he nursed ankle
and shoulder injuries. Portis led Miami with 838 rushing yards as a
freshman, but he is still stuck behind Jackson, a senior, and
junior Najeh Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to watch from the sidelines when you know that
you can get it done,'' Portis said. ''I try to do the best I can on
every play, just in case I don't get another crack at it for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is fourth on the Hurricanes' career rushing list and has
started 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of good backs on the team and that's good,''
said Jackson, who ran for 58 yards against McNeese State. ''Right
now I believe I'm getting the job done. Clinton's time will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Ken Dorsey, who will be making his fifth
career start, and first on the road, against the Huskies, said he
loves having these tools at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Santana Moss is Miami's most dangerous threat with a
combination of flashy moves and 4.3 speed. Against McNeese State,
the senior scored on a 77-yard punt return and a 75-yard reverse
for a total of 204 yards offense in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Wayne, a senior, is third on the Hurricanes career
receiving yardage list, behind Michael Irvin and Lamar Thomas. He
caught two touchdowns passes against McNeese State.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Jones and Andre Johnson are third and fourth receiving
options that could likely start for many other college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and offensive coordinator Larry Coker say they don't
decide ahead of time how many touches Moss or Wayne should get, or
how many carries the backs will receive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get the ball to our playmakers, but the key is
balance,'' Coker said. ''Most any defense can prepare for a team
that only runs or only passes.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Add Woodward, Mottola  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Chad Mottola said he
will never take the game for granted again.
</P>
<P>
   Mottola returned to the majors on Tuesday after his contract was
purchased from Triple A Syracuse. The 28 year-old, chosen fifth
overall by Cincinnati in 1992, played in 35 games with the Reds in
1996, but has been in the minors since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took the game for granted,'' said Mottola, now with his
third organization. ''Being a first round pick you don't have to
work as hard, but when you get older you wonder if you'll ever get
the opportunity again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mottola was the International League's MVP this season after
hitting .309 with a league-leading 33 homers and 102 RBIs, second
in the IL.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting, and it's a relief to be back here,'' he said.
''My mom broke down pretty hard when I told her. She knows how hard
I've worked this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said Mottola might see a start
against a left-hander, but that he would continue to play his
regular players.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a great year,'' Fregosi said. ''I just don't think
he's had a real opportunity to play at the big league level.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Mottola on the 40-man roster, the Blue Jays
designated infielder Kevin Witt for the assignment. Witt hit .247
with 26 homers and 72 RBI for Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Mottola was Witt's roommate on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe somebody will pick him up,'' Mottola said. ''He was
happy for me, but you feel for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays also added infielder Chris Woodward to their
expanded roster. Woodward hit .184 with three homers and 14 RBI in
32 games earlier this season with the Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Activate Mlicki, Morris  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers on Tuesday activated
right-hander pitcher Dave Mlicki and first baseman Hal Morris, who
had been on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers also recalled first baseman/outfielder Dusty Allen
from Triple-A Toledo and purchased left-hander Kevin Tolar's
contract from Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki was placed on the disabled list July 23 due to a chronic
sinus infection. He was 4-10, with a 5.61 ERA for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Morris went on the disabled list Aug. 9 with a fractured left
index finger. He was batting .296 for the Tigers since being
acquired from the Cincinnati Reds on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was optioned Friday and was first recalled by the Tigers
on Aug. 9 when Morris was injured. He is batting .400 for the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Tolar was 4-2 with a 3.30 ERA in 33 games for Toledo. He will
make his major league debut with the Tigers.
</P>

   To make room on the 40-man roster for Tolar, pitcher Brandon

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Suffers Setback  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The news went from bad to worse Tuesday for the
Denver Broncos and their ailing running backs.
</P>
<P>
   With Terrell Davis already hampered by a sprained left ankle,
the Broncos learned that backup Olandis Gary will miss the rest of
the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, who ran for a Denver rookie record 1,159 yards in 12 games
last season, injured the knee in the third quarter of the Broncos'
41-36 loss to the St. Louis Rams on Monday night. He remained in
the game and had runs of 25 and 13 yards in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just wasn't feeling right, but he said, 'There was no way I
was coming out of that game,''' Gary's agent, Harold Lewis, said
Tuesday. ''At the end, when everything had calmed down, I said,
'Are you all right?' He said, 'I'm all right. I'll be ready for
next week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gary's optimism, doctors recommended an MRI, and the
test Tuesday revealed a complete tear of Gary's right ACL. An
identical injury ended Davis' season in the fourth game last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite disappointing,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said
during his weekly appearance on radio station KOA. ''I think
everybody knows what he did last year. Afterward he said he felt
good, so it was more preventative than anything else to get those
tests. Unfortunately the tear is there, and he's going to have to
get operated on here shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan reported improvement to Davis' ankle and hoped to have
the 1998 NFL MVP back at practice on Thursday. The prognosis was
not as good for linebacker Al Wilson, who had two interceptions but
separated his shoulder late in the game. He is listed as
questionable for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis injured his ankle in the second quarter Monday night. He
did not come back after halftime and eventually was taken to the
team bus on a utility cart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked extremely hard in the off-season to come back and
play in a game like this,'' Davis said Monday night. ''If it's not
one thing, it's another, but my spirits are high right now. It's
the first game, and we have 15 more to play. All I can do is go out
there and try to prepare again and get this ankle ready to play
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   With teammates, fans and coaches eager to see how Davis'
reconstructed knee would hold up on unyielding artificial turf, the
early results were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gained 17 yards on Denver's first three offensive plays
and another 11 in his second series. After twice being stopped for
no gain late in the first quarter, he injured his ankle on a 6-yard
gain early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Gary gained 80 yards on 13 carries after replacing Davis. The
only other running back on Denver's roster is rookie Mike Anderson,
while rookie KaRon Coleman is on the practice squad. The Broncos
cut John Avery a week before the season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully Mike will step up and do the things that Olandis did
when Terrell went down last year,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gary and third-year quarterback Brian Griese, the Broncos
nearly upset St. Louis on the night the Rams celebrated last
season's Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   Denver led by a point with less than seven minutes remaining
only to see the Rams put together a decisive 75-yard scoring drive.
St. Louis then sacked Griese twice and forced a hurried
incompletion on fourth-and-33.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was proud of the way the team played,'' said Griese, who was
19-of-29 for 307 yards. ''I think we did some good things, but
there is a lot of things we can build on. Trust me, we are going to
get better from this game and hopefully we will see the Rams again
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense, which had three interceptions, took much of
the heat for Monday's loss. The Broncos could at least take solace
in the fact that they probably won't face a more potent offense
again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing against this offense instead of watching it is very
hard,'' said safety Billy Jenkins, who was with St. Louis last
year. ''Those guys are some of the most elusive guys in the
league.''

<HEADLINE> Houston Team To Announce Name  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The NFL's newest franchise has a host city and
the framework of a new stadium. It has a scouting system and a
general manager, Charlie Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   And it has an owner who paid $700 million to bring professional
football back to Houston to replace the Oilers, who left for
Tennessee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What the team does not have is a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   That changes Wednesday, when owner Bob McNair will announce the
team colors and logo for the NFL's 32nd franchise, after months of
research with the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll finally have an identity,'' McNair said. ''We'll no
longer be the Houston Whatchamacallits.''
</P>
<P>
   Former NFL kicker Raul Allegre will begin the ceremonies with a
ceremonial kickoff in the Astrodome, where the Oilers played.
Former Oilers coach Bum Phillips also is expected to take part.
</P>
<P>
   McNair will go to baseball's Enron Field, where the Houston
Astros face the Florida Marlins, to throw out the ceremonial first
''pitch'' with a football to Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A 69,500-seat retractable roof stadium is under construction
near the Astrodome for the new team, and McNair will try to land
the 2004 Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Official: Arafat Should Show Gains  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Yasser Arafat must bring back real
gains from meetings with President Clinton in New York if he wants
to delay a Sept. 13 deadline for statehood, a senior Palestinian
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Central Council chairman Selim Zanoun said the body
would need at least two promises before it would put off
declaration of a state.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, Israel would have to promise to hand over West
Bank territory, as it pledged in an earlier agreement. Also, he
said, the United States and Israel would have to agree to allow the
Palestinians to set up their state by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Central Council is to meet this weekend to
decide about declaring a state. Palestinian officials have strongly
hinted that the council will approve the delay, but Zanoun said it
was not a given.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PCC will not agree to a delay without serious
obligations,'' he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has threatened to unilaterally
annex West Bank land if the Palestinians declare statehood on Sept.
13. That would likely lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying came ahead of Clinton's efforts this week to
reconvene a Mideast summit. Clinton is meeting separately with
Palestinian leader Arafat and Barak on Wednesday during the U.N.
Millennium summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer, a Barak confidant,
said the prime minister had conceded enough at the Camp David
summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality right now is that we are just waiting for answers
from the other side,'' Ben Eliezer told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would propose bringing the hard-line
opposition Likud party into his government if there is no agreement
by the end of October, when parliament reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak leads a minority government, and bringing the Likud in
would be one way to survive efforts to topple him -- but it would
chill the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Barak lost the support of hawkish parties because of the
far-reaching proposals at Camp David -- he broke long-standing
taboos by even discussing Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees. Arafat also breached a taboo by tentatively agreeing to
Israel keeping some West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem issue collapsed the talks. Palestinians and
Israelis could not agree how to divide the walled Old City in the
city's traditionally Arab eastern sector. The Old City houses some
of the holiest sites in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been pressing for a solution that would defer a
decision for several years. That has been welcomed by the Israelis,
but the Palestinians have insisted that Jerusalem -- where they want
to set up a capital -- should be part of a final package.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a top Palestinian negotiator, Ahmed Qureia, proposed
internationalizing all Jerusalem pending agreement on how to share
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we can reach an agreement on Jerusalem, I have to
declare that both parts of Jerusalem east and west should be a
unified international Jerusalem ... not just the capital of Israel
or Palestine, but a capital of the world,'' Qureia told the
626-member European Parliament in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Palestinians proposed anything close
to the U.S. proposal to delay discussing the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami rejected the idea.
''There is no such thing'' as an international city, he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said both sides must have symbolic sovereignty on the
hill where holy sites are located. He told Israel television that
Israel wants an arrangement that ''preserves the actual situation
on the ground but gives symbolic satisfaction to both sides, and
this can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel claims sovereignty there, but the Islamic religious
council, or Wakf, administers the Muslim sites.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy foreign minister, Nawaf Massalha, said ''the
problem is between the Israelis and the Palestinians or the Jews
and the Arabs, and they have to solve it,'' he said. ''It's not the
international community's problem ... It is our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, King Abdullah II of Jordan encouraged Palestinians
and Israelis to work toward a peace settlement, saying a window of
opportunity to end decades of conflict in the Middle East should
not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's comments, made through a spokesman, came after a
brief meeting with Barak in tight security at a midtown Manhattan
hotel. The two are in New York to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The king and the prime minister agreed that Arafat would have to
make ''final decisions regarding outstanding issues in the peace
process,'' Barak's office said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Haiti on Election Setup  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration vowed Tuesday to
impose economic sanctions against Haiti unless it strengthens
democratic procedures in advance of presidential and legislative
elections set for Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was issued by Luis Lauredo, U.S. ambassador to the
Organization of American States, at an OAS permanent council
meeting on OAS efforts to help build democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Lauredo accused Haitian authorities of an unwillingness to
address the ''serious irregularities and deficiencies'' that he
said were evident during parliamentary runoff elections in May.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff, along with balloting in June and July, resulted in
overwhelming victories for the Lavalas Family party of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is expected to win
re-election to the presidency in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the absence of meaningful change,'' Lauredo said, ''the
United States will not support the presidential and legislative
elections of Nov. 26, financially or through observer missions,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Haitian senator praised Lauredo's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hail the evolution of the U.S. position,'' said Paul Denis,
of the former parliamentary majority Struggling People's
Organization. ''It will support the struggle of the Haitian people
against a government that wants to establish a dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauredo added that the U.S. government also would send nearly
all bilateral assistance to the people of Haiti through private and
non-governmental organizations, thus bypassing the Haitian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Lauredo also raised the possibility that the United States would
oppose Haitian loan requests from international lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had spoken of the possibility of punitive
measures previously but only in general terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached a crossroads,'' Lauredo said. ''The elation
experienced on May 21, when millions of Haitians demonstrated their
trust in the ballot box and democratic elections, has turned sour
as a result of the unwillingness of the Haitian authorities to
address the serious irregularities and deficiencies arising in the
elections' aftermath.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the electoral procures also was expressed by
Ambassador Kingsley C.A. Layne, of St. Vincent, speaking on behalf
of the Caribbean Community.
</P>
<P>
   OAS election monitors said some seats won in the first round of
voting should have gone to a runoff vote in May because the leading
candidate failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote. That
assessment is shared by the Clinton administration -- as well as
Canada and the European Union, both of which also have raised the
possibility of imposing sanctions against Haiti.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Clinton To Attend Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chelsea Clinton, so weary from foreign travel
with her dad that she missed a chance to vacation with her parents
in New York, is feeling better and is ready to represent the first
family at the Olympic Games in Australia, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Having been with President Clinton on trips to Nigeria,
Tanzania, Egypt and Colombia late last month, Chelsea didn't feel
up to going on a vacation/fund-raising jaunt to upstate New York
with her parents, who returned to the White House on Saturday after
one night out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the only real problem was that she was tired,'' White
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Tuesday. ''I think she was
subjected to a full dose of her father's schedule: a four-day trip
to Africa with a half a day off, and then a day trip to South
America, then the prospect of traveling up to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea, 20, decided to take a semester off from her studies at
Stanford University to be with her father as his presidency winds
down -- and with her mother as her race for a Senate seat from New
York heats up.
</P>
<P>
   In June, at a visit to the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula
Vista, Calif., the president said he wanted to attend the Olympic
Games this month in Sydney, but that his daughter would be
representing the family at those games. Opening ceremonies are
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife is in a competition of her own and I am informed my
services may be needed elsewhere,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13 is Mrs. Clinton's first debate against Rick Lazio, her
Republican challenger for the Senate seat.

<HEADLINE> Group To Unleash Anti-Missile Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Television ads critical of a proposed missile
defense project shelved by President Clinton will start appearing
on cable political shows Wednesday in congressional districts where
pro-missile defense candidates face the stiffest competition.
</P>
<P>
   The ads play off the project's several failures in tests, citing
statements from groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists and
Federation of American Scientists, which oppose the project.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Action, the group behind the ads, has bought time on CNN
during its prime time political shows. Voters in several
hotly-contested districts will see the ads. The group is especially
targeting Senate candidates, including Republicans Rick Lazio of
New York, and Sens. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Rick Santorum of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The ad opens with balloons floating through the sky, while a
narrator says, ''This is a mylar balloon. It is not a nuclear
warhead. Trouble is, the Star Wars Missile System the Pentagon is
pushing can't tell the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest test of the system, in July, failed when the booster
rocket didn't release the warhead-busting device called a ''kill
vehicle.'' It was the third test of the intercept program with two
of them having failed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton said he is not convinced the system is
possible with current technology, and decided to leave it to the
next administration to decide when, or if, to deploy the shield.

<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Police searched Tuesday for a man who
brandished a gun at a health clinic and demanded to see his
children.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified man vanished from the Buncombe County Health
Center after pulling out a weapon in front of a receptionist
Tuesday morning. Some 200 employees and patients were evacuated
from the center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''.. (He) pulled a pistol, then he told the receptionist he
wanted his kids,'' said assistant health director Nancy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication his children were actually at the
center. City spokeswoman Robin Nix said there had been no reports
of gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen officers with dogs searched in vain for the
man, who was described as dark-haired, about 5 feet 9 inches tall,
weighing 165 pounds and wearing a blue checked shirt and a baseball
cap.

Montana Land Reopening to Public
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Millions of acres that had been closed in Montana
because of wildfires were reopened to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts
today, but the fire threat in the West was still far from over. Twenty-five
large fires still burned on 645,079 acres in Montana alone today, but rain and
falling temperatures across the Northern Rockies had reduced the risk of those
fires spreading, officials said. Nearly 20 million acres of public, state and
private land had been closed in Montana, about one-fifth of the state.

Bush Unveils $158 Billion Drug Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- George W. Bush outlined a $158 billion prescription
drug plan today that he said would offer senior citizens more choices and
quicker coverage than Al Gore's competing Medicare expansion. The Bush plan
would fundamentally restructure Medicare, forcing the government plan to compete
with private plans for the first time. In comparison, Bush said Gore's $253
billion 10-year plan would provide ''resources without reform.'' Gore, in turn,
said Bush won't have the money for a major drug plan if he spends as much of the
expected federal surplus as he has promised on a tax cut.

Tire Hearings Unlikely To Tell Cause

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers have an arsenal of questions about defective

apart on the road? Officials from Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co.
say they have hired outside experts to help find out. Most of the 6.5 million
Firestone tires that have been recalled are on Ford vehicles, including the
popular Ford Explorer. The companies have said the reason the tires were
recalled on Aug. 9 was data showing those tires have more tread separation,
blowouts and other problems than comparable models.

<HEADLINE> MP3.com: Judge could extinguish company with Wednesday ruling  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Universal Music Group, the world's largest
record company, asked a judge Tuesday to award it up to $450
million in damages because MP3.com infringed its copyrights, an
amount the Internet music company said would put it out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   After considering closing arguments Tuesday, U.S. District Judge
Jed S. Rakoff said he would rule Wednesday afternoon whether
MP3.com willfully infringed Universal's copyrights and may
determine how much MP3.com must pay per violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''An award should sting. It should be serious,'' said Hadrian
Katz, Universal's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's record companies were the lone plaintiffs at the
trial. The nation's four other major record companies settled with
MP3.com after Rakoff found earlier this year that MP3.com had
violated copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   If he finds Wednesday that the company did so intentionally,
that could increase potential damages.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the settlements were not disclosed but the company
set aside $150 million recently to cover its legal costs, including
the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said a $450 million award would be $45,000 for each of
10,000 CDs Universal maintains were illegally copied and included
in an MP3.com service that allowed MP3.com customers to access
their favorite CDs on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said the award would hurt the innovative Internet
company but would not be so harsh that it ''would put people out of
work or end MP3.com as a corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rhodes, MP3.com's lawyer, pleaded with the judge not to
impose a penalty ''in the Draconian range of $400 million, an award
that could never be satisfied and would end up being the largest
paper award in history.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Universal did not deserve what he described as a
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not one iota of evidence that they even lost a
penny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Rakoff to conclude MP3.com did not violate copyrights
willfully.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com chief executive Michael Robertson testified that the
company went to great lengths to develop software that would
require customers to prove they already own CDs before they were
permitted to hear their favorite tunes over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com caused a stir in early January when it began the
MyMP3.com listening service, which allows customers to hear CDs
from anywhere once they prove they own them by inserting them into
a computer CD slot.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com, Rhodes said, voluntarily suspended the illegal aspects
of the service as soon as the judge ruled and sought to negotiate
business deals with the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the settlements, as many as half of the CDs in MP3.com's
collection may not be covered by the deals, meaning that a large
ruling for Universal could prompt a wave of fresh lawsuits against
MP3.com, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that music publishers also had not reached deals with
MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes suggested the company not be penalized any more than $500
for each of what MP3.com estimates is 4,700 CDs in the Universal
collection that would be subject to a court order.
</P>
<P>
   But Katz said a $2.4 million award against MP3.com would send
the wrong message to other entrepreneurs who might want to test
copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Massive copyright infringement is the kind of innovation that
needs to be deterred,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Early Byes Don't Cut It for USC  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One bye down, and another on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It's a development that doesn't particularly please Southern
California coach Paul Hackett and some of his players.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when you win your opener impressively, as the
11th-ranked Trojans did in beating Penn State 29-5 in the Kickoff
Classic on Aug. 27, at East Rutherford, N.J., you want to play
again, and right away.
</P>
<P>
   'I just think when you're rolling ... a bye is bad,'' Hackett
said Tuesday. ''Byes aren't things we look forward to, I don't like
byes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to crank it up and go. I would have much rather
played a game, we're an exciting team. The most exciting guy on
Saturday is going to be me. We've got a lot of zip on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will have 13 days between their win over Penn State
and Saturday's game at the Los Angeles Coliseum against Colorado, a
28-24 loser to Colorado State in its first game of the season last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Trojans take another week off before entertaining San
Jose State on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to get to the next UC Davis game, it's near
Philadelphia (against West Chester University),'' Hackett said with
a sigh. Hackett's son, Nathaniel, is a sophomore linebacker at UC
Davis, and Hackett watched him play last Saturday in a 55-7 victory
over New Mexico Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another bye, man,'' USC linebacker Zeke Moreno said. ''I'll
tell you, I don't know who made up the schedule. You practice all
week, you want to play Saturday. I look forward to playing
Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanker Marcell Allmond also expressed frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times between games, twice,'' he said. ''But we get
to watch everyone else we're going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Colorado was impressive on both sides of the ball
despite losing to its in-state rival, and the statistics back him
up.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes had 29 first downs and 532 yards of total offense
while Colorado State had 17 first downs and only 65 yards rushing.
The Rams scored on pass plays of 52, 34, 42 and 30 yards, and
gained 327 yards through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the big question early in the game is 'Are they going
to stop the run and force Carson (Palmer) to throw?''' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The highly touted Palmer passed for only 87 yards against Penn
State, but it didn't matter since the Trojans were in command
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carson, I don't think, will have that kind of game too many
times,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was playing in his first game since last Sept. 25, when
he broke his right collarbone against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colorado is very tough to run against,'' Hackett said. ''We
believe we're a stronger running team right now than we have been
in the past. We'll just see how the game unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he was very pleased about the performance by USC's
offensive line against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have smarted for years about what's been said about
them,'' he said. ''(But) it's just one game. Every year's a new
year, you do not know the makeup or the chemistry of your team
until you play two or three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett admitted he was ''very surprised'' Penn State lost to
Toledo 24-6 at home last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shock to me is not that they lost, it's that they lost at
Happy Valley,'' Hackett said. ''I know the Toledo people we talked
to felt like they have a good team, but they're not ready to play
in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they have a pretty good defense, I'm not sure about
their offense,'' Hackett said of Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also said, believe it or not, he was ''thrilled for
UCLA'' in the wake of the Bruins' 35-24 upset of then-No. 3 Alabama
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of tribute goes to that team,'' Hackett said. ''It's
great for our conference. We've been listening to our conference
get hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 had a very difficult time last season, and then its
teams went 1-4 in bowl games. Pac-10 teams have started this season
7-0 against non-conference opponents.

   DENVER (AP) -- Five days before its actual presentation, Sammy
Sosa shot a television spot highlighting his acceptance and
acknowledgment of a 2000 Hispanic Heritage Award.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is impressive, especially considering where I came

</P>
<P>
   The spot was taped prior to the Chicago Cubs-Colorado Rockies
game Tuesday at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs outfielder is one of five recipients honored by the
Hispanic Heritage Awards Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Widely recognized as the most prestigious honor in the Hispanic

</P>
<P>
   Actor Anthony Quinn, Pulitzer Prize novelist Oscar Hijuelos,
UCLA law professor Cruz Reynoso and labor organizer Delores Huerta
join Sosa as their year's recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame offensive guard Anthony Munoz and Olympian Rebecca

<HEADLINE> Cheney Defends Charitable Donations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Dick Cheney defended his direct
contributions to charities, which accounted for less than 1 percent
of the $4 million he earned last year, saying donations are a
matter of private choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a choice that individuals have to make in terms of what
they want to do with their resources,'' the GOP vice presidential
candidate said Tuesday. ''I thought it was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the donations arose after Cheney, running mate
for George W. Bush, released personal tax records for himself and
his wife Lynne last week showing that $442,152 went to charities
from 1989 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half of the amount, $209,832, were direct,
out-of-pocket contributions to charities. Cheney said the donations
went to United Way, a scholarship fund for inner city kids, and
other charities.
</P>
<P>
   Another $89,500 were honorariums for speeches that were declined
and requested to be donated to charities. In addition, $142,820 was
requested as matches for charitable contributions from corporations
on whose boards the Cheneys sit.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years in government jobs, Cheney, a former defense
secretary and congressman, joined Halliburton Co. in 1995 as chief
executive officer. Last year he and his wife, a writer and research
fellow, reported gross income of $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney have urged support of faith-based organizations
and charities that provide services to cure social problems and
help poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the appropriate level of giving is up to the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a private matter ... a matter of private choice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife Laura gave $334,000 in donations in 1998, the
last year figures were available, representing just under 2 percent
of their taxable income of $18.4 million that year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and his wife Tipper
gave $15,000 to charity in 1998, representing nearly 7 percent of
their taxable income of $224,000.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and his wife criticized in 1997 for
contributing only $353 to charity, after giving away more than
$35,000 the year before.

<HEADLINE> Colts Await Muhammad Decision  </HEADLINE>
By ANDY PROFFET
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts' failure to act
against a player convicted of beating his wife is ''reprehensible''
and tells the community that the team tolerates domestic abuse,
according to a coalition of domestic violence counselors.
</P>
<P>
   In separate letters sent Tuesday to NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue and Colts president Bill Polian, the Domestic Violence
Network Inc. and the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence
demanded that defensive back Mustafah Muhammad be suspended for
three games without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find it reprehensible that an organization claiming to be a
community partner would send a message, through its lack of action,
that domestic abuse is tolerated,'' said the letter to Tagliabue,
signed by Domestic Violence Network director Tracy Horth Krueger
and coalition director Laura Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad -- formerly known as Steve Muhammad -- was convicted last
week of beating his pregnant wife on Oct. 28. He received a
suspended sentence of one year in jail and was put on probation for
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad also was ordered to undergo 12 weeks of domestic
violence counseling and to perform 32 hours of community service.
The groups' letter said they intend to ask that he be assigned to
work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Team leaders have consistently refused to act against Muhammad
since his arrest on three counts of domestic battery and the
subsequent death of his wife and their stillborn child in an
unrelated car crash, saying they would let the judicial process
work.
</P>
<P>
   After Muhammad was convicted last week, Polian said the Colts
would let the NFL decide whether he should face sanctions -- a
decision strongly criticized in the local news media. Muhammad
suited up for Sunday's game at Kansas City and remains on active
status, Polian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts must wait for the league office to consider Muhammad's
case before a suspension or other penalties can be levied, he said.
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league had no timetable for a
decision on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Polian said the team will implement many of the suggestions
offered in the groups' letter, including participation in a public
awareness campaign about domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do as much as humanly possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad's attorney, James Voyles of Indianapolis, said he would
speak for his client ''at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're entitled to write to anyone they want to write,''
Voyles said of the letters. ''I just wonder what other employers
have received letters concerning employees convicted of domestic
abuse this month.''

<HEADLINE> Tests show horse died from West Nile Virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A horse on a Cape May county farm is New
Jersey's first confirmed death from the West Nile Virus, state
agriculture officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tests show the 6-year-old thoroughbred gelding died from the
virus and complications from other illnesses, Agriculture Secretary
Art Brown said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The horse became ill Wednesday and was euthanized Saturday.
Symptoms like high fever and unusually aggressive behavior prompted
the test, according to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Owners reported that the horse did not leave their Tuckahoe farm
for the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, horses only become infected with the virus
when bitten by a mosquito and not all horses become ill. The
sometimes fatal disease can't be spread to humans from infected
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the state Health Department said a Jersey City man was
the first in the state to be infected. Seven people in New York
have died from the disease this year.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Awaits Syrian Election Nod  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
chances of regaining his old job rose with his landslide
re-election to parliament, but neighboring Syria may have final say
over whether he takes back the post.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri, a billionaire who made his fortune in construction in
Saudi Arabia, said Tuesday he has not made up his mind whether he
wants to be prime minister again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's premature to talk about it now. It is a big mistake to
say that I am running for the post of the prime minister,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which dominates Lebanon militarily and politically, has
not made its position clear. Hariri is a friend of Syrian President
Bashar Assad and has economic investments in Syria. But Syria also
firmly supports Emile Lahoud, Lebanon's president and Hariri's
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1989 Arab-brokered peace plan that ended Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war, the president must name a prime minister after
polling the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two rounds of parliamentary elections for the
128-member legislature ended Sunday, more than 50 lawmakers were
reported to have voiced support for Hariri. Lahoud's choice,
current Prime Minister Salim Hoss, failed to win a seat in
parliament after a divisive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri extended an olive branch to Lahoud at his news conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hand will be extended to cooperate with political and
national leaders in the country and all legislators to reassert
Lebanon's presence on the Arab, regional and international map,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud vehemently opposes Hariri, who stepped down as prime
minister in 1998 after a power struggle with the president. If
Hariri seeks the post and his legislative allies support him,
Lahoud would have few options but to appoint him prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Sarkis Naoum, a political analyst for Lebanon's leading
newspaper, An-Nahar, said Hariri is waiting for the outcome of
discussions between Lahoud and Syria on the choice of prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Syria is seeking to reconcile conflicting Lebanese viewpoints
so as to ensure that the premiership issue will not lead to a
government crisis,'' Naoum said.
</P>
<P>
   Syria once did little to hide its hand in appointing Lebanese
leaders. Since Assad took over Lebanon policy for Syria in recent
years, open intervention has subsided -- in part because Syria has
the loyalty of every leading Lebanese politician.
</P>
<P>
   Assad became Syrian president earlier this year following the
death of his father, Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Syria is positively and optimistically looking at the results
of the Lebanese elections, which the Lebanese state has
accomplished peacefully,'' wrote Al-Baath newspaper, mouthpiece of
Syria's ruling Baath Party, in an editorial Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud has more than a month to begin consultations on naming a
new prime minister and the Hoss government does not have to resign
until the departing parliament's four-year mandate expires on Oct.
15.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1992-98 tenure, Hariri launched a multibillion-dollar
plan to rebuild Lebanon from the devastating civil war. He was
criticized harshly by the Hoss government for saddling the country
with $20 billion in debt and wasting public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss' failure to deliver on pledges to deal with Lebanon's
economic recession led voters to turn back to Hariri.
</P>
<P>
   The election is a welcome sign that the Lebanese government is
establishing its authority in the south of the country, which for
18 years was under Israeli military control, the U.N.
secretary-general said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops withdrew from south Lebanon in May. After the
pullback, the United Nations helped draw the new border and sent
peacekeepers to patrol it.
</P>
<P>
   In south Lebanon, results indicated that residents, who had
their first opportunity to vote in more than 20 years, rewarded the
Hezbollah and Amal guerrilla groups for their war against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan congratulated Lebanon ''for
successfully holding two rounds of parliamentary elections
throughout the country, including in the south,'' said a statement
issued by U.N. spokesman Fred Eckard.

<HEADLINE> Judge declines to toss out lawsuit seeking to permit wholesale wine sales </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An effort by out-of-state wineries to strike
down a New York State law preventing them from selling directly to
New York consumers cleared its first hurdle when a judge refused
Tuesday to toss it out.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman declined to rule on the
merits of the issue but he did cite successful challenges of
similar laws in other states, including Indiana, Illinois and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said even though there had been an evolution in the
way the courts have treated liquor sale cases, including a 1984
Supreme Court case in which the justices rejected state statutes
that discriminated against interstate commerce, he said it was
''too early to assess definitively the wisdom and correctness of
these other rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not too early for the plaintiffs to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's David 1, Goliath nothing,'' said Clint Bolick, litigation
director for the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm which
brought the case on behalf of wineries in Virginia and California
and three New York State consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bolick said he expected the New York case would be a significant
battle ground for the law, which is similar to statutes in 29 other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is the largest of those states and the wholesaler
industry seems to be circling the wagons in New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the firms sued the New York State Liquor Authority,
seeking to overturn the Direct Shipment and Advertising Ban, a law
which its says prevents out-of-state wineries from obtaining a
license to distribute alcoholic beverages directly to consumers in
New York State and from advertising their wines directly to New
York consumers, even on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left with a spokesman for New York State
Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   After the lawsuit was filed, others joined it to defend the law,
including four large wholesalers, a union, a package store
association and an activist who has fought in the past to keep
liquor and cigarettes out of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   They had argued that the law was Constitutional and necessary to
regulate liquor sales in New York State, including keeping liquor
away from those under the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like most states, New York has long required that imported
liquors be distributed here only through licensed wholesalers and
retailers for good reasons,'' said lawyer Randy Mastro, reading a
statement he issued jointly with a second attorney.
</P>
<P>
   He said the law was necessary to ensure accountability and
responsibility, to make sure the liquor market was orderly and to
collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are legitimate state interests that we are confident the
court will ultimately find our Constitution protects,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Teens Convicted in McDonald Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Three teen-agers were convicted of felony murder
Tuesday in the deaths of two firefighters who suffocated battling a
blaze set during the burglary of a Houston fast-food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Gerome Davis, 17, and brothers Pedro Isreal Loredo, 19,
and Juan Torres, 17, face up to life in prison. Testimony in their
punishment phase began Tuesday afternoon and was expected to take
several days.
</P>
<P>
   The three teens admitted breaking into the darkened McDonald's
early Feb. 14, armed with a cutting torches, a key and a safe code
allegedly provided by an assistant manager. They claimed they left
empty-handed, but prosecutors presented evidence that showed they
the teens went on a spending spree after the restaurant burned.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Davis and Loredo suggested during the trial that
Torres set the fire intentionally out of anger that that three
didn't make the big score they anticipated. Torres' attorney
implied the blaze was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that the three burned the building to cover
their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran firefighters Lewis Mayo, 44, and Kimberly Smith, 30,
responded to the fire call and had pulled a hose into the building
when the roof collapsed, trapping them. Autopsies showed they died
of smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   There was little reaction to the verdicts in the courtroom
Tuesday, and State District Judge Mary Lou Keel had prohibited
participants from publicly commenting on the trial until it is
over.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old McDonald's night manager and another man accused
of helping the three plan the break-in are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> China Cuts 40 Olympic Athletes  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- China is cutting 40 athletes and
officials from its team for the Sydney Olympics, including seven
rowers who failed blood tests for the banned performance-enhancing
drug EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased,'' International Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch said Wednesday of the doping withdrawals.
''I'm very happy. This is very good news. It shows the new system
for detecting doping substances will work very well. ... The
objective is to have clean games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers said they were notified by the Chinese Olympic
Committee of the withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch received a letter from
the Chinese rowing association confirming that seven rowers were
being withdrawn from the Olympic team after they tested positive
for EPO, or erthyropoietin, during doping controls in China.
</P>
<P>
   Schamasch said blood tests showed the athletes' EPO levels were
above the allowable limit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the IOC executive board approved the introduction of
a combined blood and urine test for EPO at the Sydney Games. EPO,
the drug of choice among endurance athletes, stimulates the
production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, and experts say it
can improve performance by up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no test had been able to detect the use of synthetic
EPO.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, an athlete will be considered guilty of EPO use only
if both the blood and urine tests are positive. Schamasch said the
Chinese rowers were dropped based only on blood testing.
</P>
<P>
   China, tarnished by a series of doping scandals in swimming and
other sports, has been carrying out sweeping drug tests to prevent
the embarrassment of positive results during the Sydney Games. With
Beijing bidding for the 2008 Olympics, China is particularly eager
to be seen as cracking down.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Jianyong, secretary general of the Chinese Rowing
Association, said the rowers had withdrawn to protect their health
and uphold the fairness of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trusting the Chinese,'' Samaranch said. ''They are
fighting against doping. This is an example for many other
countries. This is good news for the image of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the withdrawals of the 33 other Chinese team
members was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be surprised if all 40 were (for drugs),'' IOC vice
president Dick Pound said. ''My guess is you'll find they were in
some elimination tournament and didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, chairman of the new World Anti-Doping Agency, welcomed
the withdrawal of the seven rowers as ''a huge step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who takes EPO now knows they will be caught, increasing
the chances they won't do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, a former U.S. Olympic rower
and a vice president of the international rowing federation, said
the reduction in the Chinese team sent the right message to
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a warning to all athletes who wish to come to the
games with drugs in their system -- stay at home,'' she said. ''I've
said for a long time any athlete who is using drugs who can not
compete with his or her own ability should stay at home. Do not
come to the Games if you are not coming clean.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC began out-of-competition testing for EPO in Sydney and
elsewhere in Australia last week. So far, 10 athletes have been
tested, Schamasch said. The IOC expects to conduct 400 or more EPO
tests through the end of the games.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 3,200 drug tests will be carried out before and
during the games, the biggest anti-doping program in Olympic
history.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Suspends Five Devil Rays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tampa Bay outfielder Gerald Williams was
suspended for five games and fined $2,000 for last week's fights
against the Boston Red Sox, and four teammates were suspended for
three games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was penalized Tuesday for ''charging the mound,
inciting a bench clearing incident and returning to the dugout
following an ejection,'' according to the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Dave Eiland, Tony Fiore and Cory Lidle were suspended
for three games each and fined for ''intentionally throwing at
batters after a warning had been issued,'' and Devil Rays manager
Larry Rothschild was suspended for three games and fined for
''failing to pre-empt his players' wrongful conduct and for making
inappropriate comments during and after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, baseball's head of discipline, imposed the
penalties after reviewing the Aug. 29 game, which was interrupted
five times by fights and/or arguments. Boston's Pedro Martinez
pitched a one-hitter, taking a no-hitter into the ninth, and eight
Devil Rays were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild wanted to know why Martinez was not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person that precipitated the event walks away,''
Rothschild said. ''I don't know if that is a good precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' association appealed the penalties imposed on
Williams and Fiore, meaning the suspensions can't start until a
hearing before Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll just abide by the decision,'' Williams said, apparently
referring to Beeston.
</P>
<P>
   Lidle started his suspension Tuesday and Rothschild is to start
his Wednesday. Eiland's suspension was not scheduled to start until
later this week and he probably will make a decision Wednesday on
whether to have the union appeal on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a little stiff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore and Lidle were more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it was coming down sooner or later,'' Fiore said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Lidle: ''I guess it was in the ballpark for what I was
expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was ejected for fighting after Martinez hit him on the
arm leading off the game and he charged the mound. Boston's Brian
Daubach was hit by pitches twice after playing a role in the
first-inning fight, during which he hyperextended his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought that Daubach was throwing cheap shots in the pile
and you have to protect your players,'' Rothschild said after the
game. ''You're not going to let that happen, and the only problem
was that our pitchers kept missing that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then retired 24 consecutive batters before John
Flaherty singled leading off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland was ejected in the third inning for hitting Daubach and
Nomar Garciaparra. Lidle and Fiore were tossed during Daubach's
at-bat in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Sign Smith To Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers signed former Kansas
City and Denver defensive end Neil Smith to a two-year contract
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will begin his 13th season in the AFC West. He spent the
last three years with the Broncos, making 34 tackles and 6&AMP;frac12; sacks
in eight games last season. He played with Denver's Super Bowl
champion teams in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining the Broncos, Smith spent nine years with the
Chiefs and was part of their playoff run from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It took almost two weeks to reach the contract agreement with
Smith, who first visited the Chargers camp on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's visit may have seemed well-timed, as the Chargers had
just lost their leading pass rusher, Raylee Johnson, to a
season-ending knee injury. Johnson had a career-high 10&AMP;frac12; sacks last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The signing became even more urgent after defensive end Al
Fontenot injured a calf in the Chargers' 9-6 season-opening loss to
Oakland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not expected to practice with the Chargers until
Thursday, as his wife gave birth to a girl Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has started 162 NFL games and played in 181 since being
the No. 2 overall draft pick in 1988. He has 664 tackles, 104&AMP;frac12;
sacks and four interceptions.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan today urged the kings,
generals and presidents descending on New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit to
use the unprecedented meeting to forge peace and end poverty in the 21st
century. But some heads of state are expected to use the three days of speeches,
discussions and meetings beginning tomorrow to push their own agendas --
including those that are critical of the United States. In a taste of what may
come, North Korea denounced the United States as a ''rogue state'' today,
claiming the government was responsible for allegedly ordering the strip search
of members of the delegation as they switched planes in Germany. The incident
prompted Pyongyang to call off the summit trip by its No. 2 leader, who had been
scheduled to meet South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.

Land Reopens to Public in Montana

<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Although the fire threat in the West was still far from
over, millions of acres that had been closed in Montana because of wildfires
were reopened to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts today. Twenty-five large
fires still burned on 645,079 acres in Montana alone today, but rain and falling
temperatures across the Northern Rockies had reduced the risk of those fires
spreading, officials said. Nearly 20 million acres of public, state and private
land had been closed in Montana, about one-fifth of the state.

Bush Unveils $158 Billion Drug Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush
outlined a $158 billion prescription drug plan today that he said would offer
senior citizens more choices and quicker coverage than Al Gore's competing
Medicare expansion. The Bush plan would fundamentally restructure Medicare,
forcing the government plan to compete with private plans for the first time. In
comparison, Bush said Gore's $253 billion 10-year plan would provide ''resources
without reform.'' Gore, in turn, said Bush won't have the money for a major drug
plan if he spends as much of the expected federal surplus as he has promised on
a tax cut.

Senate Moves On China Trade Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China trade was the first order of business today as the
Senate returned from its summer recess with leaders of both parties determined
to approve the normalization of trade relations before lawmakers close shop to
campaign before the November elections. Passing the bill this year is
''profoundly important for the country,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a
leading advocate of widening trade with China. While supporters believe they
have a solid majority in the Senate, they face two real dangers -- time
limitations as Congress rushes to finish its work for the year and the
determination of some senators to link normalized trade to China's weapons
proliferation and human rights record.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Likely Without Eldred  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Cal Eldred's comeback from a nerve problem in his
troublesome right elbow apparently is over for this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the Chicago White Sox awaited results of a bone scan on
Eldred's elbow Tuesday, manager Jerry Manuel said he's not counting
on having the veteran right-hander for the final 3&AMP;frac12; weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who had ligament replacement surgery while with Brewers
in 1995, has been on the disabled list since July 17. It's his
sixth trip to the DL in five years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary reasons for the White Sox's fast start,
Eldred was 10-2 with two complete games and a shutout this season.
He came to Chicago in a trade along with shortstop Jose Valentin
for Jaime Navarro and John Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Eldred was throwing like his pre-surgery days when he
won 11, 16 and 11 games for the Brewers from 1992-94.
</P>
<P>
   But on July 14 while pitcing against the Cardinals, he felt pain
in his elbow in the fifth inning and had to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   That sent Eldred on another comeback and he had made progress,
so much in fact he hoped to pitch this Friday against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But during his second rehab start Sunday at Triple-A Charlotte,
the pain returned and Eldred pulled himself out after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt something. He did the right thing and took himself
out,'' general manager Ron Schueler said. ''He did the smart
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox wouldn't say for certain that Eldred was done.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the stuff hasn't come back, so that's not official, but as
a manager you have to go about and not plan for him to be back
again,'' Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get him back, it would be great. From what I understand
they are waiting to get tests back from the doctors that could give
a glimmer of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Eldred would be the biggest blow yet to a starting
rotation that is struggling down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin, a 14-game winner, had to miss a start with a
tired arm and was rocked in his last outing. Jim Parque has won
only two of his last nine starts. And rookie Jon Garland, who's
been inconsistent, spent time on the disabled list after being hit
with a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, no Eldred, who brought more than just his pitching to the
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he completes a game and saves our bullpen and his
presence with the young pitchers on how to act, we lost a big part
of the team,'' Manuel said. ''He brings so much because he has been
through so much, so there is a lot to offer. And all those things
he has to offer, we will miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kip Wells, recalled Tuesday from a rehab assignment, said
Eldred was an influence on him during his first two stints with the
White Sox this season and during his rehab appearances at
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see a lot of strength and perseverance in him you don't
see in a lot of other guys,'' Wells said. ''He was a little down
and upset that the course of action went the way it had. I think
it's more of an emotional letdown than a physical one. To have his
arm let him down a third or fourth time now is a little
disheartening for him and everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred was not available for comment..

<HEADLINE> Avs Forward Weighing Contract  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- In an era when pro athletes pursue the security of
a long-term contract, Colorado Avalanche forward Chris Drury
apparently prefers to take things one year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Drury, a restricted free agent who had 20 goals and 47 assists
last season, has been offered a multiyear contract, but the former
Calder Trophy winner could be absent when the Avalanche report to
training camp on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Drury's Boston-based agent, Mark Witkin, said his client would
like to sign a one-year deal for the 2000-01 season. Drury, who
made $640,000 last year, would then be eligible for arbitration
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have made offers which really channel him into a
long-term deal,'' Witkin said Tuesday. ''In effect, they're saying,
'You have to go longer term,' and it's really what he doesn't want
to do. He wants the incentive of working hard every year and get a
contract based on what he contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   At only 24, Drury's best days are likely still ahead of him,
which would explain Colorado's desire to sign him to a long deal.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix, who does not discuss
ongoing contract negotiations, has been busy this summer.
</P>
<P>
   After re-signing key free agents Ray Bourque, Adam Deadmarsh,
Joe Sakic and Stephane Yelle, he has been trying to work out deals
with Drury and forward Milan Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk, who had 36 goals and 36 assists last year, also would
prefer a one-year deal. Attempts to reach his agent Tuesday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche on Tuesday signed left wing Brad Larsen, 23, of
the American Hockey League Hershey Bears, and defenseman Stewart
Malgunas, 30, who played four games with Calgary last year. Terms
were not announced.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Calls U.S. a Rogue State  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) --North Korea on Tuesday accused the United
States of instigating an airport search of North Korean diplomats,
including the country's No. 2 leader, who angrily called off
participation in the U.N. Millennium summit and a New York meeting
with the president of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The incident Monday at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany, will
hurt U.S.-North Korean ties as well as slow reconciliation between
the two Koreas, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations,
Li Hyong Chol, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that
''the United States will come to know what a dear price it will
have to pay for having hurt our people's dignity,'' but did not
specify whether or how it would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of Kim Yong Nam, leader of the communist country's
parliament, to cancel his trip to New York was one of the first
setbacks to recent efforts by North and South Korea to do away with
decades of antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no indication the Pyongyang government planned to
halt its overall reconciliation policy. Also, Seoul officials view
plans for North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to visit South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung in Seoul as far more important than the
aborted New York meeting.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for that visit, which would be a followup
to a June summit between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Kim said the airport incident was regrettable, but
should not hurt ''the trend of a thaw between the North and
South,'' according to his chief spokesman, Park-Jun-young.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is disappointed that the
North-South meeting is not taking place, but hopes there will be
continued progress toward normalization between the two countries,
said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   The airport dispute was reminiscent of other accusations by
North Korea that were apparently aimed at disrupting the close ties
between Seoul and its longtime ally, Washington, which keeps 37,000
troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the search, including a
pat-down of the diplomats and a luggage check, was partially a
result of misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a combination of unfamiliarity with our procedures and
I think some unfamiliarity on the part there (in Frankfurt) with
the delegation coming through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the United States had looked forward to North
Korean participation in the U.N. summit. ''We regret that they got
on a plane and headed back home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said travelers from countries on a
U.S. terrorism watchlist have to undergo more stringent security
procedures, but that diplomats accredited to the United Nations and
Washington are exempt. The North Korean delegation, which did not
fall into either category, had not informed the United States that
it would be traveling on American Airlines, said a State Department
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Li, the North Korean ambassador, said the 15 North Korean
delegates were waiting to board an American Airlines flight to New
York when they were approached by U.S. aviation security officials.
The delegates were told they could not board unless they agreed to
what Li termed ''hooligan acts:'' answering questions, having their
luggage checked and undergoing a body search.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the delegates were strip searched, but Lockhart and
American Airlines denied that.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador said the aviation officials told the delegation
they were acting upon instructions ''they received from home.''
</P>
<P>
   When the delegation members protested and asked why they were
being searched, the security officials said that ''North Korea is
listed with other countries as a rogue state,'' the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the U.N. summit, the North Korean leader was to have met
Kim Dae-jung to discuss further steps toward possible
reunification. The North Korean ambassador said he believed the
airport incident was intended to ''create obstacles'' in the
reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines apologized for the search. No U.S. government
agency participated in the search, American Airlines spokesman John
Hotard said from Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the North Korean ambassador blamed the U.S. government
for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident is a fabricated scenario of the U.S.
administration,'' Li said. ''It is an insidious and brazen-faced
method of the United States. All these facts clearly show that the
United States is a rogue state.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries branded by the U.S. State
Department as a sponsor of terrorism. Under U.S. law, that bars all
but humanitarian aid to the North's government and rules out bank
loans from international financial organizations, which are heavily
influenced by Washington.	   The two nations recently held talks on possibly
removing the
communist country from the list. The U.S. State Department called
the meeting ''productive'' but did not disclose details.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the list because of its alleged involvement
in the bombing of a South Korean airliner in the skies near
Myanmar, also known as Burma, in 1987. All 115 people aboard the
Korean Air plane died.
</P>
<P>
   Ties between South and North Korea have improved dramatically in
recent months. Both sides stopped border propaganda broadcasts,
agreed to reconnect a cross-border railway and hold more reunions
of separate family members.

<HEADLINE> Scranton-Hoboken rail service funding split still undecided  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EASTON, Pa. (AP) - Pennsylvania and New Jersey transportation
officials have not decided how to divide up the costs of passenger
rail service between Scranton, Pa., and Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding expected to come in October would pay 80 percent
of preliminary engineering costs. In 1998, $160 million in federal
money was authorized toward the estimated $180 million cost.
</P>
<P>
   The two states must still negotiate an agreement, subject to
federal approval, to split the responsibility for capital and
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The rail would carry passengers from Scranton and three stations
in Monroe County, across the Delaware River into Warren, Sussex and
Morris counties in New Jersey. Passengers could then take New
Jersey Transit trains that are already in service to Hoboken, where
there are connections into New York City.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Transit is expected to operate the service, expected
to begin by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding of up to $5.3 million is to be available in
October for preliminary engineering work, subject to a 20 percent
match by Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Reilly, executive director of the Morris County, N.J.,
Department of Transportation, noted the total amount probably would
be paid over a two-year period and that preliminary engineering is
expected to begin in March or April of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hart, executive director of the Lackawanna County Railroad
Authority, said it remains to be decided who will run the trains in
Pennsylvania and what fiscal obligations Lackawanna and Monroe
counties will have.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Pichardo Leaves Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox reliever Hipolito Pichardo left
Tuesday night's game against the Oakland Athletics with an apparent
elbow problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo relieved Pete Schourek with one out in the seventh
inning with runners on first and third and Boston leading 8-1. He
allowed a double to Mike Stanley, then Adam Piatt grounded into a
fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo then walked Ben Grieve and Miguel Tejada before Red Sox
first baseman Jose Offerman came to the mound and pointed to the
right-hander's elbow and home plate umpire Randy Marsh. Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams came to the mound with trainer Jim Rowe, and
then Rich Garces came in to relieve Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo, who threw only three strikes in 12 pitches, has been
one of Boston's most reliable middle relievers this season. He was
5-3 with one save and a 3.15 ERA in 33 appearances coming into the
game.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nominations Made in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas led nine candidates in very early
returns as he sought a second term Tuesday after months of tumult
over the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 percent of precincts reporting, Penelas had 59 percent of
the vote. His nearest competitor had 19 percent. He must win a
majority to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, in primaries in Florida and Nevada, candidates for
open Senate and House seats faced scant opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Democrat Bill Nelson and GOP Rep. Bill McCollum
easily won their parties' nominations for an open Senate seat,
setting up a competitive race in the fall with national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas outraised his nearest competitor, county Commissioner
Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, by more than 4-to-1. Diaz de la
Portilla said Penelas ''split the community'' when he vowed that
local police would not help federal authorities return Elian to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas later said police would help keep the peace, and has
emphasized ''healing the wounds'' left by the boy's case. The Elian
furor has not been a prominent part of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With half of Florida's precincts reporting, Nelson, the state
insurance commissioner, got 344,214 votes, or 77 percent, to win
the nomination to seek the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Connie Mack.
McCollum had 356,106 votes, or 82 percent, for his party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who have made inroads in the South in recent
years, hope to take the Senate seat given up by Mack, who is
retiring after two terms.
</P>
<P>
   The seat left vacant by McCollum, a 10-term GOP member of
Congress who is hoping to succeed Mack, becomes part of the
national battle for control of the House, as does a Republican seat
left open by retiring four-term Rep. Tillie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Bill Sublette and first-time candidate Ric Keller
split the GOP vote and went to a runoff for the nomination for
McCollum's seat near Orlando. The winner will face Democrat Linda
Chapin in November.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for Fowler's seat near Jacksonville, former Florida
Senate President Ander Crenshaw was leading in early returns in the
GOP primary. Retired motel owner-manager Tom Sullivan was leading
lawyer Kevin Schaun Sanders for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan's decision to retire
after two terms set off a scramble. John Ensign, a veterinarian and
former two-term GOP congressman, faced two little-known candidates
in his bid for the Republican nomination. Ensign lost his 1998 bid
to unseat the state's senior senator, Democrat Harry Reid, by 428
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas lawyer Ed Bernstein has no primary opposition for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Florida, allegations of racism rocked a contest for
sheriff. Rodney Moore, the black police chief of Quincy, is
challenging Sheriff W.A. Woodham, a white man in office for 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was arrested last month and charged with ticket-fixing and
other corruption. He, along with many of the state's top black
leaders, complained of racism. Gadsden County, west of Tallahassee
in the Panhandle, is the only Florida county with a majority black
population, about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With six of 16 precincts reporting, Woodham had 1,862 voters, or
57 percent, compared with Moore's 1,389 votes, or 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Democratic primary will face only nominal
opposition in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Scooter Injuries Are Up This Summer  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They are the fad of the moment -- but those
sleek, fold-up foot scooters have sent nearly 9,500 Americans,
mostly children, to emergency rooms with injuries this year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of scooter-related injuries has surged this summer,
with more than 4,000 in August alone compared with fewer than 500
in May, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
Children younger than 15 account for nearly nine out of 10
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are certainly not your grandmother's scooters from the
'50s,'' Ann Brown, the safety commission's chairwoman, said in an
interview. ''Many kids are ending up in hospital emergency rooms
instead of classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission says it had received reports of 9,411
scooter injuries this year as of Aug. 27. The majority of injuries
were cuts, bruises and sprains, but a third were broken bones or
dislocations, mostly in the arms and hands. Hospitals treated and
released nearly all of those injured. There have been no deaths
related to the new scooters.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jill Posner, 33, who practices emergency pediatric medicine
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said she saw her first
scooter-related injury in June, but more have been coming in over
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't think about the fact that these scooters can be
as dangerous as bikes and skateboards,'' Posner said, adding that
she's seen children with serious head injuries who were struck by
cars while riding scooters.
</P>
<P>
   The scooters, first widely sold in the United States late last
year, are souped-up versions of the kick-powered scooters made
popular in the 1950s. Their popularity soared this summer and the
scooter industry expects to sell 2 million to 5 million new
scooters this year, the commission said. That's at least a $200
million business, up from virtually zero sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said nearly two-thirds of the injuries could have been
prevented or lessened if the riders had been wearing protective
equipment. The safety commission recommends scooter riders wear the
same safety gear suggested for inline skaters: a helmet, wrist
guards and knee and elbow pads. Such equipment can cost less than
$35.
</P>
<P>
   But some people doubt the message will sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wears safety gear. I have never seen anyone wear safety
gear,'' said Kristen Tempel, a George Washington University student
who owned an older-style scooter when she was younger.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 people using inline skates were injured last year,
up from about 10,000 in 1992 when they first became popular, said
the safety commission, which regularly collects information on
injuries requiring treatment in hospital emergency rooms. About
60,000 people suffered injuries using skateboards in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to head off some of the kind of injuries that
happen with inline skates and let people know about the safety gear
early on,'' Brown said. She added that children younger than 8
years old should not use the scooters without close supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The foot-propelled scooters often have small wheels like those
on inline skates and lightweight metal frames that weigh less than
10 pounds and fold for portability. They usually cost $80 to $120
and can be purchased at sporting goods and toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers have opted for larger scooters with rubber
wheels, like the Go-Ped made by Patmont Motor Werks of Livermore,
Ca., said spokesman Tim Patmont.
</P>
<P>
   Patmont said his company hasn't received any reports of people
injured using their foot-powered scooters. He blamed the accidents
on smaller models with inline skate wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you hit a little pebble, that's all it takes for you to go
down,'' Patmont said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image, a San Francisco-based scooter manufacturer,
said in a statement it supported the safety commission's safety
guidelines. ''Our print and television advertising encourages the
use of safety gear while riding our scooter products,'' the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids aren't the only one using the scooters -- college students
and commuters in cities from New York to San Francisco have also
turned to the kick-powered transportation trend.
</P>
<P>
   The scooter revival has also spread around the world from Hong
Kong to Switzerland. They have become extremely popular in Israel,
where a ban was imposed on children taking scooters to school in
Jerusalem after one child was seriously injured.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Wing Works for Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Lawyers for a faction of the Reform
Party loyal to Pat Buchanan asked a state court Tuesday to declare
him the party's true presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Their rivals in the fractured party planned their own lawsuit
Wednesday seeking a legal judgment backing up their contention that
John Hagelin is the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   At stake: $12.6 million in federal subsidies for the winning
side.
</P>
<P>
   The action came six days after a federal judge in Lynchburg,
Va., refused to referee the party's bitter split, saying he lacked
the jurisdiction to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Cooter, an attorney for the Buchanan contingent, filed the
claim in Superior Court in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That Los Angeles suburb was the site of the party's national
convention last month, when it split in two and produced dual
nominees. Cooter also filed the unsuccessful action in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Because Long Beach hosted the national convention, the state
court there should have jurisdiction over the party's actions
nationwide, Cooter said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Verney, a leader of the Hagelin faction, said his lawsuit
Wednesday would be based on the same premise.
</P>
<P>
   Cooter said he had not discussed the action Tuesday with
Buchanan or his campaign. He acted at the behest of Gerald Moan,
the chairman of the Reform Party wing aligned with Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps have waged a battle to get their respective
nominees listed on ballots in the 50 states. Meanwhile, election
officials in Wisconsin are to announce Wednesday whether, and how,
Buchanan and Hagelin will be listed on the general election ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits come as both sides await a Federal Election
Commission ruling on the matter. That is likely to be appealed to a
federal court, Verney said.

<HEADLINE> Husband charged with attempted murder of wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STONY POINT, N.Y. (AP) - Police have charged a Queens man with
trying to kill his wife by steering the jeep she was in off the
edge of a 65-foot cliff in Harriman State Park last week.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, 47-year-old Cavim Suljovic of Fresh
Meadows was driving along Seven Lakes Drive North with his
39-year-old wife Aferdita and their two sons Thursday when he
stopped and ordered his children out of the car. He then drove his
1990 Jeep Cherokee to the edge of a steep embankment, positioning
the vehicle so his wife could not escape before directing it toward
the ledge and jumping out himself.
</P>
<P>
   Aferdita Suljovic suffered numerous cuts and bruises as well as
first-, second- and third-degree burns when the vehicle flipped
over the ledge and caught on fire. It was unknown whether she was
wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   She was airlifted to Westchester Medical Center, where she was
listed in critical but stable condition. A hospital spokesman
Tuesday night withheld further information at the patient's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Cavim Suljovic was arrested when he came to the hospital Sunday.
He is being held at Rockland County Jail on $500,000 bail. He is
due to answer an attempted murder charge in Orangetown Court
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Cone Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Yankees pitcher David Cone dislocated
his left -- non-throwing -- shoulder Tuesday night fielding a
popped-up bunt in the third inning of New York's game at the Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and a runner on second, Cone dived to his right to
make the catch on Rey Sanchez's bunt. He landed hard on his left
arm and rolled on the grass in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Cone's injury was not immediately known. The
right-hander was replaced by Dwight Gooden, who retired Mike
Sweeney on an inning-ending flyout.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, 37, is 4-11 with a 6.16 ERA. In 2 2-3 innings Tuesday, he
gave up one run, one hit and three walks with one strikeout. He has
won three of his last four decisions.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Williams Likely Out 4-6 Games  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Bernie
Williams will likely miss 4-6 games because of recurring soreness
in his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it doesn't feel as bad as it did the last time, which
is encouraging,'' manager Joe Torre said Tuesday before the second
game of a four-game series with the Kansas City Royals.
''Hopefully, maybe it was just something that was left over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not planning on him for the rest of this trip, let's put
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has 111 RBIs and needs 19 to tie the single-season
record for a switch-hitter, missed seven games from Aug. 19-25 with
strained muscles in his right rib cage, an injury sustained in
batting practice Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Williams hurt himself again swinging at a forkball
from Kansas City starter Mac Suzuki in the first inning of the
Yankees' 4-3 win. After striking out swinging to end the inning,
Williams played the bottom of the first in the outfield before
being replaced by Clay Bellinger.
</P>
<P>
   Williams dressed for batting practice Tuesday but did not take
any swings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll just be out there stretching, maybe doing some
shagging,'' he said. ''No swinging -- it's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Before getting hurt for the first time, Williams had started the
Yankees' first 118 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a durable player,'' Torre said. ''He's one of those guys
you just write in the lineup -- you don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone might be joining the injured list, too. The
right-hander dislocated his left shoulder fielding a popped-up bunt
in the third inning Tuesday night and was taken to the hospital for
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis was brighter for the return of second baseman
Chuck Knoblauch and reliever Ramiro Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who has not played since returning from the disabled
list on Friday, said he hopes to return soon after being sidelined
since Aug. 3 with tendinitis in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling pretty good, which is encouraging,'' said
Knoblauch, whose stint on the DL was the first in his 10-year
career. ''I don't know that it will ever feel great the rest of the
year. I just have to deal with the fact that it's not feeling any
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch could start in another day or two, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who has been plagued by tendinitis in his right
shoulder and has not pitched since July 29, threw more than 50
pitches in a simulated-game Monday. He could get some bullpen work
against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sore in all the appropriate places, and that's good,''
Torre said. ''I don't know about tomorrow, maybe Thursday. We'd
definitely like to have him get a game under his belt here.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Paul O'Neill continues to improve after missing
six games in late August with a right hip pointer. O'Neill made a
long run to grab Jermaine Dye's foul ball in the eighth inning of
Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a good play to get to that ball,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees also called up LHP Randy Kiesler and INF
Alfonso Soriano from Triple-A Columbus. To make room for Kiesler on
the 40-man roster, the Yankees placed RHP Darrell Einertson on the
60-day DL.

<HEADLINE> China Cuts 40 from Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- China is cutting 40 athletes and
officials from its team for the Sydney Olympics, including seven
rowers who failed blood tests for the banned performance-enhancing
drug EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased,'' International Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch said Wednesday of the doping withdrawals.
''I'm very happy. This is very good news. It shows the new system
for detecting doping substances will work very well. ... The
objective is to have clean games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers said they were notified by the Chinese Olympic
Committee of the withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch received a letter from
the Chinese rowing association confirming that seven rowers were
being withdrawn from the Olympic team after they tested positive
for EPO, or erthyropoietin, during doping controls in China.
</P>
<P>
   Schamasch said blood tests showed the athletes' EPO levels were
above the allowable limit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the IOC executive board approved the introduction of
a combined blood and urine test for EPO at the Sydney Games. EPO,
the drug of choice among endurance athletes, stimulates the
production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, and experts say it
can improve performance by up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no test had been able to detect the use of synthetic
EPO.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, an athlete will be considered guilty of EPO use only
if both the blood and urine tests are positive. Schamasch said the
Chinese rowers were dropped based only on blood testing.
</P>
<P>
   China, tarnished by a series of doping scandals in swimming and
other sports, has been carrying out sweeping drug tests to prevent
the embarrassment of positive results during the Sydney Games. With
Beijing bidding for the 2008 Olympics, China is particularly eager
to be seen as cracking down.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Jianyong, secretary general of the Chinese Rowing
Association, said the rowers had withdrawn to protect their health
and uphold the fairness of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trusting the Chinese,'' Samaranch said. ''They are
fighting against doping. This is an example for many other
countries. This is good news for the image of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the withdrawals of the 33 other Chinese team
members was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be surprised if all 40 were (for drugs),'' IOC vice
president Dick Pound said. ''My guess is you'll find they were in
some elimination tournament and didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, a former U.S. Olympic rower
and a vice president of the international rowing federation, said
the reduction in the Chinese team sent the right message to
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a warning to all athletes who wish to come to the
games with drugs in their system -- stay at home,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Indians 7, Devil Rays 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Lofton hit a tiebreaking two-run single
during four-run sixth inning as the Cleveland Indians rallied from
a four-run deficit Tuesday night to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which leads the AL wild-card race, improved to 21-10
since Aug. 2 and moved a season-high 13 games over .500 at 74-61.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere (11-9) overcame early inconsistency to improve to 5-2
since the Indians acquired him from Milwaukee on July 28. He
allowed four runs and four hits in six innings, struck out seven
and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay pitched two scoreless innings and Bob Wickman
worked the ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances with the Indians,
his 26th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's two-run, single off reliever Tony Fiore (1-1) gave
Cleveland a 6-4 lead. Sandy Alomar scored from third later in the
inning on Fiore's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which found out before the game that Gerald Williams
and four others were being suspended for last week's brawls against
Boston, went ahead in the first on Greg Vaughn's three-run homer.
Vinny Castilla hit an RBI double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar began Cleveland's comeback with a fourth-inning
single off Paul Wilson, the Indians' first hit. David Segui's RBI
single later in the inning made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got another run in the fifth on a two-base throwing
error by shortstop Felix Martinez, and Jim Thome homered in the
sixth, his 33rd of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Manny Ramirez has hit in a career-high 20 consecutive
games, the fifth-longest streak in the AL this year. ... Castilla
got hits in his first two at-bats in more than a month. He had been
sidelined since July 30 with an inflamed back. ... Indians C Sandy
Alomar got his first stolen base since June 23, 1996. ... Thome
drew his 100th walk in the fourth inning -- the fourth time he has
walked 100 times or more times in a season.

   DETROIT (AP) -- Tony Clark hit his first homer since June 28 and
Brian Moehler won his sixth straight decision as the Detroit Tigers
beat Anaheim 7-5, the Angels' sixth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Billy McMillon hit a two-run double for the Tigers, who have won
five of six to move a season-best three games over .500. Detroit,
which started the season 9-23, remained five games behind AL wild
card leader Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio had a two-run triple for the Angels, whose losing
streak is their worst of the season. Anaheim began the night six
games behind Seattle in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, on the disabled list from July 15 to Sept. 1 with back
problems, hit a two-run homer in the second inning. He also walked
and scored in a five-run third that put the Tigers up 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler (12-7) gave up four runs, eight hits and no walks in six
innings. He left after the Angels scored three in the sixth to cut
Detroit's lead to 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy's RBI single off Matt Anderson made it 7-5 in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones got the final three outs for his AL-leading 38th save
in 41 chances.
</P>
<P>

league start and allowed seven runs on seven hits. He easily
retired three batters in the first, but eight of the next 11
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stocker legged out a first-inning triple for Anaheim after
center fielder Juan Encarnacion missed a try for a diving catch.
Stocker scored on Tim Salmon's two-out infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer led off the second with a double off the left-field
wall before Clark hit his 13th home run, a high drive into the
Tigers' bullpen in right.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit batted around and knocked out Wise in a five-run third.
McMillon hit a two-run double, Palmer an RBI single and Encarnacion
and Deivi Cruz had sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio tripled after singles from Garret Anderson and Troy
Glaus and scored on Kennedy's groundout as the Angels made it 7-4
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mo Vaughn went 0-for-5 with four strikeouts. ... Jones'
save tied John Hiller's club record set in 1973. ... OF Juan
Gonzalez, ailing from flulike symptoms, was scratched from the
Tigers lineup and is day to day. ... LHP Juan Alvarez and RHP Ben
Weber were both recalled from the minors and pitched relief for

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Manny Alexander hit his first career grand slam
during a seven-run first inning, backing Pete Schourek in his
comeback from a shoulder injury and leading the Boston Red Sox to a
10-3 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek (3-9) had not won in 12 starts before going on the
disabled list July 21 with a frayed left rotator cuff. He allowed
three runs on just two hits and a walk in 5 1-3 innings while
striking out six to win for the first time since May 15 against
Toronto. He combined with four other pitchers on a six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Boston remained two games back in the AL wild card race behind
Cleveland, which beat Tampa Bay 7-4 Tuesday. Oakland dropped to
three games behind the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier (12-11) made his shortest start of the year,
lasting just 2 2-3 innings and allowing eight runs, nine hits and
three walks. He gave up two walks and five hits -- including
Alexander's homer -- with two outs in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon singled to lead off the first and Jose Offerman
walked before Carl Everett grounded into a double play. Nomar
Garciaparra singled to score Nixon, then Troy O'Leary walked and
Dante Bichette singled before Scott Hatteberg blooped a broken-bat
single over the shortstop to score two more.
</P>
<P>
   After Donnie Sadler walked to load the bases, Alexander homered
into the screen above the Green Monster down the line to make it
7-0. Nixon singled again before Offerman, the 11th batter of the
inning, flied out to center for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 8-0 in the third when Sadler doubled and scored
on Nixon's double.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek held Oakland hitless through 3 1-3 innings before Jason
Giambi hit his 32nd homer, a solo shot, in the fourth. The A's
scored two in the fourth on an RBI double by Mike Stanley and a
bases-loaded walk drawn by Miguel Tejada off Hipolito Pichardo.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo then left the game with an apparent elbow problem.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Red Sox recalled Morgan Burkhart from Triple-A
Pawtucket and sent Dan Smith outright to Triple-A. Burkhart hit
.204 at Pawtucket since he was last optioned on Aug. 5. Smith was
designated for assignment last week to make room on the 40-man
roster for Bichette. ... Garciaparra was just 3-for-17 on the
homestand before singling in his first at-bat. ... Sadler started
at second base for the second consecutive game in place of Mike
Lansing, who has four hits in his last 39 at-bats. ... Appier was
2-1 with a 1.98 ERA in his previous four starts. ... Over their
previous eight games, A's starters were 4-2 with a 2.42 ERA. ...
Umpire Ron Kulpa returned to Boston for the first time since he got
into an argument with Everett that led to Everett's 10-game
suspension. ... Oakland pitchers walked nine.

   PARIS (AP) -- French trucking leaders said early Wednesday that
they were satisfied with a government offer to reduce their
gasoline bills, but planned to consult with union members before
deciding whether to end a blockade of the nation's oil refineries
and fuel depots.
</P>
<P>
   The three trucking unions involved did not plan to announce a
decision on ending the days-long protest, which has caused many gas
stations to run dry, until after a new meeting with Transport
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot later Wednesday, said Christian Rose,
the national secretary of the UNOSTRA union.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 hours of talks, the minister offered the truckers a 5
cent reimbursement per liter of fuel for this year, and a 3.5 cent
refund per liter on gasoline taxes next year, among other measures,
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The offers ''are real advances that must be examined from a
distance, taking account of the evolution of negotiations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of France's gas stations ran dry, and local governments
began rationing gasoline Tuesday as French truckers expanded a
blockade on oil refineries and fuel depots in demands for lower
taxes. Motorists faced long lines at the pump as nationwide
protests against soaring fuel prices entered a second day.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers, joined by farmers, ambulance drivers and taxi drivers,
blockaded more than 85 oil refineries and fuel depots around the
country on Tuesday. It was still unclear whether other professions
would continue striking if truckers called off their movement.
</P>
<P>
   Television news stations showed gas pumps around the country
covered with ''out of order'' signs. On Tuesday, up to 80 percent
of TotalFinaElf's 5,500 gas stations around France had run out of
gas or faced dwindling stocks, said Elisabeth de Beaumont, a
spokeswoman for the French oil and gas group.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling supplies forced officials in many regions to reserve
gas stations for the use of emergency and police vehicles. Some
drivers in search of gas crossed into neighboring countries to fill
their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mediterranean city of Nice, truckers blocked vehicles
from entering the international airport on Tuesday. Some travelers
were forced to walk with luggage from outside the airport's
entrance, said an airport spokesman, Philippe Bellissent.
</P>
<P>
   Bellissent said that planes flying into Nice from Paris and
other European points had been advised to travel with twice the
normal fuel load. Demonstrators on Monday had tried to block
aircraft from refueling.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, about 15 barges joined the protest to partially block
the Seine, and boat operators said they planned to completely stop
river traffic there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by truckers, farmers and ambulance drivers as well
as fork-lift operators and movers began early Monday, and took its
inspiration from a strike last week by fishermen, who blocked ports
for several days. The fishermen's strike ended when the Agriculture
Ministry agreed to compensate them for rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   In France, which has the second highest fuel prices in the
European Union after Britain, unleaded gasoline costs $3.70 per
gallon, of which about 75 percent is tax. Diesel fuel in France
costs $2.84 per gallon, compared to a current average of $1.58 per
gallon in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves On China Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China trade was the first order of business
Tuesday as the Senate returned from its summer recess with leaders
of both parties determined to approve the normalization of trade
relations before lawmakers close shop to campaign before the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the bill this year is ''profoundly important for the
country,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading advocate of
widening trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters believe they have a solid majority in the
Senate, they face two real dangers -- time limitations as Congress
rushes to finish its work for the year and the determination of
some senators to link normalized trade to China's weapons
proliferation and human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the China trade bill last May on a 237-197
vote, and the concern is that any Senate amendments to that bill
would effectively kill it for the year because there wouldn't be
time for the two chambers to work out differences between the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bluntly, a vote to amend is a vote to kill this bill and, with
it, any chance that U.S. workers, farmers and businesses will
benefit from China's accession to the World Trade Organization,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said as the Senate began debate on
the measure. Roth is chairman of the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   China's trade status has been subject to annual review under a
1974 act governing trade with communist states. The legislation to
make normal trade relations permanent comes after China last year,
as part of its effort to join the WTO, reached an agreement with
U.S. negotiators on lowering its tariffs and removing trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he hoped to
reach a final vote on the trade bill by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fight is likely to be over an expected amendment by
Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that
would urge the president to apply sanctions against China and
others contributing to weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has rewritten his measure to give the president more
latitude in applying sanctions, but both the administration and
American business groups still oppose it, saying China would merely
turn to European and Japanese sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus, whose state stands to benefit from increased farm
product exports to China, said he expected the Thompson measure to
be defeated. But Thompson said it would be a ''tough vote'' in an
election year where lawmakers must explain how they are dealing
with China's increased proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers don't want to seem ''to be so caught up in this PNTR
(permanent normal trade relations) frenzy that we do nothing about
this threat,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lott has said he wants to see an amendment-free bill,
he said Tuesday: ''I feel a need to vote for Senator Thompson's
issue because I think he's right on the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill has been the focus of a fierce lobbying struggle
between labor and human rights groups, which oppose it, and
business groups that consider it the most important legislation
Congress will take up this year. They estimate that U.S.
manufactured goods exports would more than triple with China's
accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Vargo of the National Association of Manufacturers said
his organization is sending letters to 1,000 of its members this
week ''urging them not to be complacent'' and to oppose the
Thompson measure ''in any form. ... We do not want to see it go
back to the House. It's too important.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Thompson, the unlikely team of conservative Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and liberal Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., are
working together on a package of human rights amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Helms contended that China has become more of a threat to the
world, particularly Taiwan, under normal trade, and that permanent
trade status ''is perhaps the most ill-advised piece of legislation
to come to the Senate in my 28 years as a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone has readied at least five amendments that would link
normal trade to China's respecting religious freedom, improving
human rights, ending prison-made exports and protecting worker
rights in both the United States and China.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> French Truck Leaders Like Offer  </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Montana Land Reopening to Public  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Millions of acres that had been closed in
Montana because of wildfires were reopened to hikers and other
outdoors enthusiasts Tuesday, but the fire threat in the West was
still far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five large fires still burned on 645,079 acres in Montana
alone Tuesday, but rain and falling temperatures across the
Northern Rockies had reduced the risk of those fires spreading,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 million acres of public, state and private land had
been closed in Montana, about one-fifth of the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Bisom, it meant that what normally would have been a
long weekend outdoor outing had been reduced to a lunchtime
mountain-biking break in the Helena National Forest on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just nice to have the trails open so you can go out
during your lunch hour and take a break when it's a nice, sunny
day,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch operator Jack Rich had closed his business Aug. 11 and
canceled a string of reservations by about 50 guests who would have
spent $1,500 each. ''With this announcement to reopen, we were on
the line waiting, like the Oklahoma land rush, to get going,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 74,755 fires have burned nearly 6.6 million acres
across the nation, an area nearly the size of Massachusetts. On
Tuesday, 81 fires were burning on 1.5 million acres in Arkansas,
California, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas,
Montana and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The weather has brought its own problems for firefighters. In
Idaho, many firefighters are coming down with ''camp crud,'' said
E. Lynn Burkett with the National Interagency Fire Center. Some
crews are experiencing flu-like symptoms caused by moisture, cold,
smoke and hard working conditions, Burkett said. Medical units are
stationed at larger fires.
</P>
<P>
   Mudslides also have become a problem, said Pat Thrasher,
information officer for an 181,700-acre complex of fires in western
Montana's Bitterroot Valley. Fires burned away so much of the
forest floor's protective covering that erosion is a problem and
mudslides have sent forest debris onto roadways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only part of the hard-hit Bitterroot National Forest reopened
Tuesday, but officials said additional land may reopen on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, a fire that has burned 200,000 acres in the
Salmon-Challis National Forest is expected to be contained by
month's end, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a fire northeast of Houston forced the evacuation of
92 homes, while another north of Dallas burned nine houses and
three barns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, some Republican senators said
Tuesday they would examine whether the Clinton administration was
adequately prepared for the wildfires and whether its policies put
more public land at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said he would hold hearings on the
administration's role in the fires in a subcommittee of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department Undersecretary Jim Lyons criticized the
senators' statments. ''Politicizing the situation and trying to
turn it into a debate over administration policies is not conducive
to our working together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture and Interior departments are expected to ask
President Clinton to request roughly $1.2 billion for repairs and
fire prevention.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Under Court Restraining Order  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday extended a temporary
restraining order forbidding the state from requiring drug testing
for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The state last October began requiring welfare applicants in a
handful of Michigan communities to provide urine samples for drug
screening before they could be considered for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the state's pilot program, the drug test
results wouldn't affect access to food stamps and police wouldn't
be notified, but applicants who tested positive for drugs would be
sent to treatment and could gradually lose benefits if they failed
to go.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts granted the original
restraining order in November after a group of welfare recipients
and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan argued that the
testing is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has said the requirement is an ''unreasonable search''
in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this instance, there is no indication of a concrete danger
to public safety which demands departure from the Fourth
Amendment's main rule and normal requirement of individualized
suspicion,'' Roberts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Independence Agency, which administers welfare in
Michigan, will review the decision and decide how to proceed by the
end of the week, spokeswoman Karen Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug testing program does not apply to Medicaid, disability,
emergency or other state assistance programs.

<HEADLINE> Ohio prosecutor says Swango to plead guilty in New York deaths  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Former physician Michael Swango is
expected to plead guilty to federal charges Wednesday in New York
that he killed three patients at a Long Island veterans' hospital,
Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment charged Swango in July with three counts of
murder, one count of assault, three counts of making false
statements and two counts of scheming to defraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's admitting to what he's charged with and that's it,''
O'Brien said. Swango, dubbed ''Dr. Death'' by tabloids, had pleaded
innocent to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for Swango's lawyer, Randi Chavis, on Tuesday were
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New York said Swango was expected in U.S
District Court on Wednesday. A court order prohibits them from
commenting further.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty plea to the three counts of murder would carry a
federal sentence of life in prison without parole, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleged Swango was responsible for Cynthia
Ann McGee's death on Jan. 14, 1984, and the poisoning of another
victim, Rena Cooper, at the Ohio State University hospital February
7, 1984. Cooper survived but was paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's admission to those allegations would give the state
enough evidence to charge him with aggravated murder in the
poisoning of McGee, a 19-year-old gymnast, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will file that charge against Swango after he admits
to the federal charges, and Swango could answer to that charge in
Franklin County Common Pleas Court within the next two weeks,
O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will not pursue charges in Cooper's case because too
much time has passed under Ohio law.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the kind of thing he has done before that followed
him wherever he went,'' O'Brien said. ''We had suspicions about all
of the deaths. What we were missing was a level of evidence. We
could not bring charges against him in the McGee case without an
admission from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claimed the only evidence previously available in
McGee's case was circumstantial. A nurse had told investigators
that Swango took a syringe into McGee's hospital room about an hour
before McGee's death to draw blood, which he never did, O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy concluded McGee died of pneumonia at the hospital
where Swango was an intern. Investigators since have found in
McGee's medical records that her potassium level spiked shortly
before her death, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The McGee family's attorney, Brian Miller, did not return a call
seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Swango pleaded innocent to the three 1993 New York killings just
days before he was to be released from a federal prison in
Colorado. He was there on charges that he lied about his criminal
past to get his job at State University of New York at Stony Brook,
the medical school that ran the Veterans Affairs Hospital in
Northport where the deaths occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of injecting the three patients with toxins. In
two of the cases, he told hospital staff the patients' families had
issued ''do not resuscitate'' orders, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth patient also died of suspected poisoning, but
prosecutors said they had evidence only for an assault charge in
that case.
</P>
<P>
   Swango also is suspected of poisoning patients in Zimbabwe,
where he worked in 1994 after being fired by Stony Brook, and spent
30 months in prison in 1985 for poisoning six co-workers in Quincy,
Ill. No one died in that case.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling book ''Blind Eye: The Story of a Doctor who Got
Away with Murder'' suggests Swango might have killed as many as 35
patients on two continents.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said it is unlikely that the number of people Swango
actually killed will be known.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without an admission from him, we don't have solid evidence in
any other cases,'' O'Brien said. ''And any other admission is not
going to be forthcoming.''

<HEADLINE> 343 Pounds of Heroin Seized  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian police said Tuesday they made one of the
largest heroin seizures in the nation's history, confiscating 343
pounds of illicit drug, some packed into fake duck eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten ethnic Chinese in Toronto and Vancouver were arrested on
drug smuggling and possession charges after police and border
patrol agents intercepted two separate shipments, according to
police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been investigating Asian drug smugglers in separate
investigations since last year. While the shipments arrived
separately in Toronto and Vancouver, police believe they were
linked because of the amount of heroin involved and the proximity
of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipment was seized Thursday in Toronto and contained
125 pounds of heroin, along with 37 pounds of ecstasy pills, hidden
inside fake duck eggs, said Supt. Ben Soave of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   In Vancouver, 218 pounds of heroin was found Saturday in a
hidden bottom of a shipping container, Soave said.
</P>
<P>
   The heroin came from Southeast Asia's ''Golden Triangle'' and
was prepared in China, then sent on ships from Hong Kong, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is one of the world's major sources of opium,
from which heroin is made, and the Golden Triangle is the nickname
for the opium fields of Thailand, Burma and Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Soave said elite Asian organized crime groups sent the drugs,
but he refused to provide any further details.
</P>
<P>
   He described it as one of the largest heroin busts ever in
Canada, but he did not specify other major seizures. Prior to the
operation, 24 pounds of heroin had been seized in Canada so far
this year, police said. Fifty-one pounds were confiscated during
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two women and one man arrested in Toronto owned a food importing
company but also were high-level drug distributors, said Sgt. Earl
Horlick of the RCMP.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs sent to Toronto were packed in small plastic bags,
then put into 1,700 plastic eggs, according to Soave. The fake duck
eggs then were mixed up with real duck eggs and packed into boxes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials used drug-sniffing dogs to separate the real
and fake eggs, and will destroy the real ones, Soave said. Duck
eggs are a delicacy in Chinese cuisine, costing as much as 10 times
the price of chicken eggs in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Mets 3, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- This time, the Mets won one with a last-inning
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile's solo shot in the 10th inning gave New York a 3-2
victory Tuesday night over the Cincinnati Reds and snapped the
Mets' four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   After losing all three games over the weekend in St. Louis by
one run in the at-bat -- two of them on homers by Jim Edmonds -- the
Mets survived another close call and turned the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (7-4) went to a 1-2 count to Ken Griffey Jr. in the
bottom of the ninth and left the next pitch over the plate. Griffey
hit it a long way but stood at the plate and craned his head
sideways, watching it hook foul before landing in the second deck
in right field. Given the reprieve, Wendell struck him out.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's 18th homer off Scott Sullivan (2-6) cleared the wall in
left-center and got the Mets up for an enthusiastic high-five
celebration in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the 10th for his 37th save, one shy of
John Franco's team record from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed, who got the Mets' only win in their six previous
games, turned a 2-1 lead over to the bullpen in the seventh and
watched it quickly slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White, who gave up Edmonds' 11th-inning homer in St. Louis
on Sunday, relieved with a runner on second and gave up Chris
Stynes' two-out single that tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Pete Harnisch kept it close through seven innings by
avoiding big innings -- neither team scored more than one run at a
time, and neither starter wound up with a decision.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing remarkable about another low-scoring game for
the Mets, who have been in a deep slump.
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring singles by Benny Agbayani in the third and Zeile in
the fourth put the Mets up 2-0, but they failed to get another
runner to second until Zeile rounded the bases in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got their first run off Reed with a little hustle.
Chris Sexton stretched a hit to right-center into a double to open
the fifth and scored on Pokey Reese's two-out single, only the
Reds' fourth hit to that point.
</P>
<P>
   Reed pumped his fist and twice pounded it into his glove after
Sexton flew out to the warning track in right field with two
runners aboard in the sixth, preserving the 2-1 lead. He slowly
walked off the field with head down after White was summoned in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Stynes tied it with his soft liner to left.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, who took a liner off his leg in the third inning last
Thursday during a start in Atlanta, held the Mets to four hits in
seven innings and ran hard in all three plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets called up utility player Joe McEwing from
Triple-A. Norfolk coach Howie Freiling also joined the Mets. ...
Reed threw 100 pitches. ... Reds SS Barry Larkin will have
arthroscopic surgery to clean out his left knee Friday and most
likely will miss the rest of the season. ... C Eddie Taubensee,
also will have surgery Friday for a bulging disc in his back. ...
The Reds called up INF Brooks Kieschnick and RHP Keith Glauber from
Triple-A Louisville.

<HEADLINE> German Leader in Pentagon Accident  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Germany's defense minister suffered cuts on
his forehead and foot Tuesday when the car he was in was hit by a
deploying security barrier as his entourage entered the Pentagon
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Maj. Tim Blair said Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping and Germany's defense attache in Washington, Army Brig.
Gen. Peter Goebel, were treated for minor injuries at Arlington
Hospital in suburban Virginia and released a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Scharping received several stitches in his foot and his eyesight
was checked, Blair said. The spokesman said he had no more details
on Goebel.
</P>
<P>
   Scharping and his delegation were arriving at the Pentagon for a
meeting with Defense Secretary William Cohen. The car carrying
Scharping and Goebel was moving through a security guard station
when a steel barrier popped out of the ground, struck the car from
below and lifted it slightly into the air, according to Detlef
Puhl, a German Defense Ministry spokesman who was riding in a car
behind Scharping's.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon described Scharping as shaken
but stable shortly after the accident. Puhl said Scharping got out
of the car and lay down on the ground. Cohen, waiting on the
Pentagon steps to greet the minister, rushed to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Scharping was taken to Cohen's office, where he
telephoned his family in Germany and was attended by a U.S.
military physician. Scharping's glasses were broken. He and Goebel,
who suffered a bloodied nose, were then taken the hospital for
precautionary tests.
</P>
<P>
   An American security agent also suffered minor injuries,
including an abrasion on his chin, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the security barrier had been placed in ''parade
mode,'' meaning it was electronically locked into position so that
it would not pop up while the German delegation drove through the
guard area. He said it was not immediately clear why the barrier
popped up anyway, but Cohen ordered a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a serious, possibly tragic situation,'' Bacon said,
expressing Cohen's demand that such accidents not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has had occasional past problems with the security
barriers. In September 1998 a car carrying Japan's defense minister
was struck by the same pop-up barrier. The minister injured his
ankle and was taken to a hospital. President Clinton called the
minister to express his concern.
</P>
<P>
   Last January a car carrying members of a Chinese military
delegation was struck by a barrier, although Bacon said that
situation was different because the driver of the car was following
too closely behind a lead car. No one was injured in that case.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 2, Fusion 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Adolfo Valencia made a penalty kick
with eight minutes left as the New York-New Jersey MetroStars beat
the Miami Fusion 2-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory boosted the MetroStars' record to 17-11-3, for an
MLS-high 54 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion (11-15-5) moved closer to missing the playoffs.
Miami, with one game left, is tied for ninth place, two points out
of the eighth and final postseason spot.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia scored his 16th goal of the season, after Tab Ramos was
fouled by Miami defender Jay Hoops, made the score 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored a minute later. Diego Serna took Martin Machon's
pass and chipped the ball over MetroStars goalkeeper Paul Grafer.
</P>
<P>
   The game's first goal came 10 minutes in, when the MetroStars'
Mike Petke scored off a rebound from 6 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Grafer made six saves. He was called up from the A League's Long
Island Rough Riders to replace Tim Howard, the backup goalkeeper on
the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ammann, the MetroStars' top goalkeeper, is out for the
season after breaking three ribs in a game last month.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: 3B Vinny Castilla was in the lineup Tuesday for the
first time since July 30. He had been sidelined with lower back
inflammation. ... The Devil Rays scored three or fewer runs in 15
of 21 games between Aug. 14 and Sept. 4, going 2-13 in those games.
... Tampa Bay starters have gone five or more innings in 49 of
their last 55 starts. ... 1B Fred McGriff needs two homers to join
Hall of Famer Frank Robinson as the only players in history with
200 homers in both leagues. ... OF Greg Vaughn has hit .233 in 63
games since being on the DL with a strained right hamstring. He hit
.302 in 46 games before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said RHP Bartolo Colon will
make his scheduled start Thursday. Colon left his last start
Saturday with inflammation in his shoulder. ... Manuel also said he
might use RHP Charles Nagy out of the bullpen. ''I would prefer him
to start, but I don't know how long he can go,'' Manuel said of
Nagy, who had elbow surgery May 19 and is currently on
rehabilitation assignment with Triple A Buffalo. ... RHP David
Riske, activated from the 60-day DL Monday, was optioned to Buffalo
on Tuesday. Riske had surgery May 5 to remove a bulging disc in his
lower back. ... INF-OF Bill Selby has added a catcher's mitt to his
equipment. He is working out with bullpen coach Luis Issac. Selby
said he played the position a bit as a youngster, but not as a pro.
Mariners-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Seattle and Toronto brawled the last time they played.
Toronto players complained that star shortstop Alex Rodriguez
received preferential treatment because he wasn't ejected. After
the July 29 game, Blue Jays' reliever Pedro Borbon said he would
hit Rodriguez the next time he faced him. The brawl started after
Toronto reliever John Frascatore hit Rodriguez with a pitch. The
next day, Frascatore threw inside to Rodriguez, who jumped back.
Frascatore was ejected. Toronto's Carlos Delgado and Tony Batista
were hit by pitches earlier in the game, but no Seattle pitcher was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: INF Chris Woodward and OF Chad Mottola were brought up
from the minors, while infielder Kevin Witt was designated for the
assignment. Woodward, who was recalled from Syracuse of the
International League, hit .184 with three homers and 14 RBIs in 32
games earlier this season with the Jays. Mottola, whose contract
was purchased from Syracuse, was the International League's MVP
this season after hitting .309 with a league-leading 33 homers and
102 RBIs, second in the IL. ... The Blue Jays entered the game
having lost six of their previous seven games against Seattle.
Athletics-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox recalled Morgan Burkhart from Triple-A
Pawtucket and sent Dan Smith outright to Triple-A. Burkhart hit
.204 at Pawtucket since he was last optioned on Aug. 5. Smith was
designated for assignment last week to make room on the 40-man
roster for Dante Bichette. ... Pete Schourek is winless in his last
12 starts dating to May 15. ... Nomar Garciaparra was just 3-for-17
on the homestand before singling in his first at-bat. ... Donnie
Sadler started at second base for the second consecutive game in
place of Mike Lansing, who has four hits in his last 39 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Kevin Appier made his shortest start of the year
Tuesday, lasting just 2 2-3 innings and allowing eight runs, nine
hits and three walks. He gave up two walks and five hits --
including Manny Alexander's first career grand slam -- with two outs
in the first as Boston scored seven in the first inning. Appier was
2-1 with a 1.98 ERA in his previous four starts. ... Over their
previous eight games, A's starters were 4-2 with a 2.42 ERA.
Orioles-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: When outfielder Karim Garcia, a recent call-up from
Triple-A Rochester, makes his debut for the Orioles, he will become
the 49th player for Baltimore this season. That total is second
only to the 54 players used by the Orioles during the 1955 campaign
... The Orioles have at least one extra-base hit in 131 of their
138 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins have not won a series from Baltimore in the
past four years, compiling a 12-36 record versus the Orioles ...
Minnesota moved Wednesday's game with Baltimore to a 12:05 CDT
start. After the game they travel to Boston for one game on
Thursday to make up for an earlier rainout, then fly to Seattle for
a weekend series with the Mariners ... The Twins are 11-46 when
scoring three runs or less.
Rangers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: John Wetteland's 29th save Monday was the 325th of his
career, seventh most in major league history. He's 16 behind Rollie
Fingers on the career list. Wetteland's next save will give him his
eighth 30-save season and sixth straight. Lee Smith has the most
30-save seasons (10). ... By adding Darwin Cubillan, Kelly
Dransfeldt, Randy Knorr and Ruben Sierra from Triple-A Oklahoma
City, the Rangers expanded their roster to 31. Sierra began his
career with the Rangers in 1986 but hasn't been in the majors since
1998 when he was with the White Sox ... The Rangers' Rafael
Palmeiro and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa are the only major league players
with at least 30 homers and 100 RBIs in each of the last six
seasons. Sosa was initially signed by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Kip Wells, one of four players brought up by the White
Sox on Tuesday, is in his third stint this season with the big
league team. Wells, who was 4-1 at the end of last season when
called up, couldn't find that form in his first two tries with the
White Sox this season. He'll start Wednesday against the Rangers.
He's 4-7 in 15 starts this season and started as the No. 2 man in
the rotation. ''I knew they (the White Sox) would be successful
with or without me,'' Wells said. ''They were while I was here. I
knew I had a place here and unfortunately my performance didn't
allow me to stick around. I had the talent to do it and couldn't
consistently put it together. Now hopefully I can.'' With Cal
Eldred likely finished for the season, Wells' performance will be a
key for the White Sox down the stretch. They returned Sean Lowe to
the bullpen to make room for Wells in the rotation. ... Despite
their first-place standing, the White Sox are still playing before
empty seats at Comiskey Park. In four games before Tuesday, they
had crowds of 16,377, 29,785, 22,020 and 29,614. ''It just
surprises me. It doesn't make me upset,'' White Sox manager Jerry
Manuel said. ''I guess it does confuse me, being a city this
size.''
Angels-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: LHP Juan Alvarez and RHP Ben Weber were recalled from
Triple-A Edmonton and Double-A Erie, respectively. Alvarez is 0-0
with a 7.71 ERA in five appearances with the Angels. Weber was
claimed off waivers Aug. 30 from San Francisco and was 0-1 with a
16.20 ERA in two relief appearances at Erie. ... LHP Scott
Schoeneweis will have to stop a trend if he's to win his start
Wednesday at Detroit. The Tigers have won their last 10 games
against left-handed starters, including Monday's 5-0 victory over
Scott Karl. ... Monday's shutout loss was the Angels' fifth of the
season, all on the road.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: OF Juan Gonzalez, ailing from flulike symptoms, was a
late scratch from Tuesday's lineup and is day-to-day. ... RHP Dave
Mlicki (sinus infection) and 1B Hal Morris (broken finger) were
activated from the disabled list. Mlicki (4-10, 5.61) will start
Thursday against Anaheim. ... 1B-OF Dusty Allen was recalled from
Triple-A Toledo. ... Setup man Doug Brocail has missed three weeks
with a bone spur in his right elbow. He will try to throw breaking
pitches off the bullpen mound Wednesday, and if all goes well he
says he can pitch Thursday.
Yankees-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: CF Bernie Williams would likely miss 4-6 games with
soreness in his ribs, the same problem that sidelined him for seven
games last month. Williams reinjured the ribs on Monday, swinging
at a forkball from Kansas City's Mac Suzuki, and left after one
inning. ... RHP Ramiro Mendoza threw 50-plus pitches in simulated
game conditions on Monday and could pitch as soon as Thursday,
manager Joe Torre said. Mendoza, plagued by tendinitis in his right
shoulder, has not pitched since July 29. ... The Yankees called up
LHP Randy Keisler, and INF Alfonso Soriano from Triple-A Columbus.
The Yankees also placed RHP Darrell Einertson on the 60-day DL.
Einertson is recovering from surgery to remove bone chips from his
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: AL Rookie of the Year Carlos Beltran started in
center field for the Royals, his first start since sustaining a
bone bruise to his right knee on July 3. Beltran, whose suspension
for refusing to report to Florida for a rehab assignment is still
under appeal, was activated Monday and struck out as a pinch hitter
in his only plate appearance ... Kansas City's Mike Sweeney had 125
RBIs going into Tuesday's game, eight off the club record set by
Hal McRae in 1982.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos called up three RHP Jeremy Powell, LHP Stan
Spencer and SS Tomas De La Rosa from Triple-A Ottawa. Ottawa's
season ended Monday and manager Rick Sweet also joined the Expos.
... 1B Lee Stevens, who injured his big left toe Monday, was out of
the lineup. .... Dustin Hermanson faces the Cardinals for the first
time since Sept. 26, 1998, when he allowed Mark McGwire's 67th home
run, on Wednesday. He's 2-0 with a 2.52 ERA in eight games against
the Cardinals for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Andy Benes, activated from the DL on Sunday, will
spend a couple weeks in the bullpen before returning to the
rotation. ... C Eli Marrero, who missed almost two months with a
broken left thumb, made his first start since July 1. He was
activated Sept. 1 from a rehab at Triple-A Memphis. ... Only three
of the Cardinals' final 24 games are against teams with winning
records. ... Garrett Stephenson, who's 15-7, will try to win his
fifth straight decision on Wednesday against the Expos. ... The No.
6-8 slots in the batting order were batting .368 with 25 RBIs in
the last 11 games, and had all four RBIs Monday.
Mets-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets recalled utility player Joe McEwing from
Triple-A Norfolk. McEwing hit .227 in 52 games for the Mets with
two homers and 18 RBIs. He was optioned to Norfolk on Aug. 28. ...
Howie Freiling, a coach at Norfolk, also joined the Mets for the
remainder of the season. ... Rick Reed was relieved in the seventh
inning Tuesday after throwing 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: SS Barry Larkin is likely out for the season. He'll
have arthroscopic surgery Friday to clean out his left knee. ... C
Eddie Taubensee was moved to the 60-day DL. He'll have surgery
Friday for a ruptured disc in his back. ... The Reds called up INF
Brooks Kieschnick and RHP Keith Glauber from Triple-A.
Marlins-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Houston has won six of its past seven series and nine
series since the All-Star break. The Astros are 27-23 since the
break ... Tony McKnight is the 21st pitcher used by Houston this
season, two short of the team record set in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Florida is 8-4 this season when Preston Wilson homers.
... Alex Gonzalez has hit in 15 of his last 16 games for Florida,
batting .328 (21 for 64).
Cubs-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs held a 20-minute meeting before Tuesday's game
with the Rockies. ''After yesterday, I had seen as much as I wanted
to see,'' manager Don Baylor said. ... Jamie Arnold started in
place of Kevin Tapani, who was given extra time between starts. ...
1B Mark Grace was back in the lineup after sitting out a game with
a bruised right knee. ... RHP Matt Karchner was waived by the Cubs.
... Chicago recalled infielders Julio Zuleta, Chad Meyers and Augie
Ojeda and purchased the contract of catcher Mike Mahoney from Iowa.
... The Cubs have homered in 30 of the 33 games they have played at
Coors Field while the Rockies have hit home runs in all 32. ...
Eric Young has 45 SBs, eight behind NL leader Luis Castillo. No Cub
has led the league in steals since Stan Hack in 1939. ... Sammy
Sosa received his Hispanic Heritage Award before the game. Sosa is
one of five recipients of the award that honors individuals in the
categories of the arts, literature, leadership, education and
sports from the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies moved Larry Walker from the 15-day DL to
the 60-day DL and took him off the 40-man roster. Walker, who last
appeared Aug. 19, will undergo surgery to remove a bone spur and
other debris from his right elbow either Thursday or Friday. ...
RHP Pete Walker was called up from Triple-A Colorado Springs. He
was 7-3 with five saves and a 3.07 ERA in 58 relief appearances at
Colorado Springs. ... RHP Giovanni Carrara was reinstated from the
15-day DL. Carrara had been on the DL since Aug. 5 with tendinitis
in his right elbow. ... When Todd Helton struck out twice on Monday
it was only the fifth time this season when he has fanned twice in
a game. ... Helton with 53 doubles is on pace to catch Joe
Medwick's NL record of 53 set in 1936.
Diamondbacks-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks will play 30 of their final 48 games
on the road. Before Tuesday, they were just 31-32 away from home,
after posting the NL's second-best road record (48-33) last year.
... Arizona recalled P Geraldo Guzman and OF Jason Conti from
Triple-A Tuscon. ... After making an error in just four of their
previous 17 games, the Diamondbacks made three in the first two
innings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Late-season slumps are nothing new for the Braves. The
team lost 11 of 13 from Aug. 31-Sept. 14, 1996, then won eight of
its next nine. Two years ago, Atlanta was 3-9 from Aug. 30-Sept. 9
but closed the season by winning 14 of its final 16 games. ... The
Braves' dugout was a lot more crowded Tuesday. Infielders Mark
DeRosa, Wes Helms and Tim Unroe, outfielder Pedro Swann and catcher
Mike Hubbard were brought up from Triple-A Richmond. Also, the
Braves activated reliever Kevin McGlinchy, who was on an injury
rehab assignment in the minors after struggling most of the season
with a sore right shoulder. McGlinchy pitched nine games at
Richmond, going 0-1 with a 3.60 ERA.
Phillies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: LF Pat Burrell is hitless in his last 18 at bats
and is just 1-fof-26, but Phillies manager Terry Francona said he's
going to stick with his rookie the rest of the year. ''I admit he's
frustrated, but he's just going through some growing pains,'' said
Francona. ''Early on he gave us so much more than we expected, it's
been hard on him. You have to be willing to be patient with young
players or you're going to miss the boat.'' ... The Phillies have
won just one of the past 12 series with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: There was no music played during the Giants'
batting practice because a crew was filming part of a movie
involving Giants radio voice Jon Miller and that didn't sit well
with the team or Giants manager Dusty Baker. ''We've got to have
our music while we're hitting,'' said Baker. ''You can't take us
out of our routine. The guys were wondering about that. This is our
batting practice, our preparation time. They can film on their own
time.'' ... OF Armando Rios hasn't played since bruising his left
elbow and left knee last Thursday in Pittsburgh. ''He looks better
and hopefully he'll be ready by Saturday,'' said Baker. ''Ellis
(Burks) is going to need a break here soon.''
Pirates-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: This is the first time the Pirates have begun
September with a 4-0 record since 1992, when they won their first
five games. ... 2B Enrique Wilson was back in the lineup Tuesday,
after missing four games because of a sprained right ankle. ...
Someone ought to declare a national holiday whenever the Pirates
score seven runs in one inning. They've done it twice this season --
on Labor Day and the Fourth of July. ... The 12 runs the Pirates
scored in its series opener at Los Angeles represented their most
at Dodger Stadium since a 13-3 victory on June 24, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Todd Hundley's mother, Betty, passed away Monday
night in Chicago at age 58 after a long bout with cancer. ... LF
Gary Sheffield entered Tuesday trying to break a season-worst
17-game home run drought stretching back to Aug. 19. The dry spell
doesn't include the 11 games he missed because of a five-game
suspension and a sinus infection. ''I feel just like I'm in someone
else's body,'' said Sheffield, who is playing at about 75-80
percent and is experiencing drowsiness because of the medication he
is taking. ''I've got two more days of taking it, because I have to
complete the bottle.'' ... The Dodgers activated SS Kevin Elster,
who had been on the DL since Aug. 23 because of a strained left
hamstring.
Brewers-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: 3B Tyler Houston, who hit a three-run homer Monday,
is hitting .407 (11-for-27) at Qualcomm Stadium. ... Despite
allowing an inherited runner to score and giving up an unearned run
Monday, LHP Ray King upped had his career-high streak to 13 1-3
innings without surrendering an earned run.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: 1B Ryan Klesko has not homered since Aug. 5, a span
of 88 at-bats. ... INF Kevin Nicholson was placed on the 60-day DL
with a broken left wrist. Nicholson, San Diego's No. 1 pick in the
1997 June draft, left batting practice on Monday after taking a
swing and feeling pain in the wrist. ... The Padres purchased the
contract of INF Greg LaRocca from Triple-A Las Vegas. ... When RHP
Tom Davey debuted in the eighth inning Monday, the Padres set a NL
record by using their 28th pitcher this season.

died Tuesday. He was 77.

Elizabeth Gordon Norcross:
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- Elizabeth Gordon Norcross, a former
editor-in-chief of House Beautiful magazine, died Sunday of
pneumonia. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross, then known as Elizabeth Gordon, directed the editorial
content of the New York-based magazine from 1941 through 1964.
</P>
<P>
   She was a major proponent of architect Frank Lloyd Wright's work
and was inspired by Wright's practical, environmentally compatible
architecture. The magazine took its name from his book, ''The House
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Norcross also is credited with introducing Shibui, a form of
Japanese design, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote home maintenance columns for the Chicago Tribune, the
New York Herald Tribune and several other New York newspapers. She
also wrote a book, ''More House for Your Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Norcross was an honorary member of the American Institute of
Architecture and was knighted by the Finnish government for
promoting an exhibition of Scandinavian arts and crafts.
Willard Scott:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Willard ''Bubba'' Scott, a key defensive
player at Southern California in the late 1960s, died Friday of
cancer. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was one of the ''Wild Bunch,'' the nickname given to the
1969 Trojans' defensive line, which included Al Cowlings, Jimmy
Gunn, Charlie Weaver and Tody Smith. That team had a 10-0-1 record
and beat Michigan in the 1970 Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore, Scott was on the national championship team that
went 10-1 and defeated Indiana in the 1968 Rose Bowl. In Scott's
three years at Southern California, the Trojans had a 29-2-2
record.
Clyde Sukeforth:
</P>
<P>
   WALDOBORO, Maine (AP) -- Clyde Sukeforth, a former major league
catcher and Brooklyn Dodgers scout who helped set the stage for
Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier, died Sunday. He
was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Sukeforth also scouted for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the
Atlanta Braves. Among the players he signed were Don Newcombe and
Roberto Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   Sukeforth was a confidant of Dodgers general manager Branch
Rickey, who sent him to Chicago in 1945 to watch a Negro League
game involving Robinson's Kansas City Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson sat out the game, but Sukeforth was impressed enough to
arrange the historic meeting with Rickey that led two years later
to Robinson becoming the first black to play in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Sukeforth was acting manager of the Dodgers, filling in for Leo
Durocher, on April 15, 1947, the day of Robinson's major league
debut. Brooklyn beat the Boston Braves, 5-3.
Jim Ward:
</P>
<P>
   SEMINOLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Ward, winner of two Ironman triathlons
in a senior division, died Monday after collapsing while cycling.
He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was five miles into a 72-mile ride on the Pinellas Trail
with the St. Pete Mad Dog Triathlon Club when he fell.
</P>
<P>
   Ward began his career as a triathlete late in life and competed
in his first triathlon at the age of 68. He had been a foreign
service officer and led a guerrilla unit in combat as an Army
officer during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ward completed more than 150 triathlons -- a 2.4-mile swim
followed by 112 miles on bicycle and a 26.2-mile marathon run. He
won in 1992 in the 75-and-over category and took the 75-plus title
in 1994 when he was 77, making him the event's oldest winner.
Audrey Wise:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Audrey Wise, a Labor Party member of Parliament
who remained a rebellious left-winger as the party shifted to the
center, died Saturday of a brain tumor. She was 65.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected in 1974, but lost her seat in Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative landslide in 1979. She was defeated again
in 1983, but finally returned to Parliament in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Labor Party's National Executive Committee
between 1982 and 1987, she was prominent in opposing leader Neil
Kinnock's efforts to purge the party of the ultra-left ''militant
tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first term in Parliament, she co-authored an amendment
which forced James Callaghan's Labor government to link tax
allowances for the elderly to the rate of inflation. It was a major
defeat for the government and its Treasury chief, Denis Healy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Wise had remained fiercely independent,
frequently voting contrary to the party line in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Tower Damage Estimate: $40M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Repairing the landmark Moscow television tower
damaged in a fire last week will cost at least $40 million and take
at least a year to complete, Russia's top construction official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Top priorities will be repairing elevators and the steel cables
that support the 1,771-foot Ostankino Tower, Anvar Shamuzafarov,
chairman of the Russian State Construction Committee, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much money the government would contribute to
the repairs. Russian media reports say the government has already
spent most of the funds earmarked in this year's budget for the
aftermath of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the damage, Shamuzafarov insisted that the structure was
stable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ostankino tower is a work of genius and will reach the
same age as the Pyramids of Egypt,'' he said in remarks carried on
Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-hour fire broke out Aug. 27 high on the tower -- a key
feature in Moscow's skyline -- and spread downward, knocking out
almost all TV service to the Moscow region's 15 million people for
three days.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a spokesman for Chechnya's rebel President Aslan
Maskhadov on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire was a very successful action that our special units
carried out,'' Information Minister Akhmed Sakayev told Germany's
Deutsche Welle radio.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Berlin-based station's Russian-language service that
the tower was selected as a target because ''that's where all the
anti-Chechen propaganda was broadcast from'' to Russia and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russian authorities said the blaze is believed to have
been sparked by a short circuit. And Russia's Federal Security
Service said that Chechen terrorism was not considered a possible
cause of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have been battling in Chechnya for nearly a year
to suppress the republic's separatist government after being driven
out at the end of a 1994-96 war. The Russian military controls
large areas of Chechnya, but appears to be far from defeating the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Clinton sighs for Saks  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton doesn't get to
do much shopping, and when she drove by the Saks Fifth Avenue store
in White Plains on Tuesday, ''My heart started to beat,'' she told
the Rotary Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''So if I talk a little faster and leave a little early, you'll
know where to find me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Clinton if she would consider running for
president when she finished her hoped-for U.S. Senate term.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. I'll consider retirement,'' she said. Nevertheless, Rotary
official Karl Milde gave her a pen ''you can sign bills with.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't his idea, but Rep. Rick Lazio is entered in another
election before his U.S. Senate battle against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republican candidate canceled his scheduled interview
Tuesday on WSYR-AM in Syracuse, the show's miffed host, Jim Reith,
decided to conduct an on-air vote on whether to allow the Senate
candidate to reschedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears he's ducking us, and I can't understand why,''
Reith told his listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Reith said he would let his listeners decide whether to permit
Lazio to do the interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Just before she was endorsed by the Sierra Club in New Rochelle
on Tuesday, Clinton shook hands with John Klotz, chairman of the
New York City chapter, and said she liked his tie.
</P>
<P>
   It showed a caricature of conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh
and the name ''Rush'' with a line through it.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she felt about Gov. George Bush's open-mike obscenity
about New York Times reporter Adam Clymer, Clinton was circumspect.
''I like Adam Clymer,'' she said. ''He's a respected, fair-minded
reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lives in Westchester County, but her campaign apparently
hasn't learned the county's ins and outs. On an itinerary for
Tuesday, it called Greenburgh ''Greensburg.'' Last month, Clinton
partisans jumped on Lazio's campaign for issuing an itinerary that
had him appearing in ''Oswego, Broome County.'' Actually, Oswego is
in Oswego County and Lazio was headed for Owego, which is in Tioga
County.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton addressed a gathering at the mostly senior Heritage
Hills condominium development Tuesday night in Somers, several
hundred supporters jammed the clubhouse and an adjoining patio.
Meanwhile, four Lazio stalwarts stood outside, vainly waving
handmade placards in an attempt to get Clinton's attention through
a window.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to show that not everybody here is for
Hillary,'' said William Montuori, 76.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton invited questions from the floor in Somers, one man
asked three at once, then two more when the candidate said she
forgot the third one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I have a lifeline?'' Clinton pleaded.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Doctor To Plead Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A former doctor will plead guilty
Wednesday to federal charges in the deaths of three patients at a
veterans' hospital in New York state, according to a prosecutor who
plans to charge him with the death of a patient in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Swango is accused of injecting the three patients with
toxins at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Northport, N.Y., in
1993. In two of the cases, he told hospital staff the patients'
families had issued ''do not resuscitate'' orders, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's admitting to what he's charged with and that's it,''
Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Swango pleaded innocent in July.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Randi Chavis, did not return a message left Tuesday
at his office in New York state. Federal prosecutors in New York
said Swango was expected in court Wednesday; a court order
prohibited them from commenting further.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-count federal indictment charged Swango with three
counts of murder, one count of assault, three counts of making
false statements and two counts of scheming to defraud, all
involving New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty plea to the three counts of murder would carry a
federal sentence of life in prison without parole, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's admission would lead Franklin County to charge him with
aggravated murder in the poisoning of Cynthia Ann McGee on Jan. 14,
1984, at Ohio State University's hospital, O'Brien said. Swango was
an intern there at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the kind of thing he has done before that followed
him wherever he went,'' O'Brien said. ''We had suspicions about all
of the deaths. What we were missing is a level of evidence. We
could not bring charges against him in the McGee case without an
admission from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Swango, who is in his mid-40s, also is suspected of poisoning
patients in Zimbabwe and spent time in prison for poisoning
co-workers in Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 2, White Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chad Curtis hit a two-out RBI single in the ninth
inning Tuesday night as the Texas Rangers pushed across an unearned
run and beat the Chicago White Sox 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Rusty Greer reached to start the ninth when Chicago
shortstop Jose Valentin threw low to first for his 31st error of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   After a fielder's choice and fly out, Luis Alicea fouled off
four pitches from Bobby Howry (2-4) before singling and then Curtis
hit a 3-2 pitch to left to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Johnson (1-0) pitched two shutout innings for his first
major league win and John Wetteland got three outs for his 30th
save.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's second straight loss to the Rangers dropped the White
Sox's lead over Cleveland to 6&AMP;frac12; games after the Indians beat Tampa
Bay on Tuesday night. It is the White Sox's smallest lead in the AL
Central since June 21.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got a run off Darren Oliver in the fourth on
singles by Magglio Ordonez and Carlos Lee and a double-pay grounder
by Herbert Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had five hits in the fifth but managed just one run
as Mike Sirotka struck out Rafael Palmeiro on a 3-2 pitch with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee singled to start the inning and scored on a double
by Scott Sheldon, who was thrown out trying to stretch it into a
triple.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers then loaded the bases on a bunt and two infield hits
before Sirotka fanned Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka, bidding for his fourth straight win, went seven
innings, allowing eight hits and one run.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, making his first start since coming off the disabled
list and his first appearance since July 30, allowed six hits and a
run in six innings. He's been bothered most of the last three
months by weakness in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game drew a small crowd of just 13,899. ... Oliver has
made eight rehab starts this season. ... Kip Wells, one of four
White Sox called up Tuesday, will start Wednesday's game. Wells is
in his third stint with the White Sox after beginning the season as
the No. 2 starter. ... Rusty Greer, scratched from Monday's lineup
with a stiff neck, didn't start again but pinch hit in the ninth.
... Wetteland's save gives him eight 30-save seasons and six
straight.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Wants To Play Sunday  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Despite still having a headache and
dizziness more than 48 hours after his ninth concussion, Troy
Aikman is determined to keep playing football -- maybe as soon as
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him an hour ago and he has not made a final
decision,'' Leigh Steinberg, Aikman's agent, said late Tuesday.
''It's partly going to be a reaction to his symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Troy's tough, but I'm hopeful he'll sit out a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said he and Aikman ''really haven't'' talked about
retirement because this latest head injury is not as severe as
either of the two he suffered last season. And, earlier this year,
a comprehensive exam showed that none of his previous injuries have
caused permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, they gave him a clean bill of health,'' Steinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg always encourages his clients not to take any risks
after head injuries. His pleading helped convince Steve Young to
retire after symptoms lingered long after a concussion last season.
</P>
<P>
   With Aikman, Steinberg's biggest fear is that he'll return too
soon and is more susceptible to another concussion. Young's last
hit came a week after an undiagnosed concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone who has had one concussion has a greater chance of a
second in close proximity to the first,'' Steinberg said. ''The
safer route is to sit out a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is well aware of the risks. He's attended several
seminars organized by Steinberg that featured leaders in the study
of concussions and the quarterback and agent have met privately
with experts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Troy has made a major effort to educate himself,'' Steinberg
said. ''Part of being cautious and careful was making those doctor
visits this offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said there were no plans for Aikman to visit those
doctors again to make sure things are still OK. That could change
if his symptoms get worse or don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was hurt during a season-opening 41-14 loss to
Philadelphia on Sunday. A heavy blitz led to four sacks and five
incompletions, including an interception returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham replaced Aikman and bruised his throwing
hand. Although the team lists him as questionable, he expects to be
ready to start against the Cardinals if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Eagles, Dallas also lost receiver Joey Galloway to a
season-ending knee injury. He was acquired in February to be the
sparkplug of a new timing-passed offense that's similar to what
Aikman ran when he led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman takes Sunday off, he'll have an extra day to prepare
for Dallas' next game: Monday night in Washington against the
defending division champions and their new cornerback, former
Cowboy Deion Sanders.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Expos 6  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ray Lankford homered twice and rookie Britt
Reames didn't allow a hit for 5 2-3 innings as the St. Louis
Cardinals beat the Montreal Expos 7-6 for their sixth straight
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals matched their season-high winning streak and
pulled 10 games ahead in the NL Central, also matching a season
best. But they had to hang on after taking a 6-0 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos' first hit off Reames (1-1) was a two-run double by
Vladimir Guerrero that came after two walks earlier in the inning.
After walking his first batter, Gene Stechschulte gave up a
three-run homer to Geoff Blum that cut the gap to a run.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford hit a two-run homer in the third off Julio Santana
(0-5) to give the Cardinals a 6-0 lead. Lankford hit his 22nd homer
leading off the sixth against Anthony Telford for a 7-5 lead, and
Fernando Seguinol homered in the seventh for the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Reames gave up three runs, one hit and four walks in 5 2-3
innings. Mike Timlin pitched the final two innings for his 12th
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are 5-0 with two games to go on the homestand,
have won 16 of 20 overall and are a season-best 22 games above
.500.
</P>
<P>
   Santana walked three batters in the Cardinals' four-run first,
and all of them scored. Will Clark had a two-run single, making him
8-for-8 against Santana with five RBIs, and Edgar Renteria had an
RBI single. Clark also walked and scored on Lankford's home run
against Santana in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Santana lasted three innings and gave up six runs -- five earned
-- and four hits.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals also led second-place Cincinnati by 10 games
on July 5. ... Lankford has 15 career multihomer games, and three
this season. Fifteen of his homers and 40 of his 58 RBIs have come
at home. ... Cardinals 2B Fernando Vina sat out for the second
straight game with bruised ribs. He missed three games last week
with the same injury. ... Guerrero has 101 RBIs. Last year he got
his 100th on Aug. 28, en route to a team record 131. ... St. Louis
C Eli Marrero, out about two months with a broken thumb, made his
first start since July 1 and was 0-for-3. He's 4-for-40 for his
career against Montreal pitching. ... The Cardinals have gone eight
games without an error.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 10, Royals 5  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- David Cone went down too early to get
the win, but reliever Dwight Gooden never lost the New York
Yankees' early lead Tuesday night in a 10-5 victory over the Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 hitter Jose Vizcaino went 4-for-5 and Scott Brosius hit an
eighth-inning grand slam for the Yankees, who maintained their
six-game lead over second-place Boston in the AL East. Brosius'
blast off reliever Andy Larkin splashed into the fountains beyond
left field and made it 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cone separated his left shoulder making a diving catch on Rey
Sanchez's bunt in the third inning, becoming the second Yankees
player in two days to go down with an injury. On Monday, center
fielder Bernie Williams aggravated a previous rib strain in the
first inning of a 4-3 win over the Royals. He is expected to miss
4-6 games.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden (6-4) replaced Cone and gave up three runs and seven hits
in 5 1-3 innings, walking one and striking out one. Mike Stanton
pitched the ninth, giving up Mike Sweeney's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's shoulder was popped back into place, but he was taken to
a hospital as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice homered and drove in two runs for the Yankees, who
beat Kansas City for the seventh time in eight games this season.
His leadoff homer in the seventh off reliever Paul Spoljaric gave
New York a 6-4 lead and atoned for a fielding error in the sixth
that allowed an unearned run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran, making his first start since he went down with a
bruised knee on July 3, went 2-for-4 and drove in a run for the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took a 1-0 lead on Jermaine Dye's RBI double in the
first inning, but the Yankees scored four times in the third
against Jeff Suppan (7-9).
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger, Williams' replacement in center field, led off
with a home run to left center. Paul O'Neill's bases-loaded fly
ball, caught by a wind blowing in from right field, fell in for an
RBI single. Tino Martinez followed with a sacrifice fly for the
inning's first out.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill got hung up between first and second when Justice struck
out, but managed to elude the tag long enough for Derek Jeter to
score from third.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan gave up five runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings, striking
out three and walking four.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded sacrifice flies in the fifth, Johnny Damon
answering Justice's RBI with his own to make it 5-2. The Royals
scored twice in the sixth, cutting the Yankees' lead to 5-4, when
Beltran hit an RBI single to left and the ball got away from
Justice, allowing Mark Quinn to score.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brosius' grand slam was his second of the season. He hit
the first on May 7 against Baltimore. ... Cone had won three of his
last four decisions after a 1-10 start. ... Justice's homer was his
35th of the season but his first since Aug. 19. ... Damon stole his
league-leading 41st base in the third. ... With a second-inning
walk, Jeter extended his streak of reaching base safely to 30
games, the most by a Yankee since he did it in 53 straight games

<HEADLINE> Gaines No Longer With Michigan  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA R. MOSES
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan sophomore point guard Kevin Gaines will
no longer be a part of the basketball team, following ''a serious
violation of team policies'' over the Labor Day weekend, coach
Brian Ellerbe said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbe said in a news release that two incoming freshmen would
also be disciplined for an off-campus incident ''that I deemed a
serious violation of team policies.'' He said he met with Michigan
athletic director Bill Martin, coaches and university officials
before coming to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place early Monday in Taylor, about 30 miles
from the Ann Arbor campus. The university declined to elaborate on
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Police reports say the three were arrested early Monday on
suspicion of disorderly intoxication. Police said Tuesday that the
three stopped their car on U.S. 24 and, despite traffic, started
wrestling outside the car.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three were behind the car and in the roadway; they were
engaged in horseplay,'' Taylor police chief Thomas Bonner told the
Detroit Free Press. ''Several cars had to change lanes to avoid
hitting these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A breath test showed Gaines, the driver, had a .17 percent
blood-alcohol level, police reports stated. By Michigan law,
anything .10 or higher is considered drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged, and Bonner said he expected a decision
on charges Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbe didn't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made the decision that as of today, Kevin Gaines is no
longer a part of the University of Michigan basketball team,'' he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Gaines was third on the Wolverines in scoring last
season at 11.7 points per game and led the team in assists (133)
and steals (34). Michigan finished 15-14 last season, losing to
Notre Dame in the opening round of the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming freshmen Bernard Robinson Jr. and Avery Queen were with
Gaines at the time and were placed on probation which Ellerbe will
direct. He provided no other details.
</P>
<P>
   ''I met with each one of these athletes to talk about the
incident and I have informed the students and their parents as well
as the team of this decision,'' Ellerbe said. ''I want to assure
everyone that we will give Kevin all the support he needs even
though he will not be with the basketball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbe said Gaines, 19, has been offered the chance to remain a
student and to retain his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove Gaines from the team shouldn't be seen as
harsh punishment, Ellerbe said. ''This is a result of numerous
violations of team rules,'' he said, but he declined to elaborate
on what those violations were.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more concerned about Kevin Gaines the individual than
Kevin Gaines the player,'' he said. ''This is not a basketball
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gaines' reaction, Ellerbe said he was ''obviously very
disappointed, but not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I really feel bad,'' Gaines told The Detroit News. ''This is
very disappointing. I don't know yet what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is a 6-6 forward from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 Queen played at the Winchendon School, a prep school in
Massachusetts. In May, he was charged with assault and battery, and
assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, stemming from a
December incident at the Winchendon School. He and another former
student were accused of hitting another student with a belt. They
were given a year's probation and ordered to perform 50 hours of
community service.

<HEADLINE> Sierra club endorses Clinton over Lazio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - The Sierra Club endorsed Hillary
Rodham Clinton for Senate on Tuesday, saying her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, has ''dropped the ball'' on several
important environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been viewed as an ally in the past by other
environmental groups for his efforts to clean up Long Island Sound
and to fight strip-mining. But the Sierra Club touted Clinton's
commitment to environmental issues while saying Lazio hasn't done
enough to protect the state from pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio defended his environmental record and said he ''can't
think of a single time when Mrs. Clinton has ever forcefully spoke
out on any environmental issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's New York leaders conducted lengthy interviews
with each candidate before making the decision.
