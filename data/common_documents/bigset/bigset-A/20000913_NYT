<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attacked from all sides, Congressman Michael Forbes,
a Republican-turned Democrat from Long Island, was locked in a
dead-even struggle with his primary challenger on Tuesday night and
was one of the few incumbents in the state who had not prevailed in
congressional and legislative contests that were unusually marked
by rancor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes acknowledged on Tuesday night that his race against
Regina Seltzer, 71, was too close to call. With Republicans
clinging to a narrow majority in the House, both national and state
party officials had channeled money and advertising into the
district early on, to sway even Democrats to vote against the man
who infuriated the GOP by switching his party affiliation in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This primary election also featured for the first time the name
of a first lady on the ballot for an elective office, with Hillary
Rodham Clinton easily winning the Democratic nomination for the
U.S. Senate against Mark McMahon, a little known Manhattan
orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   With 76 percent of the vote counted, Clinton received 80 percent
of the vote, with McMahon receiving 20 percent. Aides to Clinton's
Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had forecast that Clinton
would be viewed as a particularly weak contender for the November
general election if her opponent in the Democratic primary received
30 percent of the vote. Still, the 20-percent showing indicated
that Clinton must contend with a group of voters, even Democrats,
who carry a strong dislike for her.
</P>
<P>
   Primary day began in Chappaqua with votes by Mrs. Clinton and
her husband in their new hometown of Chappaqua, N.Y. The two
arrived at 7:15 a.m. to a waiting throng of photographers and
reporters to cast their votes in the sole voting booth in the
school's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   After signing photographs and shaking hands with residents
outside the school lobby, Mrs. Clinton went into the aqua blue
booth first, followed by her husband. Asked afterward how it felt
to see Mrs. Clinton on the ballot for the first time, President
Clinton said, ``It was a thrill. After all these years of her
helping me, it was a thrill. I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was more demure, saying only that it felt ``great''
to vote for herself. But later, talking to reporters at a nearby
delicatessen, she elaborated somewhat on the occasion. ``I stood
there for a minute,'' she said, ``staring at my name.''

MOST N.Y. INCUMBENT DEMOCRATS DEFEAT PRIMARY CHALLENGERS
</HEADLINE>
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several New York lawmakers fended off challenges in
the Democratic primary on Tuesday, once again demonstrating that
when it comes to elections, the state Legislature is usually an
incumbent's paradise. But there were a few exceptions, notably an
East Harlem assemblyman who was defeated by a former councilman,
Adam Clayton Powell IV, a son of one of the most famous politicians
in city history.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, making a comeback after an unsuccessful run for borough
president in 1997, ousted a two-term assemblyman, Nelson Antonio
Denis. Powell charged during the campaign that Denis was neglecting
the district, while Denis retorted that Powell's candidacy was
based solely on his name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Denis backed an attempt this year to overthrow the Assembly
speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, and Silver exacted revenge in
the primary, refusing to give Denis the financial or organizational
support that incumbents typically receive from the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, the longest serving Assembly member, Arthur O. Eve,
was locked in a tight race with Crystal D. Peoples, majority leader
of the Erie County legislature. An incumbent in the Bronx, Edward
Griffith, was also in a close contest, against Diane Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   In the state Senate, in a continuing feud between Bronx party
leaders and the Espada family, a former state senator, Pedro G.
Espada, appeared to be headed for a victory over the incumbent,
David Rosado. Rosado defeated Espada in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Most other Democratic incumbents facing tough challenges
survived easily. Among the Assembly members who won _ tantamount to
retaining the seat in overwhelmingly Democratic districts _ were
Clarence Norman Jr., Roger Green and Darryl C. Towns of Brooklyn;
and Catherine Nolan and Pauline Rhodd-Cummings of Queens. In the
Senate, Olga A. Mendez of Manhattan kept her seat.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, many incumbents did not face primary challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, and former Mayor Edward
Koch, a Democrat, had sought to rally support against some
Democratic incumbents in New York City, particularly Nolan, because
they voted to repeal the income tax on commuters last year, but
those appeals appeared to have had little impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of charges hurled my way, but in the end, my
neighbors felt that I was the person who served them and worked
hard,'' said Nolan, who handily turned aside a challenge from
Patrick T. O'Malley, a former Queens prosecutor whose brother,
Martin, is the mayor of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents in Albany have long maintained an iron grip on their
seats, in large part because they have name recognition, the
support of party committees, the authority to dole out projects and
the ability to raise political money from contributors with an
interest in legislation. Most turnover in the Legislature stems
from open seats.
</P>
<P>
   In one such open Assembly district in Astoria, Queens, Michael
N. Gianaris, a counsel for the Democratic majority in the Assembly,
was leading in early returns against Kimon C. Thermos, a lawyer who
had unsuccessfully sought the seat previously. Both men were vying
to become the first Greek-American Assembly member from New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   On Staten Island, John W. Lavelle, the county party chairman,
who had pledged not to seek elected office and then changed his
mind, was in a close race against Raymond G. Jorgensen for seat
held by Assemblywoman Elizabeth A. Connelly, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Krueger easily won a Democratic Senate primary on the Upper
East Side, seeking to dislodge the longtime Republican incumbent,
Roy M. Goodman. Krueger, on leave from the Community Food Resource
Center, defeated Robert J. Bellinson, a lawyer who has run against
Mr. Goodman in the last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   In another contest to take on a longtime Republican senator,
Lorraine Coyle Koppell, a lawyer who is the wife of a former state
attorney general, beat Michael R. Benedetto, a public elementary
school teacher who is a Bronx Democratic district leader.
</P>
<P>
   And in a Brooklyn Republican primary, former State Sen. Robert
J. Dicarlo narrowly defeated Charles Capetanakis for the right to
take on the incumbent Democrat, Vincent Gentile.

Young quarterbacks take over in NFL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When it comes to playing quarterback in the NFL, youth is being
served.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five years ago, the NFL was in a panic over a
shortage of young, talented prospects at quarterback. Fifteen of
the 30 teams employed starters who were at least 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   After a youth movement at one of the highest-profile positions
in pro sports, 11 teams have starting quarterbacks who are 25 years
old or younger. Only eight starters have turned 30.
</P>
<P>
   With such star QBs as John Elway, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly and
Steve Young, who combined to start 13 Super Bowls, leaving the
game, it was out with the old and in with the new.
</P>
<P>
   The youth movement began in 1998 when Peyton Manning (Colts) and
Ryan Leaf (Chargers) were the first two picks in the NFL draft.
Charlie Batch (Lions) and Brian Griese (Broncos) were selected in
the second and third rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, six quarterbacks were drafted in the first two
rounds, including five No. 1 picks.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Couch (Browns), Donovan McNabb (Eagles) and Akili Smith
(Bengals) were the first three picks. Daunte Culpepper (Vikings)
and Cade McNown (Bears) were the 11th and 12th picks in the first
round. But the only second-rounder, Tampa Bay's Shaun King, has
been the most successful. As a rookie, he was forced into the
lineup when Trent Dilfer was injured, and he has a 7-2 record as a
starter, including 1-1 in last season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Culpepper and King are the only starters from that
group who are 2-0. Couch and McNabb are 1-1. Smith is 0-1 and
McNown is 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Buccaneers have such a dominant defense, they play a
conservative offensive style, which takes pressure off King.
Although the offense gets a lot of criticism in the Tampa-St.
Petersburg area, King is the only one of the six quarterbacks not
to throw an interception this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Shaun does is win,'' says Bucs receiver Keyshawn Johnson,
who was acquired in a trade with the Jets in the offseason. ``I
don't know what the big deal is. He's the guy. He was the guy for
seven or eight games last year, so what's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quarterback. He's going to throw the ball. I'm going to
catch it. And other guys are going to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Add Jake Plummer (Cardinals), a second-round pick in 1997, to
that group of starting quarterbacks drafted in 1998 and 1999, and
the list of 11 who are 25 or younger is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're seeing a lot of teams go with younger guys more
than usual,'' Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy says. ``Usually, you like
to let a guy learn for a few seasons, but it seems like more and
more we're going with the younger guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL hopes 1999 will be remembered as the ``Year of the
Quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this quarterbacks class will be talked about
throughout the history of the game,'' Culpepper says. ``Hopefully,
we'll go out and consistently show what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The class of '99 will have to lead its teams to Super Bowls and
set NFL records in the process before it can supplant 1983 as the
``Year of the Quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway (Broncos), Marino (Dolphins), Kelly (Bills), Tony Eason
(Patriots), Ken O'Brien (Jets) and Todd Blackledge (Chiefs) were
first-round picks. Only O'Brien and Blackledge failed to lead their
team to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six quarterbacks drafted in the first two rounds of 1999,
four are black _ McNabb, Smith, Culpepper and King. It was the
first time three black quarterbacks went in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural progression because there are so many more
black quarterbacks starting on college teams,'' says Kansas City's
Warren Moon, a 17-year NFL veteran who turns 44 on Monday.
``Because defenses are devising so many ways to put pressure on the
quarterback, you need as much athleticism at the position as you
can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these young guys are doubly dangerous because they
can throw and run. There's such a demand for young quarterbacks who
can do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the six quarterbacks drafted in the first two rounds of 1999,
only Culpepper didn't throw a pass. He watched and learned behind
veterans Jeff George and Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   At this early junction of their careers, if there is a common
characteristic it's that all but Couch and King are exceptional
runners.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game of the season, McNown rushed for 87 yards.
Last season, only Cincinnati's Jeff Blake (99) rushed for more in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, McNown has 136 yards rushing. Culpepper has rushed
for 110 yards and scored three touchdowns. McNabb has run for two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the new breed of athlete,'' Minnesota coach Dennis
Green says. ``They're very talented players. They have young legs,
and they have a lot of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other offensive coordinators, Minnesota's Sherman Lewis is
trying to take advantage of Culpepper's running ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a different dimension to the offense,'' Lewis says.
``It keeps the chains moving and keeps you on the field. You can't
coach that.''

U.S. track stars recall special '56 Olympics
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID BARRON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SYDNEY, Australia _ As the athletes prepared for the 1956 Olympics
in Melbourne, legend has it the chefs at the Soviet Union's
fenced-off enclave within the Olympic Village baked 24 giant
victory cakes _ one for each men's track and field event.
</P>
<P>
   When an unnamed U.S. athlete heard about the bakefest, the story
goes, he snapped, ``Let them eat bread.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Soviets ended up eating crow.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Soviet Union won the overall medal count for the
'56 Games, which in those Cold War days was a major source of
propaganda points, the U.S. men's track team won its private war
against the Soviets _ and everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men won 15 of 24 gold medals in Melbourne, including
four 1-2-3 sweeps, and 28 of 72 total medals. It was, quite simply,
one of the most dominant performances by any team in the history of
the modern Games.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. champions included a lanky Texan named Bobby Joe Morrow,
who won the 100 and 200 meters and anchored the 400-meter relay;
Bob Richards, whose second gold medal in the pole vault launched
his career as the longtime pitchman for Wheaties; Al Oerter, who at
19 won the first of what would become four consecutive golds in the
discus; and Harold Connolly, who won not only the hammer but the
heart of Czech discus champion Olga Fikotova.
</P>
<P>
   Oerter returns this week to Sydney, where the Olympics return to
Australia after a 44-year absence. Morrow will watch on television
from his home in San Benito and Richards from his home near Waco.
Theirs was the last Olympics not to appear on television in the
United States, but the memories remain in widescreen,
high-definition, crystal clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melbourne was the greatest Olympics ever,'' Richards said.
``There were 150,000 people there every day, filling every seat and
every standing-room position. The roars were incredible. The
Australians were the most devoted fans of the Olympics ever. I'll
never forget the Closing Ceremony and the entire crowd singing
Waltzing Matilda. It was just fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Melbourne Games remain in legend as the
``Friendly Games,'' they unfolded at a time of geopolitical
tension. The Soviets had just smashed the Hungarian revolution, and
the athletes from both countries were not immune to bitter
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 19-year-old kid when I made that team, and what did I
know about international politics?'' Oerter said. ``But I remember
two Soviet athletes and two Hungarian athletes approaching one
another on the sidewalk, and you had to watch to see who was going
to move. The Hungarians moved aside, but not before one of them
spit on the ground in the Russians' path.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was the exception. Oerter remembers the relaxed,
friendly atmosphere throughout most of the Olympic Village and the
excitement that built as the U.S. team exerted its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were living in Air Force barracks, and as the athletes
finished their events and started coming back with medals, you got
to experience their feeling about what they had just done,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of West Babylon, N.Y., Oerter never had heard of the
Olympic trials until his coach at the University of Kansas signed
him up in 1956. He made the team and set an Olympic record of 184
feet, 11 inches with his first throw at Melbourne, beating
world-record holder Fortune Gordien for the gold. Desmond Koch was
third, completing the U.S. sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Richards came to Melbourne as the defending champion in the pole
vault and, in the preliminaries, nearly squandered his chance to
repeat. Running on a sore left Achilles' tendon and competing on a
windy day on a sandy approach track, he missed his first two jumps
at the qualifying height of 13 feet, 1{ inches and was on the verge
of fouling out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my own stupidity,'' he said. ``Back in those days, you
would put your pole up against the crossbar to measure it. But on
the low heights, I figured I could just fly over it and I didn't
bother. But what I didn't know is that they had moved the crossbar
forward, and twice I hit the bar going up.''
</P>
<P>
   He probably would have missed a third time but for a tip from
teammate Bob Gutowski, who pointed out Richards' miscalculation of
where the standard had been placed. Richards went on to qualify
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Richards and Gutowski cleared 14-10\ in the finals, but Gutowski
suffered a pulled stomach muscle and was unable to go higher.
Richards cleared 14-11{ to set an Olympic record and win the gold _
and therein lies a story.
</P>
<P>
   Vaulting on the aforementioned sandy runway into the
aforementioned wind, Richards hit the crossbar on the way down and
lay poised in the pit for more than 30 seconds as the crossbar hung
on the edge of the standards before finally slipping back.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it Richards, a deeply religious man who was known as
the ``Vaulting Vicar,'' tented his hands in prayer as the crossbar
hung on the edge. Richards said, it wasn't quite that dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did look up and point to the bar, but it wasn't a prayer,''
he said. ``It was more like, `Oh, Lordy, is that thing going to
fall off?''' Richards said. ``I can see how people thought it was a
prayer, but it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards went on to work 13 years as the spokesman for Wheaties,
making dozens of commercials, thousands of personal appearances and
hundreds of television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And none of it would have happened but for Gutowski's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the story of John Landy, the great Australian
runner who broke the four-minute-mile barrier after Roger
Bannister,'' Richards said. ``In one race, Landy was on the way to
a world record when he lapped a high school boy who fell down as
Landy was going into the closing curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped and picked up the boy, whose name was Ron Clarke
(who went on to set more than 20 world records as a long-distance
runner). Everybody criticized Landy and said he didn't have the
killer instinct, but he said, `I would stop every time to pick up a
fallen runner. Records don't mean that much to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about that a lot and about the way that Bob
helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years after setting the world record in 1957, Gutowski was
killed in an auto accident. He was 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   If Richards' 1956 story was of friendship, Connolly's was of a
romance that breached the Iron Curtain. His romance with Fikotova
culminated in their wedding before a crowd of 40,000 at a civil
ceremony in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the U.S. gold haul in Melbourne, at the top of
the heap was Morrow, the sprinter from San Benito by way of Abilene
Christian College who kicked up a cloud of red dust on the brick
cinder track en route to victories in both sprints plus the relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just built the track right before the Games and it
was loose. It was like running on loose dirt,'' he said. ``Of
course, I grew up running on dirt tracks. They even had one when I
went to Abilene Christian in 1954. I was used to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they remember the greatness of the 1956 team, thoughts
of friends and colleagues share time with the warmth of the
Australian fans _ memories the 2000 U.S. team no doubt will share
when they look back on the Games of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the people there,'' Morrow said. ``They're so
sports-minded and such great supporters of the athletes and the
Games. It's a great place to visit and a great place to compete.
They really love it there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely superb place,'' Oerter said. ``I don't see
how they can keep from having great Games there. The people are so
open, so gregarious, slap you on the side of the shoulder _ they're
warm, wonderful people, and that will come through.''

Column: Whole world to see Carter's coronation
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Alonzo Mourning throws around praise and
compliments like they're manhole covers. So when he starts to gush
more than an open fire hydrant, you tend to sit up and take notice
of his subject.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can't help but notice Vince Carter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dream Team barnstormed its way across the Pacific en
route to Down Under, dancing on heads all the way, Carter was doing
the fanciest steps.
</P>
<P>
   He has caught lob passes from Jason Kidd and slick
behind-the-back shuffles from Gary Payton for rim-rattling slam
dunks. He has filled the lanes on the fast break with Kevin Garnett
in what looks like a greyhound race. He has dropped in 3-pointers
right in the faces of defenders and he has dropped jaws in the
stands from Hawaii to Tokyo to Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   If the novelty of the Dream Team as conquering heroes in the
Olympics has worn off, Carter's exploits have given us a reason to
watch again.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, by the time the Games are over, Carter's reputation
and fame will have taken a kangaroo's leap from North America to
every basketball-playing country on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But more than provide footage for the nightly highlight reels,
what Carter has done with his efforts every day in practice is to
give even his hard-to-impress U.S. teammates reason to make bold
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Step aside, M.J.
</P>
<P>
   You know the one: Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the second coming,'' said the normally tactiturn
Mourning. ``I played against M.J. for a lot of years. I've seen
M.J. at his best. I watched him and tried to stop him throughout
his career. What I'm telling you now might sound crazy or
outrageous. But Vince Carter probably has more talent, more natural
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``M.J. definitely didn't jump as high as this guy, even in his
younger days. The things I've seen him do over the last few weeks,
this is the one that everybody has been waiting for to take the
game to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has been relishing each trip down the floor on the fast
break with Carter, throwing passes that even he doesn't know are
catchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing Frisbee with one of those trained dogs,''
Kidd said. ``You just throw it up there high and see if Vince can
go get it. For a point guard like me, this is the most fun you can
have on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the preliminary round of the Olympics, Carter leads
the team in scoring and plays that make even the coaching staff and
his peers stop to shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that not only wasn't he an original selection for
Dream Team 2000, but Carter was not even the first alternate chosen
when Tom Gugliotta was injured and scratched from the lineup. The
nine-man selection committee went for Ray Allen by a 6-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't get the call until just a few months ago when
Grant Hill opted out of Sydney duty to get married. Now Carter is
on the verge of burning brighter than the Olympic flame. He's
making most of the big plays and setting the tone, getting involved
in the early scuffle with Australia's flag-bearer Andrew Gaze on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how far can he take it on the NBA stage?
</P>
<P>
   A jury of his peers
</P>
<P>
   What separates Carter from Jordan in full bloom is, of course,
those six NBA championships. But if you're going to make the
comparison, the only fair way is to go back to Jordan's early years
when he was still learning what it took to go from merely a scoring
machine to becoming a hungry, relentless predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was a better defender, no question,'' Mourning said.
``That is an area that I think you learn about as you get a few
years under your belt. It's the work ethic that M.J. had that kept
him improving and eventually made him the player he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I see all of the other similarities and I think there are
a lot of things that at this stage in his career, Vince can do
better than Michael. He can elevate and maybe shoot better. He can
get up and down the floor like nobody I've ever seen and he can go
straight up and make a play from a situation that doesn't look like
it exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``His talent and ability are electrifying. You can't stop him.
You just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of comparison that would be regarded as hyperbole
if it came from anyone other than these teammates.
</P>
<P>
   They are, after all, among the best in the game and have watched
Carter up close now long enough to make valid judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sit here and say I have seen the second coming,''
Mourning said. ``When M.J. retired, I really didn't think I'd see
another one like him in my lifetime. But I have now. Vince is it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time they hand out the gold medals, the whole world will
know it.

 &HT;    PANEL SHOOTS DOWN BAN ON HUNT CONTESTS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JUDD SLIVKA(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - A proposal to ban predator hunting contests was
shot, skinned, gutted and thrown out by a state panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Regulatory Review Council not only tossed the
Game and Fish Commission's proposed ban on contests where hunters
compete to see who can kill the most nuisance creatures in a set
amount of time, it also questioned whether the commission had the
legal authority to manage wildlife in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member commission is appointed by the governor with
confirmation from the Senate. It oversees the Game and Fish
Department, which does the actual wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the meeting was over, Game and Fish employees were
shaking their heads, wondering what it all meant.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a poll paid for by a pro-ban group but conducted by a
firm used by the hunting industry said that nearly 70 percent of
Arizona residents are against the practice. The Game and Fish
proposal wouldn't have banned predator hunting, even among groups.
It merely would have banned contests, where people would pay to
compete and receive a prize at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the council struck it down unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to look at it as a process,'' said Deputy
Director Steve Farrell of the Game and Fish Department. ``This
process is done.''
</P>
<P>
   It had taken three hours and eight minutes. Twenty-four people
spoke against the proposal, only nine spoke in support.
</P>
<P>
   The council's decision, which was based, its members said, on
vague wording in the proposed rule as well as Game and Fish's lack
of specific authority from the Legislature to make the rule at all,
brought to light a greater threat.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Game and Fish Commission, charged with managing
wildlife in Arizona, be allowed to manage wildlife?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the council's recalcitrance came from an opinion issued
by its attorneys that the commission doesn't have the legal
standing to regulate wildlife contests in the state, especially
because the impact of predator contests is biologically minimal,
and thus, a social issue the commission doesn't have the power to
address.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish officials objected to the reasoning, arguing the
Legislature appointed the commission to act in its stead to manage
all wildlife in the state. The agency, its officials argued,
dictates when hunting seasons begin and end, what types of weapons
can be used in a hunt and has barred such things as people hunting
from cars, all ``social'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Game and Fish Commission has never said these
contests have a biological impact,'' Commissioner Joe Carter said.
``What it did say is that they have a tremendous, tremendous social
impact. No one doubts the authority of the commission to manage
wildlife in Arizona. Without the ability to manage social impacts
of wildlife, this commission's ability to manage wildlife at all
will be compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's words had no impact. And council Chairman Tim Boncoskey
ended the meeting with a reminder to Game and Fish:
</P>
<P>
   ``The public needs to know the rulemaking process does not end
with a commission or at the Attorney General's Office. That's why
we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   The predator-ban controversy has been around for several years,
and a similar proposed rule had gone before the review council in
February. That proposal also was thrown out as too vague. The new
version, with two words added to it in an effort to better define
what constitutes a coyote-hunting contest, was introduced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But far from clarifying the issue, it weakened the Game and Fish
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would vote to send it back to the commission with the
following advice,'' said council member Chuck Roach, who spent the
morning sparring with proponents of the ban, once leaving after an
angry exchange with a pro-ban biologist. ``Find another way of
doing it without an outright ban. And get clear and convincing
evidence from the Legislature, in the form of a legislative
initiative, that you have the power to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban opponents whooped in celebration. The Game and Fish
staff left carrying hundreds of pages of papers and rules now made
worthless.

Baylor's Newhouse inherits father's work ethic
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ From the neck up, Reggie Newhouse looks a lot like his
famous father. From the neck down, the similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime University of Houston and Dallas Cowboys fans will
remember Robert Newhouse as a short and stocky running back with
thighs like tree trunks. He was a powerful and punishing runner,
and bringing him down was like trying to tackle a boulder rolling
downhill. Reggie, a 19-year-old sophomore receiver for Baylor,
doesn't fit that physical mold.
</P>
<P>
   If Robert was a bulldog on the field, Reggie is a gazelle. At
6-2, 195 pounds, Reggie is taller and leaner than his dad. Reggie
relies on his speed and cunning moves, whereas Robert relied on
strength and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I get my genetics from my mom's side,'' Reggie
Newhouse said. ``Her brothers are all in the 6-2, 6-3 range.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Reggie are much different physically, but Baylor
coach Kevin Steele said father and son are carbon copies in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same disposition,'' Steele said. ``I've talked
to guys who were with the Cowboys when Robert was a player, and the
way they describe Robert really describes Reggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie is tough. He doesn't miss practice, and he doesn't get
tired. Since two-a-days started, I guarantee you he's run from here
to El Paso and back, but he never says a word except `yes sir.'
Everyone tells me Robert was the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   For those too young to remember, Robert Newhouse was one of the
best players in UH history and went on to have an outstanding
12-year NFL career with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Hallsville product left East Texas and played for the
Cougars from 1969-71. He ranks No. 2 behind Chuck Weatherspoon on
the all-time UH rushing list with 2,961 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse was a second-team All-America running back in 1971 when
he rushed for 1,757 yards, which was second in the nation that
season (Ed Marinaro of Cornell set an NCAA rushing record that
year) and the second-highest total in NCAA history at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse rushed for more than 100 yards 16 times, including 245
yards against Mississippi State as a sophomore. He was drafted in
1972 by Dallas in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched a lot of highlight films on him to see the things
he did,'' Reggie said. ``I would have been a big fan if I was
watching him play in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now an attorney, Robert Newhouse also works for the Cowboys in
player development. Steele thinks so much of Robert that he's had
him come to practice and speak to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert talks to them about patience and work ethic and being
coachable and teachable,'' Steele said. ``He tells them not to feel
like they have all the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells them to go about their business and good things will
happen. And his son lives that way. That's the way he raised him,
and let me tell you, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele said there is a humble nature about both men that comes
through immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Reggie, you would never know his dad was a great NFL
player right up the road,'' Steele said. ``Some youngsters in his
position would make a big issue out of it. If you didn't know, they
would tell you. But Robert is just Dad to Reggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele knows Reggie is close to his father, who attends most of
the Baylor games and will be at the Minnesota game Saturday. But
Steele quickly found out who the real disciplinarian is in the
Newhouse home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie is an ideal young man,'' Steele said. ``But the first
time he got a little rambunctious about something in practice, I
said, `Well Reggie, I guess I will call your daddy.' That didn't
faze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I said I was going to call his momma (Nancy). He
piped up and said, `Oh no, coach. Don't call my momma.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie said the advice he gets from his father rarely has
anything to do with the techniques and fundamentals of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad helps me more as a father,'' Reggie said. ``He tells me
to stay focused and do what is asked of me in football, in school
and in life. He talks to me more about the moral part of things
than football. Besides, he can't relate to the receiver position.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Reggie aren't the only athletes in the family.
Reggie's 21-year-old twin sisters _ Dawnyel and Shawntel _ run
track at Abilene Christian.
</P>
<P>
   But being a football player meant Reggie would be compared to
his dad. Still, he said he never has felt like he had to live up to
his father's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I've ever felt pressure about it,'' Reggie said.
``It was great to grow up with a dad that people knew. Old Cowboys
like Drew Pearson were always coming over to the house, and I got
to go to three Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But other than that, I always kind of did my own thing. My dad
and I are two different people, and he always told me I had big
enough shoes to pave my own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie's chance to shine is just beginning. After a stellar high
school career at Lake Highlands in Dallas, Newhouse played in all
11 games for Baylor last year as a true freshman, catching seven
passes for 77 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But he showed his potential in the season opener two weeks ago
at North Texas by catching five passes for 105 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good about my performance and feel like it's something
I can build on,'' Newhouse said. ``I had a lot to adjust to last
year, and I had my ups and downs. But it's starting to be second
nature to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse never played wide receiver until he arrived at Baylor
last year. He was following in his father's footsteps as a running
back in high school, but college recruiters believed his lanky
build better suited him to be a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Steele, the Baylor receivers coach and Kevin's brother, was
the first person on the Baylor staff to see Newhouse play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale saw in Reggie a very intelligent young man with a lot of
character,'' Kevin Steele said. ``Reggie also displayed a lot of
athleticism. He has real good body control, and he makes the hard
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing that excited us the most is his height. Before
Reggie got here, our coaches were taller than all our receivers, so
Reggie was a good fit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele knew Newhouse had a lot to learn about being a college
receiver, but he is amazed at how quickly Newhouse has adapted to
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of technical things about running pass
routes,'' Steele said. ``People think it's just run upfield 12
yards and do an out, but it's not. You have to counter what the
defense does, and there are different line splits depending on the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of stuff. One year later, not only does Reggie know
all three receiver spots, but he is telling the freshman receivers
where to line up.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele believes Newhouse will do a lot of good things at Baylor
before his college career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie is strong now,'' Steele said. ``But I really believe,
as he matures and gets stronger in the hips and legs, he's just
going to get better and better. He understands the game, and he has
a great desire to be the best he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steele knows the one thing people really want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know whether Reggie possesses the skills to do
what his dad did, but at a different position,'' Steele said.
``Reggie has the athleticism, he has the mind, and he has the work
ethic. If he continues to improve as much as he has since he first
got here, it wouldn't surprise me a bit for him to reach that
level.''

Toombs doing his duty as Texas A&AMP;M fullback
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ One block by a fullback during a game in which an
offense racks up 51 points and 490 yards normally isn't something
that would go into the memory bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the fullback was Ja'Mar Toombs, and the devastating block
led to a rushing touchdown for Texas A&AMP;M, so it was indeed
something to note.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs, the Aggies' 275-pound erstwhile tailback, cleared the
way for Richard Whitaker's 23-yard run early in a 51-3 win over
Wyoming last Saturday. As the game developed, Robert Ferguson's
seven catches for 174 yards and quarterback Mark Farris' 14-of-21,
two-touchdown game deserved to be the focal points.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs also bulled his way into the end zone twice during the
rout. Three days after the game, however, Toombs wanted to talk
more about his head-on block that sent Wyoming strong safety Lamar
James flying into the air like a Pop-Tart coming out of a toaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (block) was my favorite play,'' Toombs said Tuesday.
``I've thought about that more than the touchdowns. It's just good
to know that my block helped Richard get into the end zone. I guess
if I had messed it up, he wouldn't have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Whitaker: ``Once I saw that guy's legs go up in the air, I
didn't see anything but the end zone. I could have run forever. If
Ja'Mar keeps that attitude up the whole season, he's going to be
something.''
</P>
<P>
   For several reasons, Toombs' block was something to behold. Its
precision and ferocity offered an indication that Toombs has become
serious about improving the weak link of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs came into the season knowing he had to improve his
blocking. Out of necessity, Toombs was shifted to tailback in the
Aggies' final three games of 1999, and he gained 273 yards. Toombs
lobbied to play there this season, but the Aggies thought Whitaker
and Joe Weber were more suited to tailback because of their
breakaway potential.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs went back to fullback and was given orders to improve his
blocking. Aggies offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe said Toombs
was ``a below-average blocker'' last season.
</P>
<P>
   After two games, Kragthorpe likes what he's seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were rolling the ball down the alley, that one (the
block on James) was a strike,'' said Kragthorpe. ``He sent the guy
flying. I think Ja'Mar has improved as a blocker, and I think he
has accepted his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's going to get the ball in some situations, but in
other situations he's a glorified offensive guard. He knows there
are times when his role is to block for the guy who has the ball in
his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two games, Toombs' statistics are hardly eye-popping. He
has rushed 13 times for 25 yards and has three receptions for 30
yards. Against Wyoming however, Toombs had touchdowns of five and
one yard and rushed two other times for first downs in
short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   After the touchdowns, the Kyle Field fans unleashed their
droning ``Toooooooombs'' chant. Because of his off-field problems
last winter, Toombs wasn't sure he'd be part of that scene again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to hear that again, because I know some people
were against me,'' said Toombs. ``I was thinking about it. I was
wondering if they were actually going to chant it. I was wondering
if the `Toombs' were going to turn to boos. One good thing is I
guess I couldn't tell the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Toombs didn't have much time for levity. He
was arrested for driving under the influence in February, and since
he already was on probation from a marijuana possession conviction
in 1999, there was speculation Toombs would be dismissed from the
team. Instead, Aggies coach R.C. Slocum decided to give him another
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach,'' Slocum said when fall practice started, ``I have
to balance whether the young man is somebody that can salvaged, if
what he did is something that can be corrected, if he is showing
some accountability for his action. He's done all those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, his rope is shorter now than when he came here, and
he knows that. I don't anticipate any future problems out of
Ja'Mar.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans believed Toombs got off easy. Perhaps, but he spent
four days in Brazos County jail and is restricted to a 10 p.m.
curfew through December 2001. Toombs understands he has only one
more last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm maturing because of what I've been through,''
he said. ``One thing the people who turned on me maybe didn't
realize is that I'm 20 years old. Maybe I'm doing the same things
they did when they were 20. There's just more focus on me because
I'm at a big-time university playing big-time football. I know I
have to become more of a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to my family, my coach, my probation officer. I'm
going to get through this, and it could turn out to be a good
thing. I'm abiding by the rules now. (The curfew) is going to keep
me out of trouble. When it's over and done, going through this _
getting into trouble and getting out of trouble _ is going to help
me as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   From early indications, Toombs is winning all the on- and
off-field battles so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking tremendous pride in becoming a better blocker,''
said guard Chris Valletta. ``When you watch him tear into people,
it's almost scary. He can hurt you. He's a 275-pound guy with a
full head of steam taking out 180-pound guys. He's going to win
that battle.''

STATE PRICES FOR DIESEL, REGULAR GAS SET RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
 B (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRENT HOPKINS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Prices for regular gas and diesel fuel have hit
record levels in California and show little sign of noticeable
relief, analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The average price in the L.A. market for diesel fuel is $1.9889
per gallon, up from $1.7027 last month, according to the Automobile
Club of Southern California. This increase has put a stranglehold
on truckers, who can spend as much as $600 with each fill up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of fuel is running guys out of business,'' said
Eugene Green III, a long-haul trucker for Eagle Motor Freight out
of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The price of regular unleaded gas has also hit record levels,
though its increase over the last month hasn't been as dramatic as
the jump in diesel prices. AAA said the average price of regular
unleaded gas in California has hit a high of $1.85. In the Los
Angeles-Long Beach area, customers are shelling out $1.70 on
average, thanks to a 12-cent-a-gallon jump in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Relief won't come until later this fall, according to the
California Energy Commission. As the harvesting season comes to an
end, the agricultural sector will place less demand on the market,
spokesman Rob Schlichting said. Additionally, refinery problems
that held up production are starting to be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that for last week, production was 177,700
barrels a day, 15 percent more than the week before,'' Schlichting
said. ``They're starting to crank out more of the product, which
should bring the price down.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials say some buyers have resorted to hoarding
diesel in an attempt to avoid future price hikes, which could drain
supplies to very low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's a major crisis,'' said Bob van der Valk, fuel
supply and marketing manager for Cosby Oil, a fuel wholesaler in
Santa Fe Springs. ``We may even run out of diesel.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the oil business aren't as grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has done a pretty good job of supplying the
demand, though with increased cost,'' said Jim Huccaby, national
pricing manager for Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   This increased price is a result of three factors. The $35.50
per barrel price of crude oil, up $7 from a month ago, has driven
wholesale prices up. Second, West Coast refinery problems have
plagued the industry in recent months and reduced supply.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, increased reliance upon diesel plants for power
production in summer months further increased demand.
</P>
<P>
   While rising gas prices caused widespread alarm among motorists,
the impact of diesel's price hike has been less noticeable, van der
Valk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the gas shot up to $2, everybody wanted me to comment,''
he said. ``With diesel, there hasn't been even a whimper.''
</P>
<P>
   This hasn't been the case in Europe, where widespread outrage
over high fuel prices has spawned numerous protests. Truckers,
tour-operators and agricultural users have demonstrated both in the
United Kingdom and on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, truckers have yet to fight back against
the high prices. Instead, they just suffer in silence, hoping that
the cost will go back to reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
   In Castaic, where big rigs outnumber cars and diesel is the
lifeblood of drivers passing through on their way across the
country, emotions run high on the subject. Awaiting a load of
produce, Green frowned at the $2.03 per-gallon posted rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fill up here anymore, I try to have enough fuel so I
can get in, then get the hell out of California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For independent drivers without corporate credit cards to
bankroll their diesel expenditures, the rise is nothing short of
catastrophic. With two 150-gallon tanks to fill up for long
distance runs, independent drivers take a $600 hit each time they
head out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Salmeron, operating his own rig out of La Habra, said
that the high price for fuel has him fighting for his livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a battle,'' he said, cleaning off his hub cabs
while waiting for the his tank to fill. ``If it gets worse, I can
try to raise the rates a little bit, but it won't really help.''
</P>
<P>
   If the high cost of transportation, which has also hit air
carriers and railroads, continues, it will likely appear in higher
prices for the goods shipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably won't notice it, but you'll see anybody who
relies on transportation to pass it on in price increases,'' said
Jack Kyser, senior economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.

NORTHRIDGE'S ROBERSON MAKING MOST OF SECOND CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joseph Roberson sat in the locker room at Air
Force's Falcon Stadium before the season opener and couldn't help
but laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge senior found it difficult to accept
reality: He was playing college football ... at 28 ... as a
starting defensive end ... in a stadium packed with more than
50,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   It really was laughable in light of the road he took to get
there, a road he said included physical and mental abuse as a
child, countless street fights, a stint in jail, the birth of his
daughter and no football experience at the high school level.
</P>
<P>
   That's also how his friends (whom he calls associates) reacted
when he told them five years ago that he wanted to go to college to
earn a degree and play football.
</P>
<P>
   They're not laughing now: Not only does Roberson have a
sociology degree _ which he earned in the spring _ he's working
toward his master's in either sociology or psychology and plans to
earn his doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   He also earned a partial athletic scholarship for the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was a challenge for me,'' Roberson said. ``When I
first told my peers _ many of whom are locked up now _ they laughed
at me and told jokes. They thought it was funny. They thought it
was a passing idea _ that it was flighty.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson is anything but flighty.
</P>
<P>
   His 3.85 grade-point average is the highest on the football team
and no one doubts he'll complete his education with that doctorate.
However, he has something more important that keeps him focused:
namely, his 6-year-old daughter, Kyla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great daughter,'' Roberson said. ``I'll do anything
with her. I'll play with Barbies and stuff. I go to the park with
her and get on the swings. I didn't have the opportunity to do
those things as a kid. Even now, I'm just a kid at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He's no kid on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson, who's 6-foot-2 and 240 pounds, played sparingly last
season but has blossomed into a solid pass rusher. He had five
tackles, including a sack, in Air Force's 55-6 victory and no
tackles in CSUN's 19-13 overtime win over Southwest Texas State on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Dave Robinson attributed Roberson's
emergence in part to his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a maturity to the team because he's older,''
Robinson said. ``He's been through life a little bit. He
understands. He listens. He does what the coaches ask him to do. He
doesn't do any free-lance stuff. He works hard and gets everyone
else to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson has to work hard, particularly at the little things,
because of his relative lack of experience. For example, he asks
Robinson to translate terminology after practice sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from two seasons at Pierce College, his experience in
athletics pre-CSUN was limited to pickup basketball games _ in
which Roberson said he earned quite a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He said circumstances simply made it impossible for him to play
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family situation really didn't allow for it,'' Roberson
said. ``I had five little brothers and sisters and I had a lot of
responsibilities and had things to do around the house. Finances
didn't allow for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finances didn't allow for food sometimes. And he said he never
had new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as food, it seemed normal at the time,'' Roberson said.
``Now I understand what's reasonable. (It happened) quite often.
But that's life. I'm not hungry now.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson's problems started early in life with the abuse, he
said, while he lived in Buffalo. N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years it made me bitter,'' Roberson said. ``I still
have a lot of emotions inside tied up to it. It probably had a lot
to do with me picking psychology and sociology as my major _ trying
to understand the behavior of certain individuals and what
influence society had on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson moved to California when he was 19. He lived with an
aunt he didn't know well but he didn't stay long. He wasn't
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give you an idea of the people I chose to associate with:
One is now on death row, one has 23 years, one has nine years, one
got life, I think, and one is married,'' Roberson said. ``Those
were my associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just the environment I put myself in. I was 19. I
didn't have any direction and no guidance. That's the environment I
felt most comfortable in. I was more comfortable on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson said he was convicted of grand theft auto and forgery
and spent several months in jail, a situation in which he says
he'll never again find himself because of Kyla, who lives nearby
with her mother, Ginger Beebe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is the greatest blessing in the world,'' Roberson
said. ``My relationship with her does more for me than anything
I've ever done for her. She gave me something to miss. After I came
(to California), I was very detached. I didn't have direction.
There was nothing I enjoyed about life or being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson married Beebe shortly after Kyla was born but they
recently divorced. Beebe has temporary custody of Kyla and Roberson
has visitation rights while the two battle in court for permanent
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe declined to comment, other than to say: ``I wouldn't be a
good person to say anything good about him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson has another custody hearing Sept. 25. He has no
attorney because he said he can't afford one.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Jeff Kearin offered to testify as a character witness
for his player and he wrote the judge a letter. Kearin said
Roberson told him his life story first before he asked whether he
could join the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is what this program aspires to be,'' Kearin said. ``He's a
hard worker and he graduated. Joseph Roberson is doing it the right
way. He's taking care of school and he's taking care of his family.
He has had life experiences I'll never have.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson's experiences in court are ones he'd rather not endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's traumatic every time I walk into that court
house,'' Roberson said. ``There's a man sitting here (Beebe's
attorney) who's intent is basically to disparage me. And I
understand that. That's his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I walk in with my cornrows and I don't have a suit. I
understand the reality of that situation. But no matter what people
say, it doesn't justify their stereotypes. ... I don't think I've
slept one good night while this thing has been going on.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is one that hasn't gone unnoticed by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works harder than a lot of people here and they don't even
have the situations that he has,'' said linebacker Cos Abercrombie.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson is proud of the choices he's made to get his life back
on track. He doesn't know what he wants to do for a living, only
that he wants to help people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has their problems,'' Roberson said. ``Mine was low
self-esteem. I want to help people and tell them that somehow, some
way they can accomplish their goals. There is a way for every
person. They don't have to give up. If I did it, anyone is capable
of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed again. &QL;

SUSPENDED TROJAN INJURED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive end John Cousins remains suspended
from the team, but the junior college transfer is also recovering
from having the tip of a finger cut off in a ``non-football
related'' injury.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Cousins hurt his finger when a door
slammed on his hand the weekend of the USC-Penn State game. The
fact he suffered the injury clearly irritated USC coach Paul
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go off and do your own thing,'' Hackett said. ``When
we come back from the game, all of a sudden he's injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins' suspension was related in part to missing appointments
following the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get his act together and get cleared to come
back,'' Hackett said. ``There's nothing that's preventing him from
coming back to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins was not on the sideline during USC's victory over
Colorado. It's also usual policy for injured players to watch
practice from the sideline, but Cousins has not been present.
</P>
<P>
   NO SECOND GUESSING: Hackett said he did not regret going for a
field goal on fourth-and-1 in the first quarter from the 13-yard
line against Colorado. Kicker David Newbury badly missed his
attempt and the Trojans came away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing was we had played extremely hard and extremely well
and I didn't want to come away with no points after two drives,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   USC's previous drive ended when a sure touchdown pass was
dropped by Kareem Kelly and intercepted by Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me we would miss the field goal,''
Hackett added. ``I think I would make the same decision again.''
</P>
<P>
   USC failed to convert a third-and-1 play before the missed field
goal. On that play, it did not use its short-yardage offense
featuring tackle Faaesea Mailo at fullback, an attempt to fool
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   SECONDARY SHUFFLE: Cornerback Kris Richard (sprained knee) said
he expects to play in the San Jose State game Sept. 23, but whether
he is cleared to play by team doctors or coaches is yet to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready, but how they'll feel, I don't know,'' Richard
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Richard can't play, sophomore Kevin Arbet will start at left
cornerback with Darrell Rideaux and Chris Cash continuing to split
time at right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to play Kevin. He's earned the right to
play,'' secondary coach Dennis Thurman said. &QL;

 DAVIS SIGNS MANDATORY LIFE JACKET MEASURE  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Water-skiers, personal watercraft users and boat
passengers 11 years of age or under will be required to wear life
jackets starting Jan. 1 under a bill signed Tuesday by Gov. Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory life jacket bill is a big change. Water-skiers and
personal watercraft users don't have to wear flotation devices now,
and only kids 6 or younger are required to wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever been on a jet ski you know how dangerous it
is,'' said the bill's author, Assemblywoman Marilyn Brewer,
R-Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was one of dozens signed by the Democratic governor,
who has 17 days to dispose of roughly 1,000 measures sent to him by
the Legislature in the days before its August 31 adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Personal watercraft users also will be able to take a voluntary
safety course the state will develop under another bill signed by
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   And in a nod to the state's small wineries, Davis signed a bill
allowing them to peddle their wares at farmers' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's life jacket bill prohibits anyone from operating a
motorboat, sailboat or a vessel 26 feet long or smaller unless
every person age 11 or under is wearing a life jacket.
</P>
<P>
   All water-skiers and personal watercraft operators must wear
life jackets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state Department of Boating and Waterways said that
30 of the 58 victims of boating fatalities were not wearing life
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Like California, 33 states kids to wear life vests. Forty-three
states already order personal watercraft users to wear life
jackets. Nineteen require them for water-skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 954,000 vessels registered in California, some
171,000 are personal watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   The safety course is aimed at reducing accidents among the
growing number of personal watercraft users.
</P>
<P>
   Various voluntary boater education programs are already
available in California. The boating and waterways department will
place its new safety course on its Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone convicted of one boating violation would be required to
pass the course to qualify for a license.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis vetoed a bill that would have required all
boaters to pass a written safety test.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little evidence that a written test alone will
improve the piloting skills of motor boat operators or reduce
boating accidents,'' Davis said in his veto message.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S Coast Guard has found that 80 percent of the boat
operators involved in accidents have no boater training.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that
California and other states approve mandatory boater education to
decrease the number of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the voluntary training bill, Davis reiterated his
opposition to universal boater safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   Another law signed by Davis makes it illegal, in those cities or
counties banning alcohol in public parks, simply to possess an
alcoholic beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the law only outlawed drinking the alcohol.

PLEA BARGAIN IN SLAYING OF YOSEMITE NATURALIST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cary Stayner has struck a deal to plead guilty Wednesday to the
grisly slaying of a Yosemite naturalist in exchange for being
spared a federal execution _ but that doesn't preclude the
possibility of a death sentence if convicted of the earlier,
separate killings of three sightseers.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old motel handyman agreed to life in prison without
parole in exchange for the plea he will enter in federal court in
Fresno this afternoon, said sources close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner originally pleaded not guilty in August 1999 to federal
charges including murder, kidnapping and attempted aggravated
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both Stayner's family and that of the woman he
allegedly beheaded last year, 26-year-old Joie Armstrong, were
reportedly eager for the plea deal. They want to avoid the ordeal
of what promises to be a months-long trial at best, complete with
sordid details of Armstrong's killing and the possible necessity
for relatives from both families to testify, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, investigators and Stayner's attorneys said they
could not discuss details of the plea, but they promised a press
conference Wednesday after the court hearing before federal Judge
Anthony Ishii.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's plea bargain won't be made final until a formal
sentencing hearing is held before the judge, probably about two
months from now. After that, the case can proceed on state charges
accusing him of killing Yosemite sightseers Carole Sund, 42, her
daughter Juli,CQ &LR;  15, and their friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, of
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   And though no pleas have been entered or court dates set in the
Sund-Pelosso case, prosecutors are anxious to get going the moment
the federal matter is resolved, said Mariposa County Sheriff's Lt.
Brian Muller. The Armstrong killing is federal because it occurred
inside Yosemite, but the others happened just outside the park
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the federal government is ready to release Mr.
Stayner into our custody, we believe we will be fully ready for
trial,'' said Muller, spokesman for the county sheriff's and
district attorney's offices.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plea deal has no bearing on county prosecutors'
plans to seek the death penalty. Relatives of the Sund and Pelosso
families vary on whether they want Stayner executed or locked away
for life.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman reportedly confessed to a reporter and
investigators to killing all four women after he was captured by
police at a Sacramento-area nudist lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who took children on nature hikes in Yosemite, was
killed in the national park a few hundred feet from her cabin. She
evidently put up a ferocious fight, and her head was found about 40
feet from her body, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund's mother, Carole Carrington of Eureka, said Tuesday
that she was not surprised by the plea deal.
</P>
<P>
   `'He didn't seem to have much choice,'' she said. ``I think it's
probably a good thing for Joie's family. We're good friends with
them, and I know her mother, Leslie, was not looking forward to the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial fund in Armstrong's name established at the Yosemite
National Institutes has raised $177,000 so far, and this year
funded its first group of 10 young women to do wilderness study at
the park, said spokeswoman Tanya Grasser. She said the mood was
calm but somber among Armstrong's many friends and co-workers
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just really focusing on the positive, keeping Joie's
legacy going,'' said Grasser. ``In her time here she touched so
many children, and we try to remember that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before his name was connected with the murder spree that
filled Yosemite with terror during the spring and summer of 1999,
Cary Stayner's family had made other national headlines. His
brother, Steven Stayner, was kidnapped in Merced as a young boy in
1972 and dramatically resurfaced seven years later after escaping
his abductor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Stayner died in 1989 at 24 in an auto accident, but Cary
Stayner was said to have never fully recovered from roiling
emotions associated with the disappearance and subsequent
glorification of his brother.

MISSOURI DRUNKEN-DRIVING LAW LETS MINORS KEEP LICENSES, COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Missouri law designed to get tougher on
minors who drink and drive actually allows young offenders to keep
their licenses in some instances, an appeals court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And if that ruling stands, critics said, it would allow drivers
under 21 protection from police stops that adults who drive drunk
do not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an absurd result,'' said Springfield Rep. Craig Hosmer,
``a strange reading of the statute.'' He sponsored Missouri's 1996
zero-tolerance law, aimed at stopping underage drinking and
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling dealt with the fine distinction between
how the state enforces drunken-driving laws for minors and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The zero-tolerance law allows the state to use a civil action to
suspend licenses of minors who drive with alcohol contents above
0.02. But it also says police must have probable cause such as a
driving violation to stop the underage driver.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 case under appeal, the judges ruled there was no
probable cause to stop the young driver, who was legally
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Adults who drive drunk can lose their licenses through civil
actions when stopped for any reason, lawyers said. The civil action
is intended to provide sure punishment to many who escape
drunken-driving convictions because of plea bargains or evidence
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court in Kansas City reversed a Gentry County judge.
Albany police in 1998 stopped Jimmy D. Ballard, who was 20 at the
time, for squealing his truck tires and found he was drunk. His
blood alcohol content was 0.135 _ above the legal limit of 0.02 for
minors and 0.10 for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reason for the stop _ the squealing tires _ was not
sufficient for police to stop Ballard under the zero-tolerance law,
the appeals court ruled. Another state law allows a similar stop
for adult drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon said his office would appeal
the three-judge panel's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The decision raises questions about whether drunken minors could
even be arrested at sobriety check points, Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have always intended to punish drunken minors more
because they are drinking illegally and driving illegally, Nixon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that breaking two separate laws would get you a
benefit is not what anyone had in mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce B. Brown, Ballard's attorney, said the ruling was the
right interpretation of the law and is a good test case for the
Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ordered the Missouri Department of Revenue to
reinstate Ballard's license, but Ballard has already served a
30-day license suspension on the civil action. Brown wants the
suspension off Ballard's driving record.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ballard, now 22, did not receive a criminal
conviction for drunken driving. Ballard could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, state officials said they know of no legal challenges
to a law intended to crack down on teen-age drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas law applies to drivers under age 21. If they are
caught driving with blood-alcohol levels of 0.02 percent to 0.08
percent, their licenses are suspended for one year. Under the law,
the basic drunken-driving limit standard is 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri authorities do not know how many cases may be affected
by Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Waylene Hiles, an attorney with the Department of Revenue, said
the ruling would not change the department's position that regular
laws for adults apply to underage drivers with blood alcohol
contents of 0.10 or above.
</P>
<P>
   Her office will wait for the Missouri Supreme Court to clarify
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, action could come in Jefferson City. Hosmer said he
would introduce legislation next year to fix the problems caused by
``strained readings'' of the zero-tolerance law.
</P>
<P>
   The system will work as intended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court corrects our mistakes,'' Hosmer said, ``and we
correct the court's mistakes.''

 BILL TO SANCTION BOY SCOUTS FACES LIKELY DEFEAT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders will bring Rep. Lynn
Woolsey's bill to revoke the congressional charter of the Boy
Scouts of America to a vote Wednesday, fully expecting its
resounding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Tex., blasted the California
Democrat's bill Tuesday, calling it an ``an unjustified, despicable
attack'' that was ``part of a campaign by radical extremists to
intimidate the Boy Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I scheduled this bill to demonstrate the lack of support for
those who have declared open season on the Boy Scouts,'' Armey
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey introduced her ``Scouting for All Act'' after the
Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 on June 28 that the Constitution permits
the Boy Scouts to ban gays from leadership positions, under the
First Amendment's protection of ``expressive association.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey's measure would revoke a congressional charter for the
Boy Scouts dating from 1916. Such honorific charters are given to
distinguish organizations with a patriotic, educational or
charitable purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the bill, Woolsey said ``there is nothing
charitable or patriotic about intolerance,'' adding that she wanted
to ``send a message to the Boy Scouts and to all Americans that the
Congress of the United States does not support intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that revoking the charter would not cut off federal
funding for the scouts or change the organization's tax status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what some on the other side of the aisle claim,''
she said, ``I'm not saying the Boy Scouts are bad; I'm saying
intolerance is.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey's bill has just eight co-sponsors, down from nine after
civil rights icon John Lewis, D-Georgia, removed his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty confident that we'll have an enormous vote
opposed to this bill,'' said Armey spokeswoman Michelle Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruling has unleashed a torrent of debate over
the public role of the Boy Scouts. This week, the Lafayette City
Council discussed whether members should appear officially at
Scouting events, and in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the city commission
refused to grant the Boy Scouts $10,000 of public money after five
hours of emotional discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has also spilled over to the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Woolsey sent a letter to President Clinton, signed by
Bay Area Democrats George Miller of Martinez, Barbara Lee of
Oakland and Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, urging him to resign his
position as honorary head of the Boy Scouts to protest its policy
against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not respond to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, the Interior Department began examining whether
Boy Scout Jamborees held on federal lands violated an executive
order from Clinton _ issued just five days before the Supreme Court
decision _ banning discrimination against gays in federal education
and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, called on
the administration to drop the probe. Democratic nominee Al Gore's
spokesman, Doug Hattaway, said that ``in a Gore administration, Boy
Scouts will be allowed to use federal land.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, Attorney General Janet Reno issued a statement
finding that the federal government does not have to sever its ties
with the Boy Scouts, because the executive order applied only to
programs run by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts are working in national parks _ including Point
Reyes National Seashore in Woolsey's district _ to help eradicate
exotic species, remove litter and improve trails and campsites.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey took the name for her bill after Boy Scouts for All, a
group founded by Petaluma teenager Stephen Cozza that sought to
change the organization's policy toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 nonprofit groups currently hold congressional charters,
including the American Legion, the Daughters of the American
Revolution and the National Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional charters convey no benefits and do not signify
government approval, but they are often used by organizations as a
badge of prestige. Congress placed a moratorium on new charters in
1992, although that moratorium has been bypassed several times in
recent years.

 BE CAREFUL OPENING THAT BUBBLY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napa, Calif., is standing on shaky ground,
according to a geophysicist named John Boatwright, which raises
some questions. Such as:
</P>
<P>
   How is it that a guy who studies the ground has a name like
Boatwright? Isn't that like being a sailor named Farmer?
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's paper, Boatwright said that Napa's soil is loose,
and that a magnitude 7 quake could ``shake up Napa to pieces ...
This should be a wake-up call for people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake-up call? With that kind of news, who in Napa will ever
sleep again?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds more like a move-out call. It's hard to imagine what
kind of structure could withstand a quake on those shaky grapy
acres. Except ... a boat!
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you dig your swimming pool a little larger, drop in a
live-aboard yacht, and turn the house into a B and B.
</P>
<P>
   Boatwright. Suddenly it all makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   I'VE SEEN fire and I've seen rain.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not a lead-in to another clever item about Firestone
tires.
</P>
<P>
   The item is this: James Taylor the singer has bought a condo on
Jones St. and will be moving in, at least part-time.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Baby James is a good pal of Robin Williams. About two
years ago, superstar tenor Andrea Bocelli was booked to sing at a
big fight-cancer fund-raiser in San Francisco. He scratched at the
last minute with a sore throat.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams got the 911 call and agreed to help fill in, and
he persuaded Taylor to fly in and sing with Bocelli's symphony
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Taylor were a smash, James fell in love with the
city, and here he is.
</P>
<P>
   I hope James rides Muni a lot, and sings. It would do a lot to
cheer up the troops.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T WAIT for the movie that's sure to be made about that
Colombian cocaine-smuggling submarine that authorities stumbled
upon in mid-construction.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the submarine scheme was worth taking seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why worry?'' Randy Elwood wonders. ``As the article points
out, the sub was being built from Russian plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme music for the movie, of course, would be the Beatles'
``Yellow Submarine.'' Or ``Let It Snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Reader Doc flashes back to ``Run Silent, Run Deep'' and can
almost see ``Burt Lancaster and Clark Gable and 11 tons of blow,
headin' for the Bongo Straits.''
</P>
<P>
   I've got two working titles for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Silent, Run Deep, Run Nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Das Toot Boot.''
</P>
<P>
   BLENDING SMOOTHLY into the next sea-worthy item:
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' ticket department is under siege for playoffs and
World Series ducats.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Sullivan, the team's ticket czar, got a phone call from a
woman who runs a party-planning business in Marin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any games in early October?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The woman explained that the aircraft carrier Constellation will
be steaming into the Bay around that time for Fleet Week and she
would love to arrange for some of the sailors to take in a
ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, how many?'' Sullivan asked, warily.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5,500,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan spit out a mouthful of Coke, the official drink of the &QL; 
Gigantes.
</P>
<P>
   For a World Series game, the giants  &UR; might  &LR; be able to squeeze
an admiral or two into the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan suggested to the woman that maybe the ship could tie up
in McCovey Cove and the sailors could sit on deck and watch the
game from over the ballpark's right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   AND CAN you imagine what McCovey Cove will look like if the
Giants make it to the Series?
</P>
<P>
   Traffic will be barnacle to barnacle.
</P>
<P>
   BE CAREFUL today, please.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the 101st anniversary of the first
death-by-automobile accident, and you don't want to mess with fate.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13 of 1899, Henry Bliss was helping a woman step off a
trolley in New York City when he was killed by a speeding taxi.
</P>
<P>
   The stunned citizens learned a valuable lesson. Henry's act is
the last known instance of anyone being courteous on a New York
City street.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, did you know that there has not been a day
without a traffic fatality in California in more than 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   LESS SERIOUSLY, Buffalo Bills' quarterback Rob Johnson got
slammed around Sunday, suffered a concussion and later said, ``I
was clear-headed, I was just seeing different colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey. Is it possible that all the red-light runners in San
Francisco are present or former 49ers quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING for Willie and the Supes to ponder:
</P>
<P>
   In Finland, relates reader Kevin Friel, the size of a traffic
fine is dictated by the offender's income.
</P>
<P>
   A dot-com millionaire (in other words, just starting out) who
was cited for driving his Ferrari recklessly through Helsinki was
fined $44,100.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem with that law here: Some of these dot-com firms are
losing millions a day. Huge losses can be the sign of major
success.
</P>
<P>
   But if one of these guys runs a red light, the city might have
to pay  &UR; him &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   WHY CAN'T adults enjoy pinatas, too? That was a philosophical
question posed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A woman caller says that such objects do exist. She says that a
woman she knows had a penis pinata at her bachelorette party.
</P>
<P>
   And I suppose that's someone's idea of humor?

DEVELOPER PLANS LUXURY CONDOS IN DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City architect on Tuesday announced
plans to convert the Kansas City Club building downtown into a
luxury condominium complex.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would save the 14-story, Tudor Gothic structure from
mothballs and would add a dash of luxury living to downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Thomas R. Nolte said he would lead an investment
group, which plans to buy the building at 1228 Baltimore Ave.,
renovate the entire structure and convert five floors into as many
as 20 upscale condominium units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly one of the jewels in the crown of Kansas City,
and we intend to keep it that way,'' Nolte said.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation program could cost $12 million, but Nolte does
not plan to ask for tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The condominiums would carry a minimum price of $300,000, with
the ultimate cost depending on how fancy the buyer wants to get.
Improvements could add at least $100,000 to the price, Nolte said.
</P>
<P>
   The building would continue to house the Kansas City Club, but
the private dining club on the top floor would be replaced by a
public restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant operator has not been selected, Nolte said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte's renovation plan would rescue the Kansas City Club from a
costly prospect: spending a fortune to restore its building while
coping with a declining membership.
</P>
<P>
   E. Wynn Presson, vice chairman of Health Midwest and president
of the Kansas City Club, said the club's membership had shrunk to
900 from its peak of 2,200 in the 1980s. Membership dues average
$90 a month, club officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Club has been caught in the same vise as many
other private clubs across the country that have suffered big
declines in membership.
</P>
<P>
   As the club's membership declined, its building's problems were
swelling. The building has outdated plumbing and air-conditioning
systems, it doesn't comply with laws regulating access for the
disabled and it has asbestos in some nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which had been a bastion for executives for nearly
80 years, had become a financial sinkhole for its members.
</P>
<P>
   Presson said the club's board had concluded it would need as
much as $5 million to cure the ailments afflicting the old
building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the club needed to spruce up the 65 hotel rooms
that the building offered to members for wedding parties and for
out-of-town guests. That would push the total renovation cost to
$12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Spending that much on the rooms didn't make sense because
occupancy was 17 percent in 1999, club officials said. As a
nonprofit group, the club doesn't advertise its hotel space, so
filling it was difficult, Presson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With declining membership and prohibitive costs and rather
limited resources, the only other alternative was to seek another
location in downtown,'' Presson said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the club had begun to scour downtown for new
space when Nolte's surprise proposal came, Presson said. The
architect said he would convert the hotel space on floors seven
through 11 into luxury condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte's group would buy the building for $1. The Kansas City
Club would then lease the health club, administrative office and
lobby space for 20 years with options that could extend its
occupancy for up to 100 years, Nolte said.
</P>
<P>
   With the low-cost purchase, Nolte inherits the high-dollar
headaches of renovating the building. Nolte estimates that the
renovation of the basic systems in the building could cost as much
as $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte and the club are still negotiating the final terms of the
agreement and have set a six-month deadline to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to save the building would not rely on incentives or
tax credits from local or state governments, Nolte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes too long to get them,'' said Nolte, who is a member
of the Lenexa (Kan.) City Council. ``And we don't want the
government as partners in the project, and we don't need the (tax
breaks).''
</P>
<P>
   The housing would add a dash of flair to the downtown market,
which is primarily focused on apartments for young professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a thing whose time has come,'' said Roger
Buford, who has developed hundreds of apartments downtown. ``To
those people who would spend $1 million for a house in Hallbrook, a
$500,000 condo in downtown is a pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The downtown housing market, powered by loft conversions, has
exploded during the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lebofsky, a development specialist for the City Planning
and Development Department, said 398 loft units had been added
between 1995 and 1999. And developers have 406 units under
construction for the area bounded by the Missouri River, Union
Station, Broadway and Troost Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte said he had not presold any of the units proposed for the
Kansas City Club building. He said he had strong interest from one
potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kay Barnes said the project would be good for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a strong proponent for increasing housing
opportunities in downtown,'' Barnes said. ``I'm very grateful for
this exciting new venture.''

DICKINSON THEATRES AS CENTER OF DISPUTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ News that Dickinson Theatres was being sold
came as a big surprise, said Bob Goodrich of Goodrich Quality
Theatres Inc., who contends that he had the right of first refusal
to buy what remained of Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson officials announced last week that the Mission,
Kan.-based company was being sold to three members of its
management: John Hartley, Ron Horton and Brett Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, whose company is in Michigan, said he gained the right
of first refusal for five years when he bought 10 theaters
comprising 60 screens from Dickinson in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Goodrich said, he had wanted to buy the company. But
at the last minute, he said, Wood Dickinson changed his mind and
sold only some of the theaters to him.
</P>
<P>
   Because he still was interested in buying all or parts of what
was left, Goodrich said, he negotiated for a five-year right of
first refusal clause on properties that Dickinson owned at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid a lot of money for what I bought and for the
opportunity to buy the rest,'' Goodrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Bayer, an attorney with Morrison &AMP; Hecker in Kansas
City, who represents Dickinson, said Goodrich was ``100 percent
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's simply incorrect in terms of what he thought he was
negotiating,'' Bayer said. ``The bottom line is that Mr. Goodrich
needs to go back and look at what the (1999 agreement) says.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayer said there were provisions that would have given Goodrich
right of first refusal on the sale of certain assets, but that the
sale of Dickinson was a stock transaction, not an asset sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a change in ownership of the company,'' Bayer said.
``The right of first refusal does not apply to the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say that whatever rights and obligations existed in the
original agreement with Goodrich continue under Dickinson's new
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich said he'd been in touch with Dickinson officials
regularly since the 1999 transaction, including about six months
ago when the company said it was looking at ways to refinance some
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of had taken for granted that there might be talk about
the sale of assets,'' Goodrich said. ``I didn't realize that their
focus was a leveraged buyout by management _ I was assured that
they would keep me apprised of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bayer said he hoped that it didn't come down to legal
action, ``but if it does, the bottom line is that we think he's
wrong, and we are prepared to vigorously defend our position.''

 COMMERCIAL GILL-NETTING BANNED ALONG MUCH OF CALIFORNIA COAST  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an unprecedented move, state regulators have
closed much of the California coast to commercial gill-net fishing
to protect endangered seabirds and marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made Monday by the California Department of
Fish and Game after agency biologists determined that commercial
gill nets were inflicting substantial harm to common murres _ a
seabird _ and the southern sea otter.
</P>
<P>
   The closure covers all the areas where it is still legal and
practical to gill-net for halibut, including all of Monterey Bay
and waters off parts of Marin County, the entire San Francisco
Peninsula and portions of Santa Barbara County.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order allows commercial fishermen to set gill nets
in water deeper than 360 feet, the nature of gill-net gear and the
configuration of California's offshore sea floor make it
impractical to fish at such depths.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing industry officials said the order would be devastating
to the state's remaining gill-net fishery. ``It's basically going
to put these guys out of business,'' said Michael Stiller,
president of the Santa Cruz Commercial Fishermen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen commercial boats gill-net for halibut in the
affected waters. Gill nets are wide-meshed nets that are generally
weighted on the bottom. As fish try to swim through them, their
gill plates are entangled in the mesh, entrapping them.
</P>
<P>
   The closure comes at the end of the summer season, when most
halibut are caught in California waters. It will be in effect for
120 days and will then be reviewed. At that time, regulators can
either modify the order or make the closure permanent.
</P>
<P>
   A public meeting on the closure will be held by Fish and Game
from 4 to 6 p.m. Sept. 18 at Seaside City Hall in Monterey County.
</P>
<P>
   The closure comes after studies by state and federal biologists
concluded that the commercial gill-net fleet was entangling and
drowning large numbers of both common murres and otters.
</P>
<P>
   Murres have undergone steep declines in recent years because of
oil spills and warm water currents that have reduced the fish they
prefer to eat. To counter the trend, state biologists are
attempting to encourage new nesting colonies on coastside cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sea otters _ cuddly looking marine predators that grace T-shirts
and sweatshirts at gift shops all along the California coast _ have
also dropped in numbers during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The closure is likely to fuel the controversy over commercial
fishing in national marine sanctuaries. Offshore waters from Marin
to Monterey counties constitute the Gulf of the Farallones, Cordell
Bank and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   The closure is the most restrictive measure the state has ever
taken over the problem of ``bycatch'' _ the capture of nontarget
species. Restrictions on commercial fishing over bycatch are
extremely unusual. The last major bycatch decision by the Fish and
Game Department occurred about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined that gill-netters fishing in shallow water were
killing about 80 to 100 otters a year, so we made them move to
beyond 30 fathoms (180 feet),'' said David Bunn, a deputy director
for Fish and Game.
</P>
<P>
   But bycatch closures may become increasingly common as
environmentalists sue to protect threatened wildlife species.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's closure followed lengthy evaluation of the
situation by state biologists, it also appears to have been at
least partially motivated by a notice of intent to sue by the
Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group known for
its lawsuits on behalf of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
recommended use restrictions on 5.4 million acres of land to
protect the California red-legged frog. That decision was driven by
a court order that resulted from a Center for Biological Diversity
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Cummings, an attorney for the center, said his group
wants to make certain only ``clean fisheries'' are allowed off the
California coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a fundamental level, we believe there should be no bycatch
of endangered or threatened species,'' Cummings said. ``There may
be situations where certain types of nets are appropriate in
certain places, but generally hook-and-line fisheries, such as
salmon trolling, (are preferable).''
</P>
<P>
   From a larger perspective, said Cummings, a hard look must be
taken at commercial fishing in national marine sanctuaries, such as
the waters off Monterey Bay and the San Francisco Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``A marine sanctuary is pretty hollow if commercial fishing is
allowed,'' said Cummings, who also said his group doesn't have a
problem with recreational angling.
</P>
<P>
   News of the closure did not sit well with commercial fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reactive rather than a proactive way of managing
fisheries,'' said Mike Ricketts, a Monterey area crab, salmon and
albacore commercial fisherman and a board member of the Pacific
Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, a commercial fishing
lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Ricketts said gill-netters have taken some murres and otters,
``but the impact can't be that great, considering how few boats are
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part of these indiscriminate closures is that they
force fishermen to go after other (fish) species, which results in
more closures, and ultimately, fishermen losing their
livelihoods,'' said Ricketts. ``When we eliminate fisheries, we
eliminate fishermen.''

SCHMID UPSET WITH GALAXY'S ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, fed up with the
players' effort in Monday's workout at the Rose Bowl, cut practice
30 minutes short. Schmid then held a team meeting before heading to
Tampa Bay for the opening of Thursday's first-round, best-of-three
playoff series against the Mutiny at Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is next Wednesday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that lost its last two games, home-field advantage
and the Western Division regular-season title to Kansas City, it's
no time to start losing focus as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone has to bring an effort and they're not
bringing it,'' said Schmid. ``We have to train better than this or
we're not going to be around very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman was upset he didn't get a full
workout in. Hartman didn't mention names, but it appears that Cobi
Jones and Luis Hernandez _ the players expected to lead this team
to a championship if it's going to happen _ are the focus of their
teammates' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hasn't scored since July 8 and has been criticized by
Schmid for his shoddy play. If Jones is going through the motions,
it's probably because he has his sights set on playing in France
next season if the MLS doesn't agree to the five-year, $5 million
contract he asked for earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has scored only four goals in 17 MLS games, seems
eager for the season to end. When it's over, he will be loaned to
Club America of the Mexican first division.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to show their pride because I get pretty
disappointed about losing games,'' said Hartman. ``It seems people
are looking toward the future, the future and future. As a
professional, you have to come out and perform every day. We
haven't had that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Sigi is having this meeting. There is going to be a
lot of stuff people don't want to hear, but it's time they hear it.
Maybe it will wake us all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jones' problems developed when he returned to midfield,
but with striker Sasha Victorine gone to the Olympics, Schmid
paired Jones and Hernandez on the front line during training
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cobi and Luis have to get themselves involved,'' said
Schmid. ``And it's not so much the rest of the team getting them
involved, they need to be aggressive and get themselves involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be the key to this series. If they're active, they
will create problems for Tampa's defense. But it's up to them. They
need to bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   NO SHOOTOUTS: There are no more shootouts in the playoffs to
decide games that end in ties. MLS decided to use the points system
_ the same system used in the regular season. Teams get three
points for a win and one for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   The first team to compile five or six points (win and two ties,
or two wins), advances to the next round. If the series ends even
on points, the two teams will play two 10-minute sudden death
overtime periods following the conclusion of the third game. If the
game is still tied, penalty kicks will decide the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the MLS likes the idea of third games,'' said
Schmid. ``Personally, I think if you tie and win in your first two
games you should (advance).'' &QL;

REFINERS ARE KEY FACTOR IN FUEL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Although the industrialized world's attention
is mostly focused on the rising price of oil, the bigger problem
for American consumers promises to be the tightness of refining
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage and policy pronouncements imply that if the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would just
increase oil production enough, the threat of higher prices for
gasoline and heating oil would be ameliorated.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow developments in the trade and financial
journals get a more comprehensive picture. It's a picture showing
that no matter how much OPEC boosts output, there doesn't seem to
be enough slack in the refining system to create much relief for
U.S. consumers. Even if there were, Big Oil's stockpiles wouldn't
be adequate to produce enough additional gasoline or heating oil to
affect prices.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis in The Wall Street Journal, for example, noted
that so far this year the average weekly output of U.S. refiners
has been at 96 percent of industry production capacity. Meanwhile,
the behavior of crude prices this year has discouraged stockpiling
of extra petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the seeds of the current situation actually were
sown late last year. Kyle Cooper, who follows the market for
Salomon Smith Barney, explained the situation this way: After
OPEC's earlier production cuts began to translate into a price
spiral, U.S. refiners worked on the assumption that it was a
temporary phenomenon. Thus, they opted not to accumulate
substantial crude inventories, preferring to wait for the expected
price decline, which didn't come. All the time, they were content
to produce only enough finished product to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here, Cooper noted, is that even as U.S. interests
pressure OPEC to increase production, an oil glut seems more likely
than an oil shortage. How so? With so little excess refining
capacity to work with, U.S. refiners are limited in how much of any
extra OPEC production they'd be able to process.
</P>
<P>
   Although the summer driving season is over, which should relieve
some of the pressure, any refining capacity not needed for gasoline
must be shifted to heating oil. That market already is responding
as if it were expecting a worst-case winter scenario, as futures
prices flirt with record highs.
</P>
<P>
   The area most threatened by soaring heating-oil prices will be
the Northeast, but as refiners divert as much capacity as possible
to meeting heating-oil demand, this means gasoline supplies can be
expected to remain relatively lean. Translation: The odds of rising
gas prices are much greater than declining gasoline prices in the
weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing lasts forever, though. It's an election year, which
means Big Oil will come under political pressure to eat some of the
higher production costs imposed by market conditions. Moreover, if
surging energy prices slow the economy, this may flatten demand,
and thus prices.
</P>
<P>
   As one analyst put it recently, a combination of market
fundamentals and political pressure probably will combine at some
point to cap the market. Meantime, things probably will get worse
before they get better.

 DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR LIMITS ON VIOLENCE IN TV, MUSIC  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats chortled when Dan Quayle went after
television's Murphy Brown. They rolled their eyes when Bob Dole
railed against such movies as ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``Money
Train.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Democrats not only are voicing their own concerns about
the entertainment industry, but making them a centerpiece of their
2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman testifies
Wednesday morning before a Senate committee on the dangers of
Hollywood's violence and the virtues of curtailing it, it will be
another milepost in the party's steady march toward the
conservative position on cultural values.
</P>
<P>
   Once seen as the more free-living, more free-speech-loving and
hipper of the two major parties, Democrats now are presenting
themselves as concerned _ some would say uptight _ mothers and
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Tipper Gore's crusade against obscene music
lyrics. Then President Clinton demanded that TV-makers include
V-chips that would allow parents to block children from watching
certain shows. This week, Vice President Al Gore and his running
mate have taken the issue beyond even the GOP's most strident
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats, in a move that has many supporters raising
their eyebrows, have proposed government intervention to force the
industry to stop marketing violent products to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not censorship at all,'' Gore said of his threats to
regulate the makers of music, movies and video games. ``It's about
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also about polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many Baby Boomers who laughed at their parents' concerns over
the evil influences of rock 'n' roll now worry about the effects of
misogynist and violent lyrics on their children's CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Strict parenting may be good politics.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg writes in a recent edition
of the American Prospect that after rescuing Clinton from the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, ``Democrats again were identified with
1960s-style irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who signed on with the Gore camp earlier this summer,
says ``voters want political leaders who put the family at the
center of political discussion and ... are drawn to Democrats who
respect the public's religious faith and belief in personal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians agree that the reduction of violence and
improved family life are admirable goals. But the idea of using
government to regulate the arts _ or even the marketing of artistic
products _ makes many cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I praise (Gore) for his call for self-regulation and
self-restraint, but I do not believe it would be constitutional for
the government to start policing ads,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who also will testify at this morning's hearing before
the Senate Commerce Committee. ``It might work in China or Cuba _
but they don't have (our) Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, taking a more traditional Democratic line, suggested that
domestic violence and guns contribute to moral decay and crime
rates far more than movies and raunchy CDs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a line of reasoning that Gore himself advanced in many
speeches. Until this week, when Gore spoke about violence among
children, he focused on solutions such as restricting guns, adding
new police officers, providing V-chips and seeking voluntary
restraint from the makers of movies, music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   His selection of Lieberman as a running mate may have been the
first indication of a change.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has long been an advocate of using government to stem
``the impact that all of the violence, vulgarity and degradation
flooding into the public square is having on our children, our
culture, and our common values.'' He proposed legislation with Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., to require the entertainment industry to come
up with a uniform rating system and new laws to prohibit the sale
of certain materials to children.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gore proposed giving the entertainment industry six
months to stop marketing violent and obscene products to children
or face sanctions from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   If current law does not permit the Federal Trade Commission to
go after the industries' marketing plans as ``false advertising,''
Gore said, he will work on writing new legislation to provide the
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency,'' he told the New York
Times, ``I am going to do something about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are finding this hard to stomach, coming from a man who has
taken millions of dollars in Hollywood contributions. Democrats
have received $13.6 million from the entertainment industry this
election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change is that in the past, Al Gore has not overtly
threatened the First Amendment with government intervention,'' said
Howie Klein, president of Reprise Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Gore trying to latch onto this to show he is a tough
guy,'' Klein said. ``This is his way of showing paranoid parents _
and in some cases legitimately worried parents _ as well as the
anti-civil libertarian right-wing fanatics, that he is as tough as
the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said warning stickers that recording companies place on
CDs containing graphic lyrics do more than alert parents. They also
prevent many stores in shopping malls from carrying the product, he
said, and have a chilling effect on the artistic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem isn't that parents don't have a right to be
concerned,'' Klein said. ``My fear is that government shouldn't
have a role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a position long held by many Democrats. It is no longer
the position held by the party's presidential nominee.

STATION EDGES PAST HARRAH'S IN AUGUST MARKET SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Station Casino Kansas City didn't appear to
lose any business over its state licensing troubles, according to
the latest financial report by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Station led all Kansas City riverboats in August with $14.69
million in revenue and a 33.82 percent market share, according to
the report, which was released this week. That performance inched
past Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel, which closed the
month at $14.67 million and a 33.77 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   While the market leaders slugged it out, Flamingo Hilton Casino
posted its lowest numbers of the year. In August the Kansas City
casino temporarily shut down 490 slot machines as part of an
extensive remodeling and rebranding to an Isle of Capri casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called being under construction, and it's going to get
worse before it gets better,'' said General Manager Dan Weindruch.
</P>
<P>
   With almost half its slot machines and floor space out of
action, the Isle-operated Flamingo is going through ``an identity
crisis'' and a painful period for employees, Weindruch said.
Workers' hours have been cut, he said, but he promised, ``There
will be no layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees aren't happy, and the timing couldn't be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Local 64 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees union had been gathering signatures at the casino for
more than a year, hoping to collect a majority and force an
election to establish a collective bargaining unit at the
riverboat.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing effort bogged down in 1999 when it became clear
that Hilton Hotels Corp. was selling the casino, said Beverly
Alery, secretary-treasurer of the local. That effort has resumed
with the emergence of Mississippi-based Isle of Capri Casinos Inc.
as new owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a union town,'' Alery said Tuesday. ``We are not going
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alery said the culinary workers' Local 74 in St.
Louis probably would mount a similar effort at Isle's other
Missouri casinos in development in Boonville and Kimmswick.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Boone, Isle vice president for human resources, said the
company would fight to keep its rapidly growing chain of 12 casinos
in five states union-free.
</P>
<P>
   Isle has won all but one certifying election over the years,
Boone said. And that lone defeat was turned around after only a
year when workers voted to decertify from the union.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Weindruch formally rejected Alery's request that Isle
negotiate with Local 64, and this month letters went out to
employees over his signature urging them to refuse to sign union
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If union organizers come to see you, our advice is to tell
them you are not interested,'' Weindruch wrote in one letter
obtained by The Kansas City Star. ``Signing a union card can
obligate you to pay large sums of money to the union for regular
dues and fees...and give the union the power to make decisions for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamingo employees have long been in a cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   Political scandal kept the casino's fate uncertain for years as
the riverboat struggled just to maintain its market share, which
has long trailed the other boats.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Isle's estimated five-month construction project is sending
workers home each week with less than full paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down from 40 hours a week to a 30-hour week, and
they're still sending me home early some of the time,'' said one
Flamingo card dealer who is looking for another job and asked not
be identified. ``People can't afford to have their hours cut. I
think they're trying to make us quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch insists the difficulties are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be as fair as possible in reducing hours,'' he
said. ``We're trying to minimize the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is still working and still has their full benefits.
We hope by the first of the year, or even sometime in December when
the renovation is close to completed, business will pick up, and
hours will increase.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Weindruch said, the company is spending
additional development money on preliminary design work for a hotel
and banquet facility on the grounds. If all goes according to plan,
Weindruch said, construction could begin in the spring and the new
facilities could open in summer 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company on Monday announced a deal with Children's
Choice Learning Centers Inc., of Dallas, to provide on-site day
care for employees' children at all its casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch said the child-care center in Kansas City probably
would be part of the hotel project.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Gaming Commission held a two-day inquiry in
Kansas City into events surrounding a former Station lawyer's
guilty plea this year in federal court. Michael Lazaroff admitted
committing several felonies, including misappropriation of law firm
funds that included a questionable $500,000 bonus payment from
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry found no casino wrongdoing linked to that money. But
when Station executives refused to honor the commission's subpoenas
and testify under oath, the commission voted 5-0 to revoke the
company's state gaming licenses in Kansas City and St. Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas-based Station is expected to appeal that action. Its
riverboats would remain open until those issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's also might encounter construction blues before the end
of the year. Inside remodeling and expansion to a second deck
aboard Harrah's Mardi Gras is to begin in November. Exterior work
already has begun.
</P>
<P>
   The project is to be completed July 4, 2001, said General
Manager Michael St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the Mardi Gras work, the smaller North Star
riverboat will be shut down and moved to another Harrah's location,
probably in southern Illinois, St. Pierre said.

AGENCIES MADE $20.7 BILLION IN ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS, GAO REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taxpayers lost $20.7 billion last year on bills the
federal government paid but didn't owe, according to a General
Accounting Office report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that 12 federal agencies in 1999 made payments
erroneously or fraudulently in 20 programs. The biggest share of
the $20.7 billion was $14.1 billion in Medicare fees paid for
services not rendered, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there was $19.1 billion in improper spending. This is
the second year the GAO has studied the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for each year would be much higher, but most agencies do
not have systems to determine how much money is being improperly
spent, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's improper payments grew from $12.6 billion in 1998 to
$14.1 billion last year. Several years ago they lost more than $20
billion _ before steps were taken to crack down on the problem,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides overpayments from Medicare, improper amounts paid
included $1.3 billion for food stamps, $1.6 billion in supplemental
security income, $1.3 billion for old age and survivors insurance,
$1.1 billion for disability insurance and $935 million in housing
subsidies. The rest was spread among other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stockholders do not tolerate such mismanagement in the private
sector,'' said Thomas Schatz, president of the nonpartisan group
Citizens Against Government Waste. ``Taxpayers should be equally
outraged at such neglect of their investment in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Schatz said the $20.7 billion would be enough to give every
family in America $300 or could be used to finance programs that
may have to be left out of the budget this year.  &LR; tag1:To reach

RETURN OF POLI-DIXON SHOULD HELP BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the play of quarterback Ryan McCann has been
the focus of much of the talk concerning UCLA's uneven offensive
performance against Fresno State, the return of split end Brian
Poli-Dixon could have a big impact on the Bruins' offense Saturday
against No.3-ranked Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon, who had tightness in his right hamstring prior to
the season opener against Alabama, felt a twinge in the muscle
early in the second half of that game and didn't return. The muscle
felt tight in light running last Monday so the coaches decided to
hold him out against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poli gives you a serious big-play threat,'' offensive
coordinator Al Borges said of the junior whose only catch this
season was a 31-yard scoring pass from flanker Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run by you or take the ball underneath and run through
people. Any time you lose a player like that, you're going to
notice. (Jon) Dubravac (four catches, 32 yards) did a great job,
but now we're in a position where we can have both of them out
there (in three-receiver sets).''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon spent much of last week getting whirlpool treatments
and said Tuesday that he hasn't run full out yet. Missing a week of
conditioning could be a concern, but so is blowing out his
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go back to square one,'' Poli-Dixon said.
``This is a huge game. You only get so many opportunities to play a
team like Michigan. This could set us up for the Pac-10 and our
ranking. We can make a statement to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   KOCHER HEALING: Defensive tackle Ken Kocher (left ankle sprain)
is also expected to return after missing the Fresno State game, but
he won't start and will likely be limited to 15 to 20 plays.
</P>
<P>
   RANKINGS: After UCLA moved ahead of Alabama in the writers' poll
this week _ the Bruins were 14th and the Crimson Tide 15th _ Bruins
coach Bob Toledo felt vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fair,'' he said. ``I wasn't saying we should be No.1.
It's only right. Why should somebody be ranked ahead of you if you
beat them this early in the season?''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, apparently, don't agree. They kept UCLA 17th and
moved Alabama up a spot this week to 13th. &QL;

DRAFT PICK BOOTCHECK FINALLY ARRIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A mere three months after being selected by
the Angels with the 20th overall pick in the draft, pitcher Chris
Bootcheck finally made it to Edison Field on Tuesday afternoon for
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It took so long because Bootcheck, a 6-foot-5, 195-pound client
of agent Scott Boras, would not agree to terms on a signing bonus.
Last Friday, the two sides finally agreed on $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of anxiety during the process,'' said
Bootcheck, who skipped his senior year at Auburn to sign with the
Angels. ``Baseball is a sport I love. I was anxious to get started.
I couldn't wait for the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the negotiating process took so long, Bootcheck was
unable to pitch in the organization this season, unlike Joe Torres,
who also was taken in the first round (No.10 overall).
</P>
<P>
   Torres, pitching for Single-A Boise, went 4-1 with a 2.54 ERA in
11 games (10 starts). Bootcheck will pitch in the Arizona
Instructional League beginning Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Angels director of scouting Donny Rowland said it's not out of
the question for Bootcheck to begin next season as high as
Double-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go well, we will not hold him back,'' Rowland said.
``But we're not in a position to rush anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck has a four-pitch arsenal _ fastball (clocked at 94
mph), cut fastball/slider, curveball and changeup. But what the
Angels like equally is his intelligence and what they call an
ability to ``quickly absorb information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was tested in the conference I was in (Southeastern
Conference) and the opponents I faced,'' Bootcheck said. ``I feel I
proved myself the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras said he believes Bootcheck has the ability to reach the
majors faster than any other college pitcher in this year's draft.
He is also impressed with 17-year-old Torres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Angels could have come out of this draft
with two better pitchers than they have,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck went 9-2 with a 3.76 ERA for Auburn last season and
was 25-10 with a 4.73 ERA in his three years at the school.
</P>
<P>
   COACHES RE-SIGNED: The Angels announced they have renewed the
contracts of the entire major-league coaching staff for the 2001
season.
</P>
<P>
   Returning are pitching coach Bud Black, hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher, third-base coach Ron Roenicke, first-base coach Alfredo
Griffin, bench coach Joe Maddon, bullpen coach Bobby Ramos and
bullpen catcher Orlando Mercado.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYOFF IMPLICATIONS: A series of coin tosses were conducted to
decide the sites of potential one-game playoffs should the AL West
or wild-card race end in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels tie with Seattle for the division crown, the two
teams will play at Edison Field. If the Angels and A's tie for the
division, they will play in Oakland. &QL;

INJURED VALDES DROPS APPEAL OF SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Right-hander Ismael Valdes dropped an appeal of his
six-game suspension and began serving it Tuesday, but it's possible
he's already made his last start with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are contemplating keeping Eric Gagne and rookie
right-hander Luke Prokopec in the rotation to prepare for next
season. With Valdes eligible for free agency after the season, the
club might place him in a long-relief role, a club official said.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes can return Monday against Arizona, but the Dodgers want
to get Gagne as many starts as possible. They also want to see more
of Prokopec, who made his first major-league start Tuesday, so they
can evaluate his standing.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne and Prokopec are slated to start this weekend against
Colorado and they could remain in the rotation for the final two
weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With (17) games to go, decisions about personnel and whatever,
to me, are very important,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``Until you're mathematically eliminated, I'm never giving up. But
there are also questions (for which) you want to get some
information to help you answer for the future of this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was scratched from his start Monday because of numbness
in his right pinkie and was replaced by Gagne. Even so, Valdes said
he could have pitched Monday, but team doctors urged him to sit out
so he didn't further aggravate the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plan before (Monday), but circumstances changed the
plan,'' Valdes said. ``We were going to wait until the appeal. I
could have pitched, but they didn't want to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' future plan, at this point, doesn't involve Valdes.
But he said he wanted to pitch again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to finish this year and prepare myself for next year as
best I can this winter,'' said Valdes, a combined 2-7 with a 5.64
ERA with the Dodgers and Cubs this season. ``I have to get ready
for next season, because next season is going to be a very, very
important season for me.''
</P>
<P>
   GREEN STILL BLUE: It's been a season of adjustment for right
fielder Shawn Green, who's had a miserable time of it offensively
for the past three-plus months.
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a hot start and batted .337 through May, but since
the All-Star break Green's batting .239 with 11 homers and 36 RBI.
It's not easy to blame his struggles on the general pitfalls of
returning home under a big contract. Green, who grew up in Orange
County, is batting .308 at home but .239 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   While Green's power numbers _ he has 24 homers _ have
dramatically dropped from the last two seasons, when he hit 35 and
42 homers, he's still within five RBI of his third straight 100-RBI
season.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek was held out of
the lineup because of a bruised right thumb and because he's 5 for
31 (.161) in his career against Curt Schilling. Grudzielanek is
listed as day to day. Jeff Branson started at second in his place.
... Tom Goodwin's bunt single in the sixth pushed his hitting
streak to 13 games, tying a career high. It also matches the
highest for a Dodgers player this season. &QL;

UTA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH CHANGING PROFESSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Mike Dean said he still loves basketball, but
he hates worrying about recruiting, next year's schedule and how
the heck you beat Southland Conference rival Stephen F. Austin.
</P>
<P>
   UT-Arlington's women's coach for the past eight years resigned
Tuesday to pursue a business opportunity in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   He said basketball coaching and the job's anxiety not only takes
time he would spend with from his wife, Lisa, it consumes his mind
every minute for 365 days a year. Most of all, Dean said, it was
not making him a better person.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's resignation is effective Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've been thinking about for about two years,''
Dean said. ``Basketball is hard on me. Your job can't be more
important than your life, and for me, my life was my job. I don't
want it to be like that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the search for a replacement, UTA athletic director Pete
Carlon said he would consider assistant coaches Kim Dowell and
Robert Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said he wants to fill the position by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, 37, has spent the past 16 years coaching basketball,
including a four-year stint as an assistant coach at Arkansas State
before taking his first NCAA Division I head coaching position at
UTA. He walks away from a $67,500 salary without much knowledge of
the job he is about to take.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said he is going into a start-up investment business with
two friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know anything about what I'll be doing, but I
plan to learn, and I'm excited about starting over and doing
something different,'' Dean said. ``I'm ready to be a regular guy.
I want to spend time with my wife. I want us to be together and not
necessarily have basketball rule my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean is the second coach in UTA history to reach more than 100
victories in a career. He was 115-105 overall and had five winning
seasons. UTA's 1998-99 team was invited to the Women's National
Invitation Tournament, the Mavericks' only national postseason
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's teams became known for playing stingy defense, and the
Mavericks were consistently ranked among the Division I leaders in
fewest points allowed. The 1997-98 squad gave up 56.7 points per
game, No. 7 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   He informed his players in a meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all pretty shocked,'' said UTA junior forward Patrice
Sims, a transfer who did not play last season. ``Coach Dean stood
by me the past year and I really looked forward to playing for him.
I guess that won't happen. It's time for us to pull together as a
team and get through this.''

BAYLOR SEEKS ANOTHER TASTE OF '96 AGAINST MINNESOTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Having won their season opener for the first time
since 1996, the Baylor Bears now welcome the challenge of making it
two in a row ... also a feat last accomplished in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sure it would be a big step for us,'' says second-year
coach Kevin Steele, whose team will play host to Minnesota (1-1) at
11:30 a.m. Saturday. ``And yes, if you asked the players, they
would probably say this is a big game. But really, we're just
trying to take it week by week. We know that at some point we will
win two straight, then three, then four ...''
</P>
<P>
   Steele did note, however, that while beating North Texas two
weeks ago was great fun, beating the Gophers would be a step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big, strong, coming off a bowl year, playing with a
lot of confidence, very physical,'' Steele said of the Gophers.
``They average about 308 pounds across the offensive line, and all
of those guys are about 6-\Rfoot\S-6 to 6-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota did, however, lose Saturday to Ohio University, 23-17,
at home. Steele attributed that loss to the Gophers' difficulty
handling Ohio's wishbone offense, which rolled up 363 yards
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have an option package, which we practice every week,
but it's not the same thing, and it's something Minnesota can
probably handle,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gophers also can mount an impressive pass rush, led by SMU
transfer Karon Riley, whom Steele describes as ``basically your
sleek, get-off-the-ball-quick, relentless type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the obvious query of quarterback Greg Cicero,
about to start his second NCAA Division I-A game: Can that good ol'
Baylor line give him enough time to throw the ball?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to worry about it,'' Cicero said, smoothly.
``That's the offensive line's job, and if we're having a problem,
the coaches will make an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Cicero's jaunty self-confidence might be the key
ingredient separating the Bears from their recent predecessors, but
he is quick to add that this is indeed a big test for Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota is a Big Ten team, and they draw a lot more
attention than North Texas and have a lot more national prestige,''
he said. ``It would really be a big thing for us if we could knock
them off. To do that, we have to control the ball and avoid
turnovers, because they live off turnovers. That's all I want to
do, win the game. I'm not going out there to try to be Superman.''
\Nsubheds:Briefly Saturday's game will be televised as the regional
Big 12 Game of the Week and shown locally on KDFI/Channel 27.
</P>
<P>
   Karon Riley, who played two years at SMU, led the Big Ten with
16 sacks last season and is a preseason All-American. Receiver Jack
Brewer is also an SMU ex who was the Mustangs' leading receiver in
'97. Brewer, from Grapevine High School, is the cousin of running
back Tellis Redmon, who played at Grapevine and Colleyville
Heritage. Redmon has rushed for 168 yards in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Bears' main concern is stopping the home run.
``They throw the deep ball very well, and they do it often enough
that they'll probably hit one for a score sometime during the
game,'' Kevin Steele said. ``The concern is to make sure they don't
do it two or three times.''

FROGS LOOK TO AVENGE TOUGH '99 LOSS TO NORTHWESTERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Horned Frogs circled this game coming
into the season. Going up against a Big Ten foe in the home-opener
is a measuring stick, sure, but it's also an opportunity to make
amends for last season.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern's 17-7 victory in Evanston, Ill., doesn't sit well
with the players, who believe they gave the game away in the fourth
quarter. The Frogs had several chances to at least tie the score in
fourth quarter, including a drive inside the Northwestern 10-yard
line that ended in a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione said Tuesday at his weekly news
conference that coaching mistakes leading up to the game had as
much to do with the outcome as on-field miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not play well in this game last year and I had told the
guys, and I'm not trying to discredit Northwestern's victory, that
last year's loss was my fault,'' Franchione said. ``Totally my
fault. I take the responsibility, burden for it.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU played Arizona on Sunday night, six days before a Saturday
morning game at Northwestern. TCU lost to Arizona, 35-31, and the
loss was not only physically draining, but emotionally exhausting,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on Sunday eliminated more than a day of practice time to
prepare for the Wildcats, and left Franchione with a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a head coach, you've got a decision to come \Rand
practice\S Monday, because you don't have Sunday and then a day
off,'' he said, referring to the team's normal Monday off-day.
``So, you have to make a decision about how you're going to go into
this next week. Here's what you have to weigh: You're supposed to
improve from Game 1 to Game 2. But if you don't practice, how do
you improve? On the same token, \Rthere is\S almost a day-and-half
less preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day-and-a-half in a football player's week is quite a bit in
\Rlost\S recovery and preparation time. So, I probably pushed them
too hard in Week 2 to improve and maybe went into the game a little
dead-legged, a little tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione said that if given the chance, ``I'd probably do it a
little different.'' On the other hand, he firmly believes ``it
helped us in the long run become a better football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one to help the Wildcats prepare for the No. 20 Frogs,
Franchione kept it close to the vest Saturday against Nevada. The
game plan was simple: wear down the Wolf Pack at the point of
attack with both the offensive and defensive lines. More than 300
yards rushing and 15 sacks, and a 41-10 victory, safely
accomplished that mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we have done some other things? Probably. Did we need
to? Nah,'' Franchione said. ``We don't need to show anymore than we
need to show ... The first game you're never quite sure what to
think about yourself. I'd like to think with the number of seniors
and starters \Rback\S, I had a little bit of an idea, but you can
always be fooled. I did not know if Nevada could beat us. I did
know we could lose to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern goes into Saturday's game 2-0 for the first time
since 1975 and gunning for its first 3-0 start in 38 years. The
Wildcats, 3-8 last season, downed Duke, 38-5, behind a career-high
187 yards rushing from Damien Anderson and Zak Kustok's 197 yards
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt they're better'' than last
year, Franchione said. \Nsubheds:Injury update Defensive end Aaron
Schobel (bruised right hip), linebacker Shannon Brazzell (right
knee sprain) and safety/returner LaVar Veale (right ankle sprain)
practiced Tuesday. Schobel and Veale did light work, while
Brazzell, closer to 100 percent, went at it harder. Franchione
expects all three to play Saturday.

COWBOYS RELEASE CORNERBACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Former Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith is retired
no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys officially removed Smith from the reserve/retirement
list and released him Tuesday. The nine-year veteran left the
Cowboys during training camp because of recurring back problems and
was offered an assistant coaching position with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, still wants to play football, his agent, Stephen
Zucker, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling pretty good,'' Zucker said.''That's why we went
to Dallas and withdrew his retirement letter. They either had to
put him on the roster or release him. He says he feels fine. He
hasn't taken a physical yet. But he wants to give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said he talked to a few teams yesterday about Smith's
availability, though he said no deal was imminent. Zucker declined
to disclose those teams.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, the New York Giants are one of a couple
of teams to express interest in Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's decision to resume his career brings into question who
made the initial decision for him to leave the team after the Aug.
5 preseason game in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys said then that Smith left because of frustration
stemming from a congenital degenerative disk in his lower back and
was contemplating retirement. Smith, who missed five weeks of
training camp and the first three games of the 1999 season because
of the back injury, struggled with his health and play during the
first two weeks of camp this season.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, Smith wanted to continue his football
career, but eventually decided to retire to help the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was unavailable for comment.
\Nsubheds:Moore expected to sign The Cowboys are expected to sign
rookie free-agent defensive tackle Ron Moore to the practice squad
today. Moore would take the spot vacated by quarterback Clint
Stoerner, who was promoted to the active roster last week.

Mamadou Diallo lit up the stats with 26 goals in 28 games in his
first season in MLS, though his bruising, physical style of play
has slightly tainted that production. Teammate and legendary
Colombian midfielder Carlos Valderrama makes a strong case with a
league-record 26 assists. MetroStars midfielder and forward Clint
Mathis flourished after a midseason trade from Los Angeles, scoring
13 goals and adding 13 assists in 20 games with New York/New
Jersey. Kansas City goalkeeper Tony Meola registered a
league-record 15 shutouts and posted an 0.89 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta give it to Diallo, despite the outcry over his style.
Nearly a goal a game is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Kansas City's Bob Gansler. In his first full
season with the Wizards, Gansler has brought the franchise
unprecedented success. The Wizards won the Western Division title
after missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A close runner-up is the MetroStars' Octavio Zambrano, who
guided a team with a 7-25 record a year ago to its first division
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomer: Toss-up between Kansas City defender Nick Garcia
or Chicago defender Carlos Bocanegra. Both left early from college
and have adjusted perfectly to the professional level, playing
critical roles in their team's respective successes.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for the league is that this year's influx of
youngsters such as Garcia, Bocanegra and Bobby Convey of D.C.
United has started to move MLS into the ranks of other professional
leagues in which bypassing college or leaving early is a viable
option.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest letdown: Midfielder Lothar Matthaus, the aging German
superstar who was supposed to help lift the MetroStars. But the
rise of the team had little to do with Matthaus, who made more
headlines with his bratty behavior and weak excuses than he did
with his play. San Jose's Khodadad Azizi, the highly touted striker
who became the first Iranian player in MLS, also is a candidate.
Unfortunately, injuries kept him from playing much. And D.C.
midfielder Marco Etcheverry, ``El Diablo,'' was ejected in the
season opener and remained virtually invisible this season for
struggling United.
</P>
<P>
   With his $1 million price tag, Matthaus gets the nod.
</P>
<P>
   Best rivalry: Hands down, the Burn and the Chicago Fire. Fitting
names for teams that put on heated battles any time they meet. They
have played an astounding 17 times in only three seasons, and after
last season's bruising first-round playoffs series, you can bet
both teams were probably breathing a sigh of relief when Chad
Deering scored the game-winner Saturday against San Jose. A tie
would have meant yet another first-round playoff pairing for the
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Best resurgence: Hands down, Tony Meola. The former U.S.
national team 'keeper has had several lackluster and injury-riddled
seasons before this year, but he has been healthy all season and
has played a major role in the Wizards' astonishing turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Best disappearing act: D.C. United, which fell from its
perennial perch atop the league to the cellar. United has woes off
the field as well: The deal to sell the team to a new
owner-investor fell through last week.
</P>
<P>
   Best excuse to miss a game: Colorado rookie Seth Trembly missed
a regular-season game because he was attending his high school
prom. With the increase of younger players entering the league, we
might see more of the same excuses in the future.
</P>
<P>
   MLS's fifth season has offered more ups and downs than any
other. We'll see what else shakes out during the playoffs.
\Nsubheds:Olympic soccer begins today Olympic soccer is scheduled
to kick off early this morning, Central time, with the U.S. facing
the Czech Republic in Canberra, Australia, at 4 a.m. CDT. In other
matches scheduled today, Nigeria faces Honduras, Cameroon plays
Kuwait, and Australia takes on Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The competition will be void of some global standouts because of
injuries, as well as the longstanding red-tape power struggles
between the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, soccer's
worldwide governing body. IOC rules limit players over the age of
23 to three per roster, but the clubs of those players often
hesitate to release their highly paid standouts. \Nsubheds:Ratings

STARS' FRIENDS ARE FOES IN BATTLE FOR POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The word ``and'' usually connects Richard
Jackman's name with Brad Lukowich's.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman and Lukowich are defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman and Lukowich are roommates.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman and Lukowich are good friends.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the two open spots as the Stars' third
defensive pair, their names are connected by the word ``or,'' as in
either Jackman or Lukowich will be playing there with someone else.
The Stars don't want Jackman and Lukowich as the No. 5 and 6
defensemen because the team needs a more physical presence in that
pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the role of the sixth defenseman, and that role is
sitting there through exhibition for a \RJohn\S Erskine or a
\RSami\S Helenius,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We
anticipate that sixth position being a physical position. Who it
will be, I don't know, but that's the position. The fifth guy will
be a guy who moves the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the fifth guy is likely to be Jackman or
Lukowich.
</P>
<P>
   There's the dreaded ``or'' word again. But for a Stars bunch
that lost big banger bodies when winger Scott Thornton and
defenseman Dave Manson departed via free agency, they can't afford
not to add a little toughness to the lineup. The No. 6 defenseman
spot seems like the perfect place.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't hurt that Erskine, Helenius and Dan
Jancevski are having much better training camps than anybody hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the summer, I heard they didn't sign
Manson or whatever, and I heard they were keeping that spot open,''
Erskine said. ``And when camp began, Hitch said there is a few
spots open. He didn't say where they were, but everyone is fighting
for whatever spot is open.''
</P>
<P>
   Erskine, Helenius or Jancevski could easily fill the physical
role by size alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jancevski is the smallest, at 6 feet, 2 inches and 211 pounds,
which would make him the second-biggest defenseman in the Stars'
lineup behind 6-5, 230-pound Derian Hatcher. And if Hatcher misses
even one meal, Helenius could take that spot from him. He's 6-5,
225 pounds, with Erskine not far behind at 6-4, 213.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erskine takes after Hatch, a bigger guy,'' said Hatcher's
defensive partner, Richard Matvichuk. ``I think Luke and Jack are
more like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad comparison considering Matvichuk was once a
freewheeling defenseman and has developed into the stay-at-home,
banging physical kind. The kind, Hitchcock said, he'd like for his
No. 5 to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, we'd like the fifth guy to be physical,
too,'' Hitchcock said. ``But those guys are hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   So the bodies fly during scrimmages as Erskine, Jancevski,
Helenius, Jackman and Lukowich all try to prove that they are that
guy to the note-taking coaches and scouts and, yes, general
manager, watching from the stands at Dobson Ice Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The players know what will happen if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not, he'll go get someone else,'' Lukowich said, ``like
two guys from Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars acquired Manson from Chicago before the trading
deadline last season to bolster their lineup before the playoff
run. They're hoping they don't have to this season. It certainly
looks like they have enough in-house candidates to fill the three
open spots behind Hatcher, Matvichuk, Sergei Zubov and Darryl
Sydor. The third open spot is for a reserve, who wouldn't be active
for most games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we knew where the seven defensemen were coming from,
but two or three more have got in that mix,'' Hitchcock said.
``That's a big difference. There is competition and people now
realize who they are competing against for positions on the team.
It's getting very intense.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackman or Lukowich could find themselves in the press box
looking down. nn

MAKING HISTORY AT THE POLLS, SELMA ELECTS A BLACK MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joseph T. Smitherman, the former segregationist who
has been mayor of Selma, Ala., through 35 of the most restless
years in the Deep South, lost his tenth bid for re-election on
Tuesday night after a newly unified black electorate threw its
support to James Perkins Jr., a former computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, 47, who had run against Smitherman twice before, will
become the first black mayor in the history of Selma, a city of
21,000 famous for its bloody response to the civil rights marches
of 1965 that led to the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial returns showed that Perkins won 57 percent of the
votes in the runoff election, while Smitherman won 43 percent. As
supporters of Perkins filled the streets and crossed back and forth
over the Edmund Pettus Bridge _ where hundreds of marchers were
beaten by sheriff's deputies in 1965 _ Smitherman ruefully
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I put up a pretty damn good fight,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home, ``but the blacks decided they
wanted a change, and now they've got one. They brought in all these
celebrities to energize the voters, and I didn't think it would
work, but I guess it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a slogan used repeatedly by his opponents, he
added, ``They always said, `Joe gotta go,' and now Joe gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman won previous elections by getting most of the white
vote and enough black votes to achieve a majority, even though the
city has been mostly black for decades. Perkins was able to
assemble black voters into a majority, building on a financial
scandal in the mayor's last term and a sense in the city that
Smitherman, who is 70, had served long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many have said and many have felt that this was about James
Perkins and Joe Smitherman, and that's not true,'' Perkins said at
a victory rally. ``Many have said it's about black and white. That
ain't so. This campaign has been about faith and fear. Faith won
this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was heavy, reflecting the surge in interest in the
race since Perkins forced Smitherman into a runoff for the first
time last month. Several civil rights leaders from around the
country came to Selma to support Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smitherman was mayor during the 1965 march, he always
said he was a moderate segregationist who played no role in the
beatings, an assertion confirmed by many of those who were there.
Over the years he acknowledged being ``on the wrong side of
history,'' appointing many black department heads and trying to
spread city services evenly around the city. He had gradually grown
more isolated as the City Council and the County Commission were
dominated by black elected officials.

YANKEES CRUSH BLUE JAYS, 10-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He had his passion for playing baseball criticized by
the blustery principal owner of the Yankees, so he barked back. He
has been bothered by so many elbow, wrist and forearm injuries that
he could do a cameo on ``E.R.'' He had such a terrible defensive
game one night in June that the manager mercifully suggested he
leave Yankee Stadium before the contest was even over.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch has already endured a torturous and tumultuous
season, a season unlike any in his 10-year career. Knoblauch's
chronic throwing problems have not disappeared as much as they have
been tempered by his lack of playing time at second base. His next
throw could aggravate the tendinitis in his right elbow, the ball
could flutter like a Frisbee and cause George Steinbrenner to
screech again, or it could be accurate. It has been that perplexing
for Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees understand the importance of having a competent
Knoblauch leading off as they prepare for another postseason, and
that was underscored in their 10-2 victory over the Blue Jays on
Tuesday night at the Stadium. Knoblauch stroked a critical two-run
triple off Joey Hamilton in the second inning that gave Denny
Neagle an early cushion and helped him win his fourth straight
start.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone will return to the starting rotation after
dislocating his left shoulder eight days ago, but Neagle's
emergence has almost certainly made Cone's return Friday an
audition for the bullpen in October. Neagle (7-4) pitched
splendidly and received a standing ovation after allowing two runs
while whiffing seven in seven and two-thirds innings. Still, even
Neagle lauded Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's patented Knoblauch tonight,'' Neagle said. ``We all
know what he can do for us. I know his elbow is still sore, but
he's playing through the pain. He is going to get even better, and
that's going to make us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   With Knoblauch providing the spark, Neagle providing the
pitching and Jose Canseco providing the power with three hits and
three runs batted in, the Yanks began a 10-day period in which they
will play the Blue Jays six times and the Indians four times. The
Yankees lead the American League East by eight games over the Red
Sox, but they will influence the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees prepared for a run at their third straight World
Series title, Manager Joe Torre will continue tweaking them until
he believes they are ready. Torre needs relievers Mike Stanton and
Jeff Nelson to be sharper, and he needs the rotation to stay
effective. The piece that has been missing for over a month is
Knoblauch's tenacity atop the lineup. That is why Knoblauch's
simple contributions on Tuesday night loomed large.
</P>
<P>
   ``We traded for him and won two World Series with him,'' Torre
said. ``That tells you how important he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who had been sidelined since Aug. 3, returned to the
lineup on Sept. 6. It was less than a week after Steinbrenner
inferred that Knoblauch was hesitant to return because of his
throwing woes.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Knoblauch is looking more as if he is really back. He
walked on four pitches in his first at-bat against the wobbly
Hamilton. With the Yankees up, 2-1, with two outs and runners on
second and third in the second, Knoblauch flicked a liner to right.
Chad Mottola should have let it drop for a single, but he dived
awkwardly, flailed at a ball that bounced five feet in front of him
and had it slither by him for a triple. It was just Knoblauch's
second hit in 19 at-bats since he was activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets going on offense,'' Tino Martinez said, ``he's a
pain to the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch also ranged about 30 feet to his left to make a nice
stop and a strong off-balance throw in the fourth. But Torre still
replaced him with Jose Vizcaino to start the seventh, saying,
``That's what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco belted a two-run shot into the left-field seats to make
the score 6-1 in the fourth, pausing briefly after he hit it to
stare at his bat and make sure it was not cracked. Like Knoblauch,
Canseco is another piece the Yankees need but have not had all
season. Like Knoblauch, Canseco's body is still healing after a
long stint on the disabled list. There is a different feeling when
Canseco bats at the Stadium, and the fans booed as he was
intentionally walked in the seventh. Ryan Thompson followed with a
three-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 6-1 lead in the fifth, Neagle encountered a ticklish
situation when Toronto loaded the bases with no outs. After Alex
Gonzalez singled in the second run, Mottola hit a pop down the
right-field line. Martinez scooted toward the stands, but the wind
pushed the ball into fair territory and Martinez had to deftly
lunge to his left to snare it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neagle could not exhale. Carlos Delgado, the favorite to
win the most valuable player award and a Triple Crown candidate,
was the next batter. Delgado smacked a hard grounder to Martinez,
who flipped the ball to Derek Jeter, who then tossed it back to
Neagle covering first for a nifty and timely double play.

 Dot-com Food: A user's guide to recipes, ingredients,

 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For the adventurous cook, the Internet seems like
a dream.
 &HT;    Want to make Laotian catfish stew or a vegetable Moroccan
couscous? A wired cook need merely download a recipe, check in with
a few other online cooks for tips on technique and then click over
to order the ingredients and the pots to cook it in.
 &HT;    But reality has a way of smashing dreams. Type ``couscous'' into
a popular search engine and you get 15,500 entries. It's like
trying to get a drink of water from a fire hose.
 &HT;    When it comes to reading about restaurants online, most
restaurant Web sites are fine for hours and menus, but even the
most popular portals have out-of-date information.
 &HT;    In this week's special Food issue, we've devoted ourselves to
helping Bay Area cooks find their way around the brave new world
that blends food and technology. We've cooked recipes we pulled off
``the Net.'' We've sent our best cooks surfing to find their top
recipe sites. We've researched how to order ethnic ingredients and
compared shopping for equipment online versus what can be found in
stores.
 &HT;    As we've rated sites and picked our favorites, we've tried to
keep in mind the practical needs of cooks with average computer
equipment. Using the Internet is a lot like cooking _ if you don't
have good equipment, both pursuits can become difficult And, we've
researched with an eye toward people who might not have much skill
navigating the Web. So whether you think a search engine is stored
in a garage or you surf Google daily, you'll find something here to
help you use the Internet to enhance your kitchen.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attacked from all sides, U.S. Rep. Michael P. Forbes,
a Republican-turned Democrat from Long Island, was locked in a
dead-even struggle with his primary challenger on Tuesday night and
was one of the few incumbents who did not easily prevail in
contests that were marked by unusual rancor this season.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, of Quogue, acknowledged on Tuesday night that his race
against Regina Seltzer, 71, of Bellport, a longtime Democrat, was
too close to call. With Republicans clinging to a narrow majority
in the House, both national and state party officials had channeled
money and advertising into the district early on to sway even
Democrats to vote against the man who infuriated the Republicans by
switching parties in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Washington late Tuesday night,
Forbes sounded resigned to whatever the outcome was, saying that
his adoptive party voters ``had a hard time accepting that Mike
Forbes embraced the same values they do,'' especially his fiscal
conservatism and his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   This primary election was also the first in which the name of a
first lady was on the ballot, with Hillary Rodham Clinton easily
winning the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate against Mark
S. McMahon, a little-known Manhattan orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, Clinton received 82 percent
of the vote, with McMahon receiving 18 percent. Aides to Clinton's
Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had forecast that Clinton
would be viewed as a particularly weak contender for the November
general election if her opponent in the Democratic primary received
30 percent of the vote. Still, McMahon's showing suggested that
Clinton must contend with a group of Democratic voters who dislike
her.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the congressional primary on Long Island,
Tuesday's races drew a light voter turnout and produced decisive
victories for several incumbent members of Congress and for most
incumbents in the State Legislature, according to unofficial
returns reported by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In Forbes's race, Seltzer, a lawyer who served from 1976 to 1980
on the Brookhaven Town Board, campaigned vigorously, although she
was outspent by Forbes. Seltzer stressed that, although Forbes
became a Democrat, he continued to cast his votes with the
Republican majority in the House on tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed her support of a woman's right to choose
abortion while highlighting Forbes's opposition to the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes maintained that he has remained the same fiscal
conservative he always was and that he would continue to guard the
environment, balance the budget and reduce taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's primaries also included third-party candidates
in the Senate race. The Independence Party, New York's arm of the
national Reform Party, fielded two candidates, and Jeff Graham, the
former mayor of Watertown, emerged victorious. The Green Party
offered up three candidates, and its winner won't be known for
several days because it was forced to use paper ballots in New York
City. Its candidates were Al Lewis, formerly known as ``Grandpa''
on ``The Munsters''; Ronnie Dugger, founding editor of the Texas
Observer; and Mark Dunau, an organic farmer.
</P>
<P>
   On the Right-to-Life line, Louis Wein, a Republican, was in a
dead heat with John Adefope, a telephone company engineer, for that
nomination. With nearly all precincts reporting, the race was too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Primary day began in Chappaqua with votes by Mrs. Clinton and
her husband at the Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary School in their
new hometown of Chappaqua, N.Y. The two arrived at 7:15 a.m. to a
waiting throng of photographers and reporters to cast their votes
in the sole voting booth in the school's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   After signing photographs and shaking hands with residents
outside the school lobby, Mrs. Clinton went into the aqua blue
booth first, followed by her husband. Asked afterward how it felt
to see Mrs. Clinton on the ballot for the first time, President
Clinton said: ``It was a thrill. After all these years of her
helping me, it was a thrill. I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was more demure, saying only that it felt ``great''
to vote for herself. But later, talking to reporters at a nearby
delicatessen, she elaborated somewhat on the occasion. ``I stood
there for a minute,'' she said, ``staring at my name.''  &QL;

DODGERS WASTE HANSEN'S HISTORIC HOMER, LOSE TO D'BACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Dodgers got a big home run to get back into a
ballgame late. But, once again, defensive mistakes were their
downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly something you'd see on ``Ripley's Believe It Or Not.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen, the most dangerous pinch hitter in the game, set a
major-league record with his seventh pinch-hit homer of the season,
but two errors early and a fielding gaffe in the eighth inning led
to Arizona's 5-4 win against the Dodgers on Tuesday at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored the winning run when shortstop Alex Cora
took an extra step to throw the ball on David Dellucci's slow
bouncer behind pitcher Matt Herges. Cora threw an instant late and
Dellucci was safe, allowing pinch runner Matt Mieske to score from
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I caught it, I was trying to get it on a short hop,''
Cora said. ``When I reached for it, that's when I got off-balance.
When I took a step to get back on balance, that was the difference.
When you make it, `Wow, great play.' When you don't, you feel like
I feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The left side of the infield is talented, but it's also young.
And with such youth comes mistakes. Cora, whose throwing error in
the fourth led to two unearned runs, has made 12 errors and third
baseman Adrian Beltre has 22.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also scored an unearned run in the fifth inning when a
grounder went through the legs of second baseman Jeff Branson with
the infield playing in and a runner on third. That was the Dodgers'
major-league-leading 128th error. Their .977 field percentage is
also the worst in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   That type of defense also makes it tough on pitchers, especially
ones making their first major-league start like right-hander Luke
Prokopec. He wasn't involved in the decision after allowing four
runs (one earned) on six hits in 4 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of what we're going through, some young, talented
defensive players that make inexperienced mistakes,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``It's only going to get better, but
it's tough to go through. Emotions sometimes get the best of them
and they'll rush things.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a late-inning homer by Hansen _ who went deep on the
first pitch he saw from Curt Schilling _ was wasted. The three-run
shot with two outs in the seventh was his seventh pinch-hit homer
of the season. Brooklyn's Johnny Frederick hit six in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all surprise home runs to me,'' said Hansen, batting
.271 with seven homers and 14 RBI as a pinch-hitter. ``I can't try
and hit home runs. I'd be the worst hitter in the world. In fact,
every time I do, I end up popping it up.'' &QL;

SOURCE: MULLIN TO LAKERS LIKELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Like a frustrated game-show contestant, the
Lakers are once again reaching for the consolation prize after
wistfully watching the grand prize slip away.
</P>
<P>
   They coveted the rebounding skills of Horace Grant, but a
proposed three-team trade that would have made Grant a Laker, while
sending Glen Rice to New York, fell apart, leaving the Lakers
grasping for the nearest available help.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Chris Mullin, waived Tuesday by the Indiana
Pacers. Mullin can't fill the Lakers' gaping vacancy at power
forward, but he can provide depth at small forward in anticipation
of Rice's departure.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old former Dream Teamer asked for, and was granted,
his release from the Pacers and must now clear the 48-hour waiver
period. Mullin is owed $4.6 million next season, so no team is
likely to claim him off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Once he becomes a free agent on Thursday, the Lakers figure to
sign him for the veteran's minimum of $1 million _ a scenario
called ``likely'' by an NBA source.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, a 15-year veteran, would give the Lakers another shooter
_ he made 44 percent of his 3-point tries the last three seasons _
and provide backup to either Kobe Bryant or Rick Fox at small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers' search for a power forward continues and
they are discussing a potential trade for Lorenzen Wright of the
Atlanta Hawks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, currently with Seattle, would have been a nice fit here,
but the three-team deal died when the Knicks _ who would have sent
Patrick Ewing to the Sonics _ pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Although reports surfaced Tuesday that the trade had died, a
knowledgeable source said the deal was never close and actually had
been off the table ``for four or five days'' by the time the
details leaked out last weekend. &QL;

OLD AND NEW PAY OFF FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ This has been a season full of the unexpected
for the Angels, so Tuesday's game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
should have come as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have relied heavily on their core group of big
hitters, but they have collectively and suddenly gone into a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Enter an old man and two babies, relatively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight-year-old pitcher Tim Belcher went seven strong
innings and rookies Bengie Molina and Adam Kennedy provided most of
the offense as the Angels beat the Devil Rays 5-2 in front of
15,689 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's two-run triple in the seventh was the key hit of the
night. He also had an RBI single. Molina had three hits and the
Angels scored in each inning he had a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched a 1-2-3 eighth to set up Troy
Percival, who pitched a scoreless ninth for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the victory, the Angels remained six games behind the
Mariners in the AL West with 17 to play. The Mariners' magic number
to eliminate the Angels was reduced to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher gave up a two-run homer to Greg Vaughn in the second
inning, but that was it. He made only 74 pitches in his seven
innings, giving up five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I can do that every time,'' Belcher (4-2)
said. ``That was as pitch-efficient as I've been in a long time.
That's what I need to be good, the way I pitch now.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he was able to get through the night without an
effective splitter because he was able to spot his fastball and
slider enough. And giving up the homer to Vaughn didn't upset him
in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't pay to get too wrapped up in your mistakes,''
Belcher said. ``Since coming to the American League, I've learned
not to get too upset about giving up even as many as four runs
early in the game. Some games in this league are like beer-league
softball.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been the case with the Angels lately.
</P>
<P>
   It was the pitching that was supposed to determine the Angels'
fate down the stretch, but it was the hitting that went south in
the previous four games against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored a total of eight runs in the series. It would
be difficult to credit the Orioles pitching staff, considering its
ERA of 5.46 is second-worst in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Including Tuesday's game, the Angels core hitters _ Garret
Anderson, Darin Erstad, Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Troy Glaus _ are
hitting a combined .184 (16 for 87) with two RBI on the homestand
(five games).
</P>
<P>
   Enter Molina and Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not always going to get the middle of the lineup hitting
the ball out of the ballpark,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
``To score five runs with little ball, Adam and Bengie coming
through in RBI situations, that was a huge lift for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's was the biggest of all. With the Angels down 2-1 with
one out in the seventh, he lined a pitch from Bryan Rekar (6-10)
into the right-center-field gap for his team-leading 10th triple of
the season. It scored Anderson and Molina for the Angels' first
lead of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stalled a little bit,'' Kennedy said of the offense.
``But the bottom of the lineup the last couple of nights has been
able to produce a little bit and take the pressure off the rest of
the lineup.'' &QL;

 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The pulse is faint, but still there is a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a raw New York rookie stymied them in Fenway
Park, three days after Scott Brosius took Pedro Martinez deep and _
in the minds of many Red Sox fans _ ended all realistic hopes for
any comeback this season, the Red Sox are showing life. Pesky is
not just the name of a former Red Sox shortstop; it is the nature
of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every win is important,'' said shortstop Nomar Garciaparra,
once again proving to be the nemesis of nemeses to the Indians.
``We all know that. It's been like that all year for us. All we can
do is go out there and play hard and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night was a convincing 8-6 Boston win
over Cleveland as the teams began a staggering stretch of eight
games against each other in 10 days. The Indians' lead over the Red
Sox is now two games in the wild-card chase and, as Boston center
fielder Carl Everett put it, ``We've got to be close to perfect
from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Everett went further.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, we can't lose,'' said Everett. ``Every
game is big from now on. We're in a situation now where we can't
look at other teams. If we don't win, we don't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have squandered too many opportunities this season
for their fans to be drawn back so easily into a true September
playoff chase with merely consecutive wins over the Yankees and
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   So, while we wait for Boston to either spring back to life after
being pronounced comatose late Sunday afternoon in Fenway Park, or
head to late September anonymity, at least enjoy the entertainment.
And Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, the entertainment was plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: A third-inning fly ball to the warning track by
Cleveland's Robby Alomar with the bases loaded and none out that
resulted in monstrous gaffes by three players, two on Cleveland and
one on the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   First, Everett didn't even get his glove on the ball in deep
left center when he seemed ready to make a routine catch. It seemed
that, at the last moment, Everett might have been distracted by
left fielder Bernard Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much I was distracted,'' said Everett. ``I've
played with Gilkey before, so I've got to give myself the blame. I
called for it. I should have just ran on through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Everett didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that at least two Indians would score, with the ball
bounding free 400 feet from home plate, and perhaps all three.
</P>
<P>
   But first Nomar came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had his back to the plate when he took Everett's
relay in short left center and had no clue what he would see when
he turned to the plate. Least of all, Garciaparra didn't expect
that the speedy Kenny Lofton, who was on second when the play
started, might still be far from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just turned and I threw it,'' said Garciaparra, who let
loose a laser to catcher Jason Varitek. ``I wasn't able to look
behind me and see where (Lofton) was at.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lofton hadn't scored when Garciaparra threw the ball. In
fact, he not only slowed up as he approached the plate, but he also
didn't slide. All the while, Cleveland's next hitter, Manny
Ramirez, was the ultimate wooden Indian as he stood near the plate
and did not signal Lofton to slide. Lofton was easily tagged out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already talked to Manny,'' said Cleveland manager Charlie
Manuel. ``He's got to signal to Kenny to slide, but he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When all the gaffes had been weighed and measured, a possibly
huge Cleveland inning was reduced to a mere two-run rally, closing
Boston's lead to only 6-3. But after Red Sox starter Ramon Martinez
saw his gas tank show ``empty'' at the usual five-inning mark, Red
Sox relievers came on and shut down the Indians, who had crawled
back to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the Red Sox relievers.
</P>
<P>
   High comedy erupted in the bottom of the seventh when Boston's
Rod Beck rushed in from the bullpen, only to stop 100 feet from the
infield when he saw Hector Carrasco take the mound for a second
inning of relief. Beck returned to the bullpen in embarrassment,
only to be summoned back moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called down and they said I was in the game and I got hot
(warmed up),'' said Beck. ``So they open the gate and I was going
out there, and I see Hector's still throwing on the mound. So I
look in the dugout and (pitching coach Joe) Kerrigan waved me back.
So I went back to the bullpen, sat down, toweled off. I mean, I was
totally hot then. I was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little embarrassing when you run out there. It makes
you look like you don't know what the hell you're doing. I've seen
it happen to other guys before. But it's the first time I've done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck eventually was summoned back, pitched two strong innings of
scoreless relief, and could joke later about his comings and
goings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that they had told Hector he was done,'' said
Beck, ``and he didn't understand. That's all right. It worked out
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more hijinks erupted in the eighth when the Red Sox scored
two more runs, keyed by a Manny Alexander infield single after he
conked himself on the head with his own bat while trying to lay
down a sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I finally got the job done, move the runners over,'' said
Alexander. ``That's all that counts. Get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   And dead as they were Sunday evening in Boston, the new flicker
of life was aptly summed up by Red Sox designated hitter Dante
Bichette, who carefully reached into his locker and put on his Red
Sox cap before talking into the TV cameras about his two-run homer
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest thing about coming to a new team,'' said
Bichette. ``Trying too hard to make an impression too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the homer, Bichette felt he was part of the Red Sox.
The team that is, well, still alive and still pesky.

RED SOX SHOW LIFE IN SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Knockdown pitches. Home run dramas. Baseball
brinksmanship as two bitter rivals battled before a shrieking
sellout crowd for everything they staked their seasons on back in
the April chill.
</P>
<P>
   For all his steely restraint, even Red Sox manager Jimy Williams
could not help but distill his team's crucial showdown with the
Indians to its essence Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more of a playoff situation for us,'' said Williams,
who normally would rather suck exhaust in stalled traffic on the
Central Artery than discuss the burden of New England's unrequited
lust for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sox, who last year roared back from a 2-0 deficit to
steal the Division Series from the startled Indians, looked again
like Comeback Kids, as they stunned Cleveland, 8-6, in the opener
of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The victory narrowed Cleveland's lead in the wild-card struggle
to two games over the Sox, sending a scare through Indians country
with Pedro Martinez prepared to pitch the finale Thursday night.
Tomo Ohka starts Wednesday night for the Sox in a game the Indians
would lose at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game we play against Cleveland brings back some very
good memories from last year,'' said Pedro's big brother, Ramon,
who earned the win because Boston scored enough runs to overcome
his shaky outing. ``It was nice to start on the right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   More than nice. With the Sox and Indians scheduled to play five
more games next week at Fenway, players on both sides viewed
Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night's game as the opener of an eight-game series that
will determine their fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge win,'' said closer Derek Lowe, who picked up his
33d save despite a fright in the ninth. ``The first game of any
series is big, but especially when you're playing Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for the Sox that their bats remained hot a second straight
night. The night before, they rode a pair of two-run homers past
the Yankees in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, they pummeled Cleveland's talented lefty
starter, Chuck Finley, for six runs in a third-inning thrashing
that helped spare Martinez from defeat. After Manny Alexander drew
a one-out walk, the Sox banged out five straight hits: a perfectly
executed hit-and-run single by Darren Lewis, singles by Jose
Offerman and Nomar Garciaparra, a double by Carl Everett, and a
413-foot home run by Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck got the ball up a few times,'' Bichette said with a
touch of understatement, ``and we capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were philanthropic, too. In Cleveland's half of the
third, for instance, Martinez and Everett helped the Indians narrow
their deficit. After Martinez gave up a single to Sandy Alomar,
walked Kenny Lofton, and hit Omar Vizquel in the backside to load
the bases, Roberto Alomar lifted a high fly to the warning track in
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Bernard Gilkey and center fielder Everett camped
comfortably under the ball but then Gilkey deferred to Everett, who
waved at the ball as it dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The error allowed Sandy Alomar to score, making it 6-2. Lofton
might have scored, too, but Garciaparra's relay from Everett to
catcher Jason Varitek nailed him, in part because Lofton did not
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel landed at third on the play and scored on a ground out
by Manny Ramirez, cutting the lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a couple of mistakes and those are the kinds of things
that can't happen,'' Lewis said. ``Fortunately, we made up for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But first Cleveland lurched back, making it 6-5 in the sixth, as
Martinez gave up a leadoff double to Roberto Alomar and a jarring
home run to Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   For Ramirez, who drove in four runs, the home run was his 28th.
And he increased his RBI total to 98 in 96 games.
</P>
<P>
   The blast also knocked Martinez out of the game. He gave way to
lefthander Rheal Cormier, who retired Jim Thome and David Segui on
grounders for the first two outs of the sixth. And righthander
Hector Carrasco, in his Sox debut, induced a ground out from Travis
Fryman to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rod Beck pitched scoreless relief in the seventh
and eighth as Sox relievers mowed down 10 straight Indians before
Lowe ran into trouble in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Beck said the Sox are on a mission. ``We've got to win them all,
every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox made up for their errors in the eighth, when they scored
two runs on a double by Brian Daubach, a single by Manny Alexander,
a walk to Midre Cummings, and a sacrifice fly by Everett. That made
it 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team that panics,'' Lewis said. ``We stay positive
whether we win two or three games in a row or lose two or three
games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, because there was cause for concern in the ninth.
With two outs, Lowe yielded a double to Travis Fryman and a
run-scoring single to Russell Branyan, making it 8-6. Branyan
reached third when right fielder Trot Nixon let Branyan's ball roll
past him to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Sandy Alomar, the potential tying run. But Lowe induced
him to ground out to preserve the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely scary,' Lowe said. ``But it shows why every
run is so precious against a good team.''

 &HT;    ELIAN'S HOME TOWN A HAVEN A PRIVACY
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ There are no lawyers running to the
microphones, no angry protestors holding vigil, no banners or
posters or hordes of camera-wielding journalists.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Elian Gonzalez and his family like it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, the young shipwreck survivor was perhaps
the most famous 6-year-old in the world. Caught in the center of a
bitter custody fight between his Miami relatives and his Cuban
family, Elian became a symbol of the decades-old conflict between
communist Cuba and its capitalist neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is just another student at Marcelo Salado(cq) primary
school, one of hundreds dressed in identical red, white and blue
school uniforms, running and shouting in the school's spacious
courtyard between classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very touching to see this family come full circle,'' said
Bob Edgar, head of the National Council of Churches, the American
group that worked to see Elian returned to Cuba during his
eight-month stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar headed a small delegation that visited Cardenas recently
to present 1,500 packets containing pencils, paper and other
supplies to schoolchildren in the area. Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and his two grandmothers attended the brief presentation
ceremony at Cardenas's museum, just across the street from Elian's
school.
</P>
<P>
   Elian did not attend, but it was still an emotional reunion for
Edgar, who helped arrange a visit by the boy's grandmothers to the
United States in January in a failed attempt to see Elian returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing great,'' Edgar said, following a brief private
meeting with the family. ``Juan Miguel said when he takes Elian to
school now on his bicycle, people leave them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's return to Cuba in July, the Cuban government has
kept the Gonzalez family under tight security. For the first
several weeks, they reportedly lived in a boarding school in
Havana, and then took a vacation at a Cuban beach resort.
</P>
<P>
   Film footage of Elian frolicking at the beach was made
available, along with coverage of his first day at school.
Otherwise, there has been no media access to the boy or his family.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy is in sharp contrast to their experience in the
United States, where gangs of reporters dogged their every move,
camping out for months in front of the modest home in Miami's
Little Havana where Elian lived with his Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government complained bitterly that the Miami
relatives were abusing Elian by parading him before the cameras. It
appears Cuban dictator Fidel Castro is determined not to let his
enemies in the Cuban exile community make the same charges now that
Elian is back home in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has met with the boy and his family, but no film or
photographs of the meeting have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for Americans who witnessed the media onslaught
and political circus that surrounded Elian in the United States to
imagine the boy will ever have a normal life again. But if such a
recovery is possible, Cardenas may be the ideal setting.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it Elian's home, it's also about as far removed from
the hustle and fervor of South Florida as you can get. A gritty
industrial town of 20,000, Cardenas's narrow, dusty streets are
lined with dilapidated buildings.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sleepy central square fronting the museum, but on most
hot summer afternoons, it stands vacant. The downtown streets are
lined by modest homes with adjoining walls. Wooden doors open into
small homes that usually feature a courtyard or patio in the back.
</P>
<P>
   There are more bicycles and horse-drawn carts than cars in
Cardenas. Old women talk to neighbors through open doors or
windows, some sharing a small cup of rich, black Cuban coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents seem happy that the furor over Elian has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is calm now and that's so much better,'' said
Conchita Rodriguez(cq), a grandmother who lives a few blocks from
Elian's school. ``I have grandsons, too, and it wasn't right for
the boy to be separated from his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian left Cardenas last November, taken by his mother, who
drowned along with 10 other people after their small boat capsized
off the Florida coast. Elian was found alone, floating in an inner
tube, on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Since his recent return to school in early September, Elian
appears to be living the routine he knew before he left Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say the family is still dealing with the loss of
Elian's mother and their bitter feelings toward the Miami
relatives. The Miami branch of the Gonzalez family accused Elian's
father of abusing the boy and his mother, and made a controversial
video of Elian telling his father he didn't want to go back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father and mother were divorced, but his father has
remarried, and Elian has a half-brother who will soon celebrate his
first birthday. Edgar said the family was looking forward to the
celebration as another step in its return to normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas's residents appear ready to help the process along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so happy because all is tranquil now,'' said
Migdalia Davilas (cq), who lives half a block from Elian's school.
``He's the most famous person ever to come from Cardenas, but we
all want to let him be just a little boy.''

WORD LOVERS AS THICK AS GRAPE VINES 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The literary connection sometimes goes this way: You get the
name of a book agent from your dog's vet who has another client
who's a writer and just sold his manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Or the bartender, who is writing a book, has a brother-in-law in
L.A. who sometimes looks at scripts.
</P>
<P>
   To live in an area that is ripe with writers and artists is a
lucky thing. It is almost as good as living where there are fields
of lavender and olive oil festivals and where you can go
wine-tasting by bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Writers and artists are natural resources but we don't see them
doing their work by the side of the road or on stage. They do their
creating in solitude. They sit at home in their office or studio
where, you imagine, they wear rumpled pajamas and drink coffee all
day and don't comb their hair until they hear the Fed Ex truck in
the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   A region with a strong creative community never lacks for a poet
or playwright to visit their classrooms. You can usually find at
least one book store in every town, and often a used-book store as
well. Book readings are sometimes standing room only.
</P>
<P>
   Copy stores are popular. So are libraries. In a writer-friendly
place you can walk into the post office with a fat brown envelope
addressed to New York and the clerk pats it and whispers ``good
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a region that nourishes the arts, you can see
original art on restaurant walls that change monthly and you
sometimes know the name written in the corner. Maybe it's the woman
who cuts your hair or the guy you always see at the farmers'
market.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance that one of your favorite authors also teaches
writing at the junior college, and that you will run into him at
the gym.
</P>
<P>
   While it is said that in L.A. every waiter is a would-be actor,
in Sonoma County he or she is often doing something with a pen or a
brush on the side. But so might be your plumber or your therapist
or the woman down the road who raises sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have more artistic types than we have varieties of
heirloom tomatoes. If we could bottle our creative juices we might
rival the size of the wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   The first annual Sonoma County Book Fair happens on Saturday,
Sept. 16 and it's a pretty big deal for local writers and readers
and anyone who loves words. To have enough writers, poets, book
sellers and small publishers to fill a daylong event is a more
exciting sign of growth, in some people's minds, than a new uptown
store at the mall or another six-plex movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are 70 writers booked for the fair, and while I should
disclose that I get to be one of them, just think of that number.
Seventy people _ plus all the missing ones hiding in the woods or
spending their royalty check (ha!) in Antibes _ who call this
region home and are published writers.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be correct to say they make their living at it,
because the ones I know also teach and bartend and work in offices.
But they definitely make their passion from it.
</P>
<P>
   A celebration of the printed word comes at a good time because
writers and artists are feeling endangered these days, by whatever
threat or blessing comes from the huge world of the Internet and by
the limiting world of Wine Country real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The very things that inspire people to walk into the woods or
along the shore with a sketchpad or notebook move people with lots
of money to locate here and build big expensive houses. The wild
Pacific, magical redwoods and adorable cows are still free to look
at but the land costs a bundle, and this is bad news for inventive
types who once could live cheaply and do their art.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that as more money comes into the area which might
go toward such things as original art and patronizing book stores,
fewer original artists can afford to live here.
</P>
<P>
   If you're working 12 hours at a dot-com job you don't come home
and write novels.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have huge name writers living in Sonoma County. You
have to get closer to the Golden Gate to run into Isabel Allende
and go deep into Mendocino County to call Alice Walker your
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But we have Jean Hegland, who lives in the hills outside of
Healdsburg and who, one day in 1997, on her way to taking her kids
to piano lessons, found out her first novel, ``Into the Forest,''
was the subject of a New York bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   We used to have the late Suzanne Lipsett in Petaluma, who was
famous for introducing writers to writers at potlucks at her home.
She wrote a piece about sitting at her computer on her glassed-in
porch at 5 a.m., her family asleep, her only company the fog and
silent pasture.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of thing writers get from living here. And give
back.

MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS STIR UP BIOTECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flush with cash and high stock valuations, biotechnology
companies are seeing a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions that
analysts say rivals any during the industry's 25-year history. And
analysts say the trend is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone, the industry has seen three takeovers, most
prominently Genzyme Corp.'s $1 billion acquisition of GelTex
Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The other big deals this week include Human Genome Sciences
Inc.'s buyout of Principia Pharmaceutical Corp. for $120 million,
and Elan Corp.'s $1.8 billion deal to acquire Dura Pharmaceuticals
Inc. Human Genome is based in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are the most recent in a new wave of consolidation
among biotech companies. This year, there have been 60 biotech
mergers and acquisitions, according to Recombinant Capital Inc., a
San Francisco consulting firm for biotech companies. During the
same period last year, there were 35 such deals.
</P>
<P>
   Industry giants like Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass. are scooping up their smaller brethren to fill
pipelines and position themselves as the pharmaceutical companies
of the future. Smaller biotech companies like Antigenics Inc. and
Aquila Inc. are merging complementary technologies to gain
competitive muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who have yet to compile the number of deals this year,
say the increased activity is a sign of good times _ and a maturing
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The sector's strong performance on Wall Street in recent months
has helped biotech companies raise money and craft financially
attractive deals. Bigger companies that a decade ago focused
resources on in-house research and development are now looking to
expand their capabilities. Smaller companies are realizing they are
more likely to succeed by joining forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, biotech companies gave away much of a drug's
profits in partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies to gain
access to cash, sales and marketing resources. But as companies
mature today, they are realizing that they can have more productive
mergers with other biotech companies, said Mark Speers, managing
director of Health Advances Inc., a Wellesley management consulting
firm for life sciences companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the larger companies have substantial marketing and
sales infrastructures they didn't have a decade ago, Speers said.
Even some smaller companies have products on the market and other
promising drugs in their pipelines. And biotech executives believe
other biotech companies will have more respect for their companies'
products, Speers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of this is biotech strutting its new-found
independence,'' said Kevin Starr, chief financial officer for
Millennium. ``For years, the biotech industry has invested billions
in research and development and that is finally starting to bear
some fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions are a key element of Millennium's
strategy as the company transitions from a gene discovery to a
full-scale pharmaceutical company, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions allow the company to quickly add capabilities that
would take years to build in-house. With its recent acquisition of
Cambridge Drug Discovery, an English company, Millennium added 150
chemists to work on its pipeline. Buying Leukosite Inc. of
Cambridge infused Millennium's pipeline with drugs in late-stage
development. Over the next decade, Starr predicts Millennium will
average as many as three acquisitions a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be increasingly important in building the
company and building the industry,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Elan's acquisition of Dura Pharmaceuticals allows the Irish
company to double its US sales force and gain Dura's antibiotics
and medicine-inhaling system. Genzyme's takeover of GelTex of
Waltham, mass.gives the company sole ownership of Renagel, a kidney
dialysis drug Genzyme, of Cambridge, expects to become its biggest
moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller deals, like the one struck by Antigenics of New York
and Aquila of Framingham, Mass. last month, companies can combine
technologies in a way that strengthens them both, said Alison
Taunton-Rigby, Aquila's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Though Aquila had a rich pipeline, Taunton-Rigby said, the
company was too small to gain Wall Street's attention. By merging
with Antigenics, she said, the company gains the scale it needs to
advance. And, she said, Antigenics gains Aquila's products and its
partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Taunton-Rigby said she has also seen genomics companies buying
other biotech concerns to acquire technologies they need to turn
reams of information about the human genome into pharmaceutical
products. The companies need those technologies, they don't have
the time to build them, but they do have a lot of cash because of
the excitement about genomics, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By hook or by crook, biotech companies somehow manage to keep
going and create value during the hard times,'' she said. ``But now
you've got companies with their stock prices in a good place. So
people feel more comfortable doing deals.''

FIRMS READY TO MARKET UP TO NINE NEW DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a couple of slow years, Massachusetts biotechnology
companies may get the green light to market as many as nine drugs,
including one produced in goats' milk and another from cows, in the
next year to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have spent more than $200 million and taken
seven to 10 years to develop and extensively test their proposed
medications before asking the US Food and Drug Administration for
marketing approval. Others have acquired promising drugs or bought
companies to get access to near-term drug candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more than 370 biotech drugs are in various stages of
testing for the treatment of more than 200 diseases, a
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America survey shows.
More than half have been developed to treat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, relatively few will reach the brass ring of FDA
approval. Only 92 biotech drugs gained FDA approval between 1982
and 1999, according to the Biotechnology Industry Organization, an
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And while 20 percent of those approvals were for drugs from
Massachusetts biotech companies, there have been relatively few
drugs reaching the market in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston area has been one of the most productive in
delivering biotech drugs to the market, but in recent years there
has been a gap after the bigger companies like Genzyme, Biogen and
Genetics Institute delivered their first drugs,'' said John
Maraganore, vice president of strategic product development at
Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech industry is entering a more mature phase, where
products will come out,'' Maraganore said. ``But it is also a
question of timing as the pipeline of forthcoming drugs is getting
larger.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, only one drug, Welchol, a cholesterol-lowering
drug from GelTex Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Waltham, has gained FDA
approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the next 12 to 15 months, six Bay State companies
will seek FDA approval to market drugs. Two of the drugs are
designed to treat Fabry disease, a rare inherited disease. Others
are a blood thinner for patients undergoing cardiovascular
operations, a treatment for a common form of adult leukemia, a pair
of infertility treatments and another multiple sclerosis
medication.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, all of the biotech drugs coming out of
the state are targeted at small patient populations _ 2,000 to
100,000 people _ that have few choices of medication. Campath from
Millennium is aimed at about 10,000 to 20,000 people with adult
leukemia whose first and second lines of treatment have failed and
who have no further recourse.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Genzyme Transgenics is preparing to ask the FDA next
year for permission to market a drug made in the milk of goats that
prevents blood clots in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass
operations who are resistant to heparin, a widely used blood
thinner. If approved, it will be the first drug developed from a
herd of goats.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest race to supply a life-saving drug to
patients with a rare disease is between Genzyme Corp. and
Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. Both are battling to provide an enzyme
replacement therapy to between 2,000 and 4,000 men with Fabry
disease, a rare inherited disorder with no treatment currently
available. FDA approvals are expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But in fulfilling the unmet medical needs of these patients,
some biotech companies also are prospering. Genzyme's revenues from
its treatment of Gaucher's disease, which affects about 3,000
people worldwide, are expected to surpass $500 million this year.
And last year, Biogen's Avonex, a treatment for multiple sclerosis
used by 90,000 patients, had revenues of $619 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Genzyme Corp. said it foresees turning Renagel, a
treatment for kidney disease that had revenues of nearly $20 milion
last year, into a billion-dollar blockbuster in the next 10 years.
Genzyme is spending more than $1 billion to acquire GelTex, which
developed Renagel.
</P>
<P>
   For Genzyme, Renagel also marks a transition from developing
drugs for small patient populations to developing drugs for much
larger groups, such as the 1 million patients worldwide with
late-stage kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   Also hoping to expand with a mainstream drug next year is
Biopure Corp., which has spent 16 years and $330 million to develop
a human blood substitute. Called Hemopure, it is made from the
hemoglobin cells of cows. Instead of human blood, Biopure has
developed an oxygen-carrying blood substitute that can be stored at
room temperature, requires no tissue typing and can replace human
hemoglobin initially in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery,
such as hip replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, we are getting down to the wire and we
are excited about the prospects,'' said Carl W. Rausch, founder,
chairman and chief executive of the Cambridge-based company that
has tested Hemopure in 750 people.

BUSINESS DEALS INVOLVING GENOMICS ON THE RISE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Biotech companies are mining the human genome, hunting for
potential drug targets, and making daily discoveries about the role
of genes and proteins in disease. Pharmaceutical companies need the
emerging science and technology to fill their pipelines. And they
can't get their hands on it fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   So pharmaceutical companies are striking deals with their
smaller, younger biotech brethren in record numbers. In the first
half of this year, business deals involving gene-related data and
technology rose 70 percent over the same period last year,
according to Cambridge Healthtech Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people have begun to recognize about genomics is that
it's an information business, and it just happens to be information
that is critical to being able to move forward,'' said Phillips
Kuhl, the institute's president.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Healthtech, a Newton group that researches the biotech
industry, tracks drug discovery and development deals. It recently
released a report about genomics deals that took place between
January 1999 and March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of 1999, there were 165 genomics deals.
The number grew to 216 for the second half of 1999, and to 278 in
the first half of 2000. Most of those deals took place among a
handful of companies. In 1999, the report stated, 10 companies were
involved in about 40 percent of the deals.
</P>
<P>
   The big pharmaceutical companies realize they can't build the
genomics expertise they need fast enough to stay competitive, Kuhl
said. And the biotech companies benefit from the resources and
experience pharmaceutical companies provide in shepherding a drug
through clinical testing and into distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it moves the research forward,'' he said. ``It's
beneficial for everyone.''

   Biogen teams with Eos

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to jump-start its development of drugs to treat breast
cancer, Biogen Inc. has turned to Eos Biotechnology Inc. of South
San Francisco, a small company that in July announced it had
identified a group of genes linked to breast cancer based on a
working draft of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Under a four year research and development collaboration,
Cambridge-based Biogen will pay Eos as much as $55 million, not
including royalties on sales of products identified through the
agreement. Separately, Biogen will make a $5 million equity
investment in the three-year-old privately held company.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty bet on Eos stems from its proprietary technology to
select out from human genome data the actual genes that produce the
body's proteins. Eos used this data to create two gene chips
containing probes for more than 80 percent of the active human
genome. The company then compared gene activity in breast cancer
tissues obtained from patients in Australia and Europe with their
consent to that of normal health tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The result was specific genes found to be more active in the
cancer tissue than in the healthy cells, from which drug targets
are created and supplied by Eos to Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biogen will use our considerable knowledge and skill in
biology and drug development to work with Eos on identifying
potential targets and commercializing products,'' said James C.
Mullen, the Biogen president and chief executive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You might say Dr. Clive Meanwell is a bit of a scavenger.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he founded a business four years ago based on the
idea that there was money to be made off drugs other companies cast
aside. His start-up known as the Medicines Co. picks through and
rescues products languishing on shelves because of lackluster test
results, shifting corporate priorities, or development problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwell and his team of experienced pharmaceutical executives
in Cambridge, Mass. wanted drugs in late stages of development that
would take no more than four years and $60 million to get to
market. They needed three drugs in the pipeline to spread the risk,
each with the potential to generate at least $50 million in annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   They spent six months considering more than 3,000 drugs. They
knew their first choice would be critical to the future of the
company. If it worked, there would be money and resources for the
other drugs behind it. If it failed, it was doubtful the company
could survive, even if the pipeline looked promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be lucky. We might be better than average. But let's
assume we're not,'' Meanwell said. ``From a purely statistical
standpoint, we needed to start with five drugs. With a little
faith, three is OK. But if we were going with three, the first one
had to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwell and his team chose a blood thinner called Hirulog as
their first project. Biogen Inc., a Cambridge company that is among
the oldest and largest in the biotech industry, had abandoned
Hirulog after spending six years and $150 million developing it as
a potential replacement for heparin, widely used to prevent blood
clots that lead to heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hirulog had been expected to be a blockbuster drug. But when
results of a broad-based clinical trial showed it offered only
small improvements over heparin, Biogen scuttled the project. The
company would have to charge a relatively high price for Hirulog to
recoup its investment and cover its manufacturing costs. Given the
test results, Biogen feared it couldn't compete against the cheaper
heparin. Rather than invest more in Hirulog's development, the
company decided to cut its losses and shelve the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Where Biogen's executives saw disappointment, however,
Meanwell's group saw opportunity. The results of the clinical trial
showed Hirulog was as effective as heparin, and somewhat safer. It
has potential as a treatment for various cardiac conditions. And as
a smaller company with less infrastructure to support, the
Medicines Co. could afford to accept lower profit margins from the
drug than a company like Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of skepticism from outside folks was high,''
Meanwell said. ``No one is going to look at Biogen and say they are
wrong. They're a highly successful company. The first question
everyone asked was, `Why did Biogen give up the drug?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At times, during the Medicines Co.'s three-year struggle for
regulatory approval, the choice seemed a poor one to investment and
industry professionals. Manufacturing issues promised to make the
drug expensive to produce. A Food and Drug Administration panel
initially rejected the company's request to approve the drug for
marketing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the drug's prospects _ and the company's _ are
greatly improved. The company received an ``approvable'' letter in
May from the FDA, indicating the agency's willingness to give
approval once some final conditions were met. The company met the
conditions and is now awaiting approval for the drug, renamed
Angiomax.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the drug to be launched early next year. They
estimate sales of $21 million in the first year, growing to $91
million by 2003 and leading the company into profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've followed the drug's history, which has been long and
rocky,'' said Dr. Steven Gerber, managing director of CIBC World
Markets. ``But we firmly believe that it's going to be approved
now. We think it's going to be a product that leads to better
patient outcomes and saves the health care system money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the drug nears FDA approval, Dr. Burt Adelman, Biogen's
vice president of medical research, said the decision to sell the
rights to Hirulog to Meanwell's group was the right one for both
Biogen and the Medicines Co. The drug wasn't a good strategic fit
for Biogen, he said, but it was perfect for the Medicines Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating and perhaps soon-to-be proven business
model,'' Adelman said, ``that you can find products reasonably far
along in development that no longer fit with the mother company and
do what is necessary to complete the process and take them
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwell's isn't the only company that specializes in drug
salvage. Gerber of CIBC World Markets said there are a handful of
similar companies. Gerber believes the strategy is a good one.
There is often less risk associated with late-stage products, and
as companies have merged and altered pipelines, the pool of
potential products has grown.
</P>
<P>
   But others point out that drug salvage is still a risky
business. Late-stage development is cash intensive, and there is no
guarantee that the product will get to market. Some drugs have been
shelved because problems arise that require more scientific
refinement or testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicines Co.'s second drug, a nasal spray for the treatment
of migraine headaches, ran into just such a problem. Although
Meanwell knew about the problems before buying the drug, he and his
colleagues underestimated the investment of time and money required
to resolve it. They decided to halt its development while looking
for a partner to help with the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug might not work,'' Meanwell said. ``But it has a lot
of promise. The fact that we've put it on hold for now is a sign of
our discipline rather than a sign of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the company also acquired a third product _ a
naturally occurring lactobacillus in late-stage clinical testing
for the treatment of a common gynecological infection known as
bacterial vaginosis.
</P>
<P>
   The company also completed an initial public offering last
month, raising nearly $100 million. And the stock has held its
value at roughly $21 a share, up 30 percent from its offering price
of $16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line between being an abject failure and seeing
the beginnings of success,'' Meanwell said. ``The funny thing is
that our original business plan said we'd launch our first drug in
the year 2000 and that we'd need to raise $120 (million) to $200
million. The outline turned out to be about right. But we got all
the details wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When the company bought Hirulog, or Angiomax, in March 1997 for
$30 million, including all future royalties, Meanwell expected to
accelerate the timeline laid out in the business plan.
</P>
<P>
   He and his group had run Biogen's data by the top doctors and
researchers in cardiology. They'd also reanalyzed the data and
found Angiomax decreased by almost half the number of patients who
suffered complications, such as excess bleeding, heart trouble, and
even death. The reduction in complications would save hospitals an
average of $750 per patient, the company estimated, giving Angiomax
a significant market advantage over heparin.
</P>
<P>
   But when the company presented its findings to an FDA panel in
fall 1998, the panel rejected the company's request for approval to
begin marketing the drug. The FDA wanted additional testing,
especially among high-risk patients.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent the company into what Meanwell now describes as
``a long, cold winter.'' Phone calls from people interested in the
company dwindled from an average of 40 a day to four. Money from
investors who just months earlier had dumped as much as $36 million
into the company dried up. The company's public image _ and its
confidence _ was shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I underestimated how devastating that kind of news can be for
a small company,'' Meanwell said. ``But it also becomes a sort of
defining experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't the drug, Meanwell said. The problem was that
he and the company's other executives weren't adequately prepared
for the rigors of the regulatory process.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken nearly two more years, additional clinical testing,
and a lot of conviction to finally meet those demands. Meanwell
believes the company has fulfilled all of the additional requests
outlined in the FDA's ``approvable'' letter. If it has, it should
receive FDA approval by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug salvage is a tricky area to play in,'' Meanwell said.
``It has its own type of risk, a different type of risk. You have
to have a thick skin. If you fail, there are lots of people to come
along and say: `We told you so.' ''

 &HT;    Hey, Bush, didn't I make your A list?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential candidate George W. Bush called New York Times
reporter Adam Clymer a ``major-league'' body part that faces south
when you're headed north. Bush apparently didn't know the
microphone was on.
</P>
<P>
   This is good for a couple of reasons. If Bush is elected, it
will elevate the office of the -- residency from groping to popping
off. We're going from happy hands to happy lips, an obvious
improvement. ``Read my lips. You're an (at)$%&AMP;!.'' Also, this could
lead to a more exciting style of speechifying among our
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bush when he knows the mike is on: ``My fellow Americans ...''
</P>
<P>
   Bush when he thinks the mike is off when it's really on: ``Why
don't you Democommies in the third row stick it where the sun don't
shine?''
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if the gaffe hurt Bush politically, because calling a
journalist a big jerk is like pointing out that elephants are
large. We in the journalism business are big jerks and darned proud
of it. We're paid to be big jerks. Hey, it's not a good day for me
unless I've made someone want to lunge for my throat. So if Bush
wanted to call somebody a bad name, he picked the right profession
to target.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he'd said, ``Hey, there's Sister Mary Rosencranz, that
major-league (at)$&AMP;! from over at St. Patrick's Cathedral,'' it
might not have been received so well by the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Bush scored political points with me when he came
out and called the New York Times reporter a whatchamacallit. It
shows the man is human. It leads me to believe the guy may know how
to shoot pool. I like the idea of a president who goes around
telling Little Johnny You Know Who jokes from the third grade when
he thinks the sound has been cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this Rose Garden entrance if Bush is elected president:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``Ladies and gentleman, the president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``There once was a girl from Nantucket ...''
</P>
<P>
   Or how about a State of the Union -- ddress that starts, ``So
this giraffe walks into a bar ...''
</P>
<P>
   Has anybody considered the possibility that Bush decided to
lapse into vulgar language because he's trying to land Bobby
Knight's old job?
</P>
<P>
   There is one aspect of the incident that I find troubling: It
proves that Dick Cheney is a yes man with a brown nose. After Bush
called Clymer a _ and I'm lapsing into pig Latin here _ sass aye
ole hey, Bush's running mate responded on cue, ``Yeah, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   This tells me that George W. could say just about anything, and
Dick Cheney would bark on command. ``Hey, check out the legs on
that nurse.'' ``Yeah, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing I can't figure out _ and I guess I'm exposing my
big ego here _ is why Bush picked some chicken-bleep from New York
City to single out as the head major-league (at)$%&AMP; among writers.
New York City? How about giving some recognition to the hometown
coverage, George? What am I? Playing at the Double-A ball level or
something? I've been writing all this nasty stuff about George W.
Bush since he started running, and I don't even get a nod from the
guy? Hey, George, dance with the ones that brung you.

 &HT;    Threats to punish entertainment industry an assault on free
speech
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gloria Steinem is getting married and the Democrats want to
stifle smut.
</P>
<P>
   Wonders never cease.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem, 66, once said, ``A woman without a man is like a fish
without a bicycle.'' Now she has landed a 61-year-old,
twice-married entrepreneur named David Bale.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Steinem said that marriage ruins relationships. Now
she says her upcoming marriage proves ``that feminism is about the
ability to choose what's right at each time of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, good luck to her. I hope she is more right now than she
was then. And I envy her ability to choose what is right at each
time of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sinatra, I have regrets too many to mention.
</P>
<P>
   A turnaround more surprising than Steinem's marriage is the
threat by Democratic standard bearers Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman
to use the power of the government to crack down on the
entertainment industry if it fails to keep smut and violence out of
the hands of children.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for the threat was a Federal Trade Commission
report that said the entertainment industry markets smut and
violence to young people in spite of the industry's rating system.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the threat to punish the entertainment industry is a
result of letting voters know that God is going to be an active
participant on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants voters to know that he is going to be a moral
president, as opposed to you know who. That's why Gore chose
Lieberman to be the vice-presidential candidate. Lieberman
mentioned God 13 times in his first speech as born-again Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman want American voters to know that their deep
religious beliefs will be dedicated to make the United States more
moral, more godly, if you will, when they are elected.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising to hear Republicans take the religious high
ground and attack the cultural depravity of Hollywood and the
entertainment industry. Republicans have been playing the religion
card for years, especially since Ronald Reagan exchanged votes for
mainstream validation of televangelists on the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning against the moral pollution of America's youth is
not a profile of political courage. It's easy. It's like
campaigning against the abolition of motherhood and homemade apple
pie.
</P>
<P>
   Is there empirical evidence that America's young people have
been morally corrupted by the entertainment industry?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somewhere, but national statistics show that violent
juvenile crime fell 19 percent between 1994 and 1998. Juvenile
arrest rates for murder dropped 52 percent since 1993. Juvenile
violence has steadily decreased over the time that the FTC report
says the entertainment industry has been intentionally polluting
young minds.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Al and Tipper Gore launched a national campaign
against dirty lyrics in pop music, they did not call for punitive
legislation. Now Gore says he would support laws to punish the
entertainment industry for deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many kisses you blow at the First Amendment,
Gore's proposal would put the government in the position of being a
speech censor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who declared ``Jesus Day'' in Texas and continues to court
the religious right, jumped on the me-too bandwagon and stood
four-square against smut and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants voters to know that he would restore morality,
integrity and, supposedly, God's will to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Voters need to know that there are dangers when politicians put
God on their political tickets. Mixing church and state threatens
both institutions. Iran, after all, is one nation under God.

   HOUSEWORK-POLL _ Guys, you're busted. Throughout the South,
husbands are claiming to do more housework than wives claim their
husbands are doing. Men took more credit for cooking, laundry and
housework in general than women allowed, a new AJC poll of married
adults found. In the housework category, for instance, 40 percent
of men said they either do it themselves or are an equal partner in
the housework. Meanwhile, just 23 percent of women said men do it
all or equally. Paula Jhung, author of ``How to Avoid Housework,''
isn't surprised. ``I think housework is like sex in that people lie
about it a lot,'' she says. ``Everybody claims they're doing more''
than they are. (Miller, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH

   FOOD-LATE _ It's 5:30...do you know what's for dinner? If you're
stuck in rush hour and you haven't the foggiest idea, you've no
doubt got lots of company. But if you think your only alternative
is takeout or something dumped out of a can, think again. With the
help of five notable metro Atlanta chefs who took our 5:30
Challenge, we show you how to get a delicious made-from-scratch
dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes, with a recipe that
uses no more than 5 ingredients that requires only the simplest of
sides. With these streamlined recipes, you also spend less time in
the supermarket and washing dishes afterward. What more could you
ask for on nights you long for the comfort of a home-cooked meal
but can't bear anything mentally or physically taxing in the
kitchen? This will kick off a new weekly feature in the food
section called The Five:30 Challenge, in which we share some of our

 &HT;    Keep the car a sanctuary to call our own
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to give the Ford Motor Co. credit for trying to give
women what we want. For recognizing our power and might as
consumers and all that.
</P>
<P>
   But a new concept car designed to offer women literally
everything but the kitchen sink threatens to take away the one
thing we truly love about our cars: a place to call our thoughts
our own.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Windstar Solutions'' concept vehicle is a virtual house on
wheels, complete with Maytag washer and dryer, refrigerator,
microwave, trash compactor and wet/dry utility vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for people who always find themselves saying, `I
practically live in my car,''' said Linda Lee, manager for the
women's marketing and product office for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Promotional materials promise that ``a shirt or a
party dress could be washed and dried in 15 minutes'' in the washer
and dryer built into the rear cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   My personal and highly scientific marketing research resulted in
a resounding, ``No way!'' Women shuddered at the notion of giving
up the one place they are not required to ``multi-task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My car is my sanctuary, it's my own little place,'' said
Natasha Litvinova of Centerville. ``The car is my only place I
don't have to do anything except drive and enjoy my music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' groaned another friend. ``I cannot imagine
doing a load of laundry and heating last night's leftovers while
trying to spot one of those road signs that pop up just as you've
almost missed your exit.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept car debuted in April at the National Kitchen and
Bath Industry Show in Chicago and has been making the auto-show
circuit ever since. ``It all sounds pretty handy, but it's one more
place for you to work,'' said University of Dayton history
professor John Heitmann, who teaches a car culture class.
</P>
<P>
   That's a paradox, he noted, that mirrors the evolution of the
automobile in the women's movement: ``It's no accident that the
women's suffrage movement took off when women got behind the wheel.
Yet before the automobile, services came to the home. Now we go
everywhere to make our stops. It's freedom, but not really freedom.
One of the inherent contradictions of four wheels is the burden of
more tasks for mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Spare us, in other words, yet another time-saving invention that
ends up piling on stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we haven't gotten this far,'' sighed Montgomery County
Administrator Deborah Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   Ford seems to be bucking the trend that Feldman is witnessing
among friends and family: ``It seems people are trying very hard to
slow not only their own lives down but their kids' lives down. A
car like this says, 'We can do everything in our car.'''
</P>
<P>
   The most futuristic element is the ``Home Connection,'' which
would enable customers, using voice-activation technology, to
preheat the oven, inventory the refrigerator and monitor home
security systems. ``The controls to home might be nice, so you
could turn on the oven before you get home,'' Feldman admitted.
``But the things that are designed to avoid coming home, those I
wouldn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford spokeswoman Lee said that the washer and dryer component
isn't likely to leap the divide from concept to reality: ``With a
concept car, you stretch the envelope. We'd need to have a lot more
people raise their hands before we decided to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart move. We appreciate your thinking of us and all, but when
we peel out of the driveway, we want to leave our Maytag far, far
behind.

</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the Commission on Presidential Debates formed, and
how is it funded?
</P>
<P>
   A: Established in 1987, the commission is financed through
private contributions, according to information on its Web site
(www.debates.org/). It accepts no money from the government or
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   National Internet sponsors for the 2000 debates are AT&AMP;T, Sun
Microsystems, 3Com, Harris Interactive, Alteon WebSystems and
ZoneOfTrust. General debate sponsors are Anheuser-Busch, the
Century Foundation, the Marjorie Kovler Fund and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Each debate site agrees to pay $550,000 to stage the event. That
covers expenses for such things as production crews required for
the TV presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader, meanwhile, has
filed a suit to disallow corporate sponsorship of the debates.
Nader attorney Scott Lewis termed the debates essentially ``paid
advertisements subsidized by corporate contributions for those
candidates who participate in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people at the Emmy awards presentation Sept. 10 were
wearing yellow ribbons. What did they signify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ribbons (actually gold) were to show solidarity for union
members affiliated with the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists who work in commercials.
The two unions have been on strike against the advertising industry
since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Firestone had a problem with its tires back in
the late '70s or early '80s. Can you refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in 1978-79 that Firestone suffered through a major
product recall involving defective Firestone 500 radial tires. The
company ultimately recalled 13 million tires because of treads
peeling off.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone apparently knew about the problem as early as 1972,
but fought the government every step of the way in the subsequent
investigation. In December 1978, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration released an internal Firestone memorandum of
1972 in which one top Firestone official told another that problems
with steel-belted radials were so bad ``that we are in danger of
being cut off by Chevrolet because of separation failures.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reported at the time that the defective tires had caused
41 deaths and 65 personal injuries. Firestone lost almost $150
million in 1978, with the company losing market share because of
the incident. Weakened financially, it eventually was taken over by
Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We know the Boy Scouts' policy on homosexuality. Do the Girl
Scouts have an official policy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It's outlined in the organization's Blue Book of Basic
Documents (1994), said Lisa Hester of the Girl Scout Council of
Northwest Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The policy: ``The Girl Scout organization does not discriminate,
but we do not endorse any particular lifestyle and we do not
recruit lesbians as a group. We have firm standards relating to
appropriate conduct. We do not permit sexual displays of any sort
by our members. We do not permit the advocacy or promotion of a
personal lifestyle or sexual orientation. These are private matters
for girls and their families to address. Girl Scout volunteers and
staff must at all times serve as appropriate role models for
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' what are the ramparts in
``o'er the ramparts we watched''? No one has ever been able to
explain it to me.
</P>
<P>
   A: A rampart is an elevation or mound of earth raised as a
fortification to serve as a bulwark or defense.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the ramparts were at Fort McHenry, near
Baltimore's harbor. British naval forces bombarded the fort all day
Sept. 13, 1814, and almost all night. When Francis Scott Key saw
the American flag still flying over the walls of the fort as the
next day dawned, he was inspired to begin writing verses. His poem
was titled ``Defense of Fort M'Henry,'' and by November 1814 had
been published as ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the oil from Alaska go?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the General Accounting Office, 95 percent of
Alaskan oil is sold domestically; the remaining 5 percent is
exported to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That 5 percent is
roughly 60,000 barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
   The exporting of Alaskan North Slope crude oil originally was
banned as a condition for building the 800-mile pipeline. Congress
repealed the export ban in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that CNN's Judy Woodruff got her start at WAGA-TV in
Atlanta, but can you give us some details about her career?
</P>
<P>
   A: After graduating from Duke University in 1968, Woodruff, 53,
worked from 1970 to 1975 as a correspondent for WAGA, the CBS
affiliate in Atlanta, reporting on the state Legislature and
anchoring the noon and evening news.
</P>
<P>
   She then was an Atlanta-based general assignment reporter for
NBC News in 1975-76, and served as NBC News' White House
correspondent from 1977 to 1983. She also was chief Washington
correspondent for NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 she left NBC for public TV, serving as ``Frontline''
anchor and as chief Washington correspondent for ``The
MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.''
</P>
<P>
   She joined CNN in 1993. At present she is CNN's prime anchor and
senior correspondent and co-anchors, with Bernard Shaw, ``Inside
Politics'' and ``WorldView.'' She also co-anchors the Wednesday
edition of ``CNN NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   More information about Woodruff online:
www.cnn.com/CNN/anchorsreporters/woodruff.judy.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard of the ``rebel yell'' for many years, but have
no idea what it sounds like. Is it ``Yee-Haw!,'' ``Yahoo!,''
``Yippy-i- ay!,'' or what?
</P>
<P>
   A: None of the above. Originally used in combat in the Civil
War, and intended to strike terror into the hearts of the enemy,
the yell is described in Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and
Phrase Origins as loosely combining the turkey gobbler's cry with a
series of yelps.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, meanwhile,
describes the rebel yell as a prolonged, high-pitched,
blood-curdling cross between a yell and a scream, proclaiming it
impossibe to express in words.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that we're into a new hurricane season, can you tell me
if hurricanes occur south of the Equator? If so, what are they
called?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such powerful, swirling storms that begin over a warm sea
indeed do occur south of the Equator. And while the word
``hurricane'' can be applied to all such storms, they do have
different labels, depending on where they occur.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, they're called tropical cyclones near
Australia and in the Indian Ocean (south of the Equator). They're
known as hurricanes when they happen over the North Atlantic Ocean,
the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico or the Northeast Pacific
Ocean (north of the Equator). And they're typhoons if they occur in
the Northwest Pacific Ocean (also north of the Equator), west of
the International Date Line.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Isn't there another Bush brother in addition to George W. and
Jeb? Why do we never hear anything about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: In addition to Jeb, governor of Florida, George W. has two
other brothers: Neil, a management consultant in Texas; and Marvin,
a businessman in Virginia. He also has a sister, Dorothy Bush Koch.
All four siblings have let George W. have the spotlight lately,
although Marvin gave a TV interview and Neil appeared briefly on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' at the time of the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   If Neil Bush is the brother you're thinking of, he's generally
the least inclined to speak to reporters, probably because the
family feels like the media treated him harshly when he was caught
up in a savings and loan scandal. He was a director of the
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Colorado, which
failed in 1988, costing the taxpayers an estimated $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He was not charged with criminal wrongdoing, but agreed to pay
$50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil lawsuit lodged in 1990 by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Aug. 30, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 112.9
points. On Aug. 31, it gained 112.9 points. The media reported the
numbers, but not on the fact that they were identical. Is this not
considered news?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dow's balancing numbers two days in a row is a
coincidence with no economic implications whatsoever, said Myron
Greene, publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide. The reason it
wasn't reported is that nobody cared, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My students and I were wondering what the initials VDB and FG
on pennies stand for. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: The initials VDB, on Lincoln cents produced from 1909 to
1959, are for its designer, V.D. Brenner. FG is for Frank Gasparro,
who designed those produced since 1959.

</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the ages for Girl Scouts, Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts?
A recent article reported on Latina scouting beginning at age 5.
That seems awfully young.
</P>
<P>
   A: Girl Scouting has five levels, for girls from kindergarten
through 12th grades (or ages 5-18).
</P>
<P>
   Cub Scouting has four levels, for boys in the first through
fifth grades (or ages 7-10).
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouting is for boys who have earned the Arrow of Light
award or have completed the fifth grade or who are 11-17.
</P>

<P>
   Q: After all the publicity about the raising of the Confederate
submarine Hunley from Charleston Harbor, there's been no followup.
What, if anything, was found inside it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's not much to report. The Hunley has been moved to the
Lasch Conservation Facility in Charleston, but it hasn't yet been
opened, said Faith Colaluca of the Friends of the Hunley. It's
hoped that the public will be allowed to view the sub by the end of
the month. When available, updates can be found online at
www.hunley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The BatmanTV commercials for OnStar are awesome. Who plays
Batman and who plays the Joker?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actor Bruce Thomas (``Beverly Hills 90201,'' ``Veronica's
Closet,'' ``All My Children'' and others) is Batman; comedian
Curtis Armstrong (``Risky Business,'' ``Revenge of the Nerds,''
``Love Boat'' and others) is the Joker.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Young, OnStar's advertising manager in Troy, Mich., said
OnStar is the first enterprise granted permission to use
live-action Batman scenes with the approval of DC Comics and Warner
Bros., which own the rights to the character. Not only that, the
spots were filmed on sets used in the ``Batman'' movies, including
the Batcave, with its hydraulic gear to lift the Batcar into
motion. ``They felt like there was a tremendous link between Batman
and what we offer with OnStar,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The OnStar vehicle navigation system combines Global Positioning
System satellite technology and wireless communication to link the
driver and vehicle with a 24-hour command center in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any place online where can I find information about
traffic-related accidents and deaths in U.S. cities?
</P>
<P>
   A: Check http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/, the site for the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's believed that the recent Concorde crash near Paris was
caused by debris from another aircraft on the runway at Charles de
Gaulle Airport. Is there an FAA regulation on runway inspections in
the United States? What is the policy at American airports?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no specific Federal Aviation Agency requirement for
the number of inspections, or ``sweeps,'' a day at U.S. airports,
said agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. The term ``sweep,'' by the
way, means making a visual check of the runways for any debris that
might be present, not literally sweeping the runways.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there's no required number, it's routine for these
checks to be made at airports in the United States. At Hartsfield
International Airport in Atlanta, for example, such checks are made
daily between 7:45 and 8 a.m. and after any significant weather
event, such as high wind or a thunderstorm. Also, every time an
aircraft with a problem comes in, the runway is checked after it
lands to see if the aircraft lost any debris.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. airports might do something different, Bergen said,
but procedures would be similar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the Air Quality Index and what the color
codes mean? I frequently read and hear reports about a city's air
quality using such terms as code yellow, code range and code red.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Environmental Protection Agency's AQI scale uses six
categories to assess local air quality, based on values from zero
to 500.
</P>
<P>
   Code green, 0-50, means air quality conditions are good; yellow,
51-100, moderate; orange, 101-150, unhealthy for sensitive groups;
red, 151-200, unhealthy; purple, 201-300, very unhealthy; maroon,
301-500, hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   The AQI evolved from the Pollutant Standards Index, established
in 1976, said Colin Marquis, senior meteorologist at The Weather
Channel. It incorporated levels of ground-level ozone, particulate
matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Its
categories included good, moderate and unhealthful.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency revised the index in the
past few years and renamed it the Air Quality Index, Marquis
explained. The new scale, with color coding and associated
health-related cautionary statements, can be found online at
www.epa.gov/airnow/aqibroch/aqi.htmlozone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the Commission on Presidential Debates formed, and
how is it funded?
</P>
<P>
   A: Established in 1987, the commission is financed through
private contributions, according to information on its Web site
(www.debates.org/). It accepts no money from the government or
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   National Internet sponsors for the 2000 debates are AT&AMP;T, Sun
Microsystems, 3Com, Harris Interactive, Alteon WebSystems and
ZoneOfTrust. General debate sponsors are Anheuser-Busch, the
Century Foundation, the Marjorie Kovler Fund and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Each debate site agrees to pay $550,000 to stage the event. That
covers expenses for such things as production crews required for
the TV presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader, meanwhile, has
filed a suit to disallow corporate sponsorship of the debates.
Nader attorney Scott Lewis termed the debates essentially ``paid
advertisements subsidized by corporate contributions for those
candidates who participate in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people at the Emmy awards presentation Sept. 10 were
wearing yellow ribbons. What did they signify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ribbons (actually gold) were to show solidarity for union
members affiliated with the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists who work in commercials.
The two unions have been on strike against the advertising industry
since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Firestone had a problem with its tires back in
the late '70s or early '80s. Can you refresh my memory?

Alaskan oil is sold domestically; the remaining 5 percent is
exported to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That 5 percent is
roughly 60,000 barrels of oil a day.

   HOUSEWORK-POLL _ Guys, you're busted. Throughout the South,
husbands are claiming to do more housework than wives claim their
husbands are doing. Men took more credit for cooking, laundry and
housework in general than women allowed, a new AJC poll of married
adults found. In the housework category, for instance, 40 percent
of men said they either do it themselves or are an equal partner in
the housework. Meanwhile, just 23 percent of women said men do it
all or equally. Paula Jhung, author of ``How to Avoid Housework,''
isn't surprised. ``I think housework is like sex in that people lie
about it a lot,'' she says. ``Everybody claims they're doing more''
than they are. (Miller, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH

   FOOD-LATE _ It's 5:30...do you know what's for dinner? If you're
stuck in rush hour and you haven't the foggiest idea, you've no
doubt got lots of company. But if you think your only alternative
is takeout or something dumped out of a can, think again. With the
help of five notable metro Atlanta chefs who took our 5:30
Challenge, we show you how to get a delicious made-from-scratch
dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes, with a recipe that
uses no more than 5 ingredients that requires only the simplest of
sides. With these streamlined recipes, you also spend less time in
the supermarket and washing dishes afterward. What more could you
ask for on nights you long for the comfort of a home-cooked meal
but can't bear anything mentally or physically taxing in the
kitchen? This will kick off a new weekly feature in the food
section called The Five:30 Challenge, in which we share some of our
own 5-ingredient, 30-minutes recipes and invite readers to take the
challenge as well. (Langhenry, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

And, after focusing on football as a theme in his other novels,
there's not a single punt or pass in his latest, ``The Letter of

   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY KNIGHT: How in the world did this guy last as long as he
did? It's one thing to embarrass your employer by being an
arrogant, ill-tempered jerk _ but rubbing the boss's face in it?
</P>
<P>
   Not even Knight _ one of college basketball's all-time great
coaches _ was good enough at his job to get away with, in effect,
thumbing his nose at the president of Indiana University and the
``zero tolerance'' policy that the school had instituted regarding
Knight's outlandish behavior. The coach's latest offense _ grabbing
and intimidating a student who's not even a basketball player _
left IU no choice but to show Knight the door.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and another thing: Is Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban
really stupid/goofy enough to hire this creep? What would Knight do
for the Mavericks _ instruct the other coaches in the art of
strangling basketball players?
</P>
<P>
   TROY AIKMAN: I was an Aikman fan even before he was the Dallas
Cowboys' quarterback. I attended his news conference when he came
to North Texas with UCLA to play in the 1989 Cotton Bowl game, and
it was obvious even then that he was exactly what the then-lowly
Cowboys needed to climb back to the top of the football world.
</P>
<P>
   He fulfilled the promise, leading the Cowboys to three Super
Bowl championships and providing football fans with front-row seats
to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   But he's done enough. Nine concussions _ eight with the Cowboys
and one in college _ are more than enough. He should follow the
example of concussion-prone quarterback Steve Young, who finally
faced up to reality and retired.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: The Democratic candidate for president is up in arms
over a government report that reveals the shocking information that
Hollywood markets violent entertainment to kids who aren't old
enough to watch the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   How disingenuous can Gore get? He's raking in campaign
contributions from those evil Hollywood moguls almost as fast as
the moguls are raking in bucks from slasher movies. There were so
many Tinseltown titans running around that Democratic convention in
Los Angeles last month that the joint looked more like a movie set
than a convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is so horrified by Hollywood's marketing practices, why
doesn't he look over that list of contributors, identify the
culprits who aim violent trash at children, and order his campaign
money-changers to return every single one of those donations?
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: OK, so the Republican candidate got knocked off
stride by the amazing post-convention bounce that revived Gore's
campaign and turned what had been starting to look like a Bush
cakewalk into a race that's too close to call. It stands to reason
that when one candidate is up, the other one is down; it's no big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Bush to regain his footing, surprise the public and
the media with impressive performances in televised debates, and
surge back to the front as Election Day approaches. Bush is tougher
than he looks, folks; the man is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: The president declared himself ``cheerleader in
chief'' the other day and said he loves his new role promoting the
campaigns of Gore and first lady Hillary Clinton, who is running
for a U.S. Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a new candidate, and my party has a new
leader,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that's the good news. The bad news is that the new
candidate is Hillary and the new leader is Gore.
</P>
<P>
   OPRAH WINFREY: Gore showed up on Oprah's TV talk show the other
day, and it was touch and go to see who would outgush whom. The
hour was filled with frantic fawning and fanatical flattering.
Winfrey even cranked up some videotape of the Al-Tipper kiss at the
convention _ and provided play-by-play commentary on the Gores'
amazing ``jaw action.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to appear on the Oprah program next week. Do
you suppose that Winfrey will show the same enthusiasm and
deference toward the Republican hopeful that she offered the
Democratic candidate?

 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ About 10 years ago, I introduced my son Sam to
a legendary Oakland treat, an Original Kasper's hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   After a soccer or hockey game, I'd drive Sam to a tiny
triangular red brick-and-wood building in the Temescal neighborhood
of north Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, we stood in line, awaiting Harry Yaglijian's
attention. The wait was worth it, both for the scrumptious hot dogs
and for Harry's warm greetings. He flashed his impish grin at me,
but he really lit up when he saw Sam.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Harry long to remember that Sam, who was only 7
years old at the time, liked his hot dog plain _ no mustard, no
relish, no onion or tomato slices, no salt, no black or hot pepper.
I, on the other hand, ordered one ``with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry's friendliness was infectious. Legions of other Original
Kasper's customers apparently felt the same way about the hot dog
and Harry's personality. He had such a good ear for languages that
he often greeted customers in their native tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Four or five years ago, Harry was stricken by a stroke, but he
recovered enough to return to work. In early 1997, we were saddened
to learn Harry had had another stroke.
</P>
<P>
   This time, his affliction was more serious, and Harry no longer
was there behind the counter, lovingly slicing onions and tomatoes
to wedge into the hot dogs on buns he spread out in front of him on
a special slotted board, each slot holding a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Harry Jr., a musician and community activist, filled in
admirably for his dad, exhibiting the same friendliness to the
wildly diverse patrons. I would ask Harry the son how his dad was
doing and he'd be as positive as he could, but I sensed that the
elder Harry wasn't doing well at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, the end came for Harry Yaglijian, who was 85, a man
whose life story epitomizes the American Dream. Many stories have
been written about Harry and his wonderful Original Kasper's hot
dogs, but I was fascinated by stories his son told me shortly after
his dad's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Yaglijian was born in Armenia, the youngest of seven
children and the only boy. He was orphaned in 1915 when his parents
were killed by Turkish soldiers. He and five of his sisters managed
to reunite and spent the next nine years living in Russia, Syria,
Lebanon and Iran, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to emigrate to the United States, but couldn't, so
they went to Cuba instead, where Harry lived for about 15 years. He
came to the United States in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he was a cobbler. As a new American immigrant, he
became a gem cutter, nurtured by the tight-knit Armenian refugee
community in California.
</P>
<P>
   After serving time in the U.S. Army Air Corps _ he loaded bombs
and weapons onto fighter planes in Europe during World War II _ he
got married to the daughter of Kasper Koojoolian, an Armenian
immigrant who moved to Oakland from Chicago. Koojoolian started the
hot dog business that Harry eventually took over in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In his lifetime, Harry Yaglijian had four given names _
Harutiun, which means ``resurrection'' in Armenian; Muhammud, when
he was saved by an Arab Muslim woman named Fatima after his parents
were killed; Arturo, during his Cuban days; and finally Harry.
Actually, he took on a fifth name, Mr. Kasper's.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter what name he used.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was a very ecumenical man. He paid more attention to
who you were, not what you were,'' Harry Jr. said. ``He was honest
and good and open and friendly.''

<P>
   A perusal of recent issues of men's magazines reveals the latest
sex symbol is the female athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated features Olympic swimmer Jenny Thompson
topless with her hands covering her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   And Gear has a photo of the Australian women's soccer team, all
players completely naked with their arms and legs placed
strategically.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that this fascination with women athletes as
soft-core porn stars comes right as women are making enormous
strides in achieving parity with men in the Olympics. One step
forward, two long jumps back.
</P>
<P>
   At the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, more women will compete in
more sports with more media coverage than ever before. With 4,400
participants, women will represent a record 42 percent of the
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most exciting, women will be competing in what were once
exclusively male domains.
</P>
<P>
   New categories for women include weightlifting, pole vaulting,
water polo, tae kwon do and the triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   But the slew of wet T-shirt pictorials reveals a powerful
cultural bias. The American public is still uncomfortable seeing
women as successful athletes and celebrating them for embodying the
qualities that athletes possess. Magazines like Maxim are
undermining hard-won progress by reducing all female competition to
just another beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are valued for what their bodies can do, not how they
look.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are competitive, ambitious and they know how to win,
but those attributes just aren't ladylike. Photographing sports
superstars in lace panties and sheer camisoles keeps them safely
inside the parameters of womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   While girls learn early on they will be judged for their looks,
boys learn that athleticism equals attractiveness. Ever since high
school, the jocks were the big men on campus, a guy's skill made
him hot and the best player sealed his status by getting the
prettiest girl.
</P>
<P>
   The grown-up world isn't much better. Male athletes are
worshipped for their achievements. Joe DiMaggio won Marilyn Monroe,
and that wasn't because he looked good in his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   For women, athletic skill doesn't equal desirability. In a
capitalist world, the girl with the most money wins. Blond and
buxom tennis star Anna Kournikova makes $11 million to $15 million
in endorsements, though she has never won a professional
tournament. Her earnings equal those of Martina Hingis, who has
earned her money by winning 26 career titles, and are much more
than 43-time winner Monica Seles' $7.5 million or defending U.S.
Open champ Serena Williams' $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even a pretty female player isn't valued like a male player.
Tiger Woods gets $47 million; Michael Jordan, $40 million, and
70-year-old Arnold Palmer makes $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse is that men make big money because their sports make
more money from television contracts, but it's all a vicious
circle. When women aren't valued for their skills, aren't trained
properly and aren't celebrated the way male athletes are, they're
at a severe disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   While many call this just bad luck, the law calls it illegal.
More than 20 years ago, Title IX, which demanded gender equity in
sports funding, began to be enforced. A generation of women growing
up under it is a major reason why female athletes have been able to
make the advances they have.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this law, females make up only one third of
interscholastic and intercollegiate athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Summer 2000's gold medal favorite, Stacy Dragila, was once told
women don't have the upper body strength to pole vault. Today, pole
vaulting is the most popular new women's event, with Dragila
holding the world record.
</P>
<P>
   For reaching that record last summer, Dragila got only half the
$60,000 prize money that men get for the same competition. But, she
was able to generate more income and media coverage for her sport
by posing with other track and field women for a sexy calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics should be the one place where there truly is a
meritocracy, where women are rewarded for how high they can jump,
how fast they can run or how much they can lift.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, the rules are different for women. This summer,
along with their shotputs and discuses, female Olympic competitors
will need lipstick, good lighting and lingerie if they want to get
the gold.

&HT;     APPLE UNVEILS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer Inc. chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled a test
version of his company's newest operating system Wednesday at a
trade show in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, released the public beta Mac OS X
at the Apple Expo 2000, a gathering of European Mac enthusiasts
similar to the Macworld Expo held in San Francisco every January.
</P>
<P>
   A public beta is a test period preceding the launch of a new
line of software. Most software companies release a
close-to-finished version of their products, allowing their
tech-savvy customers to test it out and report any kinks or bugs
that remain.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, OS X, shorthand for operating system 10, will
feature a number of enhancements, according to Apple, including a
new interface called ``Aqua'' that features a watery look and feel.
The new operating system will also feature numerous graphics
additions and expanded crash-proofing features.
</P>
<P>
   The Macintosh faithful have been waiting anxiously for the
release of OS X, which was originally scheduled to be released in
late 1999. Apple delayed the launch, first saying it would come out
in early 2000, then putting it off even further. The official
version of OS X is now expected in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The delays have caused grumbling among the Mac community, but
Wall Street has learned to take software delays in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says it's late, but operating systems are hard
work,'' said analyst Daniel Kunstler, who covers Apple for J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Company. ``It's important to get them right. Compared to
the delays we've seen with other companies, these delays are
relatively trivial, and they haven't hurt sales of the Macintosh
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the iMac and its business cousin, the G4, have both been
selling well in recent months, according to Kunstler, spurred by
the release of the latest, greatest G4: the Cube. The 8-inch by
8-inch computer is small in stature but packs a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled last month, it is being marketed as a home computer in
size with super-computer strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going pretty well,'' Kunstler said. ``It appears
the Cube is doing very well, although I don't have hard data. My
general feeling from anecdotal evidence is that the Cube is
performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wouldn't be an Apple conference without some
controversy. A group of European Apple enthusiasts had planned a
protest during Jobs' opening keynote address, complaining that
Apple was not meeting their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints: Apple had canceled some localized versions
of the OS, and tight margins made it impossible for retailers to
turn a profit on the latest Mac products.
</P>
<P>
   According to a posting on the MacAddict.com Web site Tuesday,
the group had been appeased by representatives of Apple U.K. and
had canceled the protest.

 &HT;    Watch and learn during annual fall furnace inspection
 &HT;    By James Cumming
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - To those conscientious folks who are never late
with an oil change, who have a complete physical every year and who
keep track of everybody's birthday, this is a gentle reminder: It's
time to think about scheduling your annual furnace inspection and
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   To those who can't remember their last oil change, physical or
their birthdays, maybe this should be the year you finally do
something about the black smoke billowing from your registers.
</P>
<P>
   You can find companies that do inspections and cleaning in the
Yellow Pages under ``Heating Contractors.'' An annual furnace
inspection will help ensure that your system is operating
efficiently, and that it won't fail during the dead of winter when
you need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Also observing a furnace inspection and cleaning will help you
understand how your heating system works and how you should
maintain it between professional service calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all means, when the service technician is working, you can
watch and ask lots of questions,'' said Bill Michael, service
manager for Stevenson Heating and Air Conditioning in New Carlisle.
``If you don't know where your furnace filter is or how to clean it
or change it, the technician can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Tom Tanner, vice president of Tanner Heating and Air
Conditioning in Dayton, said their companies are fairly busy with
residential furnace service now, but the peak of the season is
around Oct. 1. If you call for a furnace inspection in early
October, expect to wait a few days to a week for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Fees vary between companies, but a typical cleaning and
inspection charge in this area is about $50 to $75 plus the cost of
parts if any are needed.
</P>
<P>
   If the fees worry you, consider the fact that if your heating
system goes out during the heating season, you'll end up paying
considerably more for emergency repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When furnaces break down, it seems like it's always at night
or on the weekends,'' Tanner said. ``Not only do you have to pay
extra to get a service worker out, you may also run into problems
getting repair parts. Our suppliers don't stay open all weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Heating and air-conditioning companies always charge for
emergency response, and you probably will pay an extra 50 percent
to 100 percent for a night or weekend service call.
</P>
<P>
   During a normal fall inspection, a technician should inspect the
furnace inside and out, check safety circuits, inspect and
lubricate moving parts and make sure the ignition system works
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said, for example, that one step in the inspection
process is checking the ignition sequence. Almost all the furnaces
built in the past 10 years were built without continuously burning
pilot lights, so when the thermostat calls for heat, first a pilot
light comes on, then a sensor detects the pilot light, then the
burner is lit, then the fan turns on.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical part of the inspection is checking for cracks
or other leaks in the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is the
part of the furnace that separates the chamber where combustion
occurs from the warmed air that circulates around the house.
</P>
<P>
   If the heat exchanger is damaged, dangerous carbon-monoxide
fumes can circulate through the house. Furnace-service technicians
usually can spot deterioration problems in a heat exchanger, but
ask the technician to use a carbon-monoxide detector at registers
to be sure the deadly gas is not circulating from an unseen leak.
</P>
<P>
   Your furnace technician also checks to see that the furnace is
operating at its rated efficiency. That begins with a visual
inspection of the flames; discolored flames or flames not at the
proper distance from the gas jets are indications of problems, and
the technician can make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   The technician also can measure how much the air has been warmed
as it enters the ducts leading to registers, another measure of
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But you, the homeowner, have the most important role in
maintaining your furnace's efficiency. Change or clean the furnace
filter using the schedule in your furnace's owners manual. Also
check the instructions that came with the filter you are using;
some filters should be changed monthly while others last longer.
</P>
<P>
   You can also repeat some of the routine maintenance checks your
technician performs. Notice how he cleans and lubricates the fan
motor, for instance. Also if your furnace has a pilot light, ask
how to relight it if it goes out.
</P>
<P>
   If you had any of the following problems last winter, your
furnace definitely should be serviced before you use it again:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You repeatedly heard strange noises while your unit was
operating. This might be a sign of poorly performing burners.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You noticed unusual odors such as the smell of gas or sulfur.
(The smell you may detect the first time you turn on your furnace
each year comes from accumulated dust and dirt being heated on the
heat exchanger or furnace coils, and that's normal.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Components on the furnace or pipes look burnt, corroded or
unusually dirty.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The flames over the natural-gas burners in the furnace were
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You experienced headache, nausea, fatigue or dizziness when
the furnace was operating. Flu-like symptoms that get worse when
you're at home and ease when you're outside can indicate the
presence of carbon monoxide in the house.

 &HT;    Religious groups blanket college campuses, hoping to recruit a
few good souls
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. - At the heart of Florida Atlantic University's
campus, along 200 yards of the concrete breezeway at the school's
annual ``Clubfest,'' an evangelical Baptist group handing out Cokes
vies for attention with a Boca Raton Kabbalah organization offering
Tootsie Rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, immersed in techno music from a nearby
fraternity trolling for members, a ministry for foreign exchange
students _ with pamphlets in Korean, Spanish and Russian _ is set
up across from a gay and lesbian support group. Interspersed
between two dozen more sororities, dance clubs and intramural
sports groups are representatives from the Fellowship for Christian
Athletes, the Catholic Newman House and the Jewish organization
Hillel, all making their pitches.
</P>
<P>
   At stake? Students like Lenny Marine, 20, a communications major
from Fort Lauderdale with an interest _ though not much of a formal
education _ in the religious and the spiritual. ``I was brought up
a little Jewish and a little Christian,'' Marine said. ``Basically
I believe in a god force, but I don't believe in a God that judges
people.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly defines a ``god force'' is something Marine is
trying to figure out. So to better discern what spiritual path _ if
any _ he will follow, he jotted his name and number down on the
sign-up sheet next to the Tootsie Rolls. Next week, it may be
Buddhism or Hinduism. ``I like the whole mysticism idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of such decisions are being made on college campuses
across the country, as students return to school and are faced with
an army of ministries determined to show them the light, save their
souls or just get them to Mass. Some of the decisions made will
change lives and alter spiritual trajectories. Others will be
forgotten by the end of the day. For the people manning the tables,
the competition to convert, attract or at least educate is intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is worried about how ... to protect their group from
other people who want to poach on their turf,'' said Andrew Walsh,
of the Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity
College in Connecticut. ``There's still an expectation in our
Protestant-based society that at about this time in your life
you're expected to declare some sort of adult declaration of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``(These groups) want to get their dibs in before their kids are
swallowed whole by hostile academic secularism.''
</P>
<P>
   College freshman away from home for the first time are at a
crossroads in their lives, and religious ministries know it. Out
from under their parents' wings, many will begin to question the
spiritual or religious foundations their parents may or may not
have laid for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had students come (who) say to me, `I'm literally
shopping for a religion,''' said Sharon Conley, a staffer with
InterVarsity, an evangelical Christian organization for college
kids and one of the women handing out Cokes at FAU. ``Those are my
favorites. I say, `Come check us out. See if Jesus stands up to his
claims.'''
</P>
<P>
   American religious leaders have been worried about college
freshman for 300 years. The YMCA and later the YWCA was born out of
an attempt to reach college students more than a century ago.
Entire institutions of higher learning have been built around the
premise that during young adulthood many people take a break from
their religious commitments. Campus ministries are designed to
prevent that.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Crusade for Christ, based in Orlando, Fla., is among the
largest such ministries in the nation. This year nearly 200,000
first-year students will receive ``Freshman Survival Kits''
consisting of a Bible, a video about alcohol or relationships and a
CD of Christian music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to provide them with answers to their spiritual
questions,'' said Nathan Dunn, director of communication for the
Campus Crusade for Christ. ``And they will have questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the student evangelists _ be they Muslim, Christian,
Jewish or Buddhists _ it is getting more difficult to seal the deal
with a generation sociologists say is more materialistic and
cynical and less philosophical than their baby boomer parents. In
1967, 83 percent of college freshman considered it essential or
very important to develop a meaningful philosophy of life. By 1996,
that had dropped to 42 percent, according to an annual values
survey conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at
UCLA. Meanwhile, the percentage of freshman who considered it
essential or very important to be very well off financially rose
from 44 percent in 1966 to 74 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this generation of freshman grew up being
taught the virtues of tolerance. As a result, few believe there is
only one path up the proverbial mountain. For them, their spiritual
search often leads to the mystical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's where the really important stuff is,'' Marine
said. ``It's what I'd like to learn more about.''

&HT;     GROUP URGES HALT TO COMPUTERS IN SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Traditional educational values have been
eclipsed by an obsession with technology in recent years, creating
an unhealthy learning environment for children.
</P>
<P>
   So says a coalition of doctors, educators and child development
specialists who have spent two years studying the role that
computers play in the education of children. These specialists are
calling for a temporary moratorium on computers in the lives of
children.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Alliance for Childhood, says in a report released
Tuesday that computers pose serious health hazards to children and
take away from the strong personal bonds with caring adults needed
for meaningful education.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists criticize teachers for placing an inordinate
emphasis on technology skills while ignoring the urgent social and
educational needs of low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``Fool's Gold: A Critical Look at
Computers and Childhood,'' computers are playing a major role in
reshaping children's lives at home and at school. ``Common sense
dictates we consider the potential harms, as well as the promised
benefit,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling for a moratorium on further introduction of
computers,'' said Edward Miller, an educational policy analyst,
former editor of the Harvard Education Letter and co-author of the
study. ``We are asking schools and parents to take a critical look
at what the kids are doing with the computers. Such a critical look
will reveal that most (computer) usage is a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the College Park, Md.-based alliance found that
major health hazards can result from overuse at an early age,
including repetitive stress injuries, eye strain, obesity, social
isolation, and, for some, long-term damage to physical, emotional
or intellectual development.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the research, you find that there's very
little evidence of significant gains in schooling,'' said Joan
Almon, a former kindergarten teacher who is the national
coordinator for the alliance. ``Computers have not led to the gains
one would expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of computers and the time children must spend with the
machines ``are displacing other programs,'' Almon said.
</P>
<P>
   Almon and Edwards are two of the 75 academic and professional
educators who are taking a closer look at the role technology holds
in the classroom. The group includes professors from Harvard,
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real underlying concern that individual people have
been a little afraid of standing up. As a group, they're willing to
say something,'' said Colleen Cordes, a co-author of the report.
``Our real hope is to open a national conversation on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years of research on educational technology has produced
just one clear link between computers and children's learning, the
group contends. Drill-and-practice programs appear to improve
scores modestly on some standardized tests, in narrow skill areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that,'' wrote Larry Cuban, a Stanford University
professor who is former president of the American Educational
Research Association, ``there is no clear, commanding body of
evidence that students' sustained use of multimedia machines, the
Internet, word processing, spreadsheets and other popular
applications has any impact on academic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also notes that technology may hamper children's
intellectual growth by taking away time communicating with adults.
``Time for real talk with parents and teachers is critical,''
Cordes writes. ``Similarly, academic success requires focused
attention, listening, and persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Porter, a San Francisco teacher who specializes in procuring
cheap, used computers for the district, said computers in schools
make up for a huge socioeconomic schism in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, well-intentioned academics don't realize that for
some students, the only access they have to technology is at their
schools,'' Porter said. ``We can't forget about children who can't
afford computers at home.''

RICH UNCLE LEFT LIEBERMAN WITH POTENTIALLY STICKY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic nominee, is a man of
quite modest means by the standards of the US Senate. Nonetheless,
thanks to a rich uncle, Lieberman finds himself in a peculiar
situation for someone who would be vice president _ making
decisions on an estate worth $76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a $25,000 bequest and modest fees as co-executor and
co-trustee, Lieberman is not a beneficiary of the estate of Bernard
Manger, who died in 1995. But fairly or not, the family
responsibility he undertook has some potential to cause him
political discomfiture.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for example, the Republican National Committee sought
to use the estate issue against Lieberman, resuscitating 1997 news
articles about the estate's decision to evict a tenant for
nonpayment of rent from an apartment building it owned. The tenant,
who remains in the building, subsequently filed suit claiming she
had been injured because of poor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The estate's 1996 assets were $48.2 million, according to
records filed that year in state Probate Court in Stamford, Conn.
At the time, they included stock holdings in the Hollywood
entertainment industry, which Lieberman has often criticized for
the violent content it produces; major pharmaceutical companies,
which Lieberman and Vice President Al Gore have made a target of
their campaign; and energy and tobacco firms, to which the
Democrats have said that Governor George W. Bush of Texas and his
running mate, Dick Cheney, are too closely aligned.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman did not make those investments. But his role in
overseeing the estate raises novel questions for a prospective vice
president: Since Manger's heirs _ relatives of Lieberman _ stand to
benefit from the estate trustees' decisions, should Lieberman step
aside, even though federal ethics laws would not require him to do
so even if he was a beneficiary?
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Sakol, the communications director for Lieberman's
campaign, said Lieberman has not yet decided whether to relinquish
his role overseeing the estate, but that the senator is consulting
advisers on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other campaign aides, who spoke on the condition that they not
be identified, said that they do not know what the current assets
of the estate are, since Lieberman and his co-trustee, Harold F.
Bernstein, have long since hired professional financial managers
who are empowered to decide which assets to sell or buy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the campaign advisers said that Manger's estate paid
approximately $15 million in federal estate taxes. Despite that
major tax bite, Sakol said the estate is now valued at about $76
million.
</P>
<P>
   Personal finances have been much more of a headache for Cheney.
He has had a rough initiation to national politics _ substantial
public focus on the $20 million or so he has been paid as head of a
Texas-based oil services congolmerate, a controversy that ebbed
only when he agreed to forgo $3.8 million in future stock options
if he is elected. Last week, Cheney faced further questions over
why he and his wife have donated only about 1 percent of their
income to charity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in contrast, is a relative pauper in the Senate,
where most members have assets worth millions. From Lieberman's
Senate financial disclosure statement, it appears that he and his
wife, Hadassah, have a net worth of less than $2 million. Unlike
many of his colleagues, Lieberman has not made his tax returns
public, but aides said his campaign is preparing to release his
returns from the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Manger, was the owner of a Connecticut electrical
wiring company. But when he died in 1995, his relatives discovered
that his wealth was far greater than they imagined. Lieberman, who
was named executor of the estate and a trustee, filed documents
showing that Manger's assets included real estate valued at $3.8
million; stocks and stock funds worth about $15.5 million; and
tax-free bonds worth about $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Wall Street Journal, in an article about
Lieberman's role in overseeing the estate, reported that Manger
disinherited two of his four children because they married
non-Jews, even though the spouses converted to Judaism. After a
later, less harshly worded draft of Manger's will surfaced,
Lieberman brokered a solution that treated the children equally.
</P>
<P>
   Though Manger's will stipulated that Lieberman be paid $50,000 a
year as co-trustee, he has accepted just $20,000 annually. Hadassah
Lieberman, separately named as a trustee of a trust established for
Manger's widow, is paid $40,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Hartford Courant reported that Manger's estate,
which owned several rental properties, won a court order evicting a
tenant, Monica E. Beach, for nonpayment of $10,000 in rent. Beach,
in turn, sued the estate, claiming she lost her job due to an
injury she suffered when she fell on an apartment staircase that
had gone unrepaired.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lieberman said he had been unaware of the estate's
effort to evict Beach. Under a compromise worked out at the time,
Beach was allowed to remain in the unit rent-free until her lawsuit
is resolved. It is slated to go to trial next year.

FIRST WOMAN BISHOP OF AME CHURCH HONORED IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Vashti M. McKenzie made history this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, she was elected the first woman bishop of the
African Methodist Episcopal Church, a move that also made her the
first woman bishop in any predominantly black denomination.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, 53, is a former journalist who was raised in the
Episcopal Church but converted to the AME church. For the last 10
years, she has served as pastor of the Payne Memorial Church in
Baltimore, an unusually active inner-city church that runs a
welfare-to-work program for the state of Maryland and helps
congregants start small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie was honored in Boston, when where she went to speak at
the historic Charles Street AME Church. On the eve of her visit,
she spoke with the Globe about her rise to bishop, her experience
as a pastor in Baltimore, and her thoughts as she prepares to move
to Africa for her first assignment as a bishop.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa she will oversee an episcopal district that includes
200 churches in Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you become a minister?
</P>
<P>
   A. I came from a family of writers and journalists and really
had thought that was going to be my career. I started out in
journalism, expanded into broadcasting, ended up in broadcast
management, and received my call to ministry. I can't tell you that
lightning flashed, the earth moved and that, but it's a knowing,
it's a knowing down on the inside of your heart; it's listening to
that still, small voice; it's a push that nudges you in such a way
that you know that you'll respond.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did you leave the Episcopal Church for the AME Church?
</P>
<P>
   A. Coming out of college, when you are making choices for
yourself, I found that what interested me, what was calling me was
what the AME church was doing. My concern had always been for the
community, that the church is to embrace the community, and where I
was, I didn't see that much going on. I was looking and searching
and found that here was a denomination that spoke to my interests
in building lives, building people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell me about your experience at Payne Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   A. Payne is my third congregation. It was a congregation of
about 300, and we grew to over 1,700 persons. It was a Sunday-only
congregation and now Payne is a seven-day a week church. We have
worked very hard to erase the lines between sanctuary and
community, so that when you look at us you're looking at the
community. We anchor our community; we resource our community; we
are a stabilizing force in our community and we are a redevelopment
force in our community. I believe that that's what churches who are
in the urban core ought to be about. If you sit around and wait for
other city groups or government to do it, it just won't be done. If
it was going to be done, it would have been done, and since it's
not being done, somebody must move into that void, and I believe
it's us because we have a biblical mandate. We have the role model
of Jesus Christ, who did not spend all his time in the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you worry that your emphasis on programming dilutes your
spiritual ministry?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I don't. If there is no action after you have heard the
word of God, if there is no visible response, then we're just
throwing words out, we're just whistling Dixie. I believe that
ministry is the word and action. Faith without works is death.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will it be challenging to be a woman leader in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a history in Africa of strong women, and there is
patriarchy in Africa. There is patriarchy here in the United
States. There's sexism there and sexism here. Not too different.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How will your election affect women in other denominations?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm hoping that it will be an encouragement to women to
continue to believe in the God that has called them to serve. The
election speaks to a change in the AME church, and hopefully a
change in other denominations as well. This is the 21st Century,
and we cannot afford not having the whole family at the table of
service and work. The issues are too great, the devastation is too
widespread for just one part of the family to be at the table
making decisions and providing leadership. We can transcend those
superficial divisions and join hands and partner for the welfare of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will there always be a need for separate black denominations
in the US?
</P>
<P>
   A. History will play that out, to see how diversified we can be.
There are persons in the AME Church who are not African-American,
there are pastors who are not African-American. But the church was
born because it suffered the indignity of racism and segregation
within the larger congregation and it had to separate because of
the treatment of the people. Although we were born not for any
theological differences, but because of the prejudices that people
were experiencing, we still preach a gospel of inclusion, and
whether one is white, black, pink, green or purple, the same God
extends to them salvation.

NEW SPIDER-MAN DEBUTS FOR YOUNGER AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
Houston Chronicle 
As everyone knows, comics are for kids.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, that's when ``everyone'' refers to the vast majority
of people who never come near a comic book.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, comics have skewed toward adult buyers for years,
via the collectibles market, harder-edged material and slick,
costly comics and graphic novels.
</P>
<P>
   With the corresponding rise of video games, the Internet,
collectible card games such as Pokemon and other forms of
entertainment, today's kids are spending far less time reading
comics than kids of generations past.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's their parents or older siblings who are buying
comics and sealing them in plastic bags for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, publishers face a challenge as daunting as Superman
escaping from a cell lined with Kryptonite: how to win young
readers back.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leader Marvel has what it hopes will be an answer: the
``Ultimate'' Marvel line.
</P>
<P>
   It debuts this month with Ultimate Spider-Man and will continue
by year's end with Ultimate X-Men.
</P>
<P>
   Both monthly books will retell the origins of Spider-Man and the
X-Men _ created in the early '60s _ but with a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Younger characters will be emphasized, and by starting fresh,
the yarns can be tweaked and updated.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel's new editor in chief, Joe Quesada, doesn't blame kids
for being turned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuity of Marvel is 30-plus years, and unless you've
been with us for 30 years, it's daunting to catch up on all that
history,'' he said. ``So we created the Ultimate Marvel universe to
streamline and update it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Spider-Man No. 1, featuring a 48-page story with no
ads, costs $2.99. Later issues will have 22-page stories in 32-page
books (with ads) for $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   These are being sold not only by the ``hobby'' market of comics
shops but also by mass-market retailers such as drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   Quesada admits comics have ``lost some relevance to the youth
market,'' and a Houston dealer concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Marvel reader is 30 years old,'' said Richard
Evans, owner of Bedrock City Comic Co.. ``There's a shrinking
percentage of kid readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Quesada even feels there's a ``lost generation of kids who
didn't get into comics.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's never too late.
</P>
<P>
   Kids certainly discovered Marvel's ``X-Men'' movie, judging by
its success; it has made more than $150 million in the United
States alone.
</P>
<P>
   Quesada regrets failing to have Ultimate X-Men out in time for
the movie, ``but with a Spider-Man film looming, we're ready,'' he
said. ``A readable, fan-friendly Spider-Man will be on the stands
when it appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Due next year, that film will star Tobey Maguire. Quesada
expects the script to have fresh reinventions, much as ``X-Men''
did.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a distinctive logo, Ultimate Spider-Man is aimed at
readers from ages 8 to adult. It doesn't talk down to kids, so
Quesada expects older fans to buy it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get kids reading comics again, but we hope
older readers will like this, even though they resist change. If
the product is great, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvel has tried kid-geared books before, such as Power Pack,
``but we've talked down to kids,'' Quesada said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live and learn. We'll keep trying. Ultimate Spider-Man is a
big first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Its aim, he said, ``is not to reinvent the wheel, but to polish
the hubcap, retread it and put it on a new sports car. By doing
that, we hope to reach introductory readers.''
</P>
<P>
   When writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko created Spider-Man
38 years ago, the origin tale zipped through many events in just a
few pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Spider-Man is taking its time, first reintroducing _
and slightly reinventing _ Peter Parker, the future Spider-Man.
</P>
<P>
   Peter is now a 15-year-old high school student in Queens, N.Y.,
wearing round glasses akin to Harry Potter's. (The original Peter
was a high school senior.)
</P>
<P>
   As before, the orphaned Peter lives with his Aunt May and Uncle
Ben. Ben was killed off in Spidey's first '60s appearance, but he
survives the first issue of Ultimate Spider-Man, in which his
character is fleshed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original Uncle Ben would have fought in World War II, but
that's ancient history to a lot of kids,'' Quesada said. ``You've
got to slide it across time and make it relevant for today.''
</P>
<P>
   So this Ben wears his gray hair in a ponytail and speaks like a
hip, kindly child of Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Ultimate Spider-Man, as in the first origin, Peter
is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains spider powers (super
strength and an adhesive touch that allows him to climb walls).
</P>
<P>
   But his shift to superherodom will be gradual.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, Peter created a costume and became Spider-Man in
his first appearance. At the end of Ultimate Spider-Man No. 1, he
hasn't even had such an idea yet.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, the Ultimate universe will move even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jane Watson _ Peter's future girlfriend and wife in the
original series _ didn't appear in the original series until Issue
25. In Ultimate Spider-Man, she pops up in the first issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the luxury of fleshing out Stan's story and telling
what happened between the cracks,'' Quesada said. ``We'll tell the
origin in a six-issue story arc, establishing the relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Some _ but not all _ tales and villains from Amazing
Spider-Man's early issues will be reworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see Doctor Octopus and other classic villains, but
they'll be a little different,'' Quesada said. ``We don't want to
be married to the old books. We want a more modern context.''
</P>
<P>
   The new book is written by Brian Michael Bendis and penciled by
former Spidey artist Mark Bagley, who pays homage to Ditko's
distinctive splayed fingers and the highly expressive faces of Dave
Stevens, creator of the Rocketeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art is charming,'' Quesada said. ``You get a real feel for
the kids in school _ the way they dress, their mannerisms.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marvel, this shift is especially ironic. Its rise as a
comics power in the '60s was sparked by Lee's ardor to make comics
_ until then a kids' medium _ appealing for college students and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, Stan made it cool for adults to read comics,''
Quesada said. ``Now we're trying to make it cool for kids to read
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvel did their job too well,'' Evans said. ``Now comics
aren't perceived as being for kids _ and a lot of them aren't. But
comics stores are the same as any kind of book store. There's stuff
for kids, grown-ups, boys, girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Without kids, the comics market has declined in recent years,
after an early-'90s explosion fueled by adult collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales then were high because adults aggressively bought multiple
copies, hoping to resell them at a profit. They didn't. Many people
were turned off, and readership declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comics shouldn't be about collecting,'' Quesada said. ``They
should be about reading and having fun. When people got focused on
collecting, the market crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Marvel slid into bankruptcy in '96, though it recovered
in '98 via a merger with toy manufacturer Toy Biz.
</P>
<P>
   While Ultimate Marvel is made for kids, it won't shove them into
a corner by themselves. The Ultimate storyline may even cross over
with Marvel's other titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not gonna be held down by the rules,'' Quesada said.
``Who's to say this (the Ultimate line) isn't the real marvel
universe?
</P>
<P>
   ``To a young reader, it doesn't matter. They don't mind a
change, and change is what this is all about.''

SLOGANS A LOST ART ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even now, in a new century, in a period of impatience with
politics, these cries echo across history: He kept us out of war.
Rugged individualism. A new deal for the American people. Let's get
America moving again.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are these, from this election year, slogans
without power, punch, or passion: I'm for the people, not for the
powerful. A reformer with results.
</P>
<P>
   As a genre, the American political slogan, the art form that
allowed Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
and John F. Kennedy to encapsulate an entire election with a
single, telling phrase, may be dying.
</P>
<P>
   And the death of the political slogan _ whether conjuring an
image, like William McKinley's ``full dinner pail'' during the
prosperity of 1900, or asking a question, like Ronald Reagan's
``Are you better off than you were four years ago?'' in 1980, or
drawing on the power and pith of a single word, like Warren G.
Harding's ``Normalcy'' in 1920 _ may have a significance far beyond
the rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
   At root, political slogans are nothing more than advertising
gambits and political campaigns are little more than marketing
offensives. The irony is that in this age of advertising and heyday
of mass marketing, Al Gore and George W. Bush are falling so flat.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the raw materials of this campaign. One
nominee, himself a two-term vice president, is the son of one of
the lions of the Senate _ enough to make ``Gore'' one of the most
resonant names in politics. The other, governor of a large state,
is the grandson of a senator and the son of a man who was both vice
president and president _ enough to render ``Bush'' one of the most
enduring brand names in American life.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in an era of ``branding'' _ when the most prosaic
products, even water _ have a strong marketplace identity, both
Gore and Bush have fumbled at developing a brand of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you take one candidate, Vice
President Gore, who is not sure of who he is, and another, Governor
Bush, who was anointed by the power brokers,'' said L. Sandy
Maisel, a Colby College political scientist. ``There is no there
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the colorlessness of this campaign derives from the
particular appeal of both men, who from the start of their
political lives have prospered in the center, not the fringes. It
is hard to coin fighting words for a battle over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it comes from the times, with the public seeming to
almost welcome blandness in their would-be presidents, if only for
the contrast to the colorful but also deeply flawed figure the two
nominees are trying to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   And part of it comes from the nature of contemporary culture,
which is crowded with media images in a way that would startle
William Henry Harrison, who rode to office in 1840 on his
(completely false) image as the ``log-cabin-and-hard-cider''
candidate, and would astonish Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose entire
political persona seemed in 1952 (simplistically, it turned out) to
be summarized in the phrase ``I like Ike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this country is marketing,'' said Richard Norton
Smith, a prominent presidential biographer. ``It is highly unlikely
that a slogan in this climate would move people or inspire people.
We're bombarded by so much sloganeering that it is hard to get
through the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped, of course, that both candidates seem to be
running through slogans at marathon speed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Bush has conducted a ``change-the-tone-tour,''
vowed that under his administration there would be ``no child left
behind,'' and said his goal was ``renewing America's purpose.'' He
has spoken of ``prosperity with a purpose'' and of ``compassionate
conservatism'' and then, when Senator John McCain won the New
Hampshire primary on Feb. 1 with an insurrectionary campaign,
portrayed himself as a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Bush unveiled yet another new slogan, ``Real
Plans for Real People.'' If the Bush slogan has a familiar sound to
it, it's because a dozen years ago John Hancock Insurance Co. ran
an ad campaign called ``Real Life, Real Answers,'' which was
followed by a Winston cigarette campaign called ``Real people, real
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bush may have crowded his one potentially enduring
slogan _ compassionate conservatism _ with rhetorical emphemera and
permitted the nation to sidestep a potentially important discussion
about the nature of both compassion and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has swapped slogans as often as he has changed wardrobes.
In the primaries, the refrain was ``I want to fight for you.'' In
the general election he has turned to ``I'm for the people, not the
powerful.'' But in recent weeks that has faded, replaced by a new
slogan, ``Fighting for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are switching slogans in part because they
haven't yet cemented their identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bush's case, he hasn't been able to brand himself because
he can't yet find a rationale for his candidacy,'' said Michael
Sandel, a Harvard political scientist. ``This is a time of peace
and prosperity, and his only argument is that he would provide
leadership with a higher moral standard than Clinton. Gore's
campaign has a rationale _ keep things the way they are _ but he
lacks branding because he can't do what brands do: say that they
have something new and improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the most compelling slogans in American
political history have been two-word program descriptions, in
almost every case (important exceptions were Harry S. Truman's Fair
Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society) beginning with the word
``New.'' Thus American history can be explained in outline form by
simply the phrases New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt), New
Freedom (Woodrow Wilson), New Deal (Franklin Roosevelt), New
Frontier (Kennedy), New Beginning (Reagan), and New Covenant (Bill
Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   The quick changes in persona and slogans undertaken by both
candidates have failed to convince in large measure because they
are so fleeting. One of the most compelling political slogans of
the postwar period was one of the most unlikely, the New Nixon
slogan that was so effective in 1968. Gore's efforts to project a
New Gore isn't nearly as convincing because his image isn't nearly
as fixed as Richard M. Nixon's was in the mid-1960s. The New Nixon
came after 25 years of exposure to the Old Nixon, first on Capitol
Hill, then in the vice presidency, then in a presidential campaign,
and finally in a doomed gubernatorial campaign in California.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of American elections have long cited the slogan (and
its soulmate, the bumper sticker) as the symbol of one of the evils
of the nation's politics, its tendency to favor the simplistic over
the serious.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many American slogans have been neither honest
(Harrison was no poor, cider-swigging frontier lad) nor original
(Governor Alf Landon of Kansas spoke of a ``new frontier'' 24 years
before Kennedy's campaign). In most cases, political slogans have
had almost no ideological content. Slogans such as ``Give 'em hell,
Harry'' (Truman, 1948), ``All the way with LBJ'' Johnson, 1964),
and ``Nixon's the One'' (1968) are little more than grandstand
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Slogans can have unexpected political side-effects, too. Hoover,
realizing that ``rugged individualism'' seemed harsh at the time of
great economic hardship, tried unsuccessfully to disclaim the
phrase as the Depression deepened. The Republicans ran their 1936
campaign around the sunflower, the symbol of Kansas, the home of
their nominee, Governor Landon. The Democrats countered with their
quip, ``Sunflowers die in November.'' They were right; FDR beat
Landon, taking all but Maine and Vermont. In 1964, Senator Barry
Goldwater of Arizona, the Republican nominee, chose a slogan
intended to show his ideological purity: ``In your heart you know
he's right.'' The Democrats countered with, ``In your heart you
know he's nuts.'' Goldwater lost 44 states.
</P>
<P>
   But all politicians, regardless of whether they have a
compelling slogan, have one thing in common, particularly as
Election Day approaches. They still believe in a place called Hope.

FRUSTRATED THORNTON IS ON OUTISDE, LOOKING IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His Bruins teammates are in training camp, fighting for
jobs, rehabilitating injuries, and getting in shape for the season.
But north of the border in St. Thomas, Ontario, free agent center
Joe Thornton is having the gut feeling that he won't be joining
them for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, whose shoulder has completely healed from offseason
surgery to repair stretched tendons, is skating with a junior
hockey team, the London Knights, near his home and hoping a
resolution to his status is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old center has been commiserating with the other two
missing Bruins _ Sergei Samsonov and Anson Carter _ and that has
helped keep his spirits up.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he is working with a personal trainer, skating
hard, and waiting. And waiting some more. The lines of
communication are open between Thornton's agent Mike Barnett and
Bruins management, but Thornton said talks have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going to take some more time, I think,'' said
Thornton. ``At least we have been talking, and that's a good sign,
but I don't think too much has come out of it lately.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years Thornton has watched as other free agents
have sat out camp and in some cases part of the regular season. He
said he didn't want that to be him this fall, but if it happens,
he's prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope it would get done, but you never know,'' he said.
``With guys in the past, it's gone into the regular season so I
wouldn't be surprised if it does. We are all adults and hopefully
it will get resolved. We're feeling like we're being as fair as we
can without giving up a lot. Hopefully they'll start being fair,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who became a free agent July 1, said he thinks a deal
could've been struck long before now, and he's frustrated it
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all summer to do it,'' he said. ``It is disappointing
to not be there at training camp when you knew something could've
been done two months ago. But it seems like they kept putting it on
the back burner. Hopefully it gets resolved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not too far apart. We're not miles and miles apart.
We're still a good ways apart, though, that's for sure. We're just
going to have to wait it out and hopefully it will get resolved.
But the other aspect is the guys, hopefully, will be missing us
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Thornton was stung by president/general manager
Harry Sinden's comments that the third-year player had not
developed as much as he should've. After thinking about it,
Thornton said he realized it was likely a preemptive negotiating
ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he kind of put it right there, that it was going to be
a tough, long summer,'' Thornton said. ``But me and coach (Pat)
Burns, I think we were doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said one of the most difficult aspects of this time is
how disappointing last season was for all the Bruins. A good start
is critical, and without the team's leading scorer and two strong
supporting players, that won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier they get us, the better the team chemistry is
going to be,'' he said. ``In years past, we never had guys there at
the start of the year. I think if we all get there together and
play some exhibition games together, I think we'll be that much
better at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been tough but it's part of the learning process.
Hopefully, I won't have to do it ever again but I'm kind of
learning the ropes. Just looking at guys in the past, I don't think
anyone is surprised that we're holding out right now. We want it to
get done soon. We all know it's going to be tough, though. Every
year, I'm learning something. This is another thing I have to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow free agents have told him to hang in there, his agent
is saying the same thing, and the Bruins who are in camp have told
him to do what he feels he has to do. Thornton said he just wishes
it didn't have to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been through anything like this before, so it's a
little different,'' he said. ``But I've seen other guys do it in
years past so it's not different in that aspect. You have to do
what you have do and I think I'm going to help out my teammates by
doing this. You have to think of them, too. It's definitely weird
because I've always started training camp with the guys. In junior,
I was always there, too, so it's different. But it's something you
have to do.''

PUIG: A WRITER BETRAYED BY SUCCESS

MANUEL PUIG AND THE SPIDER WOMAN 
His Life and Fictions 
By Suzanne Jill Levine 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 448 pp., illustrated, $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manuel Puig spent as much of his waking life as he could in the
dream world of the movies, most particularly the great romantic
movies of the 1930s and 1940s. He wanted to write movies, and
ultimately he did. He met Rita Hayworth, saw Garbo on the street,
watched Marlene Dietrich at work in the dubbing room, and attended
a personal appearance by Joan Crawford. His most famous novel,
``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' became an even more famous film and
after that a Broadway musical hit.
</P>
<P>
   Puig died of complications from gall-bladder surgery in 1990,
when he was 57. His agent told his biographer that Puig had been on
the verge of making more money than he had made in his entire
career, and that the musical would have given him carte blanche in
Hollywood and on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that Puig might not have wanted this particular
manifestation of success once it finally came to him. Out of the
raw material of popular culture, he had fashioned a personal and
literary art which even today has not been properly recognized and
acknowledged. The man who loved the movies hated ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman'' because it misrepresented his own achievement and
simplified everything he believed in and cared about. (In this he
found himself in a position parallel to Christopher Isherwood's _
Isherwood, too, found himself courted, coopted, and compromised by
Hollywood. ``Cabaret'' had very little to do with the perfect
little novels it was based on, but it made Ishwerwood financially
comfortable for the first time in his life.)
</P>
<P>
   Puig was born in General Villegas, an Argentine town of about
15,000 that was 12 hours by train from Buenos Aires. Puig's
lifeline was his weekly trip with his mother to Teatro Espagnol to
watch the American movies which had captivated his imagination; the
movies provided an alternative model to the all-too-real world Puig
found himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Puig later lived in Buenos Aires, in Rome (where he studied
film), in London, in New York, in Rio de Janeiro, and, finally, in
Mexico. His closest companion was his mother, elegant and
demanding, which whom he lived much of his life. He held all kinds
of odd jobs; while writing his first novel, ``Betrayed by Rita
Hayworth,'' he was working as a ticketing agent for Air France at
Kennedy Airport. He knew languages and taught them; once his books
began to attract notice, he worked a little on the academic
circuit. Ultimately he produced eight novels, along with several
plays and screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   Puig's literary achievement has not yet been properly evaluated.
His books became controversial for political reasons in South
America; there were points at which Puig had reason to fear for his
own safety and that of his family. The sensibility of the novels,
which mingles popular culture with an openly gay point of view,
made them controversial everywhere. Puig may always have spoken of
himself as a female and dubbed everyone else the same way (the
studiously straight William Hurt was ``la Hurt''), but he had
little interest in promoting himself as a ``gay novelist.'' That's
what happened to him anyway, with the result that his books have
been excessively praised and condemned for reasons having little to
do with their literary merits.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Jill Levine was Puig's principal American translator;
she met him in 1968 and remained on friendly terms with him for the
rest of his life. Her biography is detailed, affectionate, and
appropriately breezy and colloquial in tone. She clearly enjoyed
Puig's company, alarming as it could sometimes be, and its easy to
see why _ Puig was a mildly outrageous character with a sharp
tongue and a warm heart. He had no use for the film stars of the
'80s who repudiated the glamor-puss images of their predecessors;
he dismissed Ellen Burstyn, Jill Clayburgh, Meryl Streep, and Glenn
Close as ``The Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse.'' Once he threw a
close friend out into the street in the middle of a winter night
because the friend said Lana Turner was a lousy actress and a
whore.
</P>
<P>
   Puig loved to pose, vamp, and camp. One of his students at
Columbia University, the Colombian writer Jaime Manrique, wrote a
memorial tribute, ``The Writer as Diva,'' that provides a visual
image of Puig more striking than any photograph in the biography.
``Like Garbo's his eyes were a tool, a weapon, not just organs for
seeing, but for expressing what he saw. Like the great diva, he
raised his eyebrow (the left one) to indicate pain, disdain,
despair.'' But Manuel Puig did see an amazing amount with those
eyes, and what he learned to express on his Olivetti portable was
more durable than any pose in a doorway.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Would a flicker in the heavens burn as bright
if it were called Wewilroku, a tribute to the Queen anthem ``We
Will Rock You''?
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, people have given names to objects in
the sky, granting great figures _ such as Hercules, the mythical
hero who slayed the many-headed Hydra _ an added degree of
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   But now the accelerating pace of discovery _ driven by more and
ever-larger telescopes scanning the skies _ is seriously taxing our
creative powers. Just since 1998, when one Lexington-based team
began a massive search for objects that could threaten the earth,
astronomers have found more than 8,000 new asteroids, as many as
had been found since astronomy began.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at the Garden Street offices of the Minor Planets
Center, which certifies new asteroid discoveries, name suggestions
pour in every day, from Wewilroku (rejected) to MIT (accepted in
May), to Monty Python (accepted in July).
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be quite frustrating,'' said the center's director,
Brian Marsden, sitting low in a black swivel chair and surrounded
by a nebula of papers. ``It's almost getting silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, name weariness may be a byproduct of the success
of modern science. If physicists had not become so good at
discovering new elements, there would have been no need to call one
of them Californium. If biologists had not become so deft in
exploring DNA, there would be no need to dub parts of the genetic
code that control how the body grows ``sonic hedgehog'' and
``tiggywinkle.'' And meteorologists, who can use powerful weather
satellites to track storms anywhere in the Atlantic, only retire
storm names if they cause deaths or serious damage, said Michael
Carbone of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   To some eyes, though, the gathering-data flood _ from astronomy
to zoology _ is a sign of science in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amusing that we are running out of names for things,''
said physicist Alan Lightman, an MIT professor of humanities and
author of ``The Diagnoses,'' a novel out this week on the era of
information overload. ``But what most scientists try to do is
organize and simplify and find deeper unifying principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Marsden, white-haired, 63 years old, and remarkably
good-spirited about the deluge, calls the naming work an
``amusing'' sidelight to the more serious work of the center, near
the base of Harvard's ``Great Refractor'' telescope. The center's
mandate, explained Marsden, is to sift out, from observatories on
five continents, evidence of new objects so that their orbits can
be calculated, with a careful eye to ``near-earth objects'' _
comets and asteroids that could come near the earth, threatening
humans with the same fiery fate that befell the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Few astronomers, though, want to change the practice of giving
names to asteroids (which one imaginative critic once called ``the
vermin of the solar system''). Using proper names, instead of just
a designation like 1999BK23, helps avoid confusion, astronomers
said. But at least as powerful a reason is the looming fear that
asteroid naming could go commercial, unleashing the same forces
that changed San Francisco's Candlestick Park to 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment we stopped naming them,'' said Minor Planet Center
associate director Gareth Williams, ``some registry would open up
and charge for the honor.''
</P>
<P>
   So with telescopes and satellites scouring the solar system, the
need for names keeps expanding. Last month, at the triennial
meeting of the International Astronomical Union, the body that is
the final arbiter of celestial titles, scientists met to consider
what to call the craters and mountains and plains that litter the
surfaces of planets like Mars and Venus, the moons that orbit
around planets, the craters and mountains and plains on the moons
of the planets, and even craters on asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Imposing some measure of order, astronomers have devised an
elaborate set of rules that govern what can be called what, Marsden
said. When a new moon is discovered revolving around Jupiter, for
example, it must be named for one of the lovers of the god Jupiter
in classical mythology. To help keep them all straight, though,
there is another rule: All of the moons that orbit in one direction
will be given names that end in the letter ``a'' (such as the moon
Elara), and all the moons that orbit in the other direction will be
given names that end in ``e.''
</P>
<P>
   New names for five moons around Uranus, adopted at last month's
conference, all come from characters in Shakespeare's ``The
Tempest'': Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, and Stephano.
</P>
<P>
   But these themes can cause trouble. For craters on the asteroid
Eros, astronomers decided to keep to an erotic theme, with names
like Don Juan, Lolita, and Cupid. When the public was asked to
submit suggestions, many of them were rejected as
``inappropriate,'' according to Charlene Anderson, associate
director of the Planetary Society, which sponsored the contest.
Among the rejections: Bill and Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Before astronomers can name an asteroid or comet, they must talk
to Marsden. He decides when an object has been followed long enough
that it ``won't get lost'' and is therefore ready to be named.
</P>
<P>
   If it is an icy comet, then the name comes easy: It is named for
the discoverers. If the new object is a rocky asteroid, though, the
rules state that the discoverer can christen it just about
anything, as long as it meets the approval of a 13-member panel of
the International Astronomical Union known as the Committee on
Small Body Nomenclature, which Marsden sits on.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of asteroid hunting, astronomers invoked the
names of female goddesses: The first asteroid, Ceres, was
discovered in 1801 and named for the Roman goddess of harvests; the
second, Pallas, discovered in 1802, was an alternate appellation
for Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   As telescopes improved, and astronomers began finding more
asteroids, they had to loosen the rules. Female historical figures
started making appearances, and then male figures were allowed,
though tradition dictated that an ``a'' be added at the end of
their names to make them sound female, Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, except for asteroids in a few unusual orbits, there are
only two firm rules: nothing obscene, and no political or military
figures until 100 years after their death. Also, added Marsden in
his British accent, ``pet names are discouraged.'' (This
convention, he explained, came after a now-infamous incident in
which an astronomer named an asteroid ``Mr. Spock'' after his
pointy-eared tabby cat.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, some skywatchers argue that the committee has become too
staid, despite having approved asteroids that honor the Beatles,
Marilyn Monroe, and Laurel and Hardy. Marsden's colleague Williams,
who suggested the Wewilroku name and calls himself a ``big Queen
fan,'' insists that the committee's decision to reject it
``reflects badly on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a certain percentage of witty names,'' said Williams,
who secured a place on the name committee last month and hopes to
resubmit Wewilroku. ``Otherwise you lose the thrill of finding the
witty name among all the routine stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that the practice of naming points of light, no
matter how faint, will continue, said those who are involved with
the process. ``It makes a record in the stars of our own
experience,'' said Susan Russell, who volunteers for the Minor
Planets Center and is the CEO of The Russell Mark Group, a
California consulting firm that helps companies invent names for
themselves. ``It's a way to say that we are here, and we are
human.''

   Will this week's largest-ever conclave of world leaders at the
United Nations' ``millennium summit'' in New York make a bit of
difference to the billions of victims of poverty, cruelty or war?
The United Nations is determined that it should, says Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, who wrote the report that became the
basis for an ambitious declaration signed by the summiteers on
Sept. 8. If the summiteers actually succeed in making the rich
world a little less selfish in its dealings with the poor world,
all the puff and flummery will have been worthwhile. &QL;

   Suffering from a touch of deja vu? Oil prices have more than
tripled since the end of 1998; political leaders, including Bill
Clinton, are appealing to OPEC countries _ whose oil ministers are
meeting this weekend _ to increase production; France has seen the
return of long queues at gas stations, as truckers protesting fuel
prices block supplies. Such news flogs scary memories of the three
previous big oil-price shocks, in the early and late 1970s, and in
1990. Yet, oddly, hardly anybody seems worried about such a
prospect today. Nonetheless, at such times it is always prudent to
ask: ``what might go wrong?'' Will OPEC _ and our insatiable oil
consumption _ soon have us over a barrel? &QL;

   Few cities are as gloomy as Yangon, the rot-blackened capital of
Myanmar, known in better days as Rangoon and Burma respectively.
The one bright light amid the murk is Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader
of the National League for Democracy (NLD). Her nine-day protest,
trapped in a car on the outskirts of Yangon, and her subsequent
detention under house arrest, remind her countrymen, and the wider
world, both of the intransigence of the military junta and of the
fact that an alternative still exists, despite years of
oppression. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ America's presidential election has been
transformed. For much of the past year, it had seemed George W.
Bush's to lose. Now, however, it is Al Gore who is surging ahead in
the polls, with an average lead of three percentage points in most
and ten points in one. Suddenly, it is Gore who is forcefully
setting the agenda, while Bush stumbles on the hustings, getting
his billions and trillions muddled (twice) and blurting vulgar
things into open microphones. The phoney campaign is over, folks.
Election 2000 now promises to be the closest race in decades. &QL;

   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the Mecca of Democratic Texas _ a place (pre-Gov.
George W. Bush) where an elected Republican was a contradiction in
terms. It was the stomping ground of Rayburn, the powerful speaker
of the House, who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress;
Johnson, his protege, could always count on it. Yet in many ways,
Texas Democrats can longer say, ``we'll always have Paris.'' As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold, and watch grimly as Texas increasingly becomes a
one-party state for the Republicans. &QL;

360 million Internet users around the world, only 3.1 million are

Africa or north of the Sahara. But access is spreading fast,
perhaps even tripling over the course of last year. For the first

   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic disaster, and scarred by political
violence and guerrilla rebellion. On Dec. 1, he will hand over to
Vicente Fox a country that differs for the better. Whatever
Zedillo's shortcomings, Mexicans will have grounds for satisfaction
if their new president turns out to be as successful as his
predecessor. &QL;

has long been more straitlaced than its Latin neighbors. &QL;

70,000 of them, are evidently thriving. &QL;

only Americans pulled down old houses because they were too
difficult to clean. In the past few years, Beijing's municipal
authorities have been systematically tearing down centuries-old
neighborhoods of narrow alleyways to make way for souless six-lane
avenues and commercial buildings. Beijing, desperate to win the
contest to hold the 2008 Olympic Games, boasts about the
``greening'' and ``modernizing'' of the capital. In reality,
China's quest for modernity destroys much of the old in favor of
the ugly. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Last week, when the American press and broadcasters
were on a feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted
to Ford Explorers, Ford's pugnacious chief executive, Jac Nasser,
appeared in prime-time TV ads professing the company's commitment
to customers and their safety, and promising to do everything to
replace suspect tires as quickly as possible. Days later, a
defensive Nasser tried to duck his way out of appearing before a
congressional subcommittee investigating the recall. Was it
cowardice or arrogance? Whichever, unless somebody at Ford soon
gets this consumer-safety issue under control, it will not just be
Firestone tires that are shredded _ it may well be Jac Nasser's
mercurial career as well. &QL;

so on the Internet. Is Africa getting online? Not really: of some
360 million Internet users around the world, only 3.1 million are
thought to be in Africa, and most of them are either in South
Africa or north of the Sahara. But access is spreading fast,
perhaps even tripling over the course of last year. For the first
time, surfers can use the Net in Swahili. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic disaster, and scarred by political
violence and guerrilla rebellion. On Dec. 1, he will hand over to
Vicente Fox a country that differs for the better. Whatever
Zedillo's shortcomings, Mexicans will have grounds for satisfaction
if their new president turns out to be as successful as his
predecessor. &QL;

   SANTIAGO _ Earlier this year, MercadoLibre, a Miami-based online

campaign in Chile. The state-run metro seems to have objected to a
poster proclaiming ``vendo mis pelotas,'' or ``I sell my balls.''
The veto was predictable; when it comes to public morality, Chile
has long been more straitlaced than its Latin neighbors. &QL;

were on a feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted
to Ford Explorers, Ford's pugnacious chief executive, Jac Nasser,
appeared in prime-time TV ads professing the company's commitment
to customers and their safety, and promising to do everything to
replace suspect tires as quickly as possible. Days later, a
defensive Nasser tried to duck his way out of appearing before a
congressional subcommittee investigating the recall. Was it
cowardice or arrogance? Whichever, unless somebody at Ford soon
gets this consumer-safety issue under control, it will not just be
Firestone tires that are shredded _ it may well be Jac Nasser's

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The world's most esteemed medical magazine is taking on
a decidedly different look, one that almost ensures it will
continue to be the center of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that's changing is the masthead. Gone, or soon
to be, are prominent personalities who were part of the storied
past at the New England Journal of Medicine. A series of senior
editors, national correspondents and board members are being phased
out in a move that the new boss says will bring fresh blood, but
that critics see as a bloodletting aimed at rabble-rousers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the revamp of content. The jihad against
alternative medicine is yesterday's crusade, along with the passion
to keep researchers from profiting from their research. The battle
now will be waged on behalf of cold, hard science like genetics;
the passion will be to keep everyday doctors up to date on common
conditions such as chest pain and backaches.
</P>
<P>
   The most profound shift of all is one most readers will never
notice: Dr. Jeffrey Drazen, who took over as editor-in-chief this
summer, gets along just fine with his bosses at the Massachusetts
Medical Society. That is a contrast to concerns about crass
commercialization sounded by his immediate predecessors, one of
whom was forced out by the society a year ago while the other
decided not to try to keep her job.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all amount to? Clearly, the roller-coaster ride of
the last year is coming to an end as the Drazen team tightens its
grip on the controls. But it remains to be seen whether it is
steering the Boston-based journal, with its history of high ideals
and incremental change, in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen is low-key but confident. His staffing changes, he says,
will bring a ``rejuvenation of thought'' while the policy ones
represent ``not a total break but a reasonable break with the
past.'' As for the Medical Society, which thanks to journal
revenues is the richest state medical association in America,
Drazen says it ``has been very generous with its resources and
totally hands-off with any editorial policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet other journal watchers are worried. ``What Dr. Drazen told
me when he called me up and fired me is that he wants to make a
clean break from the Relman-Kassirer-Angell era of the journal. But
I think those three earlier editors set the highest scientific and
moral standards,'' says Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, one of the
journal's three national correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the journal that is boiling to the surface today
is essentially the same one that became public a year ago, when the
Medical Society fired Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer after eight years as
editor-in-chief. The narrow issue was whether the society was using
the New England Journal's prestige to sell unrelated products and
publications. More broadly, it was and is a debate over how much
right the owners have to set their publication's direction and
profit from it _ and, from the other side, whether potential
meddling by those owners must be curtailed when they are interested
parties in many controversies the journal covers.
</P>
<P>
   Even without that history of conflict, staff changes underway
now probably would come under close scrutiny, if only because they
are wider and deeper than those made by previous editors. In the
past, part-time postings like associate editor and editorial board
member had no defined limits on length of service. Now, Drazen
plans to put specific limits on them, ranging from six years for
statistical consultants to three years for board members. That
means lots of familiar names will be erased from the masthead,
ranging from two of the three national correspondents to associate
and deputy editors, with other replacements to follow with the
phasing in of the new staggered, limited terms.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen explains that term limits are standard fare for medical
publications, and that he is simply bringing the New England
Journal in line. Yet others worry about any tinkering with the
188-year-old journal, which is cited more often and revered more
widely than any technical publication in the world. ``It's Jeff's
right, of course, to make any personnel changes he chooses,'' says
Dr. Marcia Angell, Drazen's immediate predecessor. ``But I wish he
had waited to get to know the job better before he began to make
such sweeping changes. He's losing some superb people and stands to
lose more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who are leaving, some were ready to go anyway. ``I
told him (Drazen) I would like to retire by the end of the year,
not because of any proposed changes or incompatibilities, but
because I've been there almost 12 years and I am of the age where I
would like to do something a little different before I cease being
able to do anything at all,'' says the deputy editor, Dr. Robert
Utiger, 69. The replacement of Robert Kuttner, a national
correspondent, also was logical since he has been too busy to write
anything for the journal since early last year. And Dr. Walter
Willett, a statistical consultant at the journal for nearly 20
years, says it made sense to step aside now since he is heading to
Italy on a sabbatical from his teaching job at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But Willett adds that ``there are great people there at the
journal and these summary dismissals are troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise Dr. Marshall Kaplan, an associate editor for eight
years, wonders why replacements are being made: ``You have a
winning combination at the journal, and you're changing it.'' And
Dr. Robert Mayer, an associate editor for more than 13 years,
worries that ``if you rotate us every four years, you will lose the
memory of past papers and reviewers. . . . You could make the
assumption that this is a way to do housecleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Willett knows he is leaving, while Kaplan and Mayer suspect that
they may be replaced, and they and others wonder if it is because
of their outspoken criticism of the journal's direction and its
owner, the Massachusetts Medical Society. Dr. Arnold Relman, who
preceded Kassirer as the journal's top editor, is even more
critical. ``For the first in the long history of the journal . . .
business considerations appear to weigh as heavily as editorial
considerations,'' he says. ``I worry about that, and a lot of
people who care deeply about the journal worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of their worry is that other society-owned publications,
like Hippocrates, are marketed as if they have the same impeccable
editorial standards as the New England Journal, when that would be
almost impossible. There also is a concern that the society, which
bought the journal in 1921 and now gets 80 percent of its $89
million in annual revenues from it and other publications, cannot
help but see the journal as a revenue source rather than a
cherished trust. And many critics complain that the society, which
has a powerful lobbying arm that looks out for the economic
interests of its 17,700 member physicians, is worried about
articles like one Bodenheimer wrote recently charging that many
academic researchers are unduly influenced by huge rewards they
reap from drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen, who himself had strong ties to the biomedical industry
but divested them before he joined the journal, says that ``despite
all the negative publicity that has occurred over the last year
there never was a hint that the society was trying to exert any
editorial control over what we publish.'' And Dr. Virginia Latham,
the society's president, says, ``We would never do anything to
commercialize the name of the New England Journal. . . . It
obviously is in our best interests to keep the New England Journal
name as pure as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The new team running the journal is determined to make changes,
however, starting with actively competing against publications like
Science and Nature for the latest breakthroughs on issues such as
genetics. Yet it will steer those and other articles to practicing
doctors who want ``the good stuff that patients can benefit from,''
says Drazen, an asthma specialist who ran the pulmonary division at
Brigham and Women's Hospital. And there will be less focus on the
causes of and controls for disease, with more on issues that affect
average doctors and patients, like whether to use stress tests or
CT scans to evaluate chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   As for public controversies, Drazen says he shares the passion
of Angell and other predecessors for curbing smoking, but is far
less critical of alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they support Drazen's moves or oppose them, all who are
watching agree on one thing: It is too early to judge the product
he oversees since he only started on the job in July and most
current stories were in the pipeline before he arrived. Still, the
reviews are beginning to come in based on his hiring and other
early decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to hope that they've learned some lessons, but the
underlying problem is not going away. The underlying problem is
that the Medical Society regards the journal as a massive cash
cow,'' says Willett, who teaches epidemiology and nutrition at the
Harvard School of Public Health. ``I'm an optimist inherently, but
vigilance is also warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Martin, dean of the Harvard Medical School, is less
alarmed: ``I have no doubts. I think everything at the New England
Journal is just fine.''

ECONOMY LOSING TO FIRES IN IDAHO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALMON, Idaho _ Base camp was a muddy mess.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters awoke to find their tents filled with water.
Vehicles skidded in the makeshift parking lot. Roads were declared
impassable.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women in familiar yellow shirts and flame-retardant
slacks were too exhausted to celebrate, but their relief was clear.
The mud, the rain, the cooler temperatures gave them a chance to
turn the corner in their fight to bring the worst US forest fires
in a half-century or more under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fire in Idaho was big, and it looked like it was going to
burn forever,'' said Douglas Johnston, a fire information officer
temporarily stationed in Salmon. ``It doesn't look like that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Forests continue to burn across the West, but firefighters from
around the country were leaving Montana by the planeload last week.
The Clear Creek Complex, as about 206,000 acres burning in Idaho's
Salmon-Challis National Forest are known, is now 77 percent
contained, up from 29 percent only days before. About 450
firefighters packed up their equipment and went home or moved on to
fires in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters and hikers were allowed to venture out again, although
only in approved areas and not soon enough to salvage the economies
of Salmon and other small, tourist-dependent towns in fire
territory. Even towns not directly touched by fire found themselves
badly burned.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few structures and no lives have been lost around
Salmon, where about 3,400 people live and thousands more visit each
year to run the River of No Return, hunt the bountiful forest, and
backpack through spectacular Lewis &AMP; Clark country. Summer is to
Salmon retailers and river guides what Christmas is to merchants
and ski resorts elsewhere. Salmon's relatively high-paying gold
mine was recently shuttered, its namesake fish is off-limits due to
endangerment, and logging is mostly a memory.
</P>
<P>
   But tourists have stayed away from Salmon this season,
frightened by the fires only about 10 miles from town and warned of
the inaccessibility of favored spots. At one point, the air was so
thick with smoke that people wore face masks and resident C.
Hokanson had to stay indoors day after day or risk an allergy
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The view of the mountains was so blurred that one second-grader
new to Salmon drew a picture of the town without them; he didn't
know they were there. The summer fair was a failure, the balloon
festival was canceled, and even some riders couldn't reach Salmon
for the annual rodeo, one of the biggest events of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add the fire on top of what we've already gone through and
it's almost more than a community can take,'' said Salmon's mayor,
Stanley Davis, also the school district's maintenance supervisor.
``It's like kicking a guy when he's down. People were already
hurting, and now they're really hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stasiak, Lemhi County's newly appointed economic
development director, said he has been hearing complaints from the
merchants whose stores line Main Street that business is off from
10 percent to as much as 60 percent from the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's touch and go,'' said Thyra Warren, who owns Rendezvous
Sports, where visitors can buy their gear and book their fishing
and rafting adventures. The store's business was down 37 percent in
July and 26 percent in August, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst summer in the seven years we've been in
business,'' Warren added. ``I make all my profits in the summer to
last me through the winter. I'm just hoping we get some business
back now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with some forest reopened to tourists and hunting season
officially underway, no one expects a rebound overnight. Many
locals said they worry that the fires themselves will rebound once
the skies clear and the land dries. By late afternoon the other
day, base camp had already turned brown, leaving the ground parched
as usual. Deep in the forest, despite the fresh green grass, dust
was kicking up as temperatures began rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 6.6 million acres have burned since January,
the agency said. For all the recent rain, for all the months of
effort, 33 large fires were still burning on 1.4 million acres in
10 states as of Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho. Six large fires constituting 633,231 acres
remained ablaze in Idaho alone.
</P>
<P>
   The fires in the Wildnerness Complex _ at 180,600 acres, one of
the state's largest _ are spreading. Even in the Clear Creek
Complex 1,502 firefighters, 16 helicopters, and 27 engine trucks
were battling blazes. Among the firefighters were 600 Marines newly
trained to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by midweek, fire officials were using the word
``cautious'' to describe their optimism. Firefighters, many of them
staying at ``spike'' camps as close to the fires as possible, did,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got plenty of rain, but it could easily pop up again
somewhere,'' said Jon T. Lee, 40, a member of an elite, highly
trained Type 1 ``hotshot'' team. ``I chase fires for a living, and
I don't think I'm done chasing them yet this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he expects to put in 1,000 hours of overtime this fire
season, earning an estimated $35,000 for six months of 75-hour
back-wrenching weeks. For him, as for many others risking their
safety to contain the flames, the fires offer an economic boost, as
well as a surge of adrenaline and a sense of satisfaction. Each
spring, before the start of fire season, lines form around the
block to join the crews, especially in cities and towns with few
other job opportunities, according to one fire official.
</P>
<P>
   Some locals have profited from the fires, too. Although they
lost out on tourists, local hotels and motels have been filled with
firefighters, the parking lots packed with the equipment trucks and
four-wheel-drive vehicles the crews brought with them. Stasiak said
anyone with heavy or logging equipment to rent or fire-fighting
supplies to sell has done nicely.
</P>
<P>
   But in a county with an unemployment rate that hovers around 8
percent, the fires have hurt more people than they have helped.
Stasiak, the economic development director, called tourism the top
employer in Lemhi County, employing more people than the hospital,
the US Bureau of Land Management, or a company that makes laminated
wood beams.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists spent $21.5 million in Lemhi County in 1997, the most
recent figures available from the commerce department. The tourism
payroll topped $13.4 million, and that's in a county where Stasiak
said a wage of $15 an hour is rare and many employees work for
minimum wage or slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to let people to know that we're in business, we're
still here,'' he said. ``Nothing has changed other than some areas
have burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs pointing otherwise are everywhere, however, from the
``Thank you firefighters'' placards around town, to the radio
stations that offer regular updates on closed areas, to the mostly
deserted downtown movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been a rough summer for hotels without business from
the fire crews. Said Linda Anderson, an employee at the normally
sold-out Salmon River Lodge, where a double goes for $72 a night,
``Business has slowed down 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no residents said they were planning to leave Salmon or
shut down their businesses just yet. Isolated as they are _ a 2
1/2-hour winding drive from Missoula _ locals said they are
accustomed to adversity, and the fires may prove to be just another
obstacle to overcome in exchange for living in an area where deer,
bear, otter, and longhorn sheep, among other wildlife, can be
spotted regularly and the tap water is so tasty that the mayor has
considered bottling it for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're known to be survivors,'' Mayor Davis said. ``We live 150
miles from nowhere, as some would say. We depend on each other for
survival. And we'll survive this, even if don't know how right
now.''

GENDER GAP IS ZAPPING BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Those footsteps making all the difference in the presidential
election this past month don't all sound alike.
</P>
<P>
   There's the click of high heels, the scrunch of sandals, the
clip-clop of flats, the clunk of steel-toed welder's boots, the
near-silent tread of soccer-mom sneakers and nurses' slip-ons and
the crepe-soled whisper of women who are on their feet on the job
eight hours straight, before they get home to chores there before
they slide on the old slippers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the movement of female votes that brought Al Gore from way
behind to marginally ahead. If the election were limited to white
men, George W. Bush could quit today and still win. White males
have voted predictably Republican in presidential elections for
three decades, in the South some years by 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But yawning wide under the unsteady gait of the Texas governor
is Gender Gap. His year-long trail-ride campaign, with his
saddlebags laden with $100 million in contributions, runs the risk
of plunging over that looming precipice. He had the women's vote,
tentatively and tenuously, till mid-August. Now it is bleeding
away, like a river through a broken levee, and Bush seems unsure as
to how to repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   It was women who made Bill Clinton in two elections, and women
whose coolness to Prince Albert threatened to deny Mr. &AMP; Mrs. Gore
the chance to move in over the store. So what happened over the
last month? Women moved. To Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That much is clear. The ``why?'' is a little more obscure. Savvy
Republican veterans like Alan Simpson, the former Wyoming senator
who spent 18 years in D.C., kept murmuring all along that women
don't like the GOP's lining up against abortion. Bush is for
exceptions in rare cases (rape, incest, saving the mother's life)
but the platform won't even go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went to great and largely successful lengths to make his a
softer-kinder-cuddlier convention. Lots of happy female and
minority faces. But he's trying to undo the damage done since
1994's savage Newt Gingrich revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP fought family leave, raising the minimum wage (more
women than men make the bare minimum), and the Democrats have
generally out-bid the GOP congressional leadership on education,
health care, and prescription drugs, the issue that looms like the
iceberg-that-sank-the-Titanic of this election.
</P>
<P>
   Was it The Smooch? Gore's bear-hug-and-passionate-kiss of Tipper
en route to the podium for his big convention speech still
resonates. ``No kiss?'' demanded Oprah Winfrey when Al ambled onto
her set. ``I was hoping for something.'' So was Al, and he got it,
when the talk-show diva, with her 22 million viewers, let Al purr
and flirt. Dubbaya goes on Oprah next week, but he starts from way
behind with the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   How far behind? Say about 20 points worth, in the Zogby poll, or
18 points, in the ABC/Washington Post count. Gore's lead among
women varies from state to state. In the South and West, Bush does
better. But in pivotal electoral vote hotspots like Illinois, where
Gore has an overall 15-point lead in the Zogby tally, Bush leads
among men, but trails by 25 points among women.
</P>
<P>
   And marital status matters. The Voter.com Battleground poll has
Gore and Bush deadlocked nationally at 41-40, but had Gore ahead
among women by nine, and Bush up with men by 8. That survey charts
a marriage gap _ Bush ahead by nine with marrieds, Gore up by 14
among singles. The conventional wisdom is that mothers are more
angry at Bill Clinton for his Monica dalliance than are single
women, and that parents are more upset with the current president
than nonparents.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns will tailor their ads and schedules to the
battleground states _ those eight or nine running from New Jersey
to Illinois and down to Missouri. The Lieberman factor is
apparently helping Gore with women, as well as in Florida, where
Bush spent two days this week hoping to hold onto to a state he
thought was a sure thing in July.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Bush cannot win New York (trailing by 25 points
in the Marist poll) and Illinois seems to be slipping from
contention (Gore up by 15, Zogby.) It remains to be seen whether
Hillary Clinton's seesaw Senate race in New York will get a lift
from Gore's surge among women. Hillary is doing nowhere near as
well with her gender she _ and I _ thought she would.
</P>
<P>
   That could still change. If it does, she's in.

HOLLYWOOD AND MADISON AVE. NEED TO BE REINED IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is a good week to see how deep our children stand in
commercialism's grand canyon. Turn to the west and they are staring
at Hollywood's soaring walls of media violence. Turn to the east
and there is the sheer face of Madison Avenue's cold-blooded
manipulation of children's minds.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission released a report that
found that the movies, music, and video-game industries
aggressively market adult-rated wares to underage children. The FTC
found that 80 percent of R-rated movies, 70 percent of ``mature''
video games and all 55 music recordings with labels for
``explicit'' content were marketed to children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said, ``They knew what they were
doing.'' The FTC received much of its information from industry
documents. Children are exposed to a barrage of shootings,
expletives, sexuality, and references to rape and mutilation
through TV commercials and movie theatre trailers that industry
executives know will be seen by elementary school viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Some PG-13 films are advertised during the Saturday morning
cartoons. Other PG-13 and some R-rated movies exploit the vast
youth audience for football, wrestling, and music videos shows.
Many PG-13 action movies reach young children with action toys.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report was rare for being a big government project that
produced outrage across a wide political spectrum. Robert Knight,
senior director of cultural studies at the conservative Family
Research Council said, ``The tobacco industry was forced to
discontinue its use of `Joe Camel.' Well, Hollywood has a `Joe
Camel' problem of its own.'' First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
Democratic candidate for the US Senate, said, ``I am calling on the
industry to immediately stop marketing adult and violent
entertainment to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Outraged politicians should reserve some anger for other
manipulators as well. Wednesday and Thursday in New York,
advertising executives are brazenly patting themselves on the back
for getting children hooked onto junk food and video games,
celebrating the Golden Marble Awards for ads aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   Many winners of the last two years add up to a chamber of
horrors in a nation facing an epidemic of child obesity: Hostess
pastries, Oreo cookies, Pepsi, McDonald's, Burger King, Post and
Kellogg's cereals, and Nintendo. The awards are not only ads
themselves but also for campaigns that tie products into TV
networks and movies that appeal to young children such as
Nickelodeon, Fox, Men in Black and Star Wars.
</P>
<P>
   As if they are playing a joke on the rest of the world, the
Golden Marble Awards reserve one puny category for public service.
After rewarding ad execs for turning nutritional gutters into gold
mines, the Golden Marbles have the audacity to applaud a handful
finalists whose ads fight obesity, drugs, and tell children to
question what they see on television.
</P>
<P>
   The absurd assault on children has convinced several dozen child
psychologists and critics of media manipulation from around the
nation to gather Thursday for a protest outside the Golden Marbles
at the New York Grand Hyatt. The protest is being organized by
Susan Linn, a Harvard Medical School psychologist and assistant
director of the media center at the Judge Baker Children's Center
at Children's Hospital, Diane Levin, Wheelock College education
professor who linked Power Rangers to violent playground behavior,
and Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatrist, associate dean at Harvard
Medical School, and consultant to ``The ``Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers want the government to fund studies on the effect
of child marketing. ``It is appalling to us that creativity is
being rewarded in the service of maipulating children for profit,''
Linn said. ``We hope this is the beginning of a cohesive national
movement to challenge this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a golden opportunity to protest these galling golden
marbles. When both right wingers and liberals compare violent
advertising to Joe Camel, that is a good day. The FTC report made
both Al Gore and George W. Bush denounce the marketing of violence
to children. That is a good day.
</P>
<P>
   We may be reaching a great day of critical mass of people who
are ready to rescue our children. Our kids face canyon walls too
high and too steep to avoid the deluge of commercial trash
collecting at whitewater speed at the bottom. Unless we pull our
kids away from the TV, or force Hollywood and Madison Avenue to
pull ads away from our children, they will be swept away.

&HT;     KISS THE SLIP GOODBYE, AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Any woman who has ever suffered through an outdoor
wedding reception during the summer will understand. The slip had
to die.
</P>
<P>
   A stake had to be driven through its clingy tricot-and-lace
heart. It had to be sent slinking off to that great lingerie
graveyard in the sky, home to the girdle, corset, garter, underwire
bra and all the other devious inventions that have caused so much
female misery.
</P>
<P>
   First pantyhose died a gasping death, as American women took a
clue from their more confident European sisters and sandal-wearing
celebrities and bared their legs, throwing caution and even skin
tones to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same fate has apparently befallen the humble slip, once
a de rigueur prop in the quest for feminine propriety and proper
dressing. Slips have slipped out of sight. They've disappeared.
Been shucked. In an age of sheer indulgence, they've gone pppffft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slip is not only dead, we've already held the funeral,''
said Bernice Cantile, founder of the Menger Smart Shop, a bastion
of stylish dressing in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Cantile, who has worn her share of slips through the decades,
said these days even her ``larger sized'' customers _ women who
traditionally insisted on slips for modesty's sake _ have eschewed
the lacy, frilly, Aunt Bea-ish things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most clothes today are lined, so you don't need slips,'' she
said. ``They just add another layer and that's too bulky'' for
today's sleek designs.
</P>
<P>
   As for clothes you can see through _ well, that's sort of the
point, say fashion industry types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dresses these days made of sheer material usually come with a
slip-dress underneath, or women buy a little slip-dress of nude or
black to go underneath,'' said Kelly Warren, spokeswoman for Saks
Fifth Avenue. ``It's supposed to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Slip dress, she said. Not slip. As slips have evolved from items
used to hide things _ panty lines, bra seams, that embarrassing gap
between your legs when you stand in front of a window _ they've
become chic, Warren said. Sexy. This is not your mother's
Oldsmobile _ those big, boxy, white, industrial-strength numbers
that were forever peeking out from under hemlines, the lingerie
equivalent of toilet paper stuck to your shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we even have those hanging on the floor,''
Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional slip is basically gone,'' said Liz Smith,
spokeswoman for Wacoal America, licensed for Donna Karan Intimates.
</P>
<P>
   Women are ``freer'' with their bodies these days, she said.
Well, um, sort of. Slip-liberation arrived, Smith said, with the
advent of ``shape wear'' _ lighter, smoother, less-sadistic
versions of yesterday's girdle (but still a girdle) that renders
the nylon go-between redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need that extra garment between the garments,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, most women of baby-boom vintage and older recall a time
when slip-wearing was simply something you had to do, especially
for church and other dressy affairs. It was usually a complicated
contraption involving lace at bottom and top and silky straps with
metal fasteners. Wearing one was like being encased in a frilly
sausage tube.
</P>
<P>
   But not to wear a slip was to hint at a certain female moral
laxity, an essential hussiness. ``You're not wearing a slip with
that?'' your mother would ask, her eyes wide.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic female double bind: Not wearing a slip was
tacky, but letting your slip show was ultra-tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many women have rebelled, becoming defiant in
their non-slip-wearing-ways. It's not fashion that prompts them to
push their half-slips to the backs of their lingerie drawers,
little satin puddles of dejection. It's comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Stalwart slip-wearers remain, however, said Beverly Guyer,
director of marketing for Vanity Fair. In fact, studies show that
the top three sellers of ``daywear'' (slips, camisoles and the
like) at department stores nationwide continue to be half-slips and
slips. It's a regional thing: Slip sales are highest in the South,
said Kathy Reynolds, vice president and general manager of Vanity
Fair Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's related to (the region's) more conservative
nature,'' she said. ``Women in the South are more into dressing up
than dressing down, more apt to dress up for church on Sunday.
There's also a modesty issue related to the fact that (Southern
women) wear a lot of white and light colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Slip-buying may be a class thing as well: In fancy boutiques,
clothes come expensively lined; by the time you've hit Wal-Mart,
slips become more of a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Those who rejoice in the demise of the slip shouldn't cheer too
loudly, Smith said. Slips in the form of lacy camisoles meant to
show through suits will be all the rage this fall. So will vintage
slips, Guyer said (that's right, your mother's Oldsmobile). Also
primed to rise from the grave (cue the theme song from ``Psycho'')
are pantyhose, particularly colored and patterned varieties.

THERAPEUTIC ART: CHILDREN'S EXHIBIT REVEALS PAIN, HOPE FOR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  With Photos, Attn: Calif., N.M., Colo. 
By BARBARA KARKABI 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Ryan Hammons had just been dropped off at day care in April 1995,
when his world literally was torn to pieces.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now 7, Ryan was one of the littlest victims of the Oklahoma City
bombing that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and
killed 169 people.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys put a bomb by the building, and they blew it up,'' he
said in a recent telephone interview. ``I remember a big noise,
then they took us to the hospital. I was hurt on my head. Someone
carried me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days, Ryan's life is that of a typical first-grader. But he
gets worried when he and his mom drive near the monument erected at
the bombing site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mom is going to take me there again, and it is
going to happen again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bombing, Ryan suffered from post-traumatic stress
syndrome. Three years ago, Ryan's therapist asked him to draw his
feelings about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ a 4-year-old's version of what happened the day the
building fell down _ is part of a moving new book, ``Childhood
Revealed: Art Expressing Pain, Discovery and Hope`` (Harry N.
Abrams, Inc. $35), edited by Harold S. Koplewicz and Robin F.
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   The scrawled, colored lines of a small child's painting that
might be seen on the side of a kitchen fridge represent the
building's collapse. In a tiny, red box, labeled a safe box, are
Ryan and his brother, mother and therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me feel better to draw the picture,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   His artwork is one of more than 100 pieces in the book and
exhibit of the same name. ``Childhood Revealed,'' a touring
exhibit, opened in Houston this week at the Museum of Health &AMP;
Medical Science and runs through Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The art was created by children ages 4 to 18 with developmental,
psychological and physical problems ranging from learning
differences, abuse and depression to divorce, psychosis and chronic
illness.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million children in the United States suffer from
these conditions, according to Koplewicz, director of the New York
University Child Study Center. But only a fraction have been
diagnosed and treated, said Koplewicz, the force behind the book
and exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose and mission of the art show was to help
destigmatize child mental illness,'' he said. ``And to educate the
American public about how real these illnesses are, how deserving
they are of research and how important it is that everyone
understand that if they are left undiagnosed and untreated, these
children and teens don't really get a fair shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Koplewicz hopes the traveling exhibit, which includes watercolor
drawings, collages and sculpture, will put a human face on child
mental illness. He compares it to the traveling AIDS quilt, which
helped change the way people thought about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You started to realize it could be anyone's mother, brother,
father or child,'' he said. ``I thought, if this could happen in my
lifetime, then certainly the last frontier is mental illness, and
we could destigmatize these disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   The art comes from 700 clinicians who sent in art created by
their patients around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The final pieces were selected by a panel that included an
artist, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, an art
therapist, a writer for the New Yorker, a psychiatrist and a mother
whose child has leukemia and struggles with learning problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, as well as the exhibit, the art is arranged in
sections dealing with each situation _ such as anxiety disorders,
depression, autism, eating disorders and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The art ranges from colorful, almost polished pieces, to naive
images, as well as works in which the artist seems to be crying out
for help _ like ``Angry Eye,'' painted in bright red and black by a
young artist in the hyperactivity section.
</P>
<P>
   There also are hopeful images, like ``Breaking Through,`` by a
15-year-old with bipolar disorder, done in light blue, yellow and
pink pastels and showing two hands reaching across a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Just as moving are the words that go with it: ``... There is a
chain in the middle because I used to put up an emotional wall and
did not let others help me. I used drugs for help instead. Well,
now the chain is broken and I let others help. I am not alone
anymore.'' Two vividly painted pieces in the post-traumatic stress
disorder section were created by a young New Yorker who was 11 when
his mother was randomly shot through her front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up, and I heard a shot go off,'' Cory Newsome recalled.
``My sister got help. I didn't know what was going to happen or
what was going on. I didn't cry at all. But for a while my mother
had scars and I was scared of her. ... I'm better now. I feel
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of celebrities contributed to the book, including
Whoopi Goldberg, who dealt with dyslexia as a child, and Deborah
Norville, who has struggled with depression. ``Today'' co-host
Katie Couric wrote the foreword. Each section is introduced by a
piece explaining the particular problem, signs to look for and
coping resources.
</P>
<P>
   Koplewicz hopes the exhibit's images and words will touch
people's hearts and change their minds about children with
psychiatric illnesses. In many cases, with therapy and medications,
these children can be helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want visitors to take the opportunity to learn how real
these disorders are and how frequently they occur,'' he said. ``We
don't want people to look at the artwork and say: `Oh my God, my
child did a picture like that, does it mean he is depressed?' This
is just wonderful artwork by wonderful children who have a
psychiatric illness. They are sharing with us their pain and their
hope for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a senior in high school, Newsome hopes his picture will have
an effect on viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to understand what kids go through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   John Gray's best-selling book ``Men Are from Mars, Women Are
from Venus'' is being turned into a musical. Why haven't more
self-help books been given the musical treatment?
</P>
<P>
   The musical theater could do worse than seek inspiration in the
vast literature of self-improvement. Actually, it does do worse.
Even now a musical extravaganza inspired by Barry Manilow's song
``Copacabana'' is warming up for a Boston debut. Need I say more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'' seems almost made
for the stage, as do so many other self-help titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Co-Dependent No More.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Living Single.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cinderella Complex.''
</P>
<P>
   `The Idiot's Guide to Amazing Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   That last title is perfect for the all-singing, all-dancing
treatment. I can almost hear the overture.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one self-help book that practically begs for musical
treatment: ``Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives,''
by America's favorite moral taskmaster, Dr. Laura Schlessinger.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura has conquered radio, print, and television. Broadway
beckons. We've had enough ``feel-good'' musicals. It's time for a
``feel good or else'' musical.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: the title of the book is a little long. Maybe it
could be shortened to ``Ten Stupid Things.'' Or just ``Stupid
Things.'' (``These Stupid Things Remind Me of You''?)
</P>
<P>
   Since Dr. Laura is probably too busy to star in the production,
Kathie Lee Gifford might consider the role. She's been looking for
a juicy Broadway part.
</P>
<P>
   I see it as essentially a one-woman show (what else?), with a
back-up chorus. In the first act, chorus members could wear masks
and assume various identities _ single mothers, gays and lesbians,
tabloid reporters. As Dr. Laura/Kathie Lee belts out one of the
many show-stopping numbers _ ``Do as I Say (Not as I Do),'' ``You
Can't Have it All (Unless You're Me),'' ``I'm My Kid's Mom (And I'm
Your Mom Too, So Shut Up And Listen)'' _ the chorus would sing its
dissent, antiphonally. The possibilities for dramatic tension are
practically limitless, although in the end, Dr. Laura/Kathie Lee
would, as always, drown out the other voices.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't worked out all the details yet, but by the third act
Dr. Laura/Kathie Lee would have sung and danced her way through all
of ``The Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives'' _
Stupid Devotion, Stupid Passion, Stupid Attachment, etc. The show
could end with her standing on stage in a single spotlight, taking
calls from the audience and giving advice, which would give people
the opportunity to actually talk on their cell phones in the
theater, instead just letting them ring during the show.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through my copy of ``The Ten Stupid Things Women Do to
Mess Up Their Lives,'' I see potential songs in the subtitles on
almost every page.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sex Too Soon Can Do To You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Living In Is Giving In.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams Can Be Dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I Have the Right to Leave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I Still Really Love Him.'' How does it go? ``I know he's a
bore/but I love him/ He's rotten to the core/but I love him. . .''
I can almost hear Kathie Lee putting her personal stamp on that
one.

THE THRILL IS GONE: MARKETING VIOLENCE CALLS FOR ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are complicated times for rock 'n' roll moms.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission released a report that
finds that the music, film, and videogame industries aggressively
market violent, adult-oriented entertainment to underage youths.
This being an election year, the candidates have already come out
swinging. Vice President Al Gore threatened, if elected, to
initiate legislation if Hollywood can't clean up it's act _ a
gesture Governor George W. Bush's campaign has called hypocritical,
coming from the beneficiary of Hollywood's deep, largely Democratic
pockets. One can only imagine to what lengths Bush might go to
preserve family values.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a non-election year, the area spanning free speech and
an increasingly violence-drenched entertainment culture is gray. As
a music lover, an arts writer, and a supporter of freedom of
expression, I cringe at the idea of government intervention _ even
under the relatively innocent auspices of regulating advertising.
Once Washington establishes a controlling hand in the marketing of
art, it's a frighteningly short distance to content.
</P>
<P>
   As a mother, I cringe at the loss of innocence I observe in my
children on what seems to be a daily basis. They are enthralled
with image and sound, and happily seduced by every arm of the
entertainment industry. I have a 7-year-old who lisps menacing
dialogue from R-rated movie trailers he sees on TV. My 9-year-old
daughter chants lyrics to Eminem songs. The resident 12-year-old
argues with the desperate logic of an entertainment junkie that he
is mature enough to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Fates willing, that's true. There is, in fact, no hard evidence
that indicates exposure to violent media leads to acts of violence.
For every troubled teenager who guns down his schoolmates, there
are tens of thousands who listened to the same hard-core CDs,
played the same violence-strewn video games, and conned their
parents into taking them to see ``The Matrix'' _ and never hurt a
fly.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are subtler than that, and scarier, too. I'm not
worried that my children will grow into aggressive adults, or that
they'll imitate the behavior they see on a screen. Rather it's the
idea of experiencing violence as something interesting and
glamorous, exciting and entertaining, that's most distressing. It's
the prospect of a generation that's desensitized to suffering, and
proportionally titillated by the thrill of the kill.
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to the issue at hand: how to hold accountable an
entertainment industry that would prefer to collect revenues than
caretake the emotional and ethical development of children. The
FTC's study, conducted over 15 months, found that of the 44 R-rated
movies they looked at, 35 were systematically targeted at young
teens. Of 118 video games carrying an M rating (for 17 and over) 83
targeted children under 17, and all of the 55 music recordings with
explicit-content labels were intentionally marketed to young teens.
</P>
<P>
   All three major arms of the entertainment machine, the study
found, are intentionally circumventing their own voluntary labeling
systems with ad campaigns for adult product during teen-frequented
TV shows, in teen-targeted magazines, and on popular youth-oriented
Internet sites. It's arguably immoral and possibly actionable. It's
undeniably sleazy.
</P>
<P>
   But one could also argue that parents ultimately must shoulder
responsibility for monitoring their children's consumption That,
however, would involve two tasks that have become increasingly
uncommon as guilt-riddled, two-working-parent households become the
norm: tracking kids closely, and saying no.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship is not a solution The FTC isn't pressing for
legislation, but rather an expansion of voluntary codes prohibiting
promotion of adult product to underage kids that wouldn't trigger
First Amendment concerns. If the corporate engine that drives the
entertainment industry has even a vague grasp of the importance of
unfettered artistic expression _ never mind taking care of kids _
they'll respond quickly, not only with age-appropriate advertising
but with more informative ratings and content guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's up to me. To wake up at 7 after spending half the
night in a rock club, make bag lunches, go to work, and stumble
home bleary-eyed but with the will to do what's right, not what's
easy. I want my children to hear and see everything. They should
know that art doesn't have boundaries, and that self-expression
includes the dark, dank parts too. But they need the strength to
process it that comes with age and experience. And that should be
everyone's concern.

   When British fashion designer Slinky Vagabond, whose lines are
inspired by such sports as fencing, sends male models dressed for
spring down the runway in New York Saturday, they'll be wearing
Reeboks. Funky ones. Made of coated denim or bronze, gold and
silver fabric, the sneakers sport an early-'80s running shoe
silhouette, including side stripes and rubber from the sole
stretched up to the tip of the toe.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go looking for the Slinky sneakers at City Sports. Try
Louis, Boston. Or Harrod's. These sneakers, after all, are more of
a ``look'' than an athletic shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our fastest-growing segment of the business,'' said
Linda Beane, marketing director for the Canton, Mass. company's
Reebok Classic line, which creates ``lifestyle'' sneakers, as
opposed to the footwear favored by Olympic athletes. ``For 2001 and
2002, it's even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Shunned since the early '90s as unfashionable, sneakers have
become trendy again as Europeans crave brightly colored Pumas,
Adidas, and New Balance. Meanwhile, stateside, vintage sneakers _
especially Nikes _ have quietly developed a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok is zeroing in on the trend by launching about 50 new
sneakers this year, none designed with athletics in mind, though
the technology is built in just in case a sprint is in order. These
sneakers, the company declares proudly, are about fashion _ not
track and field.
</P>
<P>
   So, any old tennies won't do. Your sneakers should either look
like the ones you wore in sixth grade or seem suitable for a walk
in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of the casual workplace . . . people want to
be comfortable and they want to look good being comfortable,''
Beane said. ``The old white sneakers cruising around town don't
work anymore for people who want to look urban.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Prada Sport's sneaker gets credit for truly pushing
such footwear into mainstream fashion, other design houses,
including DKNY, were early comers to the game, upping the sneaker
cache quotient instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's OK to wear Skechers with a skirt. But prices _ like
styles _ vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Prada Sport's silver and blue sneaker retails for $250, making
it among the most expensive. And Jil Sander and Hermes varieties
have never been cheap.
</P>
<P>
   DKNY's high-tech-looking sneakers _ some even have computer guts
or a ``motherboard'' motif _ are in the $95 range. Others in that
line, including no-lace suede slip-ons called ``Sphinx,'' cost
about $70.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are knockoffs. Steve Madden's lavender sneaker,
called ``Faster,'' is inspired by '70s models and not for the faint
of heart. Price: $49. Candie's makes a black and pink style for
$45. Freeport even makes a sneaker mule (is that an oxymoron?) for
$48.
</P>
<P>
   The most affordable hot shoe around may be Nike Air Rifts, which
retail for $85. Designed for Kenyan runners who are accustomed to
running barefoot, this split-toe sneaker looks like it was made for
an ostrich. It even comes with a split-toe sock.
</P>
<P>
   NikeTown on Newbury Street reports that it has trouble keeping
the shoe in stock. Meanwhile, sales clerks say shipment dates are
closely held secrets, as is the color of the next Air Rift. (Some
die-hards have begun collecting the shoe in all available colors.)
</P>
<P>
   Nike trotted out the Air Rift about five years ago, and recently
brought back the sneaker on a limited basis in New York, Los
Angeles, and a few other markets, including Boston. Certain colors
are sold only in certain cities, with such collectible exclusivity
contributing to the craze. (Robin's-egg blue is available here.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Keds are making sneakers that look more like shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And Cole Haan has launched a line of sleek shoes that operate
more like sneakers, complete with Nike Air technology (that visible
little air bubble) built into the sole. Nike owns Cole Haan.
</P>
<P>
   Prada now makes a golf shoe that is intended for the fairway as
well as the runway. Gucci recently unveiled a biking-inspired shoe
(or was it a sneaker?). And this fall, bowling shoes are as popular
as bowling bags as a must-have accessory.
</P>
<P>
   All this amounts to the fact that the line between the two types
of footwear for men and women has become blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are shoes _ again, shoes that almost look like
sneakers _ made by Icon that are ergonomically engineered with
flexible rubber soles, sporting Tide or Campbell's Tomato soup
logos or art, designed by individual painters, on the soft leather
uppers.
</P>
<P>
   Available locally at Saks Fifth Avenue, Tess, and Cuoio, Icons
are selling steadily at $260 _ or $500 for signed and numbered
versions.
</P>
<P>
   At those rates, tread lightly.

US GOAL IS A SPOT IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ It's rather pleasant down in Canberra. There's the
afternoon tea and toast at the Parkroyal Hotel, a video arcade
featuring World Cup '98 in the lounge, and a gigantic shopping mall
across the street. And come Friday night, the US men's soccer team
can watch the Olympic opening ceremonies on TV, just like their
families back home.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Americans make history here by surviving the
preliminary round, a week in Australia's capital is as close to the
heart of the Games as they're going to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not as much grandeur here as there is in Sydney,''
reports defender Jeff Agoos, whose mates take on the Czech Republic
in their opener Wednesday night in Canberra. ``We want to move on
and get the full Olympic experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Yanks make the final, which the country's betting
shops consider extremely unlikely, the closest they'll come to the
host city is the airport, which they passed through on their way
from San Diego to Canberra. Though the team could have marched in
the ceremonies, it would have meant standing for six hours in the
evening chill the day before its second match against Cameroon,
which is likely to decide whether the US stays or goes.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 appearances since 1924, the Americans have been long gone
before the medal round. They're 4-12-6 all-time and were 1-1-1 on
home soil four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, with a roster filled with MLS and overseas
pros and a favorable draw with Kuwait for a finale, they've got
more than a passing chance to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got as good a chance as anyone in our group,''
says midfielder Peter Vagenas. `I mean, that's why we start off
with zero points. But if we bring our best and the others bring
their best, I think we'll get out of our group.''
</P>
<P>
   The US women, who won the gold medal in Atlanta and last year's
World Cup, will be in Sydney for sure. After their opener against
nemesis Norway in Melbourne Thursday afternoon, they'll fly up to
march in the ceremonies. But the only way they'll be back here is
if they survive a brutal group that also includes the Chinese, the
Olympic and World Cup finalists.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans can handle the Norwegians, who've beaten them
three times this year, they'll need only defeat Nigeria to advance.
If they can't, they'll immediately be in a win-or-die fix.
</P>
<P>
   The US males are used to that. They lost to Italy in their 1992
opener and to Argentina last time. And their opener against the
burly Czechs figures to be their toughest match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have our hands full,'' concedes coach Clive Charles,
who'll have veteran Brad Friedel in goal. ``The Czechs are big,
strong, and very direct. They go straight to goal. They not only
have talent, they have size, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yanks can manage even a draw against the Czechs, they'll
have a good chance to make it to the quarterfinals against Brazil
up in sunny Brisbane on the Gold Coast. Odds are their quest would
end there, without their ever seeing Stadium Australia.
</P>
<P>
   That's no novelty for the Americans, though. Even as hosts last
time, they never got any closer to Atlanta than Birmingham, Ala.
``At a tournament of this size, you know you can't have everyone at
one venue,'' says Agoos. `We knew we'd be in satellite cities.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Agoos and his playmates get to meet the
Kuwaitis in Melbourne, where the training complex in the industrial
suburbs is right next to an oil refinery with a smokestack that
burns with a huge flame. It's supposed to look a bit like the
Olympic cauldron.

 &HT;    Will Texas' Running of the Bulls rival Pamplona's?
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - The way Derik Strelsky sees it, Pamplona's got
nothing on Jarrell, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So when Oct. 14 rolls around, and 20 crossbred bulls come
barrelling down a 200-yard chute on the heels of however many
people are, well, crazy enough to climb in there with them,
Strelsky will be watching with glee as the dust rises around him.
</P>
<P>
   Music _ maybe Bruce Springsteen's ``Born to Run,'' or something
with Spanish flair _ will be blaring in the background, and
hundreds of people will be crowded along the fence, watching to see
what happens when you mix 2,000-pound Texas rodeo bulls with a
bunch of adrenalin junkies.
</P>
<P>
   Strelsky, a former rodeo clown and bullfighter, is modeling his
Running of the Bulls after the alcohol-soaked, centuries-old melee
in Pamplona, Spain, made famous in Ernest Hemingway's novel ``The
Sun Also Rises.'' But the Jarrell version, he says, will have Texas
style _ it will unfold on the baked dirt of a Williamson County
ranch under the blistering Texas sun instead of the cobblestone
streets of a quaint Spanish town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be invigorating. I think the hair will be
standing up on the back of their necks. I think it'll be very
exciting for the participants,'' Strelsky said.
</P>
<P>
   If you think Texas is a strange place to stage a Running of the
Bulls, you're not alone. But Strelsky, who's spending about $20,000
to put it on, says just as soon as people tell him he's nuts for
planning it, they want to know how they can sign up. So far, more
than 75 people have registered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be disappointed, I'll cry if there's not 5,000 people
there,'' Strelsky said. ``I hope there's not enough places for
people to stand, I hope we don't have enough Port-a-Potties.''
</P>
<P>
   The running will take place at Gibbs Ranch near Jarrell, with
participants divided into groups of 50 or so. Twenty bulls will be
set free behind each batch of runners, who will dash down a
fenced-in alley toward an arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I think they'll hurt anybody is if somebody falls
down and gets accidently stepped on,'' said stock contractor Wayne
Gibbs, who owns the ranch and the burly animals _ mixes of Watusi,
Longhorn and Brahman. ``They're not like the Mexican fighting bulls
that stay mad at the world all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, all sorts _ from lawyers and bankers to soldiers and
doctors _ have taken the bait. A bus load of tourists is scheduled
to drive down from Dallas, and companies are considering forming
teams to participate, Strelsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a bunch of thrill seekers _ people that want
to do something that nobody else does,'' Strelsky said. But not
him. ``Oh lord no. I'm too fat and old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Caballero, a field marketing manager from Fort Worth who
works at Taco Bell's corporate offices in Dallas, has already
registered. ``Who knows, it might be fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Caballero knows what he's getting into. He traveled to
Pamplona in July for the Fiestas de San Fermin, and survived the
running of the bulls there. He expects a calmer Texas version
because rodeo bulls are less aggressive than Spanish fighting
bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that macho. It's really scary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strelsky says he's staging the event as a way to draw attention
to the Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association sport of bullfighting, which
pits human against bovine in a 70-second one-on-one grudge match.
Unlike Spanish bullfighting, the idea is not to kill the bull, or
to swish a red cape at it, but to get as close to it as possible
without getting hooked or trampled. A bullfighting competition will
immediately follow the Running of the Bulls in Jarrell.
</P>
<P>
   Strelsky, who grew up in Rockdale and now lives in Temple, broke
ribs, fingers and his nose during his own rodeo career. ``It feels
like a baseball bat if they hit correctly,'' he said. ``But most of
the time they reach out to grab you and throw you up in the air and
you don't even feel that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen people have died in the Pamplona running in the last
75 years. But Strelsky says his event will be safer _ bulls are
less likely to slip on dirt than cobblestones, and the Jarrell
event will cover just 200 yards instead of half a mile. Alcohol
will be sold on the premises, but participants will not be allowed
to drink until after they've run with the bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances will be on hand just in case. Participants also will
be required to sign a two-page waiver.
</P>
<P>
   The running won't be the first to take place outside of
Pamplona. Twice before, a similar event has taken place in
Mesquite, Nev. But the event has been postponed because of lagging
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   If the response is good in Jarrell, Strelsky says he'll plan
similar events in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of proceeds will benefit the Peaceable Kingdom Retreat
for Children near Salado, Texas, a 125-acre retreat on the Lampasas
River for children with chronic illnesses. Strelsky says he wants
to donate at least $10,000, but that will depend on how much money
he raises.
</P>
<P>
   Strelsky says he has fielded some calls from animal rights
activists who don't want him to hold the event. But Strelsky says
the animals are treated better than most cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bulls are probably some of the best kept, well-cared for
animals in the world,'' he said. ``If they didn't earn their keep,
they'd probably be on somebody's dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County Sheriff's Department animal control officers
and deputies will be on hand, spokeswoman Tracy Karol said.

NHIS: REDUCED SPEED AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with questions about the deaths of drivers Adam Petty and
Kenny Irwin, who were killed in similar accidents eight weeks apart
at New Hampshire International Speedway this year, NASCAR officials
announced Saturday they will attempt to curb speeds at the mile
oval in Loudon, N.H., by mandating the use of 1-inch carburetor
restrictor plates for the Winston Cup and Busch North Series events
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief operating
officer, said in a phone interview Tuesday from Daytona Beach,
Fla., that officials explored various measures aimed at improving
safety conditions at NHIS, including ``soft-wall'' technology last
week at the track.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were unable to come up with viable alternatives
that could be implemented in time for Sunday's Dura Lube 300
Sponsored by Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear to us that the track has not changed in the
time that we've been there, but what has changed is that the cars
are going faster,'' Helton said. ``Be that as it may, we've not
been able to answer enough questions about other options as to what
to do, but we can address the speed of the cars by using restrictor
plates, and we have experience with those, and we know how to react
to a restrictor plate in a short period of time, and that's why we
chose to do that for this weekend at New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, the 19-year-old grandson of NASCAR legend Richard Petty
and son of Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty, was killed May 12 when
his car slammed into the wall in Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks later, in the same spot, Irwin, 31, was killed when
his car hit the wall, rolled onto the driver's side, and skidded
along the banking for several hundred feet before rolling over onto
its roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is, in part, a search for an answer,'' Helton said.
``I think it's also, in part, a search for `what else can we do?'
when we can't explain why an accident like Kenny's and Adam's
occurs. What else can we do to try and (prevent) it, because
there's no universal fix that's going to make every one of these
laps, at every racetrack we go to, inescapable of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Irwin's death, several drivers insisted that
NASCAR should take a close look at the track, saying two fatalities
in such a short period at the same track couldn't be coincidental.
Some drivers even suggested implementing a foam-wall covering in
Turn 3, similar to those used as buffers in tire-wall barriers at
the road course in Watkins Glen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said NASCAR conducted a ``soft-wall'' impact test at NHIS
last week under simulated race conditions. This came a week after
the race at Darlington, S.C., where drivers hinted of a boycott at
NHIS if no safety improvements were made. But Helton said NASCAR
had scheduled the NHIS test well before the grumblings at
Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   So what did the tests show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we found was that there were too many concerns
and unanswered questions as to what reaction the material will
create,'' Helton said. ``So we've not been able to answer
sufficiently the questions of how do you attach the material and
what happens when a car hits the material and what effect the
reaction of that material has on the rest of the race cars, on the
racetrack, as well as the spectators and other elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll keep looking at that and we'll keep looking at other
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As Helton pointed out, the qualifying speeds of Winston Cup cars
at NHIS have risen steadily since 1993, when Mark Martin won the
pole with a lap of 126.871 miles per hour, to this past July, when
Rusty Wallace blistered the track with a record-setting lap of
132.089 m.p.h. Has the increasing sophistication and speed of the
cars made them too fast for the track at NHIS?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Helton said. ``The more significant area
where NASCAR polices the sport and makes decisions is on the
equipment, the race car itself. I think when it comes to a
racetrack being able to handle Winston Cup events, or even a Busch
Grand National event for that matter, it's up to the physical plant
to stay in tune with the racing surface and with the economic
ability to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the promoter, economically, can keep his facility
in good shape and host the fans that attend and move them in and
out and afford the economics of the prize money and those different
components, those are the big issues. I think when NASCAR finds
something at a racetrack that's changed, and changed for the bad,
then NASCAR works with the promoter to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Helton said in July, NASCAR has not found anything to
suggest a problem with the track at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still maintain even today, here in September, that the track
has not changed,'' he said. ``There's nothing about that racetrack
that's different today than it was 10 years ago when we first
started racing there. I think relative to the conversation about
the two accidents, it's a positive for the track. I think it means
that nothing the track has done has led to those accidents
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then it becomes a function of what led to those accidents
happening, and short of just taking a position that everybody
understands auto racing is inherently a dangerous sport, I think
the uniqueness of two incidents that have a great deal of
similarity has heightened the concern and the questioning of `Hey,
what's going on here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what is puzzling everyone about NHIS.

JETS TRAINERS HELP WRAP UP COMEBACK WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Three times Al Groh stopped to say thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without you, we wouldn't have won this game,'' he said. ``The
job you did for us was big.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the scene, in a near-empty locker room, more than an
hour after the New York Jets' dramatic come-from-behind victory
over the Patriots Monday night in Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Groh wasn't talking to any of his players. Or his coaches.
They had left long before this. All that remained were used strips
of tape, soiled uniforms, equipment managers scurrying around
packing up _ and the training staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the mind of Groh, the first-year Jets head coach, the
trainers' contributions were just as important as those of on-field
heroes Vinny Testaverde, Wayne Chrebet, Bryan Cox, and Mo Lewis on
the memorable night.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet, despite playing with a calf injury, came up large in
the fourth quarter with a series of exceptional catches, two for
touchdowns, that chilled a tremendous performance by the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we got to the stadium tonight, Chrebet wasn't playing,''
said Groh. ``When I saw him in the hotel (Sunday) night, I figured
no way. He could barely walk. His leg was all taped and wrapped in
ice. The kid was in pain. In my mind, I wasn't counting on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these trainers stayed with him all day for two days. He
had more treatment than anyone in an intensive care unit. It was
round-the-clock. They did everything they could do to get him back
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him in warmups, I thought what I was seeing was
exceptional on the part of our staff, and Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   In a leisurely practice session Saturday, without pads or
contact, Chrebet, the Jets' best receiver and Testaverde's favorite
target, got hurt without getting hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a freak thing,'' said Groh. ``He jumped to catch a
pass, and when he came down, he stumbled and pulled something in
his calf. It was bad. He had a hard time walking on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet was in the lineup, but in the first 50 minutes of the
game, he was almost invisible. Whether it was the injury, or a
stifling Patriot defense, it just wasn't happening for the New York
offense.
</P>
<P>
   After an impressive, 12-play, 74-yard touchdown drive late in
the first quarter that gave New York a 7-3 lead, the Jets' offense
disappeared. Over the next 37 minutes, the Jets crossed midfield
once. For one play. For 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of things,'' said Testaverde, who went
from awful to sensational in the final 10 minutes of the game.
``Their defense is very good. They have good players. They are very
quick and play their schemes well. But it was just as much our
fault as anything they were doing. We made a lot of mistakes, both
mental and physical. All of us did. And that isn't like us. We
usually don't play that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth period, we changed what we were doing. We went
to the `empty nest' (no runners behind the quarterback) to spread
them out and force them to cover our wideouts more man to man. For
three periods, we wanted to look for the running back against their
linebacker matchups. It wasn't working. In the fourth period, we
went back to the wideouts, getting the ball to them.''
</P>
<P>
   This changed the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustratng part is that we made Vinny look so bad for
three quarters, and then they made all of the big plays in the
final 10 minutes to win the game,'' said Drew Bledsoe. ``Vinny's a
top quarterback, and when your defense can throw a guy like that
off his game, the way ours did, we should win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have put the game out of reach before that, with all
of the chances we had. But give Vinny and those receivers credit.
They made some fantastic plays to beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that fourth period, I felt sure we were going to win. We
had them. We had the crowd out of the game. The great feeling about
playing on the road in the NFL is to hear the silence in the
stadium when you have the lead and have the game under control. We
just let this game get away. It was a game we should have won.''

<P>
   SYDNEY _ It was the ``flyme'' that did it. The Olympics were
still a rumor until the runners bearing the fiery boomerang torch
hit town Monday. It was then that Sydneysiders who'd dreamed about,
dreaded, or shrugged off this five-ringed global circus finally
realized that showtime was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT'S HERE,'' the Daily Telegraph proclaimed on its front page,
showing faces cheering as the flame went past. And on Friday
evening, one of Australia's own _ Dawn Fraser? Mel Gibson?
Crocodile Dundee? _ will use it to ignite the cauldron inside
Stadium Australia and the Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad will begin
in this cosmopolitan oceanside city.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 44 years since the Olympics have been held in what the
natives call Oz, and they have changed utterly. Only 3,000 athletes
from 72 countries competed in 150 events in Melbourne in 1956. This
time, the numbers are 10,000, 199, and 300. The athletes' village
is so huge that it will be a separate suburb (Newington) after the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   There was jubilation hereabouts seven years ago when Sydney
outpolled favored Beijing by two votes to stage the millennial
Games. And while the local attitude about this massive undertaking
was a breezy, ``No worries,'' the citizenry soon began having
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Costs soared. Revenue estimates had to be scaled back. The
ticket plan was botched. Both of the country's International
Olympic Committee members _ Phil Coles and Kevan Gosper _ were
caught up in the Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Coles was censured by his peers and forced off the organizing
committee here. And though Gosper wriggled off the hook, he was
later ridiculed for arranging/allowing his 11-year-old daughter
Sophie to be the first Australian to carry the torch after it was
kindled at Olympia (``Sophie's Choice,'' the headlines smirked).
</P>
<P>
   As the Games drew closer, many Sydneysiders wondered whether
they shouldn't just box up the whole bloody thing and ship it back
to Switzerland on a tramp steamer.
</P>
<P>
   While they wanted to show the world that Australia is more than
kangaroos, sharks, and outback, they weren't sure they could handle
that much of the world at once.
</P>
<P>
   Could the city swallow nearly half a million Aussie tourists and
more than 100,000 foreigners for a fortnight? Were there enough
hotel rooms? Was there enough beer? Would the train and bus system
collapse? ``The world and his dog are on their way,'' warned
columnist Peter FitzSimons.
</P>
<P>
   They've been arriving all week, even as thousands of
Sydneysiders were skipping town for the States and Europe to avoid
the craziness. The visitors have been gawking at the Harbour Bridge
and the Opera House. They've been sunning themselves on Circle
Quay, watching the ferries chuff across the water. They've been
climbing up to The Rocks, heading out to Bondi Beach for an early
spring dip. And they'll be staying, most of them, until October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun side is starting to come in,'' said Eli Gallwey, who
has been seeing more than 3,000 visitors a day walk across the
threshold at the Sydney Visitor Centre. ``To see the quay
brightened up with all the flags and flowers . . .''
</P>
<P>
   All over the city, banners in the Olympic colors are flapping in
the breeze. Club France has set up shop at the old Rawson Institute
for Seamen. The peculiar sounds of espanol, italiano, russki, and
American are being overheard on George Street. And day by day, the
usual ``Sydney cynicism'' is giving way to exuberance and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``WE'RE READY'' the Sun-Herald declared Sunday, after more than
90,000 people had turned up for the dress rehearsal of the opening
ceremonies. The trains are running all night now, with many
restaurants and shops staying open around the clock. And a nation
of understated skeptics has put on its green-and-gold glasses. Four
years ago in Atlanta, the Australian team won only 44 medals. Now,
the Daily Telegraph is projecting them for 99, only two fewer than
the US won while topping the table last time.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic schedule has been set up to showcase the home side.
The Matildas, the women's soccer team that had to pose naked for a
calendar to get anybody to notice them, will play Germany Wednesday
night in Canberra in the first event of the Games. And the first
medal event Saturday will be the women's triathlon, which the
Aussies are expected to sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the cyclists, the sailors, the rowers, the field
hockey teams, and especially the swimmers, is immense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about the Olympic Games at the turn of the
century in your own country,'' said Don Talbot, who coaches the
Australian swim team. ``There's a lot of magic in that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was magic in Melbourne 44 years ago when the Aussies
finished third behind the Soviets and Yanks and Fraser and Murray
Rose and Betty Cuthbert became folk heroes. This time, the home
folks have crowned their heroes and heroines in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, they snapped up every ticket in the stadium for the
women's 400 meters to watch Cathy Freeman, their Aborigine world
champion. Ian ``The Thorpedo'' Thorpe, their teen-aged king of the
pool, is more visible than the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and worst things are being recognized everywhere you
go, even walking down the street,'' Thorpe said. ``It can be quite
daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   If Thorpe can anchor the 400 freestyle relay team to a victory
over the never-beaten Yanks Saturday night, they'll put his face(or maybe his size-17 feet) on the $50 bill. If you wear the
green-and-gold, gold brings green when the Games are down under.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century, the Olympics have been half a world
away beyond the equator. Now, they're back in a land where
September means spring. Until Kazakhs and Kenyans and Kuwaitis
began coming through customs this week, until the ``flyme'' finally
made it to New South Wales, the Games were merely a date on a
calendar. Now, for Sydney, it's time to say, ``G'day,'' to the
world.

<P>
   The geniuses who helped make Stone &AMP; Webster what it is today _
bankrupt, that is _ are convening again in Boston. And if I could
ask this sorry board of directors just one question at their
meeting at Ropes &AMP; Gray it would be this: Why has Kerner Smith been
allowed to walk away from the disaster he presided over with $3.5
million in goodbye money and Edward Sweeney, who got the shaft
after 35 years on the job, not seen a dime of the $3 million a jury
awarded him?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is all about who wins and who loses all
too often in Corporate America today.
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown of Stone &AMP; Webster, a once great Boston institution
that over 111 years built everything from the MIT campus to most of
the nation's nuclear plants, took years of mismanagement to
accomplish, starting with that fossil William F. Allen Jr. to his
handpicked successor, Bruce ``We Hardly Knew You'' Coles, to Kerner
Smith. Stone &AMP; Webster is gone, but the stink lives on in the
bankruptcy court, in shareholder suits, and a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The big losers have been the shareholders and the employees, who
got the double whammy of losing their jobs and their savings. The
employees, after all, were the largest shareholders with about 4
million shares, or 30 percent of the company, in their pension fund
and employee savings plan. Those shares, which topped out at $55 a
few months after Smith arrived, are worth about $1.20 today.
</P>
<P>
   The people driving this train wreck, Smith and his crew, will
whine they lost out along with shareholders, that their options are
now worthless. But they will manage fine. The sale of Stone &AMP;
Webster's assets to a Louisiana company triggered golden parachutes
for Smith and three other executives equal to three times their
salary and bonus. A fifth executive got two times his salary and
bonus. All received medical and other goodies for three years.
(Smith, by the way, didn't return my call.)
</P>
<P>
   Smith's chute was worth about $3.5 million. Executive vice
president Peter M. Evans, who worked at Stone &AMP; Webster just 18
months, will get $2.2 million. (Another winner: Jacobs Engineering
Group., which lost out in the bidding to Shaw Group Inc. and will
get a $10 million breakup fee.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others who will have to wade through bankruptcy
proceeding to see what, if anything, they get, Smith and his top
executives have no such problem. Shaw assumed their contracts as
part of the buyout; they will get their money.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sweeney isn't so lucky. Stone &AMP; Webster was the only place
Sweeney ever worked, joining the company straight out of college
and rising to vice president in 35 years. But Sweeney was fired in
1998, supposedly part of one of Smith's downsizings. He sued,
claiming he was a victim of age discrimination, and a Suffolk
County jury this year awarded him about $3 million. Unemployed and
living in San Diego, Sweeney is now one in a long line of unsecured
creditors hoping to get paid something.
</P>
<P>
   We will see no more brick-and-mortar monuments to the skill of
Stone &AMP; Webster's engineers, only mountains of paper from its
lawyers. The SEC, for instance, is investigating how the company
could issue an annual report and then restate its earnings weeks
later. Investigators will want to know who knew what, when in the
massive overruns at a power plant Stone &AMP; Webster was building in
Tiverton, R.I., the straw that broke the company's back. Where,
indeed, were the auditors?
</P>
<P>
   If I were, heaven forbid, a shareholder, I would have my lawyer
take depositions from every director. Among my questions: In the
three years that Smith was in charge, what kind of buyout offers
did the directors receive, and why did they pass?
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders and employees have bought and paid for nothing less
than the truth. They have a right to know what might have been.

PATRIOTS HAVE MET THE ENEMY

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Last week Bill Parcells declared the border
war was over between the New England Patriots and New York Jets. As
usual, Tuna was ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   The border war is over all right, and Monday night the Jets
proved it. At the moment, they are the better team and the better
organization, so feuding with them is futile. What the Patriots
need to do is forget about the Jets and start worrying about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since this whole sordid affair between the Jets and Patriots
began four years ago, New York has beaten New England five times in
seven games, every time at the draft table, and twice at the
negotiating table. That is not a war. It's a rout.
</P>
<P>
   So it's time to put talk of Tuna Bowls and Tuna Helper Bowls
behind them and worry about a more pressing situation. Their own
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their 1996 Super Bowl appearance, the Patriots have
slid downhill, with the pace picking up each season. They have gone
from 11-5 to 10-6 to 9-7 to 8-8 to 0-2. They have lost one of the
best running backs in the league and haven't come close to
replacing him (oh please don't compare Robert Edwards to Curtis
Martin, because when you do, you just show your ignorance). They
have seen their offensive line fall apart until the players have to
be introduced to each other every other play.
</P>
<P>
   They have a salary cap situation that is horrendous because they
paid the wrong players too much too often and they have a draft
history that is worse than the Selective Service's.
</P>
<P>
   They have a team with little depth that relies on a defense that
simply isn't as good as you want to believe it is.
</P>
<P>
   They have problems.
</P>
<P>
   What, you say, is the proof of the latter point about this
vaunted defense? The proof comes in games like Monday night's.
</P>
<P>
   For all the defense did to baffle Jets quarterback Vinny
Testaverde for much of the night, in the end it couldn't even slow
him down when it had to. That is not a great defense.
</P>
<P>
   One minute Testaverde was 7 of 25 for 116 yards. Next he was 9
of 12 for 165 yards and two touchdowns when the game was being
decided. If Monday night were an isolated incident, you could write
it off to bad luck, but it reminded you of a game a year ago when
this same vaunted defense held the Buffalo Bills and Doug Flutie in
check all afternoon in Foxborough _ until it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   That day, the defense let Flutie take the Bills down the field
to the touchdown that tied it, 10-10, late in the fourth quarter
and then right down the field again for the winning field goal in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Great defenses don't do that. Great defenses win the 13-10 games
and they hold 19-7 leads with nine minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Great defenses play like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or even the
Miami Dolphins. Given 19 points, they usually hold on. They do just
enough to win, as Tampa did against the Patriots two weekends ago.
They don't do just enough to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Give this defense 19 points and it might hold, and then again it
might not, because it has no game-breaking player. No Warren Sapp
to make the big sack or allow someone else to do it because of the
attention being paid to him.
</P>
<P>
   This is a defense of good to very good players but not great
ones, so it plays well, but is it as good a defense as Buffalo's or
Miami's?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Is it as good as Tampa's? A thousand times no.
</P>
<P>
   So what are you left with?
</P>
<P>
   You're left with a loss in a game in which the offense
controlled the ball for nearly 31 of the final 45 minutes, meaning
the defense cannot complain that it was on the field too long.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to look at that. Unfortunately, both of them
are bad.
</P>
<P>
   In 31 minutes, the offense could score only one touchdown
despite being inside the Red Zone six times. This is not only
unacceptable, it is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, in 14 minutes of work, New England's much-praised
defense allowed two touchdowns to be scored on it. That is not only
unacceptable, it is deadly.
</P>
<P>
   So what can we say about the Patriots as they stare at a 0-2
record and a visit from the high-powered Minnesota Vikings Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   What we can say is what Bill Belichick has not said but is
clearly doing. What we can say is that this is not a competitive
year for the Patriots, it's a rebuilding year, and the process is
going to take a while.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Martin averaged 4.3 yards a carry Monday night for
the Jets, and the Patriots' running game averaged 2.9.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Testaverde was sacked only twice by what is
supposed to be an overpowering defense while Drew Bledsoe was
flattened six times by a team that hasn't had a pass rush in years.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the Jets played with five offensive linemen from
start to finish while the Patriots looked like a cavalry charge
every other series as Belichick kept sending in reinforcements for
a line that is shakier than California real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the administration that preceded Belichick in New
England made too many mistakes in too many areas for too long
because it was too arrogant from top to bottom about what it
thought it knew and too unwilling to see that the way it was doing
business _ both in free agency and on draft day _ was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is a long way to go this season, and Belichick
may yet come up with ways to improve the Patriots' fortunes, but
don't believe for a minute there are unemployed football players
out there he can import to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Players who are still unemployed after Labor Day are in that
situation because they aren't good enough to impact a team. That is
simply a fact, unless someone can convince Barry Sanders to put
down the Coppertone and come out of retirement. Barring that
(forget about it), there will be no cavalry charge over the ridge
this fall unless it comes from the players already wearing Patriot
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, there may be another border war with the Jets
someday, but for now that war is over. The fight is not with the
Jets anymore or with any other team in the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   The fight now is internal because the only thing that can save
the Patriots from a disastrous season is themselves. You don't have
to be a defensive genius to see that.
</P>
<P>
   You just have to have a pair of eyes.
</P>

ZEFER FACES A NEW DOT.COM REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zefer Corp. was at the top of the heap in the glitter days of
Internet start-ups, walking away with the top prize in Harvard's
prestigious business plan competition and right into an
unprecedented one-shot, $100 million venture capital commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Those glitter days are just two years in the past but seem like
ancient history. Like everyone else working on the Web, managers at
Zefer have found today's business world a much more challenging
place.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston company's $45 million initial public stock offering
planned this month has been taken off the IPO schedule, at least
for now. Zefer had attempted an even larger $69 million offering in
the spring before pulling the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, stock market conditions appeared to have more to
do with the decision than anything happening at the company. The
market for tech stocks collapsed before Zefer's IPO in the spring
and, more recently, investors have gone cold on an Internet
consulting sector seen as losing business momentum.
</P>
<P>
   None of that has slowed Zefer from its hyper-speed plan for
building up the business, more than tripling the work force to 762
people in just over a year by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues have soared, up to $45 million for the first half of
this year. But Zefer has also spent money like water and produced
gaping deficits along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The hot little start-up has managed to burn through more than
$70 million and owes about $42 million in loans and credit lines.
Nearly half of the money to be raised in Zefer's latest IPO efforts
was earmarked to pay off the company's bank credit line rather than
be spent on new business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Zefer's reported losses, more than $60 million, have
come in the last nine months. Company documents filed in connection
with its IPO plans report financial information through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   This is one expensive buildup for a consulting company. It isn't
sinking millions into hard assets like factories or airplanes or
even printing presses. The money has been spent to construct
marketing, training, research, and administrative functions that
can support a big organization.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of investment may turn out to be a shrewd idea. But it
can also evaporate before your eyes. Any kind of consulting
business depends, almost entirely, on its people, and they have a
habit of moving. What would Zefer own for all of its millions then?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Zefer executives were not able to make their
pitch to us Tuesday. Citing the public comment restrictions imposed
by their still-active stock registration, company officials
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But their strategy never came as a big surprise. When a single
venture capital firm like GTCR Golder Rauner LLC of Chicago drops
$100 million on a young company the message is clear: Use it to
spend your close competitors into the ground and catch up with
others who have a big headstart.
</P>
<P>
   GTCR also gave 20-something Zefer founder Anthony Tjan something
else. It installed technology consulting veteran William Seibel as
chief executive of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel, once a senior executive at Cambridge Technology Partners
Inc., made no secret about his ideas for a very large new company
and how a limited corporate infrastructure contributed to the
buckling of Cambridge's operation as business soared there years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zefer has spent a great deal of its venture investors' money
building the kind of business they had in mind. The question: Will
public investors want a piece of that strategy?
</P>
<P>
   Shares of all Internet consultants and ``integrators'' have been
under pressure in recent weeks because of mounting evidence that
dot-com clients are cutting expenses and more established companies
are slowing their Web plans since they can no longer feel the hot
breath of the wired world on their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who own those stocks want what all Internet investors
want: profits. Now.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer's business was clearly soaring through the first half of
this year. The company's client roster included some big companies
such as Citicorp, Barclays, and Gillette Co. But Zefer also
expected 25 percent to 35 percent of its business this year to come
from a dot-com clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer first emerged as a hot new Internet name in a different
time when buzz, not earnings, was the ultimate asset. Times change
and perhaps Zefer is changing with them.
</P>
<P>
   But to make it public now it will have to show investors
something other than more big losses in its immediate future.

USING JUMBO CDS TO INCREASE SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently sold an underperforming fund in my rollover IRA
and am ready to add some conservative funds, and possibly even a
growth fund to cover inflation. I have been satisfied with the
funds in my taxable accounts, but I don't have any significant tax
deductions and in the past capital gains have pushed me into a
higher tax bracket. I need $2,000 a month from my portfolio. Can I
get this monthly income? Can this be achieved by investing in
fixed-income, and perhaps even tax-exempt funds? Will I be covered
for long-term inflation?
</P>
<P>
   C.H., Cambridge, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's not really anything wrong with your situation, but
you've got to get out of the money-market habit. The current level
of money-market holdings is nearly 70 percent, and while I realize
a good deal of this stems from a recent sale of a fund, I think the
correct percentage for somebody in your situation is zero.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to move the entire rollover IRA account
to five-year jumbo CDs, which are offered at rates as high as 7.71
percent entering this week. I wrote about these accounts at great
length last Sunday, so rather than repeat myself here, I suggest
you refer to that column. My specific suggestion would be to open
two $100,000 accounts, both at 7.71 percent, and a third for
$73,940, on which you can get 7.6 percent. I would then add $10,000
to your position in Vanguard GNMA, which has a current yield of
6.79 percent. The effect of these two moves would be to provide you
with fixed-income holdings sufficient to provide your required
income stream.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave you with $123,976 that could be put to work to
protect you against future inflation. And you will want it to work
a lot harder than money markets are likely to do. Let's suppose you
took that $10,000 that went into Vanguard GNMA from one of your
taxable money-market accounts. That would leave you with $52,094 in
money funds to put to work. My suggestion is one of two funds, both
of which should deliver the kind of solid long-term growth you will
need to deal with inflation, and both of which should help deal
with your tax woes.
</P>
<P>
   One is Vanguard Index 500, which is by definition quite
tax-efficient. The other is Vanguard Tax-Managed Growth and Income
fund, managed specifically to keep taxable distributions to a
minimum level.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave you with the balanced fund, the foreign fund,
and your Bell South common _ all of which I suggest you hang on to
_ and that small CD.
</P>
<P>
   I'm of two minds relative to the CD account. If it were my
money, I would wait until it matures and then move the money into
Vanguard Health Care fund _ after all, it is health care costs that
loom largest in the fears of people your age, and having the health
care industry help you meet your financial goals seems somewhat
fitting. But I am also aware that by suggesting you move either
into Vanguard 500 or Vanguard Tax-Managed Growth and Income fund, I
am quite significantly increasing the risk level of your overall
portfolio, and moving to Vanguard Health Care would increase it
still further.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are uncomfortable with that initial ratchet in the
risk level, you could use Vanguard Balanced Index instead of either
of the more aggressive funds I initially suggested. And if you are
uncomfortable with the second step into higher-risk funds
represented by the suggestion of Vanguard Health Care, you could
move the CD money into a fairly aggressive fixed-income position
such as Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   But I would argue that my initial selections are indeed
appropriate, since the moves into the high-yielding CDs and the
increase in the GNMA position should provide your income, so all of
the remainder can be treated as long-term money. Moreover, you
would need to take the more aggressive stance to maintain a good
chance of keeping pace with inflation. Consider that, if you wanted
to maintain your annual buying power at the $24,000-a-year level,
you will have to draw some funds from the stock investments each
year, adding them to the fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   For example, next year you would require $24,850 to keep even
after a year if inflation runs at 3.5 percent for the next year; to
add that much to your income stream would require moving about
$11,000 from the stock side to the fixed-income side. If you did
come close to a 10 percent portfolio return in that year, you would
be able to do it, but it would be a lot more difficult in future
years. So I suggest you try to take some of the cost of inflation
out of your budget, making only modest _ if any _ additions to the
fixed-income side in the next half-decade and letting the growth
side of your portfolio build during that period.
</P>
<P>
   The bush I am beating around, I confess, is that you don't
really have enough cash for growth investments to protect yourself
comfortably against future inflation. But if you manage your money
_ and especially the costs _ carefully, you should be able to
finance a decent retirement. But at some point in your 70s you will
doubtless find things getting tighter, and it will be hard to keep
the principal value of your savings from declining. But remember,
declining principal isn't all that bad _ after all, it was to spend
it in your retirement that you have been saving all these years,
wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I currently have $10,000 in a low-yielding savings account. I
would like to put it in a mutual fund for at least eight years but
no more than 10 years, with no additions to the account. I'm
considering Vanguard Growth and Income fund. Do you think this
would be a good move?
</P>
<P>
   B.W., Spring Valley, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the conventional wisdom is that if you have an
intermediate investment time frame, which is between five and 10
years, a balanced fund is the ticket. If you stretch the time frame
out to 10 years, then an all-stock fund such as Vanguard Growth and
Income would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   But I think the current state of the market argues in favor of a
balanced investment, hedging your stock holdings with a sizeable
bond position. What I'm referring to is the past half decade of
regular and substantial stock market gains, a pattern that cannot
long continue, as many investors have seen this year. Whether the
markets will react to this with a severe drop, a so-called
correction, or simply a long period of meandering while corporate
earnings and dividends catch up to the current heady stock prices
is anybody's guess. But it is a very solid estimate that the
double-digit gains of past years are probably behind us.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, and because you may want to call upon your
money after eight years rather than 10, I suggest you go with
Vanguard Balanced Index rather than Growth and Income. At current
levels, Vanguard Balanced Index holds 58.8 percent of its assets in
a stock portfolio that represents a blend of growth and value
large-cap stocks. It has a 39.3 percent bond position, and the rest
of the portfolio in cash. Its five-year record shows 15.56 percent
average annual returns _ although your expectations if you go into
this fund should be somewhere in the 8 to 9 percent range. It has
returned 4.38 percent year to date, and yields 2.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Growth and Income, on the other hand, holds 98.9
percent of its assets in a portfolio of value-oriented large-cap
stocks, with the balance in cash. Over five years it has averaged
23.75 percent returns, although long-term expectations should be
closer to the 10 percent area. It has returned 3.81 percent year to
date, and has a puny 0.90 percent yield.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just received a letter from Janus fund announcing that Jim
Craig, manager of the fund for 17 years, is leaving. In addition, I
have read about a bitter dispute between Janus and its parent
company. My wife and I own both Janus and Janus 20 funds. Should we
be concerned enough to consider transferring to other funds? I also
noticed that Fidelity Select Biotechnology fund has had four
managers in four years. Should I be concerned about it?
</P>
<P>
   P.W., Keene, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. These are two pretty different situations. The game of
musical chairs at Fidelity _ and especially among the managers of
its sector funds such as the biotech offering you hold _ has been
going on for years with few discernible evil effects. It's an
approach to managing its business that Fidelity believes in, and it
has gone on long enough that you should not be at all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Janus has said the departure of Craig has nothing to do
with the tension between the Janus team and Stilwell Financial,
which owns 82 percent of Janus, the news is certainly unsettling.
It is true, as Janus points out, that the team that will take
Craig's place includes managers with considerable success in
managing other funds, notably Janus Enterprise, Janus Mercury,
Janus Twenty, and Janus Worldwide. On the other hand, the friction
surrounding the management of Janus _ and especially the discussion
of whether Janus founder Thomas H. Bailey can be or might be fired
_ isn't something that should make Janus a particularly easy place
to work effectively.
</P>
<P>
   My instinct would be to watch your investment very carefully and
be prepared to jump ship (particularly with investments in IRAs and
other tax-deferred accounts in which there would be no short-term
tax consequences) in the event that Janus fund tends to be falling
behind its peers. Of course, if you're a long-term holder of Janus
in a taxable account, the tax consequences of selling should make
you willing to give the new managers a longer leash, but I would
still keep pretty close tabs on how they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to following the funds' results closely, if you have
a computer, I suggest you log onto www.morningstar.com regularly,
call up JANSX, and keep a fairly close tab on news stories relating
to the fund and its management.

   VH1's as-addictive-as-crack ``Behind the Music'' series owes
much of its success to its big, juicy servings of musician
misbehavior. Yeah, it's nice to know the details behind John
Phillips writing the Mamas &AMP; the Papas' hit ``California Dreamin.'
'' But it's way more titillating to hear about wife Michelle's
steamy affair with his bandmate Denny Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   Sleaze is sweet, and since lists are the filler of choice for
idea-exhausted magazine editors, Spin has come up with perhaps its
best list yet _ the frightening and laugh-out-loud funny ``100
Sleaziest Moments in Rock.'' (Just the cover photo of Diamond David
Lee Roth in his raunchy prime is worth the price.) Boiling down
40-plus years of debauchery _ ``the good, the bad, and the hideous;
the amusingly repellent and the simply criminal,'' as Spin's
editors write _ must have been quite the task, and the list ranges
from the antics of Chuck Berry (No. 9) to Suge Knight (No. 7), from
the Bay City Rollers (No. 24) to Cynthia Plastercaster (No. 31),
the Chicago woman who made her name immortalizing the penises of
such rock stars as Jimi Hendrix in plaster.
</P>
<P>
   You get lots of the usual suspects, of course _ Tommy Lee, Keith
Richards, Sid Vicious, and Courtney Love, who comes in at No. 13
just for being the terror fabulous that is Courtney. Diana Ross
slips in at No. 96 for trying to foist those bargain-basement
Supremes on us earlier this year, and Metallica (No. 30) gets
scolded for busting 300,000 of their Napster-loving fans.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there's a lot to quibble about _ what else are lists
really for anyway? Sure, Woodstock '99 was a violent, stupid mess,
but it just doesn't deserve a No. 4 slot over Jerry Lee Lewis's
cradle-robbing marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, which mustered
only a No. 38 slot. Much of the best stuff simply can't be
discussed in polite company, including the No. 1 choice _ no
argument here _ which involves Led Zeppelin, a groupie, and a mud
shark. 'Nuff said 'bout that.

   Maxim is a magazine for men; it says so right on the cover in
big bold white letters _ ``FOR MEN.'' So why does this men's
magazine have a postpubescent cover girl? That's barely-18-year-old
Kirsten Dunst wearing nothing but an unbuttoned denim jacket and a
pair of white hot pants _ any skimpier, and they'd be a
thong-thong-thong-thong-thong _ next to the headline ``Thirstin'
for Kirsten!'' on the September issue. Let's not even get into the
question of whether adult males should be thirsting for a girl who
isn't even old enough to buy a beer. Yes, Dunst is street legal,
but who needs to see her all tarted up in a series of revealing,
tourniquet-tight outfits, except for the Humbert Humberts of
Maxim's readership?
</P>
<P>
   In this strange new age of men's magazines, Maxim isn't the only
offender _ remember 17-year-old Jessica Biel's soft-porn spread in
Gear last year? Of course, you can blame the magazines only so
much. What dirty-minded editor is going to decline the opportunity
to feature a nubile starlet in his magazine? Getting near-naked in
men's magazines is the latest way for young female stars to shed
their goody-goody images, and they seem to be lining up for the
chance to wear little more than a come-hither stare.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst cracks nary a smile in her seven-page spread, and makes
clear in an interview (yes, there are actual words, too) with
Michael Atkinson that she wants to bust out of her sweetheart
roles, even though she turned down the Mena Suvari role in
``American Beauty.'' ``I didn't want to be kissing Kevin Spacey,''
she says. ``Come on! Lying there naked, covered with rose petals?''
Hey, Kirsten, what about sitting there almost-naked in a black
bikini in Maxim? Come on!

   With a red bikini, lovingly accessorized with a big snake,
Elizabeth Hurley is pretty raw herself on the cover of Total Movie
_ but hey, she's a full-grown women. Total Movie enters an already
crowded field of film rags, but as editor in chief Gary Whitta
asserts, it's written by ``100% pure,
cut-me-do-I-not-bleed-celluloid film fanatics.'' And it also comes
with a great gimmick: Each issue will include a DVD chock-full of
movie trailers, short films, and extra features. This month's
edition includes previews for ``Pearl Harbor,'' ``Blair Witch 2:
Book of Shadows,'' and the re-release of ``The Exorcist.'' But
there are also lots of trailers for films that have already come
and gone, such as ``Titan A. E.'' Nobody wanted to see that film
when it was in theaters, so why would anyone want to see the
trailer now? There's also behind-the-scenes footage from ``Romeo
Must Die,'' and ``The Legend of Bagger Vance.'' But other than the
DVD, Total Movie is a standard stroke for Hollywood, as if they're
aren't enough shows and magazines already doing that. But hey,
here's a new gimmick for the next issue _ how's about a DVD player
so your readers can actually watch that free DVD?

   RUSSIA-NIKITIN _ MOSCOW _ Russia's Supreme Court laid to rest
the espionage case against anti-nuclear activist Alexander Nikitin,
rejecting Wednesday a bid by prosecutors to overturn his acquittal.
Nikitin, a retired submarine captain, has fought the treason
charges for almost five years, after he published a report
detailing unsafe conditions of Russia's nuclear fleet. Hailing the
verdict as ``just,'' Nikitin said the code of secrecy surrounding
the military still exists and still poses a danger to Russians and
the world. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   ELIAN-CARDENAS _ CARDENAS, Cuba _ There are no lawyers running
to the microphones, no angry protestors holding vigil, no banners
or posters or hordes of camera-wielding journalists. By all
accounts, Elian Gonzalez and his family like it that way. Just two
months ago, the young shipwreck survivor was perhaps the most
famous six-year-old in the world. Caught in the center of a bitter
custody fight between his Miami relatives and his Cuban family,
Elian became a symbol of the decades-old conflict between communist
Cuba and its capitalist neighbor to the north. Now he is just
another student at Marcelo Salado primary school, one of hundreds
dressed in identical red, white and blue school uniforms, running
and shouting in the school's spacious courtyard between classes.

for president but Walesa, who is again a candidate, is trailing

many people are, well, crazy enough to climb in there with them,

   HOUSEWORK-POLL _ Guys, you're busted. Throughout the South,
husbands are claiming to do more housework than wives claim their
husbands are doing. Men took more credit for cooking, laundry and
housework in general than women allowed, a new AJC poll of married
adults found. In the housework category, for instance, 40 percent
of men said they either do it themselves or are an equal partner in
the housework. Meanwhile, just 23 percent of women said men do it
all or equally. Paula Jhung, author of ``How to Avoid Housework,''
isn't surprised. ``I think housework is like sex in that people lie
about it a lot,'' she says. ``Everybody claims they're doing more''
than they are. (Miller, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH

stuck in rush hour and you haven't the foggiest idea, you've no
doubt got lots of company. But if you think your only alternative

Challenge, we show you how to get a delicious made-from-scratch
dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes, with a recipe that
uses no more than 5 ingredients that requires only the simplest of
sides. With these streamlined recipes, you also spend less time in
the supermarket and washing dishes afterward. What more could you
ask for on nights you long for the comfort of a home-cooked meal
but can't bear anything mentally or physically taxing in the

   FBN-FALCONS-O-LINE _ FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. _ While most of the

left guard, was so ineffective in Sunday's loss to Denver that he
was eventually replaced by Chris Banks, who has been with the team
only two weeks. Ephraim Salaam and rookie Travis Claridge have
split time at right tackle, neither player stepping up to solidify
their hold on the position. All of the inconsistency has limited
the effectiveness of running back Jamal Anderson and could possibly
jeopardize the health of quarterback Chris Chandler. (Winkeljohn,

centralized zone of activity downtown, Sydney's game plan involves
separating most of the athletic events. That essential difference,
designed to take advantage of the natural ebb and flow of this
harbor town, is paramount as Sydney takes center stage Friday,
hoping to avoid some of Atlanta's embarrassing mistakes. There are
similarities, as well, including transportation problems that need
to get fixed for these spread-out Games to work right.

to be in Australia, it's Walker, a lanky Austin resident of Austin,
Texas and University of Texas swimmer. Four years ago he gained a
small measure of fame by missing the Olympics by the smallest of
margins, one-hundredth of a second as he was touched out for sixth
place in the 100 meter freestyle at the U.S. swim trials. In that
event, six swimmers can go to the Olympics for the 4X100 meter
freestyle relay team. This time around Walker could be anchoring
that race Saturday as well as later having a shot at medals in
another relay and two individual events. And that's after having a
couple of off swims and maybe one bad choice at the U.S. trials.

 &HT;    Buying a smart-looking leather jacket at a good price is simple
if you know what to look for
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leather report this fall calls for hot-looking jackets in
cool silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   And while the leather jacket might change shape, it never loses
its edge _ or its sleek yet practical image. Wear it with wool
trousers for day or over a chiffon dress at night.
</P>
<P>
   Stores are filled with all types of jackets, from blazers to
trench styles to cropped, zip-front numbers. Although black is the
perennial No. 1 color choice, you can also sizzle in red, wine,
camel, ivory and brown.
</P>
<P>
   A good leather jacket is an investment, and a classically styled
piece can wear well and remain chic for decades. Often, what to
look for when buying leather can be confusing, but we tell you how
to shop smart for that second-skin look.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following criteria:
</P>
<P>
   The skin game
</P>
<P>
   Leather jackets are made from the hides of cows, lambs and pigs.
They differ in texture, feel and price. In general, pig is the
least expensive, lamb the most expensive. However, certain grades
of cow leather can also be quite expensive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in cow leather, you will find cowhide, which comes
from the skin of full-grown cows and is thicker, heavier and quite
durable. Sometimes the skin is split to obtain a desired thickness.
Many manufacturers use only top-grain cowhide for quality jackets.
Calf hide is leather made from the skins of young cattle. It is
lightweight and fine grain. Go by feel when buying a jacket. Soft,
smooth and supple are good guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The finished look
</P>
<P>
   To create different textures, leather is tanned or treated. Some
of the more popular finishes, according to the leather buyers at
Federated Department Stores, are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aniline dyeing: An indigo or synthetic dye is used to dress
the skins in a large drum. These items are usually more expensive
because the most desirable and highest grades of leather are used.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Distressed: It's the process of making leather look old or
worn through buffing. Can also be achieved through spraying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coating: A substance such as oil, lacquer or synthetic covers
the fabric on one or both sides.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Embossing: Skins such as ostrich and crocodile are printed on
the grain side by a heated metal plate in a press.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nap or napping: Obtained by brushing the skin to achieve a
soft, smooth touch.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Suede: The flesh side of the skin is shaved and buffed,
creating a soft feel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tanning: This is the process used by the tanner to convert
rawhide into a usable piece of leather.
</P>
<P>
   The inside scoop
</P>
<P>
   When buying a jacket, look at the lining. You will find silk or
lightweight synthetics, such as acetate and satins. These are soft
but won't keep you warm. Some jackets are lined with Thinsulate or
Thermolite, which is sporty, warm and durable. Also, examine the
jacket seams. Look for minimal lines and smooth stitching. Metal
zippers or buttonholes should be finished cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   The price factor
</P>
<P>
   Why does one jacket cost $200 while another costs $500? ``The
leather is two-thirds the price of a jacket,'' says Mark Schwartz,
director of leather buying for Wilson's Suede and Leather stores.
``And one manufacturer or designer may select a better-grade raw
material for its jacket than another designer does. This raises the
price. For example, the best leathers come from the sides of an
animal, where the grain is most consistent.'' Also, a
time-consuming finishing process can up the ante on a jacket. And,
if your jacket boasts a designer label, that, too, can increase the
cost, in terms of advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   CARING FOR YOUR LEATHER JACKET
</P>
<P>
   It's your hide now, so care for it properly. The Leather Apparel
Association lists the following suggestions. Log on to
www.leatherassociation.com for more tips.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leather jackets should be hung on wide or padded hangers to
maintain their shape. And they should be stored in a dark closet
that is neither too dry nor humid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do not use waxes, silicone products or other leather
preparations that impair a garment's ability to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid spraying on perfume or hair spray while wearing your
jacket. They can discolor or damage leather. And wear a scarf at
the neck to keep body oils away from the collar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It is perfectly safe to iron leather. Set the controls to
rayon setting and use heavy brown wrapping paper as a pressing
cloth on the right side of the item and iron. Wrinkles should come
right out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you get caught wearing your leather jacket in the rain, let
it dry at room temperature away from heat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spill ketchup, wine or salad dressing on your jacket? Take it
to a professional cleaner as soon as possible and tell them exactly
what the stain is. Don't try to clean it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To find a leather cleaner, Richard Mays of Ram Leather Care in
Conyers (770-483-3454) suggests you contact your local dry cleaner
and ask if it provides the service of cleaning leathers. If so, get
a quote on the charge and how long it will take to clean your
jacket. Many cleaners do not clean leathers on site.

 &HT;    Hear the heavenly call of lovely angel's trumpet
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about angel's trumpet. More times than I can
remember I have grown at this plant. I did not say I have grown
this plant; I said I have grown at it.
</P>
<P>
   While I've been able to keep one of these shrubs alive from time
to time, my success at getting one to bloom is quite another story.
A short one: Several autumns ago a plant I'd grown for several
years finally put out white, fragrant blossoms. Just as I was
getting used to the loveliness, frost killed it back. The plant
returned once, then no more. Since then, none has bloomed for me,
despite full sun, good drainage, watering and feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I can figure is I just don't hold my mouth right.
But, sometimes, there's just no accounting for why a plant won't
work for you.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes clouded with visions of growing failures, I always look
with admiration at angel's trumpets that bloom with elegant abandon
in other gardens. My latest look was in Midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jones, better known as JJ, was inside when I arrived at his
home and got arrested by the lush landscaping. First, the
sunflowers, with their big bright faces, made me smile from across
the street. On the porch were many houseplants, including ficus,
lipstick plant, African violet, fern, palm, pencil cactus (I would
go home with a cutting from the huge parent plant), dumb cane,
peace lily. And coleus galore.
</P>
<P>
   More coleus grew in the narrow strip of land on the driveway
side of the house, where, surrounded by more sunflowers, the
angel's trumpet stood some 6 feet. With more than a dozen pale
yellow blossoms dangling in the morning sun, the shrub lit up the
space like a Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   JJ, whose twin passions are horticulture and doll-making, has
had more success with his angel's trumpet in a few months than I
have in 10 years. The plant, which typically blooms, rests, blooms,
way into autumn, enchants. Says JJ as he shows off the trumpet on
this muggy morning: ``These blooms are like angels dancing. To have
something this delicate, this ethereal ... I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by his yellow-blooming trumpet, JJ is eager to get
growth from several cuttings given him by friend Jayme Proctor of
Pittsboro, N.C. Through these gifts and through purchases, JJ plans
to enjoy other plants, other colors _ white, pink, peach, orange.
Why not? He's got the touch.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I went home and took a look at my latest angel's
trumpet. It came from a friend who takes 6-inch cuttings from
mature wood, puts them in water and stands back; they root quickly.
I put my cutting in the ground in the spring of 1999. I didn't
expect it to produce flowers last year, and I was not wrong. As
expected, the tender native of Peru got knocked to the ground in
the winter but returned last spring. Its height reached a foot and
has been stuck there all summer. And, yes, I have no flowers, see
no signs of any.
</P>
<P>
   My next act is to dig up the little angel's trumpet and put it
in a container. (That tack worked marvelously with my tea olive,
which blooms better and longer indoors than it ever did outside.)
One of the more attractive trumpets I'd seen lately was in a
container, growing happily in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   That was before I visited JJ's place. If the container move
doesn't work for me, I can always go back for another look.

   Q: There's a new bug spray for home use called Bioganic. It's
used to eliminate ants, roaches, etc. I am interested since no
chemicals are in this product.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maurice Horowitz, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Bugs won't drive you buggy anymore with Bioganic, from
EcoSmart. The line of products offers action against a broad range
of critters including ants, wasps, hornets, fleas, flies and dust
mites. A 14-ounce can of the Flying Insect Killer or the Wasp and
Hornet Killer is $3.79 at Publix. We found our cans at the Ansley
Mall store, 1544 Piedmont Ave. N.E. (404-898-1850). Home Depot
stores also carry the products, including Bioganic Crawling Insect
Killer (14-ounce can, $4.46) and the Bioganic Dust Insecticide (a
12-ounce can, $4.96). We found ours at 815 Sidney Marcus Blvd. N.E.
(404-231-1411).
</P>
<P>
   Bioganic's active ingredients are made from plant and tree oils
that are widely used to add flavor and aroma to candy, frosting,
baked goods, frozen dairy products and lipstick. The formula also
contains Eugenol, a steam distilled extract from cloves. You can
also order these products online at: www.bioganic.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find Pickapeppa Hot Red Pepper Sauce? When I was
in Jamaica, I fell in love with it. I can find their brown sauce
but not the hot red sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Swigart,
</P>
<P>
   Covington
</P>
<P>
   A: Peter Piper might have picked a peck of peppers but we found
your Pickapeppa Hot Red Pepper Sauce. You can order it from the
importer, Warbac Sales of Metairie, La. (504-834-1395). Twenty-four
3-ounce bottles are about $45. Or order online at:
www.pickapeppa.com. You can buy just one bottle for $3.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1921, this hot red sauce has been exported from Jamaica.
Key ingredients include hot peppers, sugar cane vinegar, salt and
spices. When asked how hot this sauce is, importer Warren H.A.
Backer simply said ``very hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: My boss is looking for a meat seasoning called Pinchitos,
which he says gives meat a wonderful flavor. He first bought it
when stationed in Spain during the '70s. For some time, he's been
trying to find it in the Atlanta area, but without success. Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Babs Hansard, Snellville
</P>
<P>
   A: Your boss should give you a raise! We asked a friend, Pilar
Amir, when she was visiting in Seville, Spain, if she could find
the seasoning and bring it back to us. Pinchitos is quite popular
in Spain and used as a marinade when mixed with oil or wine for
meat shish kebabs. It costs about 63 cents for a small pouch
encased in a yellow box adorned with a Moor's face. Ingredients
include oregano, cumin, caraway, turmeric, cilantro, anise, cayenne
pepper, clove, nutmeg and garlic. Unfortunately, the company does
not export to the United States. If a trip to Spain is not in your
plans, fax an order to the Productos Ruca Company at 0 11 34
958-402875. Or, you can contact major department stores in Spain _
such as El Corte Ingles _ which also stock the product.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Penaten Cream. It's a baby cream made in
Germany. Not only is it good for babies but the cream is also great
on the skin of allergy-prone adults. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gayle Breneman,
</P>
<P>
   Avondale Estates, Ga
</P>
<P>
   A: It's time to baby that skin again. We spotted your cream at
King's Drugs, 2345 Peachtree Road N.E. (404-233-2101). A 2-ounce
blue tin is $8.89. According to the manufacturer, the cream ``is
intended for delicate skins and is recommended to prevent and
relieve skirn irritation due to diaper-rash, chafing, prickly heat
and sunburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for old-fashioned shelf paper, in white or
cream, on a roll, about 12-15 inches wide. And I want it
non-adhesive. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jayne Buckwalter,
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Extend your shelf life with Royal Lace's Big Bargain Paper.
This lining paper (13 inches by 48 feet or 18 feet by 35 feet) is
$2.29 a roll at Richard's Variety Store, 2347 Peachtree Road N.E.
(404-237-1412). In addition to lining shelves and drawers, the
paper can also be used as disposable table covers or for scribbling
and drawing paper by your kids.

&HT;     MAGAZINE RANKS TEXAS SCHOOL AMONG BEST IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALISON GREGOR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ An elementary school lauded for its chess
program was recognized as one of the five best schools in the
country by Hispanic Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Morningside Elementary School, whose chess teams ranked among
the top 10 nationwide, received the honor for its outstanding and
unique programs, said a letter from Hispanic Magazine publisher Sam
Verdeja.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Harris, Morningside's principal, said the magazine
considered demographics, test scores and academic and
extracurricular programs. He gave a lot of the credit to the
school's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of the teachers,'' Harris said. ``They
believe that every child can learn and will learn, and they don't
let any obstacles get in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle could have been poverty. Ninety-four percent of
Morningside's 930 students are from low-income families that
qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches. Much of the
almost all-Hispanic student body is in bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't seem to have been a problem for the school,
which trounced public and private schools alike in state and
national chess competitions. State test scores have ranked the
school among the best, if not the best, in Texas in reading and
math, according to statistical analysis done by Just for the Kids,
an Austin group that studies Texas public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids do well,'' Harris said. ``They came in first in the
science fair.
</P>
<P>
   The principal said Morningside hopes to place first in academic
competition conducted by the University Interscholastic League, the
governing body for extracurricular activities for the state's
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Hispanic Magazine became interested in Morningside
when Secretary of Education Richard Riley mentioned the school's
chess achievements in a recent speech. The speech focused on the
importance of education for the nation's Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought _ in a state where high school football
is sometimes king and English is for many a second language _ that
these students would go head to head with the best minds in the
country in one of the most challenging and intellectual games?''
Riley said. ``They did and so did their teachers, parents and
principals _ and that made all the difference.''

WORLD CORRUPTION INDEX SHOWS THAT AN IMAGE IS NOT ALTERED IN A
DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When a country gets a reputation for being
deeply corrupt, it takes a lot of time _ and more than just the
election of an anti-corruption government _ to make a dent in its
negative image, a corruption watchdog group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Transparency International, used the case of Nigeria
to make that point in its 2000 Corruption Perception Index.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, whose president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is a former
advisory council chairman of Transparency International, is still
at the bottom of the index more than a year after the change of
government that restored democracy following a period of corrupt
military rule.
</P>
<P>
   The low ranking is in part related to a change in this year's
index, a measure of perceptions about corruption drawn from surveys
by international economic organizations and risk analysts. For the
first time, Transparency International, an independent organization
founded in 1995 by former World Bank officials to expose corruption
among public officials worldwide, used data from a three-year
period, not a single year. Change takes time to register, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valiant efforts are being made by President Olusegun Obasanjo
to force full-scale changes in a country whose people have been
robbed by the grand corruption of their past leaders,'' said Peter
Eigen, chairman of Transparency International, which has chapters
in more than 70 countries. ``But the process of change initiated by
the new president is barely 12 months old, and so it is not
surprising that Nigeria's CPI score is virtually unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   In the perceptions of business people, Transparency
International found this year that officials in Yugoslavia,
Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Indonesia and Angola are also at the bottom of
the list, which ranks countries on a score of 10, for the least
corrupt, to zero, for the most corrupt. They all have scores below
2.
</P>
<P>
   A number of countries seeking more trade and investment from the
United States and Europe _ among them China, Vietnam, India and
Mexico _ also rank low, all below 3.5.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 countries ranked least corrupt are Finland, Denmark, New
Zealand, Sweden, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Singapore, the
Netherlands and Britain. The United States is in 14th place, with
7.8 points on the 10-point scale. It ranks at about the same level
as Austria, Hong Kong, Germany and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The Corruption Perceptions Index is available online at
http://www.transparency.org/documents/cpi/2000/cpi2000.html.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency International in based in Berlin, with offices in
London and Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ninety countries were included in this year's report, down from
98 last year. Some countries were eliminated because not enough
information was available for the expanded three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dropping out of the CPI for lack of data is bad news for
countries and may indicate reduced investor interest,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency International, criticized in earlier years for
focusing on bribe-taking officials rather than bribe-paying
businesses, also began publishing a bribe payers' index last year.
Another survey of bribe payers will be published next year.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR WHISTLE-BLOWER ACQUITTED ON TREASON CHARGES
 &HT;    540&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's Supreme Court on Wednesday ended a nearly
five-year effort by government prosecutors to punish a retired
Russian naval captain for exposing the perils of Russia's decaying
nuclear fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which upheld a lower court decision acquitting
Alexander Nikitin on spy and treason charges, was praised by human
rights groups and military observers alike as a step toward
cracking the military's code of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Military secrecy, Nikitin's supporters say, led to the deaths of
118 sailors last month when the submarine Kursk sank.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Nikitin stemmed from a report he published
in 1996 with the Norwegian environmental group Bellona that
documented alleged nuclear abuses by the Navy and the unsafe
conditions of the fleet's nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am very happy,'' said the 46-year-old with a military
flattop after Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is a triumph of law and justice. At the time
(the report was published), we said that if society is informed of
such facts, this forces the authorities to fix problems. The basis
of our case was that talking about so-called secrets is not a sign
of a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict marks the first time a Russian has been found not
guilty on treason charges, according to Nikitin's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin, himself a former submarine captain, has won several
international awards for his work in uncovering radiation dangers
here. He told reporters he would continue his environmental studies
in his own country and try to strengthen the support for such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has to learn that the truth is the only way to
make sure there are no more accidents ... and that contaminating
our environment means contaminating people, too,'' Nikitin said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 report described 52 abandoned nuclear submarines in a
remote shipyard near Russia's border with Norway. Its release
brought scorn from Russia's tight-lipped military brass and
intelligence agencies, and Nikitin was arrested in February of that
year by the Federal Security Service (FSB), domestic successor to
the Soviet KGB. He was jailed for two years and tried 13 separate
times.
</P>
<P>
   His acquittal by a St. Petersburg court in December 1999 was
upheld five months later by Russia's Supreme Court, which slammed
the FSB and the prosecutor's office for imprisoning Nikitin under
``secret'' regulations and trying him for violations of unpublished
and retroactively applied laws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, prosecutors didn't give up the case. They appealed the
decision to the Presidium of the Supreme Court, the nation's
highest court, which could have reopened the prosecution on
identical charges _ a process barred by the U.S. Constitution as
double jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief to the Presidium, prosecutors recommended
overturning Nikitin's acquittal on the grounds that the FSB had
violated the former submariner's human rights. In Russian legal
practice, a higher court can restart a prosecution if they are
convinced the original investigation was conducted incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That such a brief could be published shows that our legal
system is a farce. To say 'The police beat me and jailed me even
though I was innocent' as a reason to retry someone's guilt is
stranger than fiction,'' said Fredrick Hague, the director of
Bellona.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Presidium's ruling closes the case for good, but
environmentalists in Russia still expect many fights ahead of them,
thanks to the slow pace of reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a rational system in Russia, Nikitin would be made a
government consultant on how to prevent accidents like the Kursk.
But, unfortunately, our system still says that anyone without the
authority to speak must keep their mouths shut,'' said Alexei
Smirnov, the director of Moscow's Glasnost Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Several similar cases have tarnished Russia's already deplorable
record on environmental safety and military reform.
</P>
<P>
   Another former naval officer, Grigory Pasko, was imprisoned for
20 months on treason charges after providing videotaped evidence of
illegal nuclear dumping by Russia's Pacific Fleet to Japanese
journalists. He won an appeal on treason charges earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory of Vladimir Sofyer, a Russian nuclear scientist,
was raided by the FSB in 1999 because the lab was carrying out an
unsanctioned study of the environmental effects of a 1985 Soviet
atomic-submarine accident in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Russian Ministry of Justice announced
that all nongovernmental organizations must register with the
government or face dissolution. Several human rights,
environmental, and antimilitarist groups were denied documentation,
essentially making them illegal groups.

</P>
<P>
   ``I feel such a thrill, my feet won't keep still, when they
swing that music for me.'' _ ``Swing That Music,'' Louis Armstrong,
1936; Decca Records
</P>
<P>
   Hearing ``Swing That Music'' on my tabletop radio may have been
my first exposure to the world of swing _ but more important, it
was my introduction to the talents of Louis Armstrong and to the
world of black jazz.
</P>
<P>
   It never would have occurred to fans in those years prior to
World War II that there would one day be internationally observed
centennial birth-year celebrations and commemorative stamps devoted
to Armstrong. (Armstrong died in 1971.)
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night at the Monterey Jazz Festival, trumpeters
Nicholas Payton, Roy Hargrove, Tom Harrell and their bands will pay
tribute; the Jazz at Lincoln Center organization began its
year-long ``100 Years of Armstrong'' series with a concert by
Wynton Marsalis' JLC band in Liberty State Park on the Fourth of
July (despite evidence that Armstrong was not born on July 4, 1900,
as he claimed, but, rather, on Aug. 3, 1901); and Ken Burns'
lengthy ``Jazz'' documentary series, scheduled to air on PBS in
January, is devoting a full segment to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Like most jazz performers of the 1920s, Armstrong _ the all-time
greatest jazz soloist _ was resurfacing on the American music scene
in the mid-1930s after lengthy European touring, various personal
problems and Depression-era doldrums. A recording contract from
Jack Kapp's new Decca label sparked the Armstrong revival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, he appeared with Bing Crosby (his pal from earlier
years) in ``Pennies From Heaven,'' a popular Hollywood film, and
was a frequent guest on Crosby's radio show. This sort of thing was
controversial in the 1930s, but Crosby had clout and often had
black jazz and swing stars on his show.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby has been quoted in the JLC Armstrong guidebook as saying,
``Satch is the beginning and end of American music.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of recordings he had made 1923-31, Armstrong was,
in the 1930s, already considered by musicians the most inventive
and extraordinary of jazz soloists. Many observers and fans,
however, believed his best years were behind him _ that his
increasing role as a singing, clowning showman had diluted his jazz
career.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics were wrong. There was a new generation of jazz
(or swing) fans that were idolizing trumpeters like Bunny Berigan,
Harry James, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie and a dozen more _ and
all of them said, ``listen to Armstrong _ he's the one.'' Trumpeter
Jack Purvis even issued a record titled ``Copyin' Louis,'' and
Gillespie's familiar quote (often mentioned), ``To speak his name
is to conjure up our whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miles Davis was riding high in the 1960s, he commented to
Dan Morgenstern of the Rutgers Institute for Jazz Studies, ``You
can't play anything on the horn that Louis hasn't played.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1939-40, RCA Victor, Columbia and Decca Records were all
instituting reissue programs, generating interest in the jazz
background of swing music for younger buyers, as well as alerting
budding trumpet stars to the Armstrong genius.
</P>
<P>
   And he was a genius. No one had played as brilliantly nor
improvised as wondrously as Armstrong _ at least on recordings, or
in listeners' memories. From the beginning, Armstrong injected
blues harmonies, rhythmic swing and unbelievably complex melodic
improvisations into every solo.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, under the guidance of George Avakian, started its Hot
Jazz Classics series with a four-disc (78 rpm) album set drawn from
Armstrong's earliest sessions _ the Hot Five and Hot Seven
recordings from 1925 to 1927. The public response was astonishing.
We had never heard trumpet playing like this; the swing trumpeters
were right _ Louis was ``the one.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's career began when he headed north from New Orleans
in 1923 to join King Oliver's band, with whom he stayed until
spring 1924. The Creole Jazz Band recorded a couple of dozen sides,
acoustically (into a horn) for four labels. He then went to New
York, taking the solo cornet chair with Fletcher Henderson's
Roseland Ballroom orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his new wife, pianist Lil Hardin, he learned to
read music. His solos with Henderson are generally magnificent.
``We laughed at the way Louis looked when he arrived in New York,''
said drummer Kaiser Marshall. But after we heard one solo we all
shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years starting in November 1925, Armstrong played in
bands large and small in Chicago and recorded extensively with his
Hot Five and Hot Seven groups, as well as with many blues singers,
from Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey to Sippie Wallace, Chippie Hill and
others.
</P>
<P>
   This was Armstrong's grandest era, during which he shifted from
cornet to trumpet and changed his recording group's complement
(added a sax or two, brought in younger, brighter guys like Earl
Hines). Following the Hines-Armstrong groups, Armstrong began
fronting big bands (one for each coast) and became a full-fledged
band leader.
</P>
<P>
   The body of work he recorded between 1925 and 1931 constitutes
the finest era in Armstrong's life; almost all of his recordings
from that era are now reissued in a four-CD set, titled ``Louis
Armstrong: The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings'' on the
Columbia/Legacy label.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's trumpet is so inspired and played with such power,
that others in the Hot Five and Hot Seven (Kid Ory, Johnny Dodds)
have trouble keeping up. On ``Droppin' Shucks'' and ``Who'sit,''
Armstrong is off on a trumpet tear seldom heard on records;
incredible stuff. He played a slide-whistle solo on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Included among the set's 89 tracks are ``Big Butter and Egg
Man,'' a great Armstrong vocal; ``Skid-Dat-De Dat,'' a marvelous
blues; ``Potato Head Blues,'' ``West End Blues'' (the pair
considered Armstrong's all-time greatest), ``New Orleans Stomp''
from a rare session, ``Beau Koo Jack'' _ unbelievable duet choruses
by Armstrong and Hines, trumpet and piano _ and ``Basin Street
Blues,'' ``Weather Bird'' (Hines and Armstrong duet) and ``Knockin'
A Jug,'' a famous session with Armstrong and trombonist Jack
Teagarden; the two joined again, after World War II, in the
Armstrong All-Star band.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong gigged around the East Coast (especially New York) in
1929-30, usually fronting a big band. There were microphones, now,
and he was singing more frequently in public performances. For
nearly a year he headlined with Les Hite's Los Angeles band at
Sebastian's Cotton Club in Los Angeles, and was recorded,
beautifully, playing and singing, ``I'm Confessin','' ``Shine,''
``If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight,'' ``Sweethearts on
Parade'' and other classics.
</P>
<P>
   Vibist Lionel Hampton, 91 and still at it, ends each band set
with the now familiar ``What a Wonderful World,'' which Armstrong
recorded in 1970, a year before his death. In a workshop session at
the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in Moscow, Idaho, a young music
student commented, ``You sing `Wonderful World' just the way Louis
Armstrong did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton chuckled and answered, ``Well, that's a compliment. Of
course I sound like Louis _ I heard him sing night after night when
I played drums (and learned how to play the vibes) with his band in
Los Angeles a number of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy years ago every trumpeter and every singer tried to
sound like Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only one who mattered; still is, really.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a near-fatal crash in Congress, a $2.5
billion federal program to develop fuel-efficient vehicles is
getting back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the House of Representatives who voted to kill
the program in June have apparently been convinced that the
Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles is not a form of aid
to automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the national interest,'' said U.S. Rep. Fred Upton,
R-Mich., one of a host of Michigan lawmakers fighting to maintain
funding for the partnership in the waning weeks of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists who scorn the effort to build
80-miles-per-gallon cars concede that the auto industry and the
Clinton administration have won over enough House members to
reverse a 214-211 vote to end the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fix is in,'' said Dan Becker, director of the
Sierra Club's global warming and energy project. The House is now
likely to go along with a Senate bill providing $140 million for
the partnership next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker and other environmentalists argue that U.S. automakers
should be developing fuel-efficient vehicles without government
help.
</P>
<P>
   Two Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, already have cars on
the U.S. market that get between 60 and 70 mpg, while American
makers promote pickups and sport-utility vehicles that average less
than 20 mpg, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's time to pull the plug because it's really a
scam,'' he said of the partnership. ``The auto industry has spent a
billion and a half dollars of taxpayer money and come up with three
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker was referring to three ``concept cars'' developed through
the partnership that were unveiled in March by General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   The GM Precept, the Ford Prodigy and the Dodge ESX3 each get
about 80 mpg from their highly efficient diesel-fueled engines, but
the cars are still too expensive for the mass market.
DaimlerChrysler estimates the Dodge ESX3 would cost about $7,500
more than the comparably sized Dodge Intrepid, and questions
whether people would pay that much just for better gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, launched by President Clinton and the three U.S.
automakers in 1993, is to have a prototype for an affordable 80-mpg
family car by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot more work to be done,'' said Lee Sechler,
spokesman for the U.S. Council for Automotive Research, which
manages the industry's side of the partnership for GM, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept vehicles demonstrate there's technology out there
to come up with this car, but the next step is to put it into mass
production,'' Sechler said. ``That requires both government and
industry working together.''
</P>
<P>
   When the House voted to end funding for the program in June,
many members thought the automakers had simply received $1.25
billion in federal grants to produce the concept cars, said Cary
Gravatt, the government's partnership director.
</P>
<P>
   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler actually spent about $1.25 billion
of their own money developing the cars, while the federal funds
went for research by government labs, universities and hundreds of
automotive suppliers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the congressmen said they didn't realize that,''
Gravatt said. ``Many of them said, `We thought it all went to the
Big Three.'''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders must now work out a compromise between the
House bill, which cuts money for the partnership, and the Senate
bill, which provides $140 million for the fiscal year starting Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is at the end of the day, the funding will be
restored,'' said Upton. ``There's strong support for it. With the
spike in gas prices we had this summer, we ought to do something to
help the industry develop fuel-efficient cars.''

should be developing fuel-efficient vehicles without government
help.
</P>
<P>
   Two Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, already have cars on
the U.S. market that get between 60 and 70 mpg, while American
makers promote pickups and sport-utility vehicles that average less
than 20 mpg, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's time to pull the plug because it's really a
scam,'' he said of the partnership. ``The auto industry has spent a
billion and a half dollars of taxpayer money and come up with three
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker was referring to three ``concept cars'' developed through
the partnership that were unveiled in March by General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   The GM Precept, the Ford Prodigy and the Dodge ESX3 each get
about 80 mpg from their highly efficient diesel-fueled engines, but
the cars are still too expensive for the mass market.
DaimlerChrysler estimates the Dodge ESX3 would cost about $7,500
more than the comparably sized Dodge Intrepid, and questions
whether people would pay that much just for better gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, launched by President Clinton and the three U.S.
automakers in 1993, is to have a prototype for an affordable 80-mpg
family car by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot more work to be done,'' said Lee Sechler,
spokesman for the U.S. Council for Automotive Research, which
manages the industry's side of the partnership for GM, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept vehicles demonstrate there's technology out there
to come up with this car, but the next step is to put it into mass
production,'' Sechler said. ``That requires both government and
industry working together.''
</P>
<P>
   When the House voted to end funding for the program in June,
many members thought the automakers had simply received $1.25
billion in federal grants to produce the concept cars, said Cary
Gravatt, the government's partnership director.
</P>
<P>
   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler actually spent about $1.25 billion
of their own money developing the cars, while the federal funds
went for research by government labs, universities and hundreds of
automotive suppliers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the congressmen said they didn't realize that,''
Gravatt said. ``Many of them said, `We thought it all went to the
Big Three.'''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders must now work out a compromise between the
House bill, which cuts money for the partnership, and the Senate
bill, which provides $140 million for the fiscal year starting Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is at the end of the day, the funding will be
restored,'' said Upton. ``There's strong support for it. With the
spike in gas prices we had this summer, we ought to do something to
help the industry develop fuel-efficient cars.''

   POWER-DEREG (Undated) _ After a 1997 power shortage, Wisconsin
Electric began to support a go-slow approach to deregulation,
building in an extra margin of reliable power before encouraging
the state to remove its decades-old grip on the electricity
industry. Lately, the rest of the country has been drawing the same
conclusion. Just like Wisconsin, several other states have lost
their early faith in deregulation as surging consumer demand has
outstripped the supply of electricity, and regulators and utilities
scramble to cope with price volatility and power outages. Still,
few experts expect a return to the days of strict government
control. A world where various power generators compete openly to
provide electricity at market prices still offers the prospect of
both lower costs for business and consumers and higher profits for
utilities than is possible under the traditional, more inefficient
regulated system. But getting to that promised land is proving far
more difficult than expected. ``Deregulation was definitely
oversold to consumers by many people,'' one expert says. By Neela

LIMITED FUEL DELIVERIES RESUME IN BRITAIN, BUT PROTESTS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Fuel tankers resumed limited deliveries from picketed
refineries and storage depots Wednesday, but the crack in the siege
that has left almost all the country's filling stations dry was
doing little to restore the normality that Prime Minister Tony
Blair has promised British motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of gasoline was estimated to be less than 10 percent of
what is regularly scheduled, and almost all of it was designated
for the vital services sector rather than the nation's gas pumps.
The Petrol Retailers' Association warned that it could be three
weeks before Britain was back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The protests against high fuel prices that have presented Blair
with the most serious domestic crisis of his three-and-a-half years
in office continued, with pickets monitoring the rigs exiting oil
company properties and convoys of truckers tying up avenues and
expressways across the country. At some locations, drivers refused
to take on oil out of sympathy with the protesters or fear of
possible retaliation from them.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, which caught the Blair government badly off guard,
have been mounted by truckers and other workers who claim that
rising fuel prices are putting them out of business. They have used
the Internet to coordinate far-flung demonstrations and have
attracted a good deal of sympathy from the British public despite
the inconveniences they are causing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Blair say he wouldn't cave in to the protesters, but
he should know that 90 percent of the public are with them, not
him,'' said Dave Cummings, a taxi driver in Edinburgh who said he
only had a half tank of gas left and nowhere to refill. ``Here we
have all this oil in the North Sea, and we're paying the highest
petrol prices in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators have succeeded in focusing blame for the
crisis on Blair, and he cut short a tour of the Midlands on Tuesday
to return to London and issue tough declarations that he would not
capitulate to demands that taxes on fuel be reduced. The country's
fuel tax, which amounts to 76.2 percent of the roughly $4.37
charged for a gallon of gas, is the highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made a high-risk pledge to get the fuel situation ``on the
way back to normal'' within 24 hours, and the protesters reacted
with defiance, promising in effect to make him eat his words. Blair
is eager to appear decisive, aware of the power of popular protest
in Britain to bring down governments. Mass actions in 1979 began
the fall of the Labor administration of Prime Minister James
Callaghan, and widespread protests to Margaret Thatcher's
imposition of poll taxes speeded the end of her government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blair summoned oil company leaders to 10 Downing Street on
Wednesday for the second time in as many days, and they emerged
saying that they would do everything they could to free up
deliveries. They had argued that they were unwilling to order
drivers to make shipments because of fear for their safety. ``We
will be stepping this up as soon as possible to get back to
normal,'' said Shell's chief executive, Malcolm Brinder, reading
from a joint statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The protests had been largely free of incidents until Wednesday,
when the police were ordered to clear the way for oil trucks and
had to arrest some demonstrators. The protesters have become more
belligerent, with leaders taking photographs of departing tanker
drivers and telling them the pictures would be posted on Web sites
if the fuel was delivered to commercial clients instead of the
emergency services that the demonstrators have promised not to
disrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Evans of the Association of Chief Police Officers said
he had been receiving reports of intimidation, though overall, he
said, the demonstrations were not confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   John Monks, the general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress,
condemned the protests as a ``bosses blockade'' and, citing a stark
example, urged all union members to avoid participating in them.
``Let me remind you of another occasion when trucks and lorries
were used by the self-employed and the far-right to attack
democracy,'' he told a congress meeting in Glasgow. ``That was in
1973 in Chile, and it started a chain of events which brought down
the Allende government.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Psychologists have identified the archetypal
affliction of the new millennium: computer failure syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey of office workers has revealed that one in eight
find IT failure, an everyday occurrence in many offices, more
stressful than the breakdown of a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms are easy to spot. The first sighting of a frozen
mouse is usually enough to make the blood boil. Palpitations follow
the appearance of those dread words, ``Unable to connect to
server'' _ and the even more sinister, ``A type 3 error has
occurred. Shut down and start again'' sends blood pressure soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 200 people, commissioned by technology firm ICL,
has measured stress levels caused by computer crashes by asking
those surveyed how system failures compared with other stressful
situations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 68 percent of office workers regard
visiting the in-laws as less stressful than a computer crash, while
38 percent would rather be stuck on public transport.
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 find PC failure more stressful than missing a holiday
flight, while one in three would rather babysit.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which IT failures caused the most stress, workers
pointed to computer or network failure, followed by printer, e-mail
and Internet malfunctions in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this survey shows is that we have become more and
dependent on this funny machine in front of us,'' said Cary Cooper,
professor of organizational psychology at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. ``As a result,
people get hysterical when a computer breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   An expert on the working environment, Cooper has identified a
number of trademark symptoms that push stress levels through the
roof. Palpitations begin, he says, with the first signs of a frozen
computer or warning message. The tendency to hurl insults at the
impassive screen or else punch the hard drive does not help.
</P>
<P>
   But what really sends blood pressure soaring is the last resort:
the call to the technology ``help'' desk for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper believes that stress levels are compounded by inadequate
IT support due to a lack of financial investment in back-up staff.
</P>
<P>
   The survey supports his comments: 60 percent of those questioned
blamed poor work performance on the failure of technology staff to
sort problems out speedily, while 50 percent want technical
training so that they can iron out problems without resorting to
support staff.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are also frustrated by slow or old technology: one in
four reckon they waste between 30 minutes and an hour each day
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper warns, however, that we should not get too wound up over
crashing screens: ``Computers are pretty fundamental to our working
lives but not as important as a relationship. So to find a computer
breakdown more stressful is really pretty sad. Actually, I think
it's pathetic.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Psychologists have identified the archetypal
affliction of the new millennium: computer failure syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey of office workers has revealed that one in eight
find IT failure, an everyday occurrence in many offices, more
stressful than the breakdown of a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms are easy to spot. The first sighting of a frozen
mouse is usually enough to make the blood boil. Palpitations follow
the appearance of those dread words, ``Unable to connect to
server'' _ and the even more sinister, ``A type 3 error has
occurred. Shut down and start again'' sends blood pressure soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 200 people, commissioned by technology firm ICL,
has measured stress levels caused by computer crashes by asking
those surveyed how system failures compared with other stressful
situations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 68 percent of office workers regard
visiting the in-laws as less stressful than a computer crash, while
38 percent would rather be stuck on public transport.
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 find PC failure more stressful than missing a holiday
flight, while one in three would rather babysit.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which IT failures caused the most stress, workers
pointed to computer or network failure, followed by printer, e-mail
and Internet malfunctions in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this survey shows is that we have become more and
dependent on this funny machine in front of us,'' said Cary Cooper,
professor of organizational psychology at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. ``As a result,
people get hysterical when a computer breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   An expert on the working environment, Cooper has identified a
number of trademark symptoms that push stress levels through the
roof. Palpitations begin, he says, with the first signs of a frozen
computer or warning message. The tendency to hurl insults at the
impassive screen or else punch the hard drive does not help.
</P>
<P>
   But what really sends blood pressure soaring is the last resort:
the call to the technology ``help'' desk for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper believes that stress levels are compounded by inadequate
IT support due to a lack of financial investment in back-up staff.
</P>
<P>
   The survey supports his comments: 60 percent of those questioned
blamed poor work performance on the failure of technology staff to
sort problems out speedily, while 50 percent want technical
training so that they can iron out problems without resorting to
support staff.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are also frustrated by slow or old technology: one in
four reckon they waste between 30 minutes and an hour each day
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper warns, however, that we should not get too wound up over
crashing screens: ``Computers are pretty fundamental to our working
lives but not as important as a relationship. So to find a computer
breakdown more stressful is really pretty sad. Actually, I think
it's pathetic.'' &QL;

WELCOME TO THE UNITED NATIONS, TUVALU!
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed so surprisingly modern for the tiny South Pacific
nation of Tuvalu to join the United Nations last week, hoisting
above New York City streets its light-blue flag that fluttered in
the breeze as an emblem of entry into the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu, however, a group of nine coral atolls halfway between
Australia and Hawaii, unwittingly joined the world community some
time ago. Its entry may spell great fortune as islanders become
Internet entrepreneurs. And it may mean great tragedy: Scientists
predict that the low-lying islands will disappear under the waves
if global warming continues to raise sea levels. Tuvalu could
become the next Atlantis. Just as easily, it could find a way to
thrive in a technologically sophisticated world.
</P>
<P>
   Will the people of Tuvalu be survivors? Intrigued? We were, too.
Here's our guide to Tuvalu, a tiny nation feeling the stresses of
the modern world:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Geography 101 stats:
</P>
<P>
   Population: 10,000, about the same number of people as Saginaw,
Texas, or the Dallas enclave of Highland Park
</P>
<P>
   Size of islands: 10 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy: 68 years, at least 10 years less than life
expectancy in the United States
</P>
<P>
   Chief export: Dried coconut meat, used in making coconut oil
</P>
<P>
   Imports: Food, fuel and manufactured goods
</P>
<P>
   Nationhood: Tuvalu gained independence from Britain in 1978
</P>
<P>
   Amenities: One unpaved road, few computers, no newspapers, few
televisions, and airline service is so poor that only about 1,000
tourists venture to its shores each year
</P>
<P>
   What it's known for: American World War II veterans may remember
Tuvalu by its former name of Ellice Islands, and recall it as home
to three now-abandoned war-era American airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Income: Licenses sold to American, Korean and Taiwanese tuna
fishing boats, and revenue from a trust fund set up by the
governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Other
revenue comes from the sale of colorful postage stamps to
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   GNP: $10 million in U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
   Average annual income: Higher managerial, $9,983 in U.S.
dollars; clerical, $4,308
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The islands stand to make a fortune from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The nation of Tuvalu in April sold its Internet domain, .tv, for
$50 million to DotTV, a business started by Idealab of Pasadena,
Calif., to sell the .tv domain spaces to folks who will probably
pay large sums for the descriptive Web site address.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United Kingdom received .uk as a domain name, and
Austraila received .au, Tuvalu was assigned the .tv location long
before anyone knew how lucrative that address suffix would prove to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very, very poor, but now we are getting some
money from the marketing of assets like .tv,'' Tuvalu Parliament
member Koloa Talake told the Los Angeles Times in April.
</P>
<P>
   Talake, who says he has never even seen a Web site, now holds a
seat on DotTV's board.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet millions are to be paid to Tuvalu in increments of
$1 million a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The island once made lots of money from phone sex operations.
</P>
<P>
   The DotTV deal isn't the first time islanders have tried to cash
in on technology. In 1996, new telephone service to the islands
created excess international service capacity, which islanders
sold. Unfortunately, the buyers of Tuvalu's international access
code, 688, were telephone sex operators in Japan, the United States
and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, the arrangement earned Tuvalu ($68,550 in U.S.
dollars), and 10 percent of the country's budget is now covered by
income from telephone sex,'' writes David Stanley, author of ``The
South Pacific Handbook'' (Avalon Travel Publishing, 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   The contracts with the operators were later canceled by
officials in the Christian nation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   You can see Tuvalu on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu isn't entirely removed from the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Tuvalu-Canadian'' family on the islands runs a Web site
called Tuvalu online. Its address is
http://members.xoom.com//tuvaluonline.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu's window to the world
</P>
<P>
   A few of the islands have solar-powered satellite
telecommunications receivers, allowing the handful of TV owners to
pick up MTV, CNN, the Disney Channel and other cable stations,
according to Stanley. ``South Pacific Handbook'' (Avalon Travel
Publishing, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The island is disappearing (perhaps making this the perfect
setting for a future ``Survivor'' series?).
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the islands are noticing that the Pacific Ocean
keeps creeping deeper onto their properties.
</P>
<P>
   Enele Sopoaga, Tuvalu's ambassador to Fiji, told reporters last
year that sea levels are forecast to rise between more than a foot
to more than 3 feet within 100 years, due to climatic shifts toward
warmer temperatures, which is melting the polar ice caps. The
climate change is attributed partly to emissions from fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu sits, on average, 3 feet above sea level, and seawater
already laps at some doors during particularly high tides.
</P>
<P>
   The plight has attracted the attention of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who said in a special session of the General Assembly
last year that there is ``trouble in paradise'' because of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Tuvalu government pleaded for foreign assurance
of assistance. In June, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff
promised that New Zealand, Australia and other Pacific nations will
welcome anyone from Tuvalu displaced by rising water.
</P>
<P>
   Sopoaga, in an account carried by the San Jose Mercury News last
year, said: ``Our people are a religious people. This is the main
topic of our church services and prayers. We believe God will
somehow show his hand of protection to the small island states and
Tuvalu.'' He is said to have fallen silent as tears sprang to his
eyes. ``I really don't know where we will be in 50 years' time,
whether there will still be a place called Tuvalu.''

&HT;     CALIFORNIA RESTRICTS USE OF GILL-NET FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an attempt to stop the drowning deaths of
more than a hundred marine mammals and thousands of seabirds a
year, California on Wednesday began restricting gill-net fishing
along a vast stretch of the Central Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen set the nets to catch halibut but also entrap
threatened otters and common murres at numbers high enough to
impede the recovery of their populations, the state Fish and Game
Department said in a preliminary order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers of common murre being drowned were high enough to
threaten the viability of the Central Coast population,'' said
David Bunn, deputy director of the agency. ``The number of otters
are substantially below their historic numbers, and there is
concern that the gill-net fishery is hindering their recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The California sea otter population had been dropping over four
years, only to rise slightly in the spring count to 2,377. Disease,
pollutants, killing by sharks and fishermen and entrapment in
fishing gear are suspected in the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Common murres, down to 100,000 from 1 million on the Farallon
Islands 200 years ago, have been killed in the last decades by oil
spills and gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   Seabirds such as the common murre, otters and other marine
mammals forage for food in the salmon zones where fishermen set
halibut nets: near shore rich with fish, shellfish and other sea
life.
</P>
<P>
   Over a year, National Marine Fisheries Service inspectors
monitored a quarter of the trips made by the 15 halibut boats that
use gill nets in Central California.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates based on the data from the on-board
observer program, more than 5,200 common murres, 120 harbor
porpoises and at least one otter would be killed in a year by the
gill nets set for halibut in the Monterey Bay region alone.
</P>
<P>
   The observers also found elephant seals, harbor seals and
California sea lions drowned in the nets.
</P>
<P>
   The state's order restricts halibut fishermen from setting nets
shallower than 60 fathoms, or 360 feet, from Point Reyes to Carmel
and in Santa Barbara County from Point Sal to Point Arguello.
</P>
<P>
   The order will be in effect for 120 days while the department
takes public comment. The department is expected to make the order
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Hung from buoys and anchored to the sea floor, the 10-foot-high
nylon gill nets with 8 1/2-inch mesh stretch tautly for about 1,800
feet. They earn their name by entangling big fish around the gills.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the regulations have restricted gill nets to a depth
no shallower than 30 fathoms, or 180 feet along most of California.
There had been no restrictions for the 20-mile section of Santa
Barbara County between Point Sal and Point Arguello, which is
frequented by a spreading population of otters.
</P>
<P>
   The new restriction most likely will put an end to halibut
fishing in California with gill nets, which represents about 6
percent of the state's halibut fishing, because to get the nets
that deep virtually would push the boats out of the fish's
territory. Most halibut are caught commercially by trawlers, which
drag nets in deeper waters, and by hook and line.
</P>
<P>
   For years coastal environmental groups such as Friends of the
Sea Otters, Center for Marine Conservation and Save Our Shores have
sought an end to the use of gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Center for Biological Diversity in Oakland filed a
notice of intent to sue if the state didn't control the gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very grateful to the director of Fish and Game for
giving the sea otter additional protection on the Central Coast and
closing a gap where the otter had no protection at all,'' said
Carol Fulton Yates, consultant to Friends of the Sea Otter in Santa
Cruz. ``We need to continue monitoring the areas where the gill
nets are still allowed to be set to be sure that they are not
drowning marine birds and animals.``

   The schoolbook version of voting rights history leaves the
impression that it was practically a pre-ordained march that
brought us from a time when only propertied white men could vote to
today, when almost all adult citizens can.
</P>
<P>
   So as another presidential election approaches, and with it the
hand-wringing over historic low voter turnouts, it is worth knowing
that it was not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Just beneath the myth is a nuanced and often inspiring story of
how Americans have taken the Declaration of Independence at its
word _ that governments derive ``their just Powers from the Consent
of the Governed.'' It reveals the great difficulty with which the
United States evolved into the democracy that we know _ not so much
in that imagined march forward, but in fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   Voting rights, in fact, have been bitterly contested for most of
our history. Not only that, they have been won and lost, and then
won again.
</P>
<P>
   As generations of Americans thrashed out the question of who
could vote, they went right to the core of what it means to be a
citizen and what rights and obligations that demands. Even today,
voting restrictions keep felons and residents who are not citizens
from the polling booths _ vestiges of what was once a long list of
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``History rarely moves in simple, straight lines, and the
history of suffrage is no exception,'' Alexander Keyssar observed
in his just-published book, ``The Right to Vote: The Contested
History of Democracy in the United States'' (Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   The historical record shows that New Jersey women could vote
until 1807, and then lost that right until a 1920 constitutional
amendment gave all women the vote. Blacks in some Northern states
could vote early in the 19th century until they, too, lost that
right as the nation moved toward civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants, for a time, were enfranchised as states competed to
attract them to sparsely populated areas. If they'd lived in the
United States for two years and declared their intent to become
citizens, they could vote. But they grew too numerous by 1900, and
suddenly were a political threat.
</P>
<P>
   And although the 15th Amendment in 1870 declared that race could
not infringe on voting rights, it took the Voting Rights Act of
1965 to guarantee that Southern blacks could freely exercise the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A grant of suffrage was not forever,'' said Benjamin Ginsberg,
director of the Johns Hopkins Center for the Study of American
Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be sanguine about this,'' he believes, even now.
</P>
<P>
   Voting rights history is really a chronicle of a people
struggling to gain a foothold on democracy, whether it was Chinese
immigrants on the West Coast, African-Americans in the North and
South, the Irish in the Northeast, eastern and southern European
immigrants in the Midwest and Southwest, or the nation's women.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University historian Eric Foner makes the case that
those who forced the broadening of American democracy are as much
``authors of the notion of freedom'' as the Founding Fathers. The
founders may have spoken loftily of having a voice in one's
government. But it was a voice that determined opponents, over two
centuries, tried to mute.
</P>
<P>
   This tension between America's promise and its reality was
articulated more than 100 years ago by a Massachusetts shoemaker
and future vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us give to all citizens equal rights, and then protect
everybody in the United States in the exercise of those rights,''
Henry Wilson, then a U.S. senator, argued during congressional
debates over the 15th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we do that,'' Wilson warned, ``we are in a false
position, an illogical position _ a position that cannot be
defended.''
</P>
<P>
   As Keyssar recounted, the opportunity existed at that moment to
write a broader law, one upholding voting rights without regard not
only to race, but to ``nativity, property, education or creed.''
Women would still have been excluded.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonable to assume, for most of us who are not
constitutional scholars, that an explicit right to vote can be
found somewhere in the U.S. Constitution. But for political reasons
_ primarily to ensure the survival of the Constitution itself _ the
determination of voting rights was left to the states. As British
colonies, they had devised their own voting rules, and they were
loathe to lose that authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution adopted in 1787 left the federal government
without any clear power or mechanism, other than through
constitutional amendment, to institute a national conception of
voting rights, to express a national vision of democracy,'' wrote
Keyssar, a professor of history and public policy at Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   And, he concluded, that was ``a fact that was to have
significant repercussions for almost two centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The new country inherited a British notion that adult men who
owned property were the only worthy guardians of the vote. The
assumption was that their property gave them a stake in civic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin famously poked fun at that:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today a man owns a jackass worth fifty dollars and he is
entitled to vote; but before the next election the jackass dies.
... Now gentlemen, pray inform me, in whom is the right of
suffrage? In the man or in the jackass?''
</P>
<P>
   But a broader voting rights debate soon took shape.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``governed'' were to give their ``consent,'' just who was
going to participate in this new representative government? And was
voting a natural right or a privilege? The answers would determine
how broad or how limited the electorate would be.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In compiling his history, Keyssar asked a fundamental question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by no means self-evident, as one looks at modern
history, that individuals who possess political power will (or can
be expected to) share that power with others, millions of others,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it happen, and why did the right to vote expand at
certain times and certain places, while contracting in others?''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over nearly 200 years against this or that group
revealed significant and deeply ingrained attitudes. Were
immigrants intelligent enough to vote? Would the act of voting
degrade women and sully them with politics? Did the illiterate _
white or black _ pose a danger to the nation's political life? Did
Native Americans qualify as citizens if they ``adopted the habits
of civilized life?''
</P>
<P>
   Political interests always were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   That was true when states sought to attract immigrants with the
vote. And, Johns Hopkins' Ginsberg argues, it was true during the
Vietnam War. However much 18-year-olds may have wanted the vote
then, Ginsberg said that in giving it to them, Democrats hoped to
get the youth vote and Republicans hoped the kids would just stop
demonstrating.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Any number of social forces, including war and race, played
pivotal roles in whether the vote was expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary fervor, for one, resulted in freed blacks getting
the vote in North Carolina, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland and Vermont. And voting prohibitions against Roman
Catholics and Jews were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The abolitionist movement against slavery that began gaining
force in the early 19th century encouraged hopes of an even broader
democracy. It led to an alliance of African-American abolitionists
and progressive women, many of whom would take leadership roles in
the women's suffrage movement that emerged at mid-century. But even
before they won the vote in 1920, as Kevin Mattson of the Walt
Whitman Center for the Culture and Politics of Democracy reminds
us, women organized and led social movements that thrust them into
civic and political life. Getting the vote was an ardous process of
some 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   And there were history's unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Property and tax requirements were dropped in Northern and
Southern states before the large-scale immigration of the 19th
century and before it was conceivable that slavery would be
abolished. Suddenly there was a large working class, especially
visible in growing industrial centers, that changed the face of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this enormous kind of `oops' North and South,''
Keyssar said.
</P>
<P>
   Any number of voting restrictions from Oregon to Massachusetts
followed to limit the immigrant vote. And in the South, newly
imposed restrictions from literacy tests to ``good character''
tests would dilute the voting power of blacks deep into the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, however, it is remarkable how Americans always have
taken the rhetoric of the Revolutionary War at face value. And that
was especially evident during wartime. From the Revolution through
Vietnam, Americans have realized that they could not ask their
soldiers to fight their wars and then deny them the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Voting restrictions, for example, kept many Native Americans
from voting as late as the 1940s, even though Congress had granted
all Indians citizenship in 1924. In part because of the protests of
Native American World War II veterans, those restrictions were
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   There is a particularly moving passage in Keyssar's book of
Virginians ``mustering in'' for service during the War of 1812. As
they did so, they lodged an eloquent protest by indicating whether
they could vote. Of 1,000 Shenandoah men, in one mustering, 700
could not. And Keyssar writes of how African-American veterans of
the Civil War paraded in jubiliation with their wives after they
had won the vote with the 15th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who could not vote,'' Keyssar explained, ``were very
aware that they couldn't, and that they were excluded and that they
were not full citizens.''

&HT;     CALIFORNIA RESTRICTS USE OF GILL-NET FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an attempt to stop the drowning deaths of
more than a hundred marine mammals and thousands of seabirds a
year, California on Wednesday began restricting gill-net fishing
along a vast stretch of the Central Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen set the nets to catch halibut but also entrap
threatened otters and common murres at numbers high enough to
impede the recovery of their populations, the state Fish and Game
Department said in a preliminary order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers of common murre being drowned were high enough to
threaten the viability of the Central Coast population,'' said
David Bunn, deputy director of the agency. ``The number of otters
are substantially below their historic numbers, and there is
concern that the gill-net fishery is hindering their recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The California sea otter population had been dropping over four
years, only to rise slightly in the spring count to 2,377. Disease,
pollutants, killing by sharks and fishermen and entrapment in
fishing gear are suspected in the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Common murres, down to 100,000 from 1 million on the Farallon
Islands 200 years ago, have been killed in the last decades by oil
spills and gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   Seabirds such as the common murre, otters and other marine
mammals forage for food in the salmon zones where fishermen set
halibut nets: near shore rich with fish, shellfish and other sea
life.
</P>
<P>
   Over a year, National Marine Fisheries Service inspectors
monitored a quarter of the trips made by the 15 halibut boats that
use gill nets in Central California.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates based on the data from the on-board
observer program, more than 5,200 common murres, 120 harbor
porpoises and at least one otter would be killed in a year by the
gill nets set for halibut in the Monterey Bay region alone.
</P>
<P>
   The observers also found elephant seals, harbor seals and
California sea lions drowned in the nets.
</P>
<P>
   The state's order restricts halibut fishermen from setting nets
shallower than 60 fathoms, or 360 feet, from Point Reyes to Carmel
and in Santa Barbara County from Point Sal to Point Arguello.
</P>
<P>
   The order will be in effect for 120 days while the department
takes public comment. The department is expected to make the order
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Hung from buoys and anchored to the sea floor, the 10-foot-high
nylon gill nets with 8 1/2-inch mesh stretch tautly for about 1,800
feet. They earn their name by entangling big fish around the gills.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the regulations have restricted gill nets to a depth
no shallower than 30 fathoms, or 180 feet along most of California.
There had been no restrictions for the 20-mile section of Santa
Barbara County between Point Sal and Point Arguello, which is
frequented by a spreading population of otters.
</P>
<P>
   The new restriction most likely will put an end to halibut
fishing in California with gill nets, which represents about 6
percent of the state's halibut fishing, because to get the nets
that deep virtually would push the boats out of the fish's
territory. Most halibut are caught commercially by trawlers, which
drag nets in deeper waters, and by hook and line.
</P>
<P>
   For years coastal environmental groups such as Friends of the
Sea Otters, Center for Marine Conservation and Save Our Shores have
sought an end to the use of gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Center for Biological Diversity in Oakland filed a
notice of intent to sue if the state didn't control the gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very grateful to the director of Fish and Game for
giving the sea otter additional protection on the Central Coast and
closing a gap where the otter had no protection at all,'' said
Carol Fulton Yates, consultant to Friends of the Sea Otter in Santa
Cruz. ``We need to continue monitoring the areas where the gill
nets are still allowed to be set to be sure that they are not
drowning marine birds and animals.``

 &HT;    HOLLYWOOD HOPPING ON THE INTERNET WAVE
 &HT;    Moving in (e) entertainment and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 17.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tom Arnold hasn't had the best of luck with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The actor recently did some advertisements for a high-speed
Internet access company. But it took the company months to install
service at his home.
</P>
<P>
   When he was considering starting whether to start a Web site, he
went to several companies that promised the world, but couldn't
deliver. One outfit's computers crashed halfway through a
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a bit surprising to see Arnold bumping elbows and
sharing yuks with Web designers and other Internet junkies at a
recent private party held in an empty studio near Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more surprising when, he got up on stage, between
sets by a San Francisco salsa-rap band, he announced he was joining
the board of and investing in the party's sponsor, Broadband
Investment Group Corp. He also plans to launch an Internet talk
show with the group's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would've told me a year ago that you were thinking
about doing something on the Internet, I would've puked,'' Arnold
said afterwards between puffs of a stubby Cohiba cigar. ``But the
perception of the Internet has changed. The medium has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   And with it, Hollywood is changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, William Shatner went where no star has ever gone before
with his endorsement ads for Priceline.com. Several actors and
actresses have Web sites, authorized or not.
</P>
<P>
   But while Northern California's Silicon Valley may might be the
epicenter of technology, only recently have the ripples reached the
epicenter of entertainment _ Hollywood and the Southern California
cities that surround it _ in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting marriage of glitz and geek promises to produce
everything from Internet movies to star-powered technology business
incubators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period where _ for the first time in history _
technology and creative (entertainment) are beginning to
intersect,'' said Leonard Armato, a Los Angeles talent agent who
has also become an Internet entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Armato is best known in Los Angeles as Shaquille O'Neal's agent.
He also represents actress Pamela Anderson. In between contracts
and negotiations, Armato is starting something he calls the Digital
Media Campus, a quasi-technology business incubator where sports
and film celebrities can create Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Anderson has set up shop there, working on a site
she plans to call Pamtv.com. But Digital Media Campus claims to
have some hefty backers. Among the advisers and investors Armato
lists are actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, music maker Quincy Jones and
tech stars like such as Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison and Netscape
co-founder Marc Andreessen.
</P>
<P>
   Armato also has a little Web experience: Earlier this year, he
and O'Neal teamed up to create Dunk.com to sell shoes and other
athletic apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arnold and Anderson, other stars are taking to the Internet
with profits in mind. One of the most visible has been actress
Melanie Griffith, who made a big splash recently when she launched
Oneworldlive.com , which sells beauty supplies and diet programs
while providing what it calls ``lifestyle and transformational
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's hitch to high-tech isn't just about actors and
athletes, however. After years of sitting on the sidelines, even
major film studios are cautiously starting to get in on the
Internet act.
</P>
<P>
   Following the success of last year's ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which was promoted extensively on the Internet, every
major studio started doing extensive Internet advertising.
Universal Pictures reportedly spent $1 million promoting
Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days'' sci-fi thriller on America Online
last year. Look for more cross-marketing deals as AOL completes its
purchase of Time Warner Inc., the parent of Warner Bros., New Line
Cinema and Turner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Some studios are taking more creative approaches to their
newfound technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment, for example, recently struck a deal
with Liberty Digital Inc. aimed at creating the first 24-hour
interactive game show network, which promises to let viewers of
shows like such as ``Wheel of Fortune `` and ``Jeopardy'' play
along using television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't eat our own lunch, somebody else is going to,''
Sony Pictures Senior Vice President Patrick Kennedy explained at a
recent Internet entertainment conference in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In June, in a sign of what may might come for film distribution,
20th Century Fox and Cisco Systems Inc. teamed up to send an
80-minute digitized cartoon, ``Titan AE,'' over the Internet from
California to a theater in Atlanta. The event marked the first time
a movie was distributed without putting film in a can and shipping
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the major corporations, they all recognize that this is
something they have to get into some way or another,'' said Leron
Gubler, who as president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
spends a good bit of his time gripping and grinning with
entertainment's elite. ``They know they can't be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the growth in the Hollywood area's technology
industry has come from small companies that do everything from Web
site creation to Internet marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Web designer Ready Set Net Inc. is a typical Hollywood tech
company.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Darin Andersen started Ready Set Net six years ago in
his home in Hollywood Hills, not far from the famed Hollywood sign.
When the company grew big enough to warrant its own space, he moved
it to downtown Los Angeles, but came back to Hollywood as soon as
his lease in a pricey L.A. office building was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have clients that would come to our offices and
they'd say 'Gee, this is really corporate, isn't it?''' said
Andersen, whose company lists MGM Studios and CBS Television as its
clients. ``It's not what they expected from a Web company.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ready Set Net is based in a 70-year-old building off
Hollywood Boulevard, a few blocks from Mann's Chinese Theater
Theatre and across from Musso &AMP; Frank Grill, one of the Los
Angeles' area's oldest restaurants, best known for its chilled
martinis and for people-watching.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story building, the original home of the Screen Actors
Guild, has high ceilings, tile floors, transom windows and other
remnants of Hollywood's first golden age, the 1920s and 1930s. In a
different time, the basement was home to The Masque, a rock club
where Blondie, the Go-Gos and other 1980s bands got their start.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the building is in the center of a breeding
ground for creativity. And in the Web design business, creativity
is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our employees come from the (film) production
industry _ we're really tapping into that,'' Andersen said. ``If
you think about it, a Web site is constructed in a very similar
fashion to a movie. It's basically a one-time major production,
with a lot of the same types of elements,'' like scripts and
special effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking how many technology companies have sprung up in the Los
Angeles area is tough, since the industry is so new and growing so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, technology discovered Tinseltown _ and
vice-versa _ about three years ago, and the love affair has been
growing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we might have had 150 companies in this
area'' in the technology and electronic entertainment business,
said Mark Richter, economic development manager for the city of
Santa Monica, west of Hollywood. ``Now we have probably well over
1,000 in Santa Monica alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica's ``e-entertainment'' businesses, as Richter calls
them, range from film marketing company Reelplay.com Inc. to
Iam.com Inc., an online talent agency for actors, models and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies have come to the region for talent, others
have come simply because it's Hollywood, and Hollywood is where you
need to be if you're in the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile from Ready Set Net's offices is the headquarters
for the hottest Internet film company in business today, Ifilm
Corp. On Ifilm's Web site is ``405,'' a short movie about an
airplane that lands on an SUV on busy Interstate 405 in Los
Angeles. The film, with highly detailed special effects done
entirely with computers, has become the Internet's first big hit,
luring audiences in offices, campus dorm rooms and wherever else a
fast Web connection is available.
</P>
<P>
   Ifilm chairman and chief executive is Kevin Wendle helped to
start the popular technology information Web site CNet.com and was
one of the first executives at Fox Broadcasting _ he created
``Beverly Hills 90210'' _ before getting into the online film
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company (Ifilm) was started in Silicon Valley,'' he said.
``But ... when it comes to the film community, Hollywood and L.A.
are such company towns that you just need to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   With features like such as ``405,'' visitors to Ifilm.com can
experience what many in Hollywood see as the Internet's Holy Grail:
downloadable films.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Web gets faster, however, nobody is making will make
much money from Internet films. Most of today's Web productions are
low-budget, independent films that aspiring directors can post on
sites like such as Ifilm.com for free. Viewers can watch for free,
too _ and many of the movies are so bad that few would pay to watch
them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To help bring in revenue, Ifilm also runs a site that links
entertainment industry employers with prospective job candidates.
It also recently made the jump from the Web to television, striking
a deal with cable's Independent Film Channel to support each other
and produce a 26-episode series about independent film production.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of profits and the uncertainty over where the Internet
may might take the film business are what kept Hollywood from
jumping on the technology bandwagon sooner. Hollywood, like Wall
Street, hates uncertainty (think about all those ``Beverly Hills
Cop'' sequels).
</P>
<P>
   ``The question has sort of been, OK, we need to get on line, but
what do we do whenever we get there?'' said Malcolm Maclachlan,
media and e-commerce analyst with research company International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, yes, we're going to see on-demand movies and TV
shows delivered over the Internet,'' he said. ``But that could be
awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the metamorphosis has clearly begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has been lagging behind technologically and in
exploiting and operating on the Web,'' said Andersen, the Web site
developer. ``But it's really gotten the message now. And with the
star power in this town, you're going to see a lot more buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the restaurants and clubs around Andersen's offices
near Hollywood Boulevard and you can already hear it. Table talk is
not longer just about scripts and screens, it's also about
bandwidth and page views and cross-media marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they don't know exactly how just yet, it seems that
everybody who's anybody in Hollywood wants in on the tech trend.
And that's a far cry from where they were just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, there was practically no such thing as e-mail
in Hollywood,'' said Ifilm's Wendle. ``And up until two years ago,
many senior-level executives here were still having their
secretaries print their e-mails for them and respond for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see that happening occasionally, but the sea change is
occurring.''

   Sure, William Shatner went where no star has ever gone before
with his endorsement ads for Priceline.com. Several actors and
actresses have Web sites, authorized or not.
</P>
<P>
   But while Northern California's Silicon Valley may might be the
epicenter of technology, only recently have the ripples reached the
epicenter of entertainment _ Hollywood and the Southern California
cities that surround it _ in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting marriage of glitz and geek promises to produce
everything from Internet movies to star-powered technology business
incubators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period where _ for the first time in history _
technology and creative (entertainment) are beginning to
intersect,'' said Leonard Armato, a Los Angeles talent agent who
has also become an Internet entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Armato is best known in Los Angeles as Shaquille O'Neal's agent.
He also represents actress Pamela Anderson. In between contracts
and negotiations, Armato is starting something he calls the Digital
Media Campus, a quasi-technology business incubator where sports
and film celebrities can create Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Anderson has set up shop there, working on a site
she plans to call Pamtv.com. But Digital Media Campus claims to
have some hefty backers. Among the advisers and investors Armato
lists are actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, music maker Quincy Jones and
tech stars like such as Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison and Netscape
co-founder Marc Andreessen.
</P>
<P>
   Armato also has a little Web experience: Earlier this year, he
and O'Neal teamed up to create Dunk.com to sell shoes and other
athletic apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arnold and Anderson, other stars are taking to the Internet
with profits in mind. One of the most visible has been actress
Melanie Griffith, who made a big splash recently when she launched
Oneworldlive.com , which sells beauty supplies and diet programs
while providing what it calls ``lifestyle and transformational
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's hitch to high-tech isn't just about actors and
athletes, however. After years of sitting on the sidelines, even
major film studios are cautiously starting to get in on the
Internet act.
</P>
<P>
   Following the success of last year's ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which was promoted extensively on the Internet, every
major studio started doing extensive Internet advertising.
Universal Pictures reportedly spent $1 million promoting
Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days'' sci-fi thriller on America Online
last year. Look for more cross-marketing deals as AOL completes its
purchase of Time Warner Inc., the parent of Warner Bros., New Line
Cinema and Turner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Some studios are taking more creative approaches to their
newfound technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment, for example, recently struck a deal
with Liberty Digital Inc. aimed at creating the first 24-hour
interactive game show network, which promises to let viewers of
shows like such as ``Wheel of Fortune `` and ``Jeopardy'' play
along using television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't eat our own lunch, somebody else is going to,''
Sony Pictures Senior Vice President Patrick Kennedy explained at a
recent Internet entertainment conference in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In June, in a sign of what may might come for film distribution,
20th Century Fox and Cisco Systems Inc. teamed up to send an
80-minute digitized cartoon, ``Titan AE,'' over the Internet from
California to a theater in Atlanta. The event marked the first time
a movie was distributed without putting film in a can and shipping
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the major corporations, they all recognize that this is
something they have to get into some way or another,'' said Leron
Gubler, who as president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
spends a good bit of his time gripping and grinning with
entertainment's elite. ``They know they can't be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the growth in the Hollywood area's technology
industry has come from small companies that do everything from Web
site creation to Internet marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Web designer Ready Set Net Inc. is a typical Hollywood tech
company.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Darin Andersen started Ready Set Net six years ago in
his home in Hollywood Hills, not far from the famed Hollywood sign.
When the company grew big enough to warrant its own space, he moved
it to downtown Los Angeles, but came back to Hollywood as soon as
his lease in a pricey L.A. office building was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have clients that would come to our offices and
they'd say 'Gee, this is really corporate, isn't it?''' said
Andersen, whose company lists MGM Studios and CBS Television as its
clients. ``It's not what they expected from a Web company.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ready Set Net is based in a 70-year-old building off
Hollywood Boulevard, a few blocks from Mann's Chinese Theater
Theatre and across from Musso &AMP; Frank Grill, one of the Los
Angeles' area's oldest restaurants, best known for its chilled
martinis and for people-watching.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story building, the original home of the Screen Actors
Guild, has high ceilings, tile floors, transom windows and other
remnants of Hollywood's first golden age, the 1920s and 1930s. In a
different time, the basement was home to The Masque, a rock club
where Blondie, the Go-Gos and other 1980s bands got their start.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the building is in the center of a breeding
ground for creativity. And in the Web design business, creativity
is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our employees come from the (film) production
industry _ we're really tapping into that,'' Andersen said. ``If
you think about it, a Web site is constructed in a very similar
fashion to a movie. It's basically a one-time major production,
with a lot of the same types of elements,'' like scripts and
special effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking how many technology companies have sprung up in the Los
Angeles area is tough, since the industry is so new and growing so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, technology discovered Tinseltown _ and
vice-versa _ about three years ago, and the love affair has been
growing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we might have had 150 companies in this
area'' in the technology and electronic entertainment business,
said Mark Richter, economic development manager for the city of
Santa Monica, west of Hollywood. ``Now we have probably well over
1,000 in Santa Monica alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica's ``e-entertainment'' businesses, as Richter calls
them, range from film marketing company Reelplay.com Inc. to
Iam.com Inc., an online talent agency for actors, models and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies have come to the region for talent, others
have come simply because it's Hollywood, and Hollywood is where you
need to be if you're in the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile from Ready Set Net's offices is the headquarters
for the hottest Internet film company in business today, Ifilm
Corp. On Ifilm's Web site is ``405,'' a short movie about an
airplane that lands on an SUV on busy Interstate 405 in Los
Angeles. The film, with highly detailed special effects done
entirely with computers, has become the Internet's first big hit,
luring audiences in offices, campus dorm rooms and wherever else a
fast Web connection is available.
</P>
<P>
   Ifilm chairman and chief executive is Kevin Wendle helped to
start the popular technology information Web site CNet.com and was
one of the first executives at Fox Broadcasting _ he created
``Beverly Hills 90210'' _ before getting into the online film
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company (Ifilm) was started in Silicon Valley,'' he said.
``But ... when it comes to the film community, Hollywood and L.A.
are such company towns that you just need to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   With features like such as ``405,'' visitors to Ifilm.com can
experience what many in Hollywood see as the Internet's Holy Grail:
downloadable films.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Web gets faster, however, nobody is making will make
much money from Internet films. Most of today's Web productions are
low-budget, independent films that aspiring directors can post on
sites like such as Ifilm.com for free. Viewers can watch for free,
too _ and many of the movies are so bad that few would pay to watch
them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To help bring in revenue, Ifilm also runs a site that links
entertainment industry employers with prospective job candidates.
It also recently made the jump from the Web to television, striking
a deal with cable's Independent Film Channel to support each other
and produce a 26-episode series about independent film production.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of profits and the uncertainty over where the Internet
may might take the film business are what kept Hollywood from
jumping on the technology bandwagon sooner. Hollywood, like Wall
Street, hates uncertainty (think about all those ``Beverly Hills
Cop'' sequels).
</P>
<P>
   ``The question has sort of been, OK, we need to get on line, but
what do we do whenever we get there?'' said Malcolm Maclachlan,
media and e-commerce analyst with research company International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, yes, we're going to see on-demand movies and TV
shows delivered over the Internet,'' he said. ``But that could be
awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the metamorphosis has clearly begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has been lagging behind technologically and in
exploiting and operating on the Web,'' said Andersen, the Web site
developer. ``But it's really gotten the message now. And with the
star power in this town, you're going to see a lot more buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the restaurants and clubs around Andersen's offices
near Hollywood Boulevard and you can already hear it. Table talk is
not longer just about scripts and screens, it's also about
bandwidth and page views and cross-media marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they don't know exactly how just yet, it seems that
everybody who's anybody in Hollywood wants in on the tech trend.
And that's a far cry from where they were just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, there was practically no such thing as e-mail
in Hollywood,'' said Ifilm's Wendle. ``And up until two years ago,
many senior-level executives here were still having their
secretaries print their e-mails for them and respond for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see that happening occasionally, but the sea change is
occurring.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For a man who was a confirmed fascist, at
least politically, much earlier in his life, Juan Antonio Samaranch
has become an old softie as he nears octogenarian status.
</P>
<P>
   The man credited with saving the Olympic movement following
successive boycotts of the Games in 1976, 1980 and 1984 is
flourishing in his role as ambassador to the world of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who as a youth was a supporter of Francisco Franco in
Spain, has persuaded North and South Koreas to march under one flag
in Friday's Opening Ceremonies at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been a softening of ideologies between the
two Koreas in recent months, filing into Olympic Stadium under the
same flag and wearing common uniforms is a significant gesture.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly matters that once competition begins Saturday the two
Koreas will go their separate ways in the uniforms of their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, 79, congratulated North Korea and South Korea for
uniting under the Olympic ideal of ``friendship, solidarity and
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Peace has been in short supply in turbulent East Timor, the
former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975. East Timor
recently declared its independence from Indonesia but has paid a
severe price for it in reprisals from Indonesian militias.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's independence is so recent it is not yet a
full-fledged member of the International Olympic Committee.
Nevertheless, Samaranch, president of the IOC, invited four East
Timorese athletes to compete in Sydney as independent athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The four _ a boxer, a weightlifter and two marathon runners _
will wear plain white uniforms bearing the familiar five-ring
Olympic logo. They are the second group of independent athletes to
compete in an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   There's more peace on Earth and good will to men and women, at
least as regards Sydney 2000. A mixed group of Muslims, Serbs and
Croats will compete here under the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   For Samaranch and the IOC, extending the olive branch to the
world's athletes means an ever-expanding roster of countries in the
Olympic Games. On Friday, 199 nations, some with delegations as
small as two or three and others as large as several hundred, are
expected to march into Sydney's 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting East Timor, of course. Its time will come as an IOC
member, possibly as soon as Athens in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In a land as biologically diverse as Australia, from blistering
stretches of near complete desolation in the outback to rich
tropical rain forests in the north, Sydney is promoting the 2000
Olympics as the ``Green Games.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same sense, including more and more of the world's people
in the pursuit of competition and cooperation adds to the human
diversity of Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before he steps down as head of the IOC, Samaranch may yet
receive his personal gold medal in the form of a Nobel Peace Prize.
He's longed for the prize for many years, yet his work furthering
the ideal of the Olympic Games does not come off as self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   From fascist youth to aging benefactor, the man has made quite a
transition in his life.

Jones and Ian Thorpe and strong teams like the Hockeyroos and the

<P>
   Scrub and peel potatoes; place in small saucepan. Cover
generously with water and boil rapidly until potatoes are very
tender. Drain, saving water. You will need 3/4 cup potato water. If
you do not have enough, add hot water to make that amount. Put
potatoes through a ricer. Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water to
which 1 teaspoon sugar has been added. Beat butter to cream it. A
little at a time, beat in remaining cup sugar and salt, then eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the 3/4 cup potato water into mashed potatoes, then add to
egg mixture. Stir in yeast mixture. When well-mixed, add 1 cup
flour, beating constantly. Do not spare the beating. Add the second
and third cups of flour the same way, small amounts at a time. Be
sure to beat hard to make the gluten in the flour wake up, and try
not to have to add that last half cup of flour. The dough should
not be too stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Place a damp cloth (not wet, just damp) over bowl with dough and
let rise. If you refrigerate it during this rest period, it will
become firmer and still will rise to double in bulk, but it will
take a little longer. It is far better to allow a little more time
for the rising than to try to stiffen the dough with extra flour.
</P>
<P>
   Generously butter a 9-by-13-inch pan. When dough has doubled,
thump it down and turn it out onto lightly floured surface.
Sprinkle top lightly with flour and roll out with floured rolling
pin to a little more than 1/2 inch thickness and as close to the
rectangular shape of the pan as you can. Place it in pan, punching
it out toward sides and corners. Cover and let rise in warm place
out of drafts (the unheated oven is about the best place for this
in most kitchens) until doubled.
</P>
<P>
   To make topping: Beat butter to cream it. Sift together flour
and sugar, a little at a time; beat into butter mixture. Add eggs,
one at a time, beating each in thoroughly. By teaspoonfuls, add
enough milk to make mixture the right consistency to spread (this
could require 3 or 4 tablespoons of milk, but don't get it too
runny). Gently spread over risen dough. This makes a large coffee
cake-type of cake. The topping melts into it as it bakes, and the
top should be crisp but very moist and ``gooey'' underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Spread with topping and bake in a 350-degree oven for 35 to 40
minutes until done. Cool in pan before cutting.

to make it too runny. Divide dough in two pieces. Roll or pat to
fit two well-greased 8-inch-square pans, or one 9-by-13-inch pan

dough is spread, prick well with a fork to prevent bubbling. Divide
topping between pans, spread over the dough.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Can anything more shocking be added to former
President Richard Nixon's tragic legacy?
</P>
<P>
   Well, try this.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``The Arrogance of Power, The Secret World of
Richard Nixon,'' author Anthony Summers charges that Nixon
deliberately sabotaged President Lyndon Johnson's attempt to win
South Vietnam's approval of a bombing halt in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Summers says that in October of that year, as the presidential
race neared an end, a desperate Nixon feared that his rival, Vice
President Hubert Humphrey, would win if Johnson's peace initiatives
gained acceptance in the unpopular war. A bombing halt would have
paved the way for talks with Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   In Summers' account _ which has been corroborated by Harry
Middleton, the librarian at the LBJ presidential Library in Austin,
Texas _ Nixon enlisted the help of Anna Chennault, widow of Gen.
Claire Chennalt, who headed the famed Flying Tigers in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon persuaded her to be his emissary to the government of
South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu. She frequently
contacted the South Vietnamese ambassador in Washington that fall
and even traveled to Saigon at Nixon's suggestion to personally
urge Thieu to reject Johnson's bid for his support to stop the
bombing of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Her telephone calls to the South Vietnamese officials were
tapped by the FBI, and the CIA also kept track of her clandestine
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Thieu ultimately balked at Johnson's peace gesture, and Summers
speculated that he probably would have done so even without
Chennault's pleas. But Summers adds, ``The fact that Nixon
intervened, though, deliberately flouting the efforts of American
officials, was indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything to win!
</P>
<P>
   Nixon did win the election by a hair, 43.4 percent to Humphrey's
42.7 percent. But thousands more Americans and South Vietnamese
died and thousands more were wounded in the war under Nixon ``in
the name of the quest for an honorable peace,'' Summers writes.
</P>
<P>
   As the war dragged on, the bitter protests over the conflict
tore the country apart and shattered the people's faith in the
government. Sen. George Aiken, R-Vt., gave Nixon the same advice
that he had given Johnson: ``Declare a victory and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither president would heed Aiken's sage advice.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1968 returns were in and his victory was sealed, Nixon
thanked Chennault effusively ``for her help in the election,''
Summers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Chennault told Nixon curtly: ``I've paid dearly for it.'' Nixon
responded ``Yes, I appreciate that. You're a good soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the FBI and the CIA, Johnson knew all about Nixon's
intrigues and apparently wrestled with the question of whether to
blow the whistle on his diabolical behavior. In the end, Johnson
remained silent. He apparently feared that if he exposed Nixon,
some national security operations would have to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knew that unless he laid out the evidence in detail
against Nixon, the accusation would be seen as a political ploy by
the Democrats to win the election. Johnson did inform Humphrey and
the late Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, both of whom decided
that a revelation of Nixon's treachery would damage national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with Johnson's decision. Bob Hardesty, a
Johnson speechwriter and later president of Southwest Texas State
University, LBJ's alma mater, dissented. He apparently thought the
country would have fared better if Nixon's betrayal had been
revealed during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I think he's right. The war, unwinnable short of dropping the
nuclear bomb, might have ended sooner. Thousands more Americans
might be alive today. And Nixon might have lost the election. The
nation then would have been spared the anguish of the Watergate
scandal when Nixon again broke laws in his effort to win reelection
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the 1968 campaign, Johnson summoned Nixon to
the Oval Office. I thought at the time it was extraordinary for the
president to do that since he was supporting Humphrey's candidacy.
The purpose of the meeting was not announced. We reporters at the
White House suspected it had something to do with national
security, but no official would say anything.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's refusal to unmask Nixon will be debated in the history
books. But that whole era could have been quite different if
Americans had been trusted with the truth.

IT'S ANOTHER INSTANCE OF `GIVE THE AUDIENCE WHAT IT WANTS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DOUGLAS PERRY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your typical female Olympian is far from a clothes horse. Check
out her closet and you'll find a lot of Banana Republic and Gap,
even Old Navy. Who's got time to worry about clothes when there's
training to do, right? She'll tell you that all she really needs
are her Nikes, a pair of sweats, and maybe a braided band to hold
back her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, when she's dressing for a meet. That's where
the couture designers and makeup artists and image consultants come
in.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't noticed yet, high fashion has come to
Olympic sports _ although it's definitely not an attempt to lure
more female fans. The female swimmers now compete in sheer designer
suits that are fitted so tight that you unconsciously lean closer
to your TV set to see whether the seams are going to blow. Over on
the track, sprinters go all-out in colorful sports bras and teeny,
rump-hugging shorts.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about aerodynamics, they'll tell you _ and there's
something to that. (The men mostly wear the same garb, and Speedo's
new body suit is being credited with helping swimmers set world
records.)
</P>
<P>
   But with popular testosterone-fueled cable programs such as
``The Cindy Margolis Show'' and ``The Man Show'' raising viewer
expectations, it's more about meeting customer demand _ and making
sure that the Sydney Olympic Games are truly Must-See TV.
</P>
<P>
   All of which shows that, despite the progress that female
athletes have made in the 28 years since the landmark Title IX
ruling leveled the collegiate playing field between the sexes,
athletes and sports marketers still must face an indisputable fact:
To most men (who remain the chief consumers of sports), how women
look matters a lot more than how they play.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible example of this is Anna Kournikova. Lycos Inc.
reports that the Russian tennis star, who has yet to win a
professional tournament, is the most-searched-for athlete on the
Web, more than double the searches for Michael Jordan. During this
year's Wimbledon, where Kournikova lost in the second round, the
London Sun offered readers ``Kourna Corner,'' a daily page of
cleavage-exposing photographs of the unseeded player. When
Wimbledon isn't going on, the page is devoted to topless models.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis great Martina Navratilova recently lit into the
international tennis federation for encouraging such cheesecake
coverage, saying that it trivializes the players' abilities and
hard work _ and coarsens and degrades male attitudes toward female
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But even among the sport's hard-core backers, such complaints
face opposition. Former Wimbledon champ Boris Becker, decrying
tennis' slipping TV ratings, has said that tennis ``needs more Anna
Kournikovas.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee, which has seen its ratings
fall, fully embraces this give-the-public-what-it-wants attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the news media labeled Atlanta the ``Women's
Olympics,'' thanks to breakout stars such as Lisa Leslie. But
behind the scenes, it became known as the ``T&AMP;A Games'' because of
TV coverage that focused more on muscled thighs and heaving chests
than on the thrill of victory.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes are in step with the ``Zeitgeist.'' Well aware of
the importance of getting noticed in the increasingly crowded
Games, they are posing for calendars and magazines, all in the hope
of drawing viewers _ and maybe, just maybe, wowing them with more
than their pulchritude.
</P>
<P>
   As synchronized swimmer Nathalie Schneyder says, ``There's a lot
more to our sport than our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   That premise still brings giggles from many sports fans, but
athletes such as Schneyder can at least take comfort in knowing
that their doubters will be watching.

APARTMENT BUILDING MANAGERS CAN USE HIGH TECH TO REDUCE HEATING
BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Homeowners who want to cut their heating costs
usually have several options: they can make sure all windows remain
closed when the heat is on; they can set the thermostat to whatever
temperature they want, day or night; they can avoid heating unused
rooms by selectively shutting off radiators or heat registers; and
they can make sweaters and thick socks mandatory attire for
occupants during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and managers of multifamily buildings, on the other hand,
cannot avail themselves of such strategies because most states have
minimum temperature requirements that apply to every room in every
apartment in a building regardless of how individual tenants might
chose to dress.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a number of ways that multifamily building
owners can reduce heating bills _ sometimes significantly. A small
but noticeable savings may be obtained, for example, by ensuring
that the nozzle on the heating system's burner, a $5 part, is the
one recommended by the manufacturer. And savings of as much as 30
percent can be obtained by installing computer-controlled
temperature-sensing equipment on the furnace and at strategic
locations in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first signs of cold weather in most New York City
apartments is that it gets too hot in the apartment,'' said Richard
Cherry, president of Community Environmental Center, a
not-for-profit environmental services organization based in Long
Island City. ``That is because superintendents will usually pile on
the heat in their buildings to avoid complaints from tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cherry said, since the heating system in most
multifamily buildings is controlled by a heat-timer _ which turns
the system on and off for preset periods of time _ the most common
strategy superintendents use to determine whether there is
sufficient heat in the building is to keep the furnace running
until no one complains. That, however, often results in a huge
waste of fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the average daytime temperature in most
apartment buildings is between 78 and 80 degrees,'' he said. ``And
as excusable as this may have been when heating oil was 30 cents a
gallon, at $1 or more a gallon it's almost criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid overheating a multiunit building, Cherry said,
is to install Community Environmental Center's Total Energy
Management System. The system, he said, uses a control unit in the
boiler room to receive a constant stream of information from
sensors installed on the boiler or furnace itself and throughout
the building.
</P>
<P>
   The information provided by the sensors is analyzed by the
control unit, which then determines the heating needs and the
optimum time to run the furnace or boiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar to having a thermostatically controlled
building,'' he said, adding that information about the heating
system _ as well as reports of existing trouble or potential
malfunctions _ can be sent to superintendents and off-site managers
through a dial-up connection and computer.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Total Energy Management System, which includes a
comprehensive buildingwide heating-system analysis, would range
between $17,000 and $22,000 for most buildings, depending on the
size, Cherry said. ``We offer a money-back guarantee if a building
owner doesn't see a 10 percent reduction in fuel costs over the
previous year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A less expensive heating system add-on that comes with a similar
money-back guarantee is MicroTherm, a product manufactured in
Manchester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Cocke, a Manhattan-based agent for the SNS Energy
Distribution Corp., a company in Amityville, N.Y., that sells the
product in the United States, explained that MicroTherm is a
``microprocessor in a box'' connected to the timing device that
controls the on-off cycle of the boiler or furnace. Using a sensor
that detects the temperature of water returning to the furnace
after it has made its way through radiators in the building, the
MicroTherm determines the optimum on-off cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It acts as the gatekeeper for the burner control circuit,''
Cocke said, explaining that rather than allow the furnace or boiler
to cycle on and off solely in accordance with a preset time
schedule, the MicroTherm will either delay the start of a cycle or
extend a cycle in progress, based upon the temperature of the water
returning to the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's guaranteed to reduce your fuel consumption by 10
percent,'' Cocke said, adding that the installed cost of the
MicroTherm system in most buildings would be $3,250.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-tech way to monitor the efficiency of the heating
system in larger buildings is through the use of stand-alone
sensors that can be placed in apartments and common areas
throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Baker, senior consultant for building automation of
Advanced Digital Internet, a Manhattan company, said his company is
now marketing a heating fuel efficiency system that uses wireless
digital thermometers installed at strategic locations in a building
to send signals to an on-site computer, which then transmits the
information over telephone lines to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is then presented in a graphical format on our
Web site,'' Baker said, explaining that the information can be used
by a building's management to determine what areas of the building
are receiving too much or too little heat, and then remedy the
situation. He said Advanced Digital Internet _ which is also an
Internet service provider _ charges about $100 for each remote
thermometer and as little as $600 for the reporting device.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Henry Gifford, president of Gifford Fuel Savings Inc., a
Manhattan-based heating contractor, said he uses what he calls ``a
double-hung windowstat'' to determine whether a building is wasting
fuel by being unnecessarily overheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand in front of the building in the winter and see if
there are any open windows,'' Gifford said, explaining that in many
buildings, the amount of heat being supplied to the building is the
direct result of ``one cold tenant yelling for heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Gifford said, cold apartments should be inspected
to determine whether there are any defective vents on steam
radiators, improperly installed radiators or radiators that have
been turned off or blocked by furniture or shelving. If there are
no obvious problems, he said, management might want to consider
installing larger radiators in the cold apartments.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible _ with some heating systems _ to install
thermostats on individual radiators in each apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this in a couple of 12-story buildings, and the
people are happy as clams,'' he said, adding that because of the
way heating systems work, thermostats can be efficiently used only
on hot-water heating systems and on ``two pipe'' steam systems that
have separate pipes for steam supply and return.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gifford said, a building owner can ensure that his
heating plant is functioning as efficiently as possible for an
investment of as little as $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how much a nozzle costs for most burners,'' he said,
referring to the part of the burner that regulates combustion.
``And I have almost never seen the correct nozzle on an old
burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford explained that while a burner will operate with a nozzle
that is a ``close fit,'' it will not operate at its peak
efficiency. Accordingly, he said, it is wise for building owners to
determine the correct nozzle for their heating system _ something
that can be done by calling the system manufacturer and providing
the model number of the system _ and then insisting that any
service contractor use the proper nozzle.

   Saffron in the Garden
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last fall I read about a farmer who grows a few acres of
saffron crocus to harvest and sell locally. How easy is it for a
home gardener to grow saffron for personal use?
</P>
<P>
   A. That farmer is earning his money. Saffron, the dried
orange-red flower stigmas of the fall-blooming Crocus sativus, must
be harvested by hand because machinery would damage the leaves,
which are needed to produce food for the plant. So it's stoop (way
down _ crocus flowers are only a couple of inches above the soil)
and carefully pick the flower, take a step, stoop and pick again.
It takes about 4,000 crocuses to yield the 12,000 or so stigmas
needed for a single ounce of saffron, and every crocus means a bulb
that has to be planted (by hand, bent over) and then harvested, and
then lifted (by hand, bent over) every second or third spring to
divide the daughter corms, and then each of the daughter corms has
to be planted (by hand, bent over). Close your eyes and imagine
doing that for a single row, let alone a few acres, and you might
not begrudge the farmer his profits.
</P>
<P>
   But if your back is strong and your desires can be satisfied
with just a few dishes flavored with home-grown saffron (it takes
the stigmas from 15 to 20 crocuses to make a single pinch of
saffron), all it takes is a perfectly drained, full-sun site that
bakes dry during the summer so the bulbs can lie dormant until
fall. Plant saffron crocus in early September and the flowers will
be ready for harvest in October or November. Air-dry the stigmas
after separating them from the flowers (by hand, bent over the
kitchen table).
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangea Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I bought my house in Newton, Mass., seven years ago, my
hydrangeas produced large blue flowers. At the end of the season I
would cut the shoots to the ground. After two or three years, the
shrubs grew foliage but no blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   So I experimented. I did not cut all of them down at the end of
the season. I found that in spring the old shoots did not leaf out,
although the new growth was healthy. I therefore believe that my
hydrangeas are the type that do not produce from old wood. Is there
something I can do to cause them to flower again? Although I am no
expert, I believe the shrubs are what is called ``nikko blue.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Grab a cup of coffee: you might have to read this twice for
it to make sense. Nikko Blue is a cultivar of Hydrangea
macrophylla, one of the hydrangeas that do bloom on old wood _ sort
of. Each year new shoots arise from the plant's crown. They are
easy to spot because they don't have any side branches. The
following year, in late summer, they produce flowers both from
terminal buds and from side shoots that grow during that summer. So
the flowers are on new wood that comes from year-old wood.
</P>
<P>
   The years you cut them down and they still bloomed, you most
likely cut them some distance above the soil, leaving some short
year-old stems that could produce new side shoots. Then you may
have gotten a bit neater, pruning right to the soil. Since there
were no year-old shoots, there were no flowers the following
summer.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds complicated, but pruning these hydrangeas isn't
that hard. As soon as the flowers become disreputable-looking,
prune the stems that had flowers right down to the ground. (They'll
die anyway in another year or so.) Prune only stems that have side
branches _ those without side stems are the ones that will branch
and flower next year. Unless you need to control size, don't prune
them even partway. Leaving them whole encourages both food
production this year and larger flowers next year. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the introduction of modern latex and acrylic-based
paints, oil-based paint was the most common type of paint used for
commercial and residential applications. There was also another
type of paint that was made and used around the home, although
today few people have even heard of it. This was milk paint, and it
was made, as the name implies, with a milk base.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem strange to make paint out of milk, but milk has a
protein, called casein, that has strong adhesive properties (it was
often used as a glue) and which makes it an excellent binder for
paint pigments. It is manufactured by drying the curd of soured
skim milk. The powdered casein is then mixed with other ingredients
like pigment, clay, lime and water to create milk paint.
</P>
<P>
   Because it could be made easily by do-it-yourself homeowners,
milk paint was used extensively in homes built before the Civil
War. Decorators and painters interested in restoring or duplicating
period interiors use milk paint to recreate authentic colors and
textures. Another reason why milk paint is enjoying renewed
popularity is because it is made with natural ingredients. There
are no solvents. It is non-flammable, biodegradable and non-toxic
when dry.
</P>
<P>
   Milk paint is still being manufactured today and is available in
some stores or through mail-order sources (One source is the Old
Fashioned Milk Paint Co., P.O. Box 222, Groton, Mass. 01450). It
comes in powder form and is available in a wide variety of
traditional colors. It is also available in a colorless powder that
is contains only the casein binder and other dry ingredients but no
pigment. With this product, you can add your own powdered pigment
to create milk paint in a custom color of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   The milk paint must first be mixed with water to make liquid
paint. To mix the paint, start with equal amounts of powder and
warm water in separate containers. Stir the powder into the water
until you achieve the desired consistency. Let it stand for about
15 minutes so the water absorbs all the particles. The paint may
thicken somewhat as it stands, and it may be necessary to add more
water.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to milk paint is that once it is mixed, it does not
store well. It is best therefore not to mix up more paint than you
can use in a day. If, for some reason, you are interrupted and must
store the liquid paint, pour it in an airtight container and place
it in the refrigerator. Refrigeration will only preserve the paint
for another day. The powder, however, will last indefinitely as
long as it kept in an airtight container.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback to using milk paint is that even though the
final paint finish is tough and durable, it will waterspot and
readily absorb dirt (This makes milk paint impractical for outdoor
applications). For this reason, most manufacturers recommend
applying a protective sealer to the paint finish after it dries.
</P>
<P>
   You can use almost any sealer, like varnish or polyurethane, but
they may darken the color of the paint finish slightly. Most milk
paint manufacturers also offer a sealer for their products that is
water based and solvent free.
</P>
<P>
   Milk paint can be applied to almost surface that is clean, dry
and free of oil, grease, dust and dirt. Glossy surfaces should be
dulled with sandpaper or a degloss solution. Metal surfaces should
first be coated with a rust- inhibiting primer.
</P>
<P>
   When painting raw wood, first wipe the surface with a damp rag
to remove dust. Seal all knots with shellac to prevent bleeding.
When the shellac is thoroughly dry, you can paint the surface.
Since milk paint is a water-based paint, it should not be applied
with a natural-bristle brush. The brush fibers will absorb the
water and lose their shape and resiliency. Use a synthetic-fiber
brush or a foam brush to apply the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are not interested in painting with milk paint, you
may come across it if you like to refinish old furniture.
Do-it-yourselfers are often puzzled when they try to strip a paint
finish off an old piece and find that it is impervious to modern
paint removers. That is because the finish is probably milk paint
and it is unaffected by petroleum-based solvents. For many years,
the only solvent that would dissolve milk paint was ammonia. Today,
there is a remover made especially for milk paint. It is called
Behlen PDE-Milk and is formulated to soften a milk paint finish so
it can be scraped off.

SNEEZING? YOU CAN LOOK IT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. George Patton's first rule of war _ get the other poor
blankety-blank before he gets you _ doesn't work with ragweed. It's
too prolific, and a single plant's lightweight, allergenic spores,
as many as 1 million a day, blow too far in the wind to let you
solve your watering, itching and sneezing problems in your own
backyard. Samples of ragweed pollen have been collected 400 miles
at sea and 2 miles high, according to the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean giving up. One of Patton's other rules
does apply: Know your enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To help with identification, the Plants Database of the federal
Department of Agriculture (http://plants.usda.gov/) gives profiles
of more than 20 ragweed varieties, along with many other plants.
Under common ragweed, the site has links to several picture
displays, notably those from the Weed Science Society of America,
whose pages show ragweed as a seedling, a young plant and a mature
plant.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent text and picture site comes from the Cooperative
Extension Service at Oklahoma State University
(http://plantsoil.okstate.edu/alfalfa/webnews/common(percent
sign)20ragweed.htm). You may not need its advice about herbicides
for your alfalfa field, but the close-ups of ragweed at different
stages provide clear identification for any homeowner. The photos
of baby ragweed can be especially useful next spring and early
summer, when you can weed on your property before the pollen begins
flying in early August and usually lasts until the killing frost.
</P>
<P>
   A page on ragweed from the University of Tulsa
(http://bio44.utulsa.edu/homepages/levetin/ragweed.htm) gives a
scientific description of the common ragweed plant (Ambrosia
artemisiifolia), which it calls the most important cause of
allergenic rhinitis and pollen asthma in North America. Two species
of ragweed, it notes, account for more hay fever than all other
plants together. Pollen release normally occurs in midmorning as
dew dries and humidity decreases, it says.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough account of ragweed, complete with literary
references, was compiled by Larry Mitich
(http://ext.agn.uiuc.edu/wssa/subpages/weed/10-1.htm). Why ragweed
acquired a beautiful generic name like Ambrosia, which means food
for the gods, is not known, he writes. He quotes an earlier
speculation that whoever first used the word ``may have had the
equine god in mind, for horses are very fond of this species, often
forsaking other food for its juicy leaves and branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Hay fever, or allergic rhinitis, affects more than 15 percent of
the population, according to the American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology. Its advice page
(www.allergy.mcg.edu/patients/index.html) explains the various
forms of rhinitis, which can be seasonal or permanent and can be
caused by a wide variety of substances besides pollen, including
mold spores, dust mites, animal dander and certain foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragweed, which affects 75 percent of allergic rhinitis
sufferers, blankets most of the United States,'' even parts of
Alaska and Hawaii, the site says, adding: ``Allergist-immunologists
seldom recommend moving to another locale as a cure for
allergies.'' Rhinitis can be nonallergenic, the site notes; viruses
from colds or flu can be the culprit, as can air pollution or
aerosol sprays. Treatment options include avoidance, medication and
allergy shots.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to avoid ragweed entirely, but the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has a short, readable

   Q:.MDNM/ Did the term ``spaghetti western'' come from the
decision to shoot the Clint Eastwood film ``For a Few Dollars
More'' in Italy? _ G.M., via the Internet A:.MDNM/ The inspiration
was ``Fistful of Dollars,'' the 1964 Italian movie that
``single-handedly invented the `spaghetti western,' '' according to
film critic Leonard Maltin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fistful'' was the first of three films directed by Sergio
Leone that starred Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name. It was
followed by ``For a Few Dollars More'' and ``Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, to meet the high demand for American westerns
in Europe, Leone and other filmmakers recruited American actors to
appear in foreign productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, the term `spaghetti western' is simply a
throwaway phrase that is used to describe four or five films made
by Sergio Leone,'' Lee Broughton writes in ``DVD Savant.'' ``But
Leone's films, seemingly the only genre films to have retained any
kind of a public profile, actually inspired the production of over
600 other European westerns.''

   Q:.MDNM/ I'm moving to Houston early next year. How can I
request ticket information on the new NFL franchise that is
starting up there? _ T.B., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Call the Houston Texans at (832) 200-2002 or visit the
Web site www.houstontexans.com.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which begins play in the 2002 NFL season, unveiled its
logo and nickname this month. Team owner Bob McNair also considered
the names Apollos and Stallions before choosing Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys have agreed to an annual preseason game
against the Texans, a revival of the Governor's Cup game that took
place against the Houston Oilers before they relocated and became
the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Texans team played in Dallas from 1960 to 1962 in the
American Football Conference. The team moved to Kansas City as the
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ How many black players are there in the National Hockey
League? _ C.C., Dallas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ During the 1999-2000 season, 19 black athletes were on
NHL rosters out of 650 players, according to Information Please.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes two Americans, Mike Grier and Donald Brashear,
and one Nigerian, Rumun Ndur. Others include Anson Carter, Jarome
Iginla, Peter Worrell, Fred Brathwaite, Sandy McCarthy, Kevin
Weekes and Jason Doig, all from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The first black player in the NHL was Willie O'Ree, who skated
for the Boston Bruins from 1958 to 1961. The next was Mike Marson
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Fuhr, who became the sixth in 1981, retired this month
with 403 career wins and five Stanley Cup victories as goaltender
for the Edmonton Oilers. &QL;

A PONG REDUX WITH SWEAT AND SWAGGER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Virtua Tennis, published by Sega for Dreamcast; $39.99; for all
ages.
</P>
<P>
   What right does that Tommy Haas have to be so smug? Look at him,
with his cocky walk and his stupid baseball hat on backward,
thinking he's so great because he slammed that ball past me and won
the match.
</P>
<P>
   I could have made that shot, but just as I was making a
desperate run for the ball, my wife walked in front of the TV and
blocked my view. Tommy Haas never had to deal with something like
that. You lucked out this time, Haas, but I'm hitting the Try Again
button, and this time I am out for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, a real-life German tennis star, is one of an international
all-male cast of players you can compete against in Sega's Virtua
Tennis, an addictive game in which you can experience victory and
defeat without getting off the couch. The players are remarkably
lifelike, grunting when they serve, mopping up sweat between sets,
going for the ball with desperate leaps that have them tumbling
head over heels while the crowd gives a collective sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual tennis looks so much like televised tennis, complete
with slow-motion instant replays, that you could very well start to
believe that you are seeing a real match.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget that this is not a spectator sport. You can
find yourself neglecting to control your player, staring at the
screen and thinking: ``What's wrong with that guy? Why is he just
standing there?''
</P>
<P>
   The game seems so athletic that after a while you may feel as
though you are that testosterone-pumped player on the court rather
than a couch potato with a game controller. You won't work up a
sweat, but you may feel as though you have. You may even be
convinced that you are getting physically stronger, faster and more
muscular _ until you play a live game of tennis and discover that
your muscles (except for those in your thumbs) have atrophied.
</P>
<P>
   Virtua Tennis is unlike most sports games in that you don't have
to like sports to enjoy playing. The game is not so much a sports
simulation as it is a retread of Pong, the game that began the
video game craze in the '70s. Underneath all the bells and
whistles, Virtua Tennis is a game about hitting a virtual
representation of a ball with a virtual representation of a racket,
an activity that has lost none of its charm in the last two and a
half decades.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pong, the game is simplicity itself. Direction keys run
your player across the court, and pushing a button makes him swing.
If the ball is nearby, he will move toward it and hit; if it's a
little too far away, he will jump for it. There is an incalculable
pleasure in seeing your opponent dive for a well-placed ball and
take a tumble, and a great frustration in doing so yourself.
</P>
<P>
   You choose a famous tennis player to play, and your choice
affects your tennis form: Mark Philippoussis has a hard serve;
Yevgeny Kafelnikov has a strong backhand. The effects are slight
but noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Your computer opponents will also vary. Some will play the net;
some will volley; some will blast serves. Game play is also
affected by the court you choose, with concrete giving you more
bounce than clay or grass.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing against a computer opponent, you can choose
to play against someone sitting next to you on that couch of yours.
And since you can play singles or doubles matches, you can put four
people on that couch, each with a controller.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where the Pong essence of Virtua Tennis comes into play:
It isn't hard to persuade people to play with you, even those with
little interest in video games. Virtua Tennis is easy to play and
difficult to stop. It is both mindless and engaging. It appeals to
women as much as to men, to adults as well as to children.
</P>
<P>
   In a real game of tennis, you can attribute your losses to
arbitrary factors: the sun got in your eyes, there was a pebble
underfoot. Virtua Tennis also gives you problems beyond your
control. Like real tennis, one side of the court is easier to play
than the other, and you keep switching sides. The easy side is when
your player has his back to you. On this side, movement is pretty
natural, with the Up button moving you closer to the net, and the
Down button moving you away. It's more difficult to play from the
other side, where the controls are reversed. That gives you the
opportunity to say, ``I could have made that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In singles mode, you can switch to an alternate view when on the
far side of the net, but in that view the ball is often off the
screen, one of the game's few shortcomings. You'll want to practice
on the far side anyway to train for those live competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Even when playing against the computer, you might feel as though
you have a live opponent _ not because of the intelligence of the
playing, although your computer opponents are frighteningly
proficient, but because of those moments when they shake their
heads after bad shots or pump their arms in excitement after good
ones. These reaction shots give a heightened sense of reality and
involvement; watching your opponent smirk after you miss an easy
shot will make you wish that Virtua Tennis had included a way to
throw your racket at the guy.
</P>
<P>
   When I won at an English tournament, I wasn't just beating a
computer, I was teaching Tommy Haas a lesson. So what if I couldn't
beat him in a real tennis match _ I'm sure I could destroy him in a
game of Pong. Then he might not be so smug.

SCIENTIST FREED AFTER PLEADING GUILTY IN DEAL WITH GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico _ Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos
National Laboratory scientist, was set free Wednesday after
pleading guilty to one count of improperly downloading nuclear
secrets under a plea agreement reached with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Parker accepted the deal and released Lee Wednesday
afternoon, with a sentence of 278 days, the time he has already
served. He was also fined $100.
</P>
<P>
   The judge apologized to Lee for the ``unfair manner'' of his
incarceration and said the Department of Justice and Energy ``have
embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials defended keeping Lee in solitary confinement
to limit his communication with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you steal our nuclear secrets we are not going to let you
communicate with anyone,'' said George Stamboulidis, an assistant
U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and Lee's lawyers reached agreement after Lee said
he would withdraw allegations that he had been a victim of racial
profiling, and prosecutors said they would drop their request that
he remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution denied that Lee had been singled out because of
his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lee was not prosecuted for his race,'' said Norman Bay,
another assistant U.S. attorney. ``He was prosecuted for what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was not about race. It was about the actions of a
man who mishandled huge amounts of classified data.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea agreement, prosecutors will be able to question
Lee under oath and reinstate the charges if he is found to have
lied, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to go home with my wife and my children
today,'' Lee said in brief remarks to reporters outside the
courthouse. ``I want to say thank you to all the people who support
me. I really appreciate it very, very much. In the next few days,
I'm going fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a defeat for the government, which had originally
charged Lee in a 59-count indictment and portrayed him as a spy for
the Chinese government. As the case seemed to unravel in recent
weeks, government officials suggested that Lee might instead have
provided secrets to other governments. Ultimately, he was not
charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, even before the final deal was reached, officials
began placing blame for the virtual collapse of the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, the former U.S. attorney in Albuquerque who indicted
Lee and then left government to run for Congress, said in an
interview that the original indictment had been approved not just
by him but also by senior officials at the Justice and Energy
Departments. It was a ``team decision,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some government officials blamed the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for providing false testimony at pretrial hearings,
which ultimately hurt the government's case. And one government
lawyer said the Los Alamos National Laboratory had harmed the case
by giving deeply conflicting views of the value of the weapons
information Lee had improperly downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the government agreed to reduce the charges to one
felony count of having illegally gathered and retained nuclear
weapons secrets. But negotiations this week delayed Lee's release.
Friends and neighbors of Lee came to court again Wednesday in
T-shirts that read ``Free Wen Ho Lee Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the case said the delay in completing the
plea agreement was caused by several questions being debated among
lawyers: Can the investigators ask about any efforts by China to
steal nuclear secrets? And can Lee be prosecuted for any other
crime that comes to light in discussions with investigators?
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Lee would be sentenced to the time he had
already served in prison in the nine months since he was arrested,
but would serve no probation. He also agreed that he would
cooperate with investigators and explain why he downloaded a huge
amount of nuclear data and what he did with seven computer tapes of
the information that have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice was a winner today,'' Stamboulidis said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides refused to comment on their unexpected
battle that delayed the final agreement. But people with knowledge
of the problem say it relates not to the terms of the actual
agreement, which was already signed on Sunday, but to competing
views of what Lee would tell the government investigators and what
legal risks he might face for those disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   In making the plea agreement final, Lee's attorneys made what is
called a proffer _ a description of what, in general terms, he
would tell the investigators. Several people said the disagreement
delaying Lee's release related to how far afield the government
could go in its questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers have sought the narrowest interpretation of the
deal, and have sought to protect him against additional
prosecution, people with knowledge of the talks said. From the
defense perspective, they said, it appeared that the government was
trying to stiffen the terms of the deal at the last minute in order
to avoid criticism that it had gained little from this long and
divisive case.
</P>
<P>
   The government has insisted that Lee must answer all questions
and should be vulnerable to prosecution if he admits to crimes
outside of the downloading charge to which he is pleading guilty,
people close to the talks said.

HELPING A PALM PILOT TO GET ITSELF IN SYNC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently purchased a Palm V organizer and installed the
appropriate software in my computer, but I was unable to
synchronize the Palm functions with the PC. How do I remedy the
situation?
</P>
<P>
   A. There could be a number of things that are causing the
communications problem between the Palm organizer and the desktop
computer. Many problems with getting Palm's HotSync software to
work smoothly can be traced to the computer's COM ports, especially
if you have other programs using them.
</P>
<P>
   After you have made sure that the Palm's cradle is firmly
connected to the back of the computer, check to see whether the
HotSync Manager program is running. Look for a little red-and-blue
HotSync icon on your system tray, then open it and check the Setup
options in the menu to make sure that you have directed the HotSync
program to use an available COM port. That port cannot be the same
one that your internal modem uses and it cannot have the same IRQ
(Interrupt Request) value as your computer's mouse or any other
hardware device.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably too many unknown factors to diagnose the
precise reason for the HotSync problem here. Palm says that simply
quitting and restarting the HotSync Manager program will sometimes
fix the problem. Palm's Web site, however, has a very detailed
section on how to troubleshoot HotSync problems on both the Windows
and Macintosh platforms (www.palm.com/support/hotsync.html). The
page also contains links to documents about COM port management for
the Palm, problems with the USB version of the HotSync software and
Mac OS 9.0.4., and a host of other platform-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I play CD-ROM programs on my computer, they seem to
stutter. Is that a mechanical problem with the CD drive?
</P>
<P>
   A. It could be a mechanical problem, but you might try cleaning
the lens on the CD-ROM drive first to see whether that helps with
the skipping. The CD player reads the disks with an optical lens,
and things like dust, dirt and pet hair can get sucked inside the
computer and wind up on the lens. If the lens is blocked by dirt,
it cannot read the disk accurately, and that causes skipping or
stuttering.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to clean the drive is to purchase a
special lens-cleaner CD from a computer or electronics store. These
cleaning disks, which cost around $10 apiece and can be used
repeatedly, usually have tiny brushes embedded on the underside
that can sweep accumulated debris off the lens.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some World Wide Web addresses have ``www'' in them, but I've
seen some that have ``www2'' instead, and I land there even if I
type ``www'' in the address. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. The ``www'' is a common Internet standard indicating that the
computer you're trying to reach is a Web server. But it is not
mandatory, and it is not part of the site's domain name, which is
the main part of a Web address, like rockthevote.com.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the site was set up, ``www'' may be a required
part of the URL, or you may not even have to type it. Some sites
don't even have it in their addresses. Many just set set up
electronic pointers that will direct you to the right page, no
matter what variation of the domain name you type.
</P>
<P>
   When you see ``www2'' or something similar in a Web address,
odds are that the site had multiple servers with the same content,
and you were just redirected to another server in the site's fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web browsers, like the current versions of Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, will helpfully insert
the ``http://www.'' and the ``.com'' for you. If you use one of
these browsers, you can type ``nytimes,'' for example, in the
address box and it will take you to www.nytimes.com.

SKIN-BARING PHOTOS DO FEMALE ATHLETICS NO FAVORS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American swimmer Jenny Thompson bares practically all in a
photograph accompanying a Sports Illustrated story about her quest
to bring home another gold medal _ she has five _ at the Summer
Olympic games this month in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova leaves little to the
imagination, dressed in white micro-shorts and a clingy tube top,
on the cover of the August edition of GQ. (The same edition
features the top American male Olympic athletes in long-sleeved,
leather-jacketed, cover-the-body Armani suits and Ralph Lauren
slacks _ even the guy in the pool.)
</P>
<P>
   The August edition of Esquire brought the world ``Style &AMP;
Beauty: A portfolio of America's 10 sexiest athletes'' _ all women,
of course, and most of them clad in scanty panties and
breast-hugging tops.
</P>
<P>
   You've come a long way, baby. Not!
</P>
<P>
   This sort of Olympiad of ogling wasn't what the torch bearers
for Title IX had in mind back in the early 1970s, when they were
petitioning Congress and lobbying state legislatures and haranguing
local school boards for enhanced opportunities and participation
for female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX says: ``No
person in the United States, shall on the ground of race, color, or
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, or be so treated
on the basis of sex under most education programs or activities
receiving Federal assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   When Congress made Title IX the law of the land, female athletes
and their coaches across the country _ energized by optimism that
their day in the sport spotlight had finally arrived _ worked their
collective tails off to build competitive athletic programs for
girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just a question of securing funds for women's sports.
There was a credibility issue on the line, too. The prevailing
attitude at many colleges and universities _ and if many athletic
directors told the gospel truth, some would admit it still exists _
was that women weren't geared toward athletic competition, weren't
serious about competitive sports, didn't have what it takes to
build a loyal and, more important, paying audience.
</P>
<P>
   UNDRESSED FOR SUCCESS?: Today's trend of marketing female
athletes as if they were selling 1-900 numbers raises questions,
particularly for the female athletes who were on the front lines a
quarter-century ago seeking equity. The sweat and the hours spent
to build credible athletic programs was for ... what? So that, at
the dawn of a new millennium, female athletes could take their
clothes off for America?
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bobel, director of the Women's Center at the University of
Cincinnati, worries that the fixation on sexuality will aggravate
existing problems for female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focusing on the bodies of women athletes hypersensitizes young
women to the importance of their appearance,'' Bobel said. ``Given
the already disproportionate rate of eating disorders and related
body-image dysfunction among female athletes, this trend could
surely exacerbate an already serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But many female athlete don't see it that way, which is all too
apparent by their appearances sans sweats _ or any other athletic
apparel _ in calendars and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila, a 29-year-old world-champion pole vaulter from
Auburn, Calif., makes no apologies for posing nude with other
American women for a track-and-field calendar. Dragila told The New
York Times that she considers it a sign of progress that women are
confident enough about their bodies to expose them as figures of
strength and power instead of titillation.
</P>
<P>
   But some aren't buying that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't insult my intelligence by telling me this is about
showing off your muscles,'' said Mary Jo Kane, director of the
Tucker Center for Girls and Women in Sport at the University of
Minnesota. ``It's not clear to me what muscle group their breasts
belong to. Jenny Thompson didn't win five gold medals because she
has nice breasts, so why are we talking about them?''
</P>
<P>
   Kane, whose center studies how sport and physical activity
affect girls and women, says that the news media's focus on the
sexuality of female athletes is not a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the data available and many of the studies I've done
show that historically, women athletes, when compared to male, are
more likely to be portrayed off the court, not in uniform, in
highly feminine poses,'' she said. ``What is unusual about today is
that female athletes, rather than being portrayed in classy evening
gowns or sorority shots, are shown in ways alarmingly similar to
soft porn poses.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Kane is well aware that anyone who questions this latest trend
in marketing is labeled a prude and a moralist.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who call us humorless feminists and say we don't get
it, all I'm asking with respect to the media's treatment or
marketing of women athletes is that there be some kind of parallel
or equitable portrayal of men. The day that Tiger Woods is
portrayed with a sexy smile standing on a golf course with nothing
but a Nike swoosh over his genitals, then I'll be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's humorless now, guys?
</P>
<P>
   SHOW THEM THE MONEY: Historically, the fastest way for a woman
to lose her credibility has been to disrobe. So why are so many
female athletes getting down to the bare essentials?
</P>
<P>
   Attention, which in the athletic world can translate into
lucrative endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants attention,'' said Marian Washington, head coach
of the women's basketball team at the University of Kansas and a
role model for this writer back in the mid-'70s, when I played
volleyball for KU and lobbied the state Legislature for sports
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think the athletes are always thinking the same
way as the marketing person. When they're draped in a flag, I don't
know that the marketing person is thinking that the message is they
work hard and their bodies are great. The marketing person is
thinking, `How do I to sell this magazine,' or, `How can I position
the athletes so they can get opportunities for endorsements?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes feel they are going to have some leverage if they
are willing to come across with a more sexual undertone as part of
the promotion. It's too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials and sponsors are definitely paying more
attention to female athletes than ever before, sparked partly by
the success of last summer's Women's World Cup of soccer. You
remember the games, don't you? Or do you just remember American
Brandi Chastain peeling out of her jersey and down to her sports
bra after nailing the winning kick?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that women are being shown more as athletes,'' said Dr.
Roberta Nutt, professor of psychology at Texas Women's University.
``But there is some distortion. People remember the women's soccer
team as Chastain with her shirt off. She and Mia Hamm get the big
publicity partly because of how they look, but the entire team
contributed to the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And the women's teams do deserve attention this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's Olympics is the first moment where America is
paying attention on a major scale to women's sports,'' the Tucker
Center's Kane said. ``The U.S. women compared to U.S. men, going
into the Sydney games, were clearly the story in terms of the
opportunity to garner medals _ gold medals in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus should be on that, and how far women have come, and
that all the physiological and biological and sociological
stereotypes of what women couldn't do in sports are being blown out
of the water. But the take is what it means for women athletes to
take their clothes off. Who's being served by this?''
</P>
<P>
   Nutt doesn't view the new wave of athletic portraiture as
entirely negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plus is that at least it's a more positive image than we
used to have,'' she said. ``We're seeing healthy, strong women with
muscles rather than waif-like models like Kate Moss who starve
themselves to death to get that look. But it's still
objectification of the female body. We're doing some of it with
men, too, but a male athlete who isn't gorgeous gets the same
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative part is that it reinforces that old message that
women are valued most for looks. Wonderful female athletes who are
not gorgeous don't get the same media coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   So the progress made for female athletes since the mid-'70s is
two steps forward and one shot of the naked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about how far we still have to go in my Psychology of
Women class,'' Nutt said. ``It's hard not to have students getting
discouraged. I try to create a balance as to where we have made
progress. And there is progress. At least now we're looking at
female athletes, and that's a good thing, and they are making more
money than they used to, and that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we live in a culture that still objectifies female bodies,
and that's a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane, too, sees good news and bad news. Twenty-eight years after
its passage, Title IX has engendered a sense of entitlement in
young women who grew up with sport opportunities that those who
came before them had to fight for. The bad news, she said, is that
they don't understand that sacrifices were made to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't occur to them that a lot of blood has been spilled
so they can do what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing what they do includes taking their clothes off for the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who has advocated for women's sport for last 20
years,'' Kane said, ``if this is what it means to have arrived, no
thanks. No thanks.''

HOUSE REPUBLICANS FAIL TO OVERRIDE VETO OF MARRIAGE PENALTY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: we plan to update this story later with a longer version by
Richard W. Stevenson) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans fell short Wednesday in their
attempt to override President Clinton's veto of the ``marriage
penalty'' bill. But while the bill is dead, the issue it addresses
is very much alive politically.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 270-158 in favor of overriding Clinton's veto,
short of the two-thirds required. Even if the bill had garnered the
necessary two-thirds in the House, vote-counters thought there was
virtually no chance of getting the same margin in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey immediately signaled that
Republicans would try to use the marriage penalty as campaign
grist. ``Americans understand it is wrong to tax marriage,'' he
said. ``We will have to put it up on the floor next year and have a
president who will sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the Republicans of being more interested in
nurturing a political issue than in passing genuine and equitable
tax relief. ``It's the show that counts,'' said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer
of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When he vetoed the bill last month, Clinton said it would have
benefited wealthy people most while providing very little relief to
middle-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that Clinton vetoed, and which died Wednesday in the
House, has been advertised by Republicans as a way to eliminate the
quirk in the tax code that leave many _ but not all _ two-income
couples paying a higher tax bill than they would if they had stayed
single.
</P>
<P>
   But it would have cut taxes for almost all married couples,
regardless of whether they now pay a penalty. Couples with one
working spouse, or households in which one spouse earns much more
than the other, typically pay a lower tax bill because they are
married than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill would have raised the standard
deduction for married couples filing jointly, so that it would be
equal to that of two single people.
</P>
<P>
   The deduction is adjusted each year for inflation. For this
year, the standard deduction for couples filing jointly is $7,350.
That is only 1.67 times the deduction for single people, which is
$4,400, meaning that the married couples pay a ``penalty'' of
$1,450.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the debate is the fact that this quirk _ like so many
others in the tax code _ arose because of attempts to correct
inequities that once penalized single people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When an earthquake roused tens of thousands of Northern
California residents from their sleep early in the morning on Sept.
3, hundreds of those rattled souls went straight to their computers
and logged onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   First, many people checked the U.S. Geological Survey's Web site
(quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs) for the magnitude (5.2) and epicenter
(near the town of Yountville, in Napa County), which were
calculated within minutes by seismic instruments and posted
automatically to the site.
</P>
<P>
   From there, a lot of people went to a page called Did You Feel
It? (pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ciim(underscore)nocal.html). They
entered their ZIP code and answered a list of questions about
things like how frightened they had been and whether their
appliances had moved.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the sun came up a few hours later, a color-coded map
showing where and how intensely the earthquake had been felt around
the San Francisco Bay Area had already taken shape.
</P>
<P>
   Such Community Internet Intensity Maps, like the one made for
the Napa quake, are the creation of Dr. David Wald, a 38-year-old
seismologist at the USGS in Pasadena, Calif., whose expertise in
computer modeling gave him the idea of moving intensity and damage
reporting to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the magnitude and epicenter of an earthquake are
valuable pieces of data, Wald said, they do not reveal much about
what the intensity of shaking was like in different places.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to gather that information someplace else,'' he said.
Seismic instruments generate automated shake-intensity maps after a
quake, but they do not tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to put instruments everywhere,'' Wald said,
``but people are on the Net everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And people, it turns out, are excellent seismometers. For years,
the Geological Survey gathered intensity data by mailing
questionnaires after a significant quake, then drawing its maps
based on responses.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Southern California,
which had a magnitude of 6.7, killed more than 60 people and caused
billions of dollars in damage, Dr. Lori Dengler, a geophysicist at
Humboldt State University, conducted post-quake telephone surveys.
She assigned numbers to the responses and used those numbers to map
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web gained popularity, Wald decided to apply Dengler's
methodology to the task of creating an interactive Web site that
would lead to intensity maps. The first questionnaire was put up in
1997, and since then, the intensity of hundreds of small and
moderate earthquakes has been mapped using the site. Most of the
maps apply to quakes in California, but Wald and his co-workers are
expanding the site to cover earthquakes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Did You Feel It? questionnaires for several large
historic quakes, including the Northridge quake and the 1989 Loma
Prieta quake near San Francisco, for people to fill out years after
the fact.
</P>
<P>
   The Did You Feel It? site asks a raft of questions, like ``Did
the earthquake wake you up?'' and ``Was it difficult to stand or
walk?'' and ``Did objects fall off shelves?''
</P>
<P>
   Each set of responses is assigned a numeric value and a
corresponding color, then plugged into the map. The map refreshes
itself every five minutes as the responses are received, filling in
with colors that range from white, for no shaking, to deep red, for
extreme shaking and very heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
   The more people who respond, the more accurately the map
reflects the actual intensity and the extent of damage.
</P>
<P>
   As the map forms, things begin to make geophysical sense, too.
People usually report more shaking in areas with softer sediment,
where the ground is less stable. Such was the case with the recent
Napa County quake.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quake was centered north of Napa, that city, which
sits on softer soil and is more densely populated, suffered the
most damage.
</P>
<P>
   Even mild earthquakes can be upsetting, and people who go to the
Did You Feel It? site appear to find comfort in seeing that others
felt what they felt.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said he was impressed by the number of people who took the
time to write lengthy accounts in the form's Additional Comments
section. ``People like to get it off their chest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling example of the effectiveness of the Did You
Feel It? site came at 3 a.m. on Oct. 16, 1999, when a 7.1-magnitude
quake was felt throughout Southern California. The epicenter of the
quake was in the middle of the desert, but 15 minutes after the
quake, more than 100 people had filled out the survey, and by later
that morning, 8,000 people had registered what they felt. Nearly
25,000 people have since filled out the form for that earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most amusing responses, Wald said, came from a police
officer who had been chasing a burglary suspect when the earthquake
hit. The officer was knocked off the concrete wall he had been
running on. ``Thief got away due to divine intervention,'' he
reported on Wald's site.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said that the site attracted pranksters here and there but
that they were not difficult to weed out. If answers are internally
inconsistent (nothing felt but severe damage reported, for
instance) the questionnaire is discounted.
</P>
<P>
   After one quake, an entry on the site included a 90210 ZIP code,
and Wald knew to discard the response.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said the site had been very useful for gathering data on
small and medium quakes, which leave people rattled but unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a large earthquake, Wald said, it could take
several days to get responses in heavily damaged areas. Still, he
said, a delay of days is an improvement over the weeks of delay
that the Geological Survey faced in the past. Wald added: ``Having
a hole in a map that shows increasing intensity toward the hole
tells you what must have happened in areas that did not respond _
they couldn't. And that implies power outages and lost
communication.''

 &HT;    GRAMM SAYS AMERICA DESERVES MORE BEAUTIFUL COINS
 &HT;    By BRUCE HIGHT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, says the government should put new money into the
pockets of all Americans _ and can make a profit doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the Texas Republican and former coin collector said
Wednesday, is that U.S. coins, which should be ``both utilitarian
and beautiful,'' are unattractive, unworthy of a great nation and
in need of redesign.
</P>
<P>
   It costs much less to mint a coin than its face value, and
Americans have shown an enormous appetite for new coins. So a
redesigned coinage could become a major ``profit center'' for the
federal government, Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   At what he called a ``symposium on coin design,'' Gramm
complained that current American coins, if dug up centuries from
now, would not ``conjure up an image of the greatest nation in the
history of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Campbell, president of the American Numismatic
Association, put it, U.S. coins may not be ``crummy'' _ as Gramm
has said in the past _ but collectors regard them as a collection
of ``dead heads'' featuring tired designs.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm referred to the passion that another Republican, President
Theodore Roosevelt, brought to a redesign of American coins in the
first decade of 20th century, producing what many collectors regard
as some of the most beautiful coins ever.
</P>
<P>
   Those designs were later changed, but most current versions have
been around for more than a half-century. The Lincoln penny was
begun in 1909 and modified on one side in 1959. The Washington
quarter appeared in 1932, the Jefferson nickel in 1938, and the
Roosevelt dime in 1946. Even the Kennedy half-dollar, which doesn't
circulate much, has been around since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doty, curator of numismatics at the Smithsonian National
Museum of American History, called America's coins ``distinctly
uninspired,'' cluttered and trite.
</P>
<P>
   But even if ugly, U.S. coins sure are in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Johnson, director of the U.S. Mint, said coin-producing
facilities in Philadelphia and Denver are running three shifts a
day, ``nearly'' seven days a week to keep up with the demand for
coins _ 28 billion this year alone, 8 billion more than the
previous record.
</P>
<P>
   Americans apparently love the new state quarters, in which each
state was allowed to suggest the design for the reverse. The
quarters are being minted over the next several years in the order
in which the states entered the union.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that before 1999, when the first state quarter came
out, the mint produced between 1 and 1.5 billion quarters a year;
now it's 6 billion a year and climbing. The new ``golden''
Sacagawea dollar also has been a success, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, the mint will generate $3.1 billion for the
treasury in ``profits,'' up from $550 million in 1998, mint
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, while not directly challenging criticism of current
designs on U.S. coins, laid out some of the problems that make it
more difficult to produce coins as beautiful as the $20 gold piece
designed by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the gold piece had to be modified almost
immediately, because the high relief in its design made them more
difficult to produce, and bankers found they didn't stack well.
</P>
<P>
   If the mint must substantially change the way it makes coins to
handle new ones with more detailed designs, different weights or
sizes, or metals, he said, it could ``seriously challenge our
ability to meet the nation's coin needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Johnson said, coins must be capable of being used in
vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm said that, given enormous advances in metallurgy over
the past century, surely more could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat of a paradox to me that with the dramatic
improvement in the precision of American technology and, therefore,
in our capacity to mint finer coins than we've ever minted before,
the quality of American coins has dropped dramatically in the last
century,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm made no specific proposals for who or what should be on
redesigned coins _ he didn't even push a conservative hero, former
President Ronald Reagan, for a spot.
</P>
<P>
   A recent unscientific poll of 1,940 coin collectors by a Chicago
firm, Minkus &AMP; Dunne Communications for the coin dealers Littleton
and Co. found that the three top vote-getters for a place on
American coins were Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Reagan and former
President Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan would be ``a contestant'' if it is decided to keep great
national leaders on coins, Gramm said after the symposium.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator said he wasn't even sure that the best design
would involve people: ``Maybe we should have coins that try to
embody the different concepts of American democracy _ liberty,
justice _ those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, he said, would be to resume production of the
famed ``Buffalo'' nickel that was minted between 1913 and 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has no pending legislation on coin redesign, but he said
he expects to take up the issue when the new Congress convenes in
January.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own coin collection, Gramm no longer has it. He said
he sold it for $300 in 1961 to help finance his college education.

 SIZING UP THE 10 MOST EAGERLY AWAITED FALL-RELEASE CDs 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, record labels save up CDs from their biggest stars,
then unleash them during the cutthroat Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the list of discs from high-profile artists is
typically staggering. Christina Aguilera, Limp Bizkit, The
Wallflowers, U2 and Radiohead, among others, will release discs
within the same few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a record company tradition to release a lot of new
records in the fall,'' says Dan Lightner, music manager for Borders
Books and Music in Fort Worth. ``It'll be Christmastime soon.
Everyone's shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall deluge of top-talent efforts will be followed by even
more this winter, performed by the likes of the Dave Matthews Band
and the Backstreet Boys, increasing the Christmas competition.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, here's a look at the top 10 most-anticipated
CDs headed for the bins. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Christina Aguilera &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: The reigning queen of teen-pop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Mi Reflejo'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: This week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: An all-Spanish disc featuring en espanol
versions of established hits such as ``Genie in a Bottle,''
alongside a handful of new songs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Aguilera is pulling a reverse Ricky Martin: she's out
to conquer the Latin market the same way Martin cracked the U.S.
market. If she succeeds, she'll not only increase her fan base but
also gain credibility as a legit singer. If the disc flops, well,
thank heaven for American teen-age girls. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Erykah Badu &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Sultry, Dallas-born R&AMP;B singer whose debut disc,
``Baduizm,'' not only sold extremely well _ thanks to the No. 1
single ``On and On'' _ but also served as a breath of fresh, rootsy
air in a genre dominated by plasticity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Mama's Gun'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 31 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Recorded in Dallas and New York, Badu's second
disc is said to be in the same jazz-laced, R&AMP;B vein as
``Baduizm.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: ``Baduizm'' came out three years ago, a lifetime in
the ever-changing, here-today-already-gone world of pop and R&AMP;B. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Johnny Cash &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Country icon whose soot-dark voice and candid imagery
have haunted and enthralled country music for 40 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``American III: Solitary Man'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 17 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Another collection of ghostly acoustic songs
(including U2 and Neil Diamond covers) that could easily be an
accompaniment to his beautifully stark 1994 disc, ``American
Recordings.'' Tom Petty and Sheryl Crow guest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Absolutely nothing. Country radio hasn't paid
attention to guys like Cash for years. Like Willie Nelson, Cash
makes music just because he wants to, not to hear cash registers
clink. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Green Day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Monstrously popular California punk trio whose major
label debut, ``Dookie,'' ushered in a wave of soundalikes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Warning'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Let's just say it's aptly titled. Not much on
``Warning'' resembles the band's past punk-pop efforts. Most of the
songs are strummy, acoustic-guitar-driven singalongs. Definitely a
change of pace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Their longtime fans, who have stuck by them through
commercial ups and downs. Be interesting to see if they ditch them
for softening things up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Limp Bizkit &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Unstoppable kings of the rap-rock hill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Chocolate Starfish and the Hot-Dog Flavored Water'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 17 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: More of the same. For whatever reason, kids have
latched onto Limp Bizkit's vanilla-flavored metal-rock hybrid. The
Florida-bred band is certainly not gonna jeopardize its popularity
by changing its sure-thing formula. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Are you kidding? This thing's gonna sell even if it's
an hourlong recording of singer Fred Durst belching. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Madonna &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Pop goddess who constantly reinvents herself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Music'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Tuesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Another ``Ray of Light.'' Madonna's
platinum-plus success with that 1998 techno/dance effort led her
back to ``Light'' producer William Orbit, who tweaked ``Music''
along with dance-music gurus Groove Armada and Mirwais. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Madonna has always toyed with dance music, whether
it's for the charts or the clubs; she has nothing to lose, simply
because she's been making dance music for years, even though it's
often disguised as pop. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Marilyn Manson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Shock/shlock rocker bent on entertaining kids and
enraging their parents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Nov. 14 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Manson's first ``concept album'' about a star
who self-destructs after becoming everything he once despised. No
word yet if it harks back to Manson's industrial days or his more
recent infatuation with glam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Manson is still incredibly popular with a certain
slice of kids _ and he's still a target on the hit lists of certain
keep-America-beautiful organizations. The rest of the world ignores
him. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: Radiohead &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: English rock outfit that blew away critics and fans
alike with its grandiose, art-rock 1997 effort, ``OK, Computer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Kid A'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: A more dreamy, atmospheric effort, with touches
of Brian Eno-esque ambience mixed in with crunchy guitar work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: Everything. This is easily one of the most anticipated
CDs of the year, and if it doesn't live up to ``Computer,'' the
band could lose the stardom it has worked for nearly a decade to
achieve. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: U2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: One of the most intelligent and inventive rock bands
to ever emerge from Ireland, or anywhere else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``All That You Can't Leave Behind'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 31 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: A supposed return to the sparse, guitar-based
sound of their two best discs, ``The Unforgettable Fire'' and ``The
Joshua Tree.'' Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois _ producers of ``Fire''
and ``Tree'' _ are back behind the boards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: When it comes to U2, fans are very forgiving, perhaps
because they know that for every clunker like ``Rattle &AMP; Hum''
there will be a masterpiece, such as ``The Joshua Tree'' or
``Achtung Baby.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who: The Wallflowers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brief bio: Led by Jakob Dylan, son of Bob Dylan, The Wallflowers
have steered clear of emulating Dylan Sr.'s folk leanings. Rather,
the band staked out its own roots-rock turf, adding dark layers
that went over surprisingly well with pop-music listeners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Breach'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out: Oct. 10 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: More introspection. Jakob Dylan has always shied
away from writing biographical songs. On ``Breach,'' he breaks that
tradition, while maintaining the band's trademark sound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At stake: The Wallflowers are yet another band that lives from
disc to disc, and simply can't afford a commercial failure. If this
bombs, they'll be back to playing the Galaxy Club. Yes, they did
once play there. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five other priority-one discs slated for this fall: country
singer Willie Nelson's all-blues foray, ``Milk Cow Blues'' (Sept.
19); boy-band 98 Degrees' latest syrup-coated CD, ``Revelation''
(Sept. 26); world-pop tunesmith Paul Simon's ``You're the One''
(Oct. 3); techno genius Fatboy Slim's ``Halfway Between the Gutter
and the Stars'' (Nov. 7); and the Spice Girls' comeback effort,
``Forever'' (Nov. 7).

ATWOOD'S NEWEST NOVEL CAN BE TOUGH GOING, BUT THEN, SO CAN THE
WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are books that are as comfy as an old pair of jeans, an
easy fit for many readers. Then there are books that raise demands
on readers, like schoolteachers, books that insist that serious
attention be paid, or else.
</P>
<P>
   The latest novel by Margaret Atwood is such a book. Canada's
leading literary figure has produced ``The Blind Assassin'' (Nan A.
Talese/Doubleday, 521 pages, $26). It is a literary afghan made of
a story within a story within a story, three unlikely threads of
narrative woven into a single piece of imposing craftwork. And the
60-year-old Atwood would not have it any other way, as a writer or
as a reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``A story within a story within a story is excessive, but I'm
not writing for people with short attention spans,'' Atwood in a
Seattle interview. ``I'm writing for readers like me who go into a
book and stay with it and like a challenge. Because I believe that
if a book is not risky, not a challenge _ if it's just something
you can do without any thinking or worry _ then it's not what I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``The Blind Assassin'' includes the first-person life story
of one Iris Chase Griffen, a crusty octogenarian who spins forth a
Canadian family story of ``loss and regret and misery and
yearning.'' That alternates with chapters from a steamy 1940s' noir
novel (``The Blind Assassin'') supposedly written by her sister,
Laura, a noir novel that tracks two unnamed lovers through trysts
in seedy rented rooms in hopes of avoiding detection. And within
that noir novel, there is a violent sci-fi saga cooked up by the
male character to entertain his lover during post-passion repose.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that what Atwood once envisioned as a 350-page
novel mushroomed way beyond that. Nor should it surprise that one
early critic, novelist Thomas Mallon in The New York Times Book
Review, has savaged the novel for ``its peculiar blend of low and
high, like a Nancy Drew story written by one of the Brontes.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood declined to respond to that review's criticisms because,
she said, she has not read it (``it was hidden from me by my
assistant''). But mention of that review brought forth the writer's
prickly side, an arch intensity that is the stuff of legend.
Suddenly missing-in-action were Atwood's engaging smiles, witty
asides, easy laughter. In their place was a withering gaze, sharp
words.
</P>
<P>
   Such a review should not even be discussed unless ``the 99 good
reviews are also discussed,'' Atwood insisted, then named some
publications where they have appeared. Any question about that
negative review should be addressed not to her, Atwood added, but
to the review's editor who assigned it to Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the aura of the giant-killer game to this, and it is
not the first time this has happened,'' Atwood emphasized. ``I must
say it is boring to be asked about one review.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject was then dropped, like a microwaved potato, and
Atwood's demeanor brightened when she discussed how engaged she was
by all three stories in ``The Blind Assassin.'' Or how ``everything
is timing'' in a book with so many plot threads, or how alternating
the plots must be done carefully so the author can avoid ``getting
between the reader and the book itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is easier or more difficult for a writer of
Atwood's stature is open to debate. Atwood's work does come with
imposing luggage, from her often-mentioned feminist perspective to
her propensity for Gothic plot elements, from her legions of
fanatic readers (there is a Margaret Atwood Society in Canada with
$10 annual dues) to her prodigiousness as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   She has 15 works of fiction to her credit, along with 13 books
of poetry, plus five works of non-fiction and three books for
children. There is no denying that Atwood is a literary colossus of
formidable dexterity, like John Updike in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit to Seattle was an early stop on an international book
campaign that will crisscross North America, then do the same in
Europe, with Australia, New Zealand and Japan to follow next
spring. This is a taxing (or ``horrifying,'' in Atwood's view)
schedule of readings and public appearances, especially for someone
who is known for being zealous about protecting her private life in
Toronto, other than making brief passing references to her husband
of two decades, writer Graeme Gibson, and their grown daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My private life is so boring,'' Atwood said. ``People would
fall on their faces from the normality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood subjects herself to a book tour's inevitable questions
from interviewers and audiences out of a literary equivalent of
noblesse oblige. She believes it is part of her responsibility as a
hugely successful author to bring in all the money she can to
assist publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is like hockey cards really,'' Atwood said.
``Publishers live off books that sell well and that allows them to
publish young writers and new writers, or writers who do not have
such a high profile.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also why Atwood's appearance before 800 people at First
United Methodist Church in Seattle was a much-appreciated benefit
for Copper Canyon Press, the fine poetry publisher in Port
Townsend. Atwood taught two summers long ago at the writer's
conference there and retains ``many fond memories'' of that place
and Copper Canyon's work.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood read a lengthy passage from ``The Blind Assassin'' before
the large crowd, which seemed to hang on her every word, chuckling
aloud when the author even slightly cocked a pencil-thin eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Atwood answered a half-dozen questions, displaying both
her scissor wit and her cactus side. Those had also surfaced often
during the day when Atwood dealt with those she considers
functionaries of one sort or another: hotel staffers, bookstore
personnel, interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   A man in the audience who asked ``what writers inspire you''
soon found himself installed on the hot seat as Atwood peppered him
with questions, such as ``which century?'' and ``what period?'' and
``men or women?'' She then provided suggestions for further
reading.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchange with this stranger, which at first seemed
light-hearted and humorous, went on and on and soon sunk under the
leaden weight of condescension _ naive innocent vs. brilliant
writer.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, no great contest.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ It took only a few minutes for Chris Witty
to discover she was a prodigy in speed skating. As a 10-year-old in
West Allis, Wis., she entered a 500-meter race wearing her
brother's figure skates. Still, she won so easily that she was
showing the gold medal to her mother by the time the second-place
skater reached the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Having won silver and bronze medals at the 1998 Winter Olympics
in Nagano, Japan, Witty will again be a favorite in the middle
distances at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. First,
however, she will enter the 500-meter cycling time trial on
Saturday at the Sydney Games, attempting to become only the fourth
person to win medals in both the Winter and Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awesome, probably more than I hoped for,'' Witty,
25, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Only one athlete has ever won a gold medal in both Olympics.
Eddie Eagan of Denver took the light-heavyweight boxing title at
the 1920 Summer Games in Antwerp, Belgium; 12 years later, he
finished first as part of the four-man bobsled at the 1932 Winter
Games in Lake Placid, N.Y. Jacob Tullin Thams of Norway won the ski
jump at the 1924 Winter Games in Chamonix, France, and finished
second in the 8-meter sailing competition at the 1936 Summer Games
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic ancestor to Witty was Christa Luding-Rothenburger
of the former East Germany, who won gold medals in speed skating at
the 1984 Sarajevo Games and the 1988 Calgary Olympics, then took a
silver in the cycling 1,000-meter match sprint at the 1988 Summer
Games in Seoul, South Korea. All of her medals have since been
devalued, given revelations about the state-sponsored system of
doping in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare people with East Germans and the system they
came up through,'' said Des Dickie, the American sprint track coach
for cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, speed skaters have long used cycling for
cross-training. The Olympic 500-meter cycling time trial will
consist of two laps around the velodrome. It is not dissimilar to a
500-meter speed skating race. The times are similar, both involve
anaerobic sprints and the athletes are powered by the same primary
muscle groups, quads and glutes. The transfer is one way, however.
Because of the precise technique required, few cyclists take up
speed skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skating technique is not something you can learn in a couple
of years,'' Witty said. ``You have to learn when you're young.
Cycling is more brute strength. If you are fit, you can get on a
bike and smooth out your pedal stroke, and it's possible to get to
the top level.''
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Ballanger of France, the world-record holder at 34.0
seconds in the 500-meter time trial, will be favored in Sydney.
Witty's personal best is 35.5. A second and a half is like an hour
when it comes to races decided by hundredths of a second. If Witty
trained full time for cycling, she would be a consistent medal
contender in international events, Dickie said. She finished fourth
at the 1998 world championships. He ranks her among the top six in
Sydney and hopes for the magic of unexpected triumph that makes the
Olympics so riveting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Olympic skating,'' Witty said. ``You have medal
favorites, and things don't go right, whether they're tense or
something, and someone normally seven through 10 ends up winning
the race or a medal. In the Olympics, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   She speaks from disappointed experience. She had been favored to
win the 1,000 meters in speed skating at the Nagano Games, only to
grow nervous from expectation. Anxious, excited, Witty set an early
pace that was too fast, and even though she won the silver medal,
she felt as if she had squandered her chance.
</P>
<P>
   In cycling, the pressure of expectation is not so bulging as the
pressure in the tires. Perhaps Witty will feel as relaxed in Sydney
as she did at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, when,
as a carefree 18-year-old, she skated a personal best in finishing
23rd in the 1,000-meter race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '98, I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders,''
Witty said. ``Here, it's kind of a mixture. I'm curious to see how
it will go. Will I start to feel tense? Or will I go back to '94,
beginner-type focus, relaxed?''
</P>
<P>
   As a girl, she skated on baseball diamonds in West Allis that
were flooded and frozen, paying a quarter or a half dollar for an
afternoon on the ice. Her promising career seemed as if it might
end when the factory that made agricultural machinery closed and
her father was left without a job. ``We'll find a way,'' her mother
told Chris and her three older brothers. She and her brother Mike
got paper routes. At skating competitions, they overstuffed hotel
rooms to save money.
</P>
<P>
   At 15 or 16, Witty began cross-training on her bike. She won a
bronze medal at the 1992 world junior championships and followed
with national championships in the 500-meter time trial in 1996 and
'98. The time trial was not an Olympic event in 1996, so Witty
bought her own tickets to the Atlanta Games, watching cycling,
diving, soccer and volleyball. This year, she will be sitting on
her bike in the Sydney velodrome instead of sitting in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Witty spent the summer training twice a day for her two sports,
riding her bike and her in-line skates. The biggest difference
between the two? Sunburn, she said. That shouldn't be much of a
problem in the chilly weather of the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I chose this Olympics; it's winter,'' she said with
a laugh.

presented Blair with the most serious domestic crisis of his three

THE CAPTAIN IS BACK: MESSIER, NEARING 40, RETURNS TO DIRECT
RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Between most hockey players, it would have
been just a routine encounter in the corridor on the first day of
training camp. But Mark Messier is not like most players. Even his
small gestures carry nuance and significance.
</P>
<P>
   So when Petr Nedved walked by the seated Messier, tapped him on
his padded leg and used the nickname ``Mess'' as his pleasant
greeting, you couldn't help notice that Messier responded by
looking up toward Nedved and saying, in his deep voice, ``Hey, how
are ya?'' in a friendly sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   When these two centers first played together on the Rangers, in
1994-95, Messier doubted Nedved's competitive fire, despite
Nedved's elite talent. Messier's animosity resulted in Nedved's
trade to Pittsburgh. In a game soon after that, Messier speared
Nedved. As time passed, Messier left New York in 1997 for three
seasons in Vancouver; Nedved returned to the Rangers in a trade in
1998; and Messier also came back, this time as an unrestricted free
agent in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   How Messier interacts with Nedved _ and just about everyone else
in the organization _ will affect this season's comprehensive
attempt to revive the Rangers, who have missed the playoffs in the
three seasons of Messier's exile. So far, the vibrations are good,
and Nedved is the personification of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's water under the bridge,'' Nedved said, referring to their
past difficulties. ``I was happy that the Rangers signed him. I'm
looking forward to working with him and playing with him. He's
going to make our team that much more dangerous. He's a great
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Nedved, Messier said he had researched the subject by
talking with Adam Graves, Mike Richter and Brian Leetch, the only
three Rangers remaining from the 1994 team that Messier led to the
Stanley Cup. Those veterans praised Nedved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here who has seen him play over the past couple
years can admire his courage, his heart,'' Messier said of Nedved.
``He was battered from pillar to post without receiving the proper
protection a player of his caliber should. He has played hard, game
in and game out.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier, Nedved, Graves, Leetch and Richter should make up
one-quarter of the 20-man roster being shaped by Glen Sather, the
new general manager, and Ron Low, the new coach. And the presence
of Sather and Low should suit Messier, whose disapproval of past
coaches has led to their dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Sather was the young general manager and coach in Edmonton when
Messier broke into the National Hockey League as an 18-year-old
rookie in 1979. Low was a veteran goalie then, assigned by Sather
to be Messier's roommate on the road. Low watched him develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was a pretty rawboned kid at that time,'' Low recalled
after practice the other day at Gutterson Field House. ``He did a
lot of pretty crazy things as a player. He made some horrific
mistakes in his own end. But you could always count on him coming
back and doing something in the other end _ the good end. He was
never afraid to take a chance, to try something.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier is not so raw anymore and he is definitely not a kid. He
is 6 feet 1 inch and listed as 210 pounds, although he appears
heavier. Still bold, he is much balder and much older, among the
senior athletes in professional sports. Messier will celebrate his
40th birthday in January, midway through his 22nd NHL season. He is
the only player still active from the World Hockey Association,
which folded in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In training camp, Messier appears to be gradually working
himself into shape. In a scrimmage on Monday, Nedved's line
dominated Messier's line with skating speed and puck movement.
Perhaps this was a meaningless workout, but it also encouraged
speculation about how much Messier has left. He left Tuesday's
practice early with a sore groin; the injury is not serious.
</P>
<P>
   In his final season with the Rangers, Messier scored 36 goals.
In three seasons with Vancouver, he accumulated only 52. Despite
changes of coaches, general managers and players, some of them
urged by Messier, the Canucks never made the playoffs while he was
their captain.
</P>
<P>
   They could have kept Messier this season, but they chose to buy
out his option and let him leave with no compensation. For the
Canadian Olympic team of 1998, Messier was not selected. Although
his age, diminishing production, dominant personality and $5.5
million salary would make Messier an awkward fit with some teams
now, the Rangers talk as if they are the right team at the right
time, just as they were in 1991 when he first came to New York from
Edmonton at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have him back where I think he belongs,'' said
Leetch, who gave back the captain's ``C'' to Messier. ``The Ranger
jersey looks the best on him. I never really lost hope. It's going
to be a big boost to a lot of veterans around here. He's a
one-of-a-kind person, and he certainly wears his emotions on his
sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this is true: He epitomizes hockey passion. Think of
Messier images over the years: stretching back his head and
laughing to celebrate six Stanley Cup championships, five of them
with Edmonton; or glaring, shouting and swinging at opponents
during angry confrontations on ice; or wiping tears from his eyes
in a Vancouver uniform during his first return to Madison Square
Garden in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never really wanted to leave New York,'' Leetch said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did depart after a contract tiff with Neil Smith, the
former general manager, and Dave Checketts, the president of the
Garden. They felt Messier had become overbearing. His departure
seemed to sap the spirit of Leetch, Richter and Graves. Recently,
in a Burlington restaurant, Messier, Richter and Leetch could be
seen dining and discussing the team's past, present and future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems the same,'' Richter said of Messier. ``Mark brings an
awful lot to this locker room. And that comes down to character. We
need it.'' But even a disciple like Richter senses some unease.
``At this point in his career, with the type of player that he is,
it's not easy to jump teams,'' Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways outside the locker rooms, Messier's presence
dominates the mood. He exudes relaxed authority. Rookies like Jamie
Lundmark, from junior teams, and minor-league hopefuls like Dale
Purinton follow Messier with their eyes as he makes his casual
rounds. And people instinctively step aside when Messier walks
past, just as players do when he skates on the ice. Sandy McCarthy,
a fistfighting expert acquired over the summer, discussed how
Messier intimidates opponents without having to throw punches the
way he once did.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows he's big and tough and you are going to get
something if you mess around with him, if not a stick, an elbow,''
McCarthy said. ``That's why he gets room on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Physical intimidation was one of the topics Messier addressed
while standing near the door to the coach's room for a news
conference. ``Toughness and sticking up for each other is something
that comes from within a team,'' Messier said. ``It does not come
from individuals. Part of the problem last year was the team was
fragmented, for whatever reason. The other team can sense it. They
know you are not together and you are not willing to fight for each
other. The whole situation last year got to be in such a downward
spiral that it really just spun out of control for everybody.
Nobody really knew where to turn to or what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said players must abide by a ``code of loyalty'' that
keeps internal discord private. This applied particularly to
Stephane Quintal, a defenseman suspended late last season for
saying he would like to leave the Rangers. Messier has granted
Quintal his forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing for Stephane is to realize he made
a mistake,'' Messier said. ``He put the integrity of the
organization in jeopardy and it had to be dealt with and it was
dealt with.'' According to Quintal, Messier told him: ``Don't worry
about it. Go have fun.'' They should play golf or have lunch,
Messier told Quintal.
</P>
<P>
   Messier understands mistakes: even he makes them, Messier said,
``I've made plenty of mistakes in my career and so has everyone
else, and I'll continue to make mistakes.'' He said he puts them
behind and lives in the present. And he also told the reporters
that they, too, were part of his equation for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to shed a good light for the public through the
media,'' Messier said. ``We need to be as open and as honest as we
possibly can. We want to be proud of ourselves on and off the ice.
And the way to do that is for us to handle the media properly so
that we convey a good message. Obviously, we did a good job of that
in the years I was here. And it's important to get back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also chatted casually about returning to Manhattan and
seeking an apartment on the Upper West Side. Prices are way up in
this prosperous era, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the day drew to a close, a black Jeep pulled up near the
locker room door, his special transport to the nearby hotel through
the crowd of fans waiting for autographs. Some of them wore blue
and white Ranger jerseys with the name Messier and his number 11 on
the back. The charismatic man who once guaranteed a victory in a
crucial playoff game was not making any grand promises for the
first season of his second coming to New York. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not coming back with the idea that things are going to be
the same,'' Messier said. ``In a way, it's good. It keeps it
exciting. Things will be different, but I think different in a good
way. We want to win. The sooner the better.''

SOURCEBOOK REVEALS SOME OF THE WIZARDRY BEHIND `HARRY POTTER'
BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scratch the surface of J.K. Rowling's entertaining ``Harry
Potter'' tales and you'll find classical and mythical allusions,
historical references and wordplay that many of Rowling's 35
million-plus readers have yet to discover, says the author of the
first comprehensive sourcebook on the boy wizard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her books are so exciting. There's just so much there,'' says
Elizabeth D. Schafer, whose ``Exploring Harry Potter'' is the lead
title in a new series called ``Beacham's Sourcebooks for Teaching
Young Adult Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schafer believes Rowling, a former teacher and classics major,
knew exactly what she was doing when she laced her stories with
character names and plot devices that draw on classical themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of fun,'' Schafer said in an interview, ``like
she put (this dimension) in the text and hoped readers would
discover it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploring Harry Potter'' (Beacham Publishing, 479 pages,
$24.95) is out this week. Like the ``Potter'' series itself, it
became a best seller weeks ahead of its release. By early August,
600,000 copies were on advance order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially,'' said publisher Walton Beacham, ``we thought it
would be great if we sold 50,000 copies.''
</P>
<P>
   Added company publicist Jim Miller, ``You cannot overestimate
the interest in `Harry Potter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Margin decorations and small drop-in illustrations give the book
an inviting look, but it's essentially a straightforward reference
tool for kids, parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not imagine kids reading it cover to cover,'' Schafer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming installments will focus on C.S. Lewis' ``Narnia''
series and L. Frank Baum's ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Schafer, incidentally, sees parallels between ``Harry Potter''
and the ``Oz'' series, which was the publishing phenomenon of the
early 20th century. She notes that Baum opened each tale with a
letter thanking children for their loyal readership and their many
cards and notes.
</P>
<P>
   The Potter sourcebook includes a biographical sketch of Rowling
and detailed discussion of virtually all aspects of the novels,
from their emphasis on food and sports to the allegation _ which
Schafer disputes _ that the books promote witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Rowling says, and I agree, is that the books are very
moral,'' Schafer said, ``and good does prevail over evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing we learn is that Schafer's tome is ``NOT
Approved by J.K. Rowling.'' Publicist Miller said the
above-the-title disclaimer grew out of negotiations with Scholastic
Inc., Rowling's American publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached an agreement that we can publish this book (with
the disclaimer) and they won't try to sue us,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Search the Web and you'll find a grab bag of sites devoted to
amateur analysis of the ``Harry Potter'' books, complete with
literary allusions and online links. But the Beacham guide gains
credibility from Schafer's credentials _ a doctorate in the history
of science and technology and a graduate-studies award for critical
scholarship of children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer, who lives near Auburn, Ala., says the strength of
``Exploring Harry Potter'' is its comprehensiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a wide variety of topics, and I hit it all in one
place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer will analyze future Potter books on the Beacham Web
site, www.beachampublishing.com. The site contains her analysis of
Book IV, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' which was
published after the sourcebook went to press.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schafer's critique of the series is overwhelmingly
favorable, she does pick a few bones, though she doesn't go as far
as Yale professor Harold Bloom. His scathing essay in the July 11
Wall Street Journal said the books lack an authentic imaginative
vision, are heavy on cliche and make no demands on readers.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Schafer admires the Potter series, she, too, faults
Rowling's tendency to cover well-trod ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is derivative, and it is (full of) stereotyped cliches,''
Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she mentioned Rowling's continuing focus on
obesity as a defining characteristic of Harry's disagreeable cousin
Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Harry's friend, Hermione, has strong academic
skills and a highly developed sense of right and wrong, but her
behavior in the first three books also ``perpetuates stereotypical
images of females being moody, fickle and unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Schafer was especially disappointed that Hermione, who took a
leading role in brewing the Polyjuice Potion and solving part of
the mystery in Book II (``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban''), was sidelined from further adventure by being turned
into a cat and then petrified like Sleeping Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did upset me when Hermione was absent during the whole
adventure,'' she said. ``Hermione could be such a good role model
for girls, and it is frustrating to see her not be a part of
everything and solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while social themes such as racism and fair treatment are
an important element of the books _ Rowling worked for Amnesty
International in college as a researcher on human rights in Africa
_ her characterizations do tend to reinforce ethnic stereotypes,
Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Goblet of Fire,'' for instance, Rowling describes the
Bulgarian quidditch champ as surly and heavy-browed, and she
portrays the French wizardry students as snobbish.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it doesn't kill the stories, but I wish she could have
developed the characterizations without having to rely on those
descriptions or those cliches,'' Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sourcebook's most intriguing features is a historical
timeline in which Schafer shows what was happening in the real
world as the novels' fictional events unfolded. For instance,
sandwiched between the death of King James II during the siege of
Roxburgh Castle (Aug. 3, 1460) and the beginning of the Spanish
Inquisition (1478), is the entry: ``1473: World Cup Quidditch match
in which all 700 fouls occurred.'' Asterisks indicate which entries
are fictional.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said she apparently is the first to notice that Harry's
tenure at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry begins in
1991, which makes him an adult in present time. She bases that
conclusion on Book II's Halloween Deathday Party to commemorate the
500th anniversary of Nearly Headless Nick's semi-beheading in 1492.
Schafer extrapolates from this and other clues that Harry's birth
date is July 31, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The book's final section includes a teaching guide with plot
summaries, discussion questions and suggested activities. Example:
``Discuss the roles of scars and physical markings, both permanent
and temporary, in literature.''
</P>
<P>
   When best-selling, escapist fun turns into homework, can
disillusionment be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said she doubts school assignments will break the
series' spell, since many kids already write lengthy Internet
analyses of ``Harry Potter.'' Despite a few flaws, she said the
saga enchants through its use of humor, mystery, intricate plot
twists and archetypal themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just really good reads,'' Schafer said. ``I didn't
want to bash the books, because if kids are so excited about them,
maybe it'll open up doors and lead them to other things. If I had
to sum up the books, I'd say they're fun more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``I hope people are open to realizing just
because a book's popular and published, doesn't mean it's
perfect.''

 DISCOVERING DINOSAURS ON 2 CD-ROMs  
 (Circuits)  
 (editors: product notes at end of reviews)  
 Alice Keim, a teacher, is the technology coordinator for the Horace
Mann Lower School in New York  
 By ALICE KEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before Barney sank his purple talons into preschoolers,
dinosaurs fascinated children. Fortunately for parents, the study
of dinosaurs can develop important scientific inquiry skills in
young students, and the academic appeal lasts long after children
learn to distinguish Hollywood fiction from fact.
</P>
<P>
   I had high expectations for ``I See Sue'', a CD-ROM game
developed with The Field Museum of Chicago and based on Sue, the
largest and most complete Tyrannosaurus Rex ever discovered. Sue
was found in South Dakota 10 years ago and went on display in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the Field Museum's Web site (www.thefieldmuseum.com/)
provided more extensive and educational information on Sue and her
environment than the CD-ROM itself.
</P>
<P>
   The disk starts with a catchy jingle and flashes some dinosaur
images as a song explains the game. The program then shows a main
menu screen with four levels of difficulty, sound options and
whether to play against the computer or a friend. Square
color-coded game tiles appear in the bottom third of the screen,
each featuring the head, tail or body of a specific dinosaur. The
object of the game is to match the parts to complete a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   After you match three tiles, a completed dinosaur moves along a
trail. There are shortcuts for some species. If they have wings
they can fly over part of the trail, and if they are light and
graceful they can take a log bridge. The first player to complete
the trail is rewarded with a picture of Sue and a dinosaur drawing
to print out and color. Facts on each dinosaur are presented in
clever rhyming sentences that, if re-enforced throughout the
program, could have helped players retain information.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the game is buried in its limitations. Names and facts
are in audio only, and young users will have trouble remembering
them. There is a help screen, but it only offers pictures of each
dinosaur and details like ``crosses log bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   For a game based on one of the most exciting modern dinosaur
discoveries, ``I See Sue'' is anti-climatic. After finishing the
trail, the player gets to see a bit of Sue accompanied by some
uninspiring animation. The real Sue deserves better.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, DK's ``Dinosaur Hunter Deluxe'' is buried
treasure. The program has two main sections: a virtual museum and
3D environments representing the environments in which the
dinosaurs lived. The environments are interesting, but the museum,
an interactive environment with exhibits and activities, brings
more than 50 species of dinosaurs to life, is a gem.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual visitor can wander the dark museum halls and follow
a time line through the Jurassic, Triassic and Cretaceous periods.
Along the way they can learn about specific dinosaurs and their
characteristics through videos, displays and puzzles. The central
exhibit hall, The Arena, provides extensive information about
Dinosaur anatomy and behavior. The second main exhibit area focuses
on the discovery, including information on where and how dinosaur
fossils were found and details about great discoverers.
</P>
<P>
   The program has brilliant explanations of the dinosaur's
characteristics and behavioral habits. For example, many of the
explanations combine animation with video of modern animals. A
section on how ancient herbivores chewed uses clips of camels to
demonstrate a circular grinding motion and reptiles using an up and
down movement, and then uses animation to show a dinosaur jaw in
motion, which looks like a combination of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also go to the Dinosaur Excavation Site, a room
that features The Excavator, which is a virtual machine that allows
the user to uncover bones of dinosaur species. First, the user
chooses a species to complete and then reads about the dinosaur's
history. Next the visitor excavates several layers and uses tools
to find the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Bones can be identified by relative age, body part and shape.
The dig is not particularly difficult, but it requires patience to
search through the layers. Once all the bones are recovered, the
dinosaur comes to life and roams the museum corridors. The program
features wonderful graphics and explanatory animation. Young
dinosaur fans will delight in their prehistoric encounters here.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the museum, visitors go to the Museum Store.
While the very name may have parents clutching their wallets, the
area offers free program accessories. Shoppers can download images
and sounds to their hard drives, or print out masks, stationary and
postcards. I enjoyed the jukebox where you could hear the sounds of
12 dinosaurs. The museum products are an excellent way to extend
the activities beyond the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur Hunter Deluxe'' is full of information and
educational activities, but navigating the program was frustrating.
For example, I found myself going in circles as I searched for the
excavation area. There is a help section that explains each area of
the museum, but this did not get me where I wanted to go. The halls
feel like the corridors of a true natural history museum but,
sadly, without the guards to guide you.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the late 19th century, when Westerners began
trading extensively with China, there have been established wealthy
collectors seeking Chinese antiques. But in the last 10 years, a
group of younger, less affluent collectors has emerged. ``There are
two separate markets,'' said James Godfrey, the director for
Chinese works of art at Sotheby's auction house in Manhattan.
``There are buyers of classical furniture _ 16th-, 17th- and
18th-century material of huanghuali and zitan,'' two of the most
sought-after hardwoods. (In 1996, a 17th-century Chinese huanghuali
and marble screen sold for $1.1 million at Christie's.)
</P>
<P>
   The second market is for furniture made of camphor, elm,
ironwood or bamboo, said Theow H. Tow, the international director
for Chinese works of art at Christie's. Next week is Asia Week for
Sotheby's and Christie's, who will be offering Chinese camphor, elm
and bamboo furniture that has brought estimates from $4,000 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, said Lark E. Mason Jr., the director for online
auctions at Sothebys.com, he saw little Chinese furniture outside
of New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. This year, he said, he
saw it being sold in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture made of camphor, bamboo and elm, along with simple
domestic objects like lacquered water jugs and ceramic planters,
are coveted by young collectors. For many, the minimalist, simple
lines of Chinese pieces work in a modern interior.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Didik, a producer of CD-ROMs, who is in his 30s, grew up
with parents who revered Asian things, and inherited this passion
rather like a gene. This year, Didik brought home to Brooklyn a
1905 Chinese chair that he bought for $1,200 from Xiaoping Cao, who
sells antiques and her interpretations of Chinese furniture in her
Soho shop. ``The simplistic design can blend with modern pieces,''
Didik said. ``You can't do that with Louis XVI.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others begin collecting Chinese furniture after going to
China. Mary Peng, who sells $50 Chinese wedding baskets and $3,500
Chinese antiques out of her Manhattan loft, said, ``The younger
collectors are seasoned travelers in their 20s, coming back to the
United States, who want to purchase the furniture they had seen
overseas, and who know that antiques don't have to be $10,000 to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tish Durkin, a reporter for The New York Observer, went to
Beijing in 1995 to cover the World Conference on Women, she went to
an antiques market in search of a souvenir. Instead, she bought a
chicken coop/vegetable bin made of camphor wood; it stood 6 feet
tall, and was 39 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this thing,'' said Durkin, who is in her 30s and has
studied Chinese language and history. ``It was so solid. I love
Chinese language, and there are the characters for spring, summer,
winter and fall carved in the four little doors.'' The price was
$150. Cheaper than a halogen lamp, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   For Audrey Wu, a corporate events specialist in her 30s, who
works at Fulcrum Information Services in Manhattan, collecting
Chinese furniture began spontaneously. She was at an aunt's house
in Manhattan, saw a small wood Chinese kitchen cabinet, and said
something innocuous like ``Oh, what a cute piece of furniture.''
Her aunt gave it to her. The next year, Wu went to Shanghai and met
Annly Chyn, a furniture dealer, who took her to her warehouse
filled with chests, tables, chairs and screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dusty, moldy and fading,'' said Wu, who saw chests
painted with hunters and dragons in a background of golden mist,
and promptly bought one for $300.
</P>
<P>
   Like Didik, Michael Stark, 29, an actor and graphic designer in
Manhattan, grew up in a family that loved all things Chinese. His
grandfather, Alexander Stark, who lived in Denver, collected
Chinese and Japanese art and furniture, and kept it in a private
room (no children allowed). Stark now collects small Chinese wood
chests fitted with bronze, while nurturing the desire to buy a
Chinese table someday.
</P>
<P>
   Mason of Sothebys.com has some advice for neophyte collectors.
``Think in terms of what you can use in your own home, because it's
tough to be a furniture collector of things you can't use,'' he
said. ``Second, think in terms of classic forms.'' As for the
lacquered box or bamboo basket, ``it can be fragile if you're
considering using a basket for magazines,'' he said. And finally,
he said, ``Look for dynamism.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   TREASURES OLD AND NEW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Chinese furniture will be auctioned at Christie's and
Sotheby's. There are also shops where baskets and cabinets (many of
them restored) can be bought at reasonable prices. When you buy an
antique, ``you are not going to find a perfect piece of
furniture,'' said Theow H. Tow, the international director for
Chinese works of art at Christie's, ``because in every category _
French, English or Chinese _ these things were used and have a part
that's been replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIE'S, 20 Rockefeller Plaza. The Chinese auction will be
Thursday, Sept. 21, at 10 a.m. and at 2 p.m. Information: (212)
636-2000.
</P>
<P>
   SOTHEBY'S, 1334 York Ave. (72nd Street). The Chinese auction
will be Wednesday, Sept. 20, starting at 10:15 a.m. Information:
(212) 606-7332.
</P>
<P>
   XIAOPING DESIGN, 73 Hudson St. (Worth Street). Xiaoping Cao
sells antiques and her own interpretations of Chinese furniture. A
new garden bench starts at $400. Information: (212) 962-4080 or

OUR NEW MOVIE CRITIC PANS CYNICAL REVIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was announced that I was going to be the new film critic
for the Star-Telegram, I found myself answering a lot of the same
questions. ``What have you seen recently that you liked?'' (It was
a disappointing summer, but ``The Perfect Storm,'' with its
dazzling wave effects, qualifies as a major guilty pleasure);
``What are your favorite movies of all time?'' (I have lots of
favorites, but lately I've been citing ``A Hard Day's Night,'' Bob
Fosse's ``All That Jazz,'' and Alan Parker's ``Shoot the Moon'');
``Is there anything good coming out?'' (Watch for ``Billy Elliot,''
a British charmer about a young boy who wants to be a ballet
dancer.)
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, though, I'm asked more-general questions _ for
instance, ``What kind of movies do you like?'' or ``What sort of
things do you look for when you're evaluating a movie?'' And it's
here I run into a bit of trouble explaining myself.
</P>
<P>
   Like every other film critic, I have my quirks: I have a soft
spot for certain genres (domestic melodramas, children's films); a
handful of working directors (Jonathan Demme, Todd Haynes, David
Cronenberg) command my attention on even their worst days; and, as
a general rule, I tend to get irritated with movies that
prominently feature either junkies (''Trainspotting,'' ``Jesus'
Son'') or self-declared mutes (''The Piano,'' ``Little Voice'').
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such particulars don't really tell you much about how
I go about doing my job. In which case, I should probably tell you
how I don't go about doing my job _ and explain why I think too
many critics and filmgoers close themselves off to the pleasures
that movies, and movie criticism, can offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, an alarming number of American film
critics have adopted a doomsayer's pose. Of course, critics have
always bellyached that there aren't any good movies out there, but
more recently their ire has been directed at the audience. In two
widely-read essays, in The New York Times Magazine and The New
Yorker, respectively, Susan Sontag and David Denby both argued that
the real problem with our film culture is not the lack of great
movies, but the fact that an audience no longer exists for
challenging, original filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's sentiments like these that leave many moviegoers
feeling alienated from critics. I know that's the way I often feel.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for example, I saw ``The Sixth Sense'' a week after
it opened in theaters, and after having already been told by a
number of my colleagues that, as clever as the film was, the old
``Twilight Zone'' TV series covered the same material far more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore the fact that I disagreed completely; it was, for my
money, one of the very best films of last year. What troubled me
most was how so many critics seemed uninterested in treating the
film as seriously as, say, the French film ``The Dreamlife of
Angels'' _ another film about mortality and emotional anxiety.
Troubling, too, was the fact that so few critics seemed interested
in going back to the film, and trying to understand why it struck
such a chord with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of critics will lazily suggest that audiences aren't
interested in such dialogue _ that their attention is focused not
on what they've just seen, but on which blockbuster they're going
to see next. I don't agree. Every day, I overhear or participate in
conversations (often with complete strangers) about movies _ recent
and old, obscure and popular _ at the video store, in line at the
bank, while shopping for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   So why are critics so jaded? And why has such a vast disconnect
developed between critics and their readership? The real problem
may be that our film culture looks stranger and more diverse than
it ever has before, especially since the explosion of independent
cinema in the early 1990s and, more recently, with the advent of
new technology. In any given week, you'll see movies that reinvent
filmmaking technique (''Three Kings,'' ``Timecode'') alongside
films that offer nothing but empty technique (''Mission: Impossible
2''), startlingly original films that seem piped in from outer
space (''Holy Smoke,'' ``South Park'') alongside startlingly banal
films that you wish could be shipped off to space (''The Green
Mile'').
</P>
<P>
   In which case, to a lot of people, the resulting film landscape
may look like nothing more than an ungainly _ and doomed _ mess.
The fact that an audience seems to exist for both the original
movies and the wretched ones might further suggest that the
audience just doesn't care what they see. But I like to think it
means that a critic simply has to work harder to sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   We do live in an increasingly speeded-up era, where movies zip
into and out of theaters, and onto and off the pop culture radar,
at a rate that can be exhausting. A critic's main job, then, is to
be the one who does keep up, and who helps readers figure out
what's worth keeping up on. But I also think it's the critic's job
to slow things down a bit _ to hold on to a movie that's
disappearing too fast, to question the value of a film that won't
seem to go away, and to try to figure out which direction the art
form is headed next.
</P>
<P>
   As film critic for the Star-Telegram, I can't promise I'll
always be right in my estimations. I can't even promise I'm always
going to be fair (especially if there is a mute involved). But I do
promise to convey, as accurately and honestly as I know how, why I
think movies still have life in them. And why I think the process
of thinking and talking and arguing about them can sometimes be the
most entertaining part of the show.

 &HT;    Dances with dogs
 &HT;    By Ryan Rahe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Usually reserved for two-legged athletes during
summer sports camps, Camp
</P>
<P>
   America, located just outside of Hueston Woods State Park in
southwest Ohio, recently was home to a unique camp designed for
four-legged friends.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years Becky and Corkey Campbell have been
running their special breed of dog camp at the facility. The camp
is designed so that dogs and their owners can enjoy activities
together and learn, hands-on, new training techniques with
practical everyday uses.
</P>
<P>
   Each day of the three-day event provides many different
exercises and activities for dogs and their trainers. Activities
such as herding, water games, obstacle courses and agility tests
are held during the morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon the dogs get a rest while their owners attend
various lectures on topics ranging from innovations in obedience
training to dog chiropractics and massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shape behavior through positive methods. We don't use any
negative reinforcement,'' said Becky Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The positive method approach seemed to be the underlying message
at the dog camp. By teaching your dog to obey you through positive
methods, such as rewards and positive verbal reinforcement, a
trainer develops a better rapport with the dog, and eventually a
friendship built on mutual respect and trust, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tucker and his wife, Leigh Ann, were in attendance at this
year's camp to give lessons on sheep herding. Paul, along with his
dog Craig, has won many awards for sheep herding including the Ohio
Valley Dog of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   This year Craig is in fourth place for Ohio Valley Dog of The
Year, despite the fact that he is almost 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Paul is very competitive with his dogs, the
competition at the camp is rather nonexistent. There are awards
given for various events, but the main point is to let the dogs
have fun. Even if a dog is not a purebred herding dog, or maybe
even 10 times smaller than the sheep, Paul will still let them have
an opportunity to try their ``paw'' at sheep herding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only bring experienced sheep, so that they know what to do
even if the dogs don't,'' said Leigh Ann Tucker. ``The purpose is
not to make a sheep dog out of a poodle, it's to let a poodle see
what it's like to be a sheep dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many lecturers in attendance this year was Leslie
Nelson, one the most prominent names in the country for animal
obedience. Nelson spoke about advanced dog training techniques.
Nelson continued the theme of positive reinforcement in her lecture
telling people that the more they force their dog to obey the less
the dog will enjoy activities with them.
</P>
<P>
   A new event this year at the camp is something Darla Paganini
likes to call ``Dancing With Dogs.'' This is like free-style
gymnastics with your dog. The owner and the dog work on a dance
routine set to music and often involving costumes. Darla and her
dog do a routine to the song ``The Lion Sleeps Tonight.'' Darla
wears a safari uniform, her dog a lion costume. They even complete
the event with a bow.
</P>
<P>
   The event that seemed to be enjoyed by the dogs the most was the
lure course.
</P>
<P>
   At this event, basically the dogs chase a white bag around a
field. The bag, or ``bunny'' as it is referred to, is placed on a
wire and run by a generator.
</P>
<P>
   The bag is kept in constant motion, just inches in front of the
dog. ``This is an event just about any dog can do with little or no
training,'' said Corkey Campbell. ``What dog doesn't like to chase
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a camp where you can come and bring your dog to
sample just about everything that is going on either professionally
or for fun,'' said Corkey.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what the camp is, a great place to bring you
dog to have
</P>
<P>
   fun. The camp is open to all dogs and owners.

   Fall is one of the best seasons in New England. There are still
lots of warm and sunny days, the crowds have left the popular
tourist areas, all attractions, restaurants, and resorts are open,
and, best of all, it's the most colorful season, not just from
foliage but also from festivals.
</P>
<P>
   If you have even a hint of Scottish blood, an event next weekend
is one not to miss. It's the 25th anniversary for the New Hampshire
Highland Games Friday through Sunday at Loon Mountain in New
Hampshire. The games have grown to become the largest Scottish
cultural festival in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more than just ``games'' at this festival. On
Saturday, 39 pipe bands will be performing at noon and 5:30 p.m.
And at 5 p.m. the first-ever Grade One Challenge of the top pipe
bands in the country _ the Los Angeles Scots and the City of
Washington band _ will be held. On Friday evening, Battlefield
Band, Scotland's favorite, will perform, and other musical events
will be held throughout the weekend. There also will be
whisky-tasting seminars, exhibits by more than 60 clans and
societies, dancing, dinners, 20 Scottish food outlets, tartan and
genealogical workshops, athletic events, a sheepdog competition, a
Highland dance championship, and lots of children's activities.

   One of America's most accessible national parks, Shenandoah,
just two hours from Washington, D.C., features some grand fall
colors and the scenic Skyline Drive, a spectacular 105-mile
journey. It's a road with a posted speed of 35 miles an hour, and
for good reason _ its a road for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to take your time and look for white-tailed deer,
black bear and bobcats, wild turkey, owls, and more than 200 other
bird species. The park's 196,000 acres include more than 100
varieties of trees, 200 species of birds, and 1,100 flowering
plants. Foliage in the park usually peaks between Oct. 5 and 25 In
addition to its natural wonders, the park includes a presidential
retreat that can be visited. Camp Rapidan was built by President
Herbert Hoover as a retreat, for himself and future presidents.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt instead built Camp David, which has
been used by all presidents since. Hoover donated the camp to the
National Park Service, which is now restoring it to its original
1931 appearance. For information on lodging, dining, and other

   ``I never saw a place where morality and huckleberries
flourished as they do here,'' wrote Mark Twain about Hartford in
1868. Twain made his home in Hartford from 1871 to 1891, his most
productive years. Now there is a free brochure, ``Mark Twain's
Hartford,'' listing 17 sites associated with the author. While the
first place to visit is his home, now a National Historic Landmark,
the guide ``offers opportunities for outdoor recreation, shopping,
and dining, for a day or a weekend,'' said David Bush of the Mark
Twain House. For a copy, call 860-247-0998, ext. 40, e-mail

THE SILVER LINING IN EMPTY NESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., N.C., Conn., Pa., Calif., Mass., Minn., Mo.)   By DEBORAH BALDWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago, we packed our daughter's sneakers,
CDs, laptop and rice cooker and drove her to college, doing our bit
to contribute to the biggest youth exodus since Woodstock. During
the weeks bracketing Labor Day, more than 13 million students
enrolled as college undergraduates, the first loud rumblings of a
baby boom echo that will have social ramifications for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Personal ramifications, too. Imagine our pangs the first time we
caught a glimpse of our daughter's new home, where vegan is the
preferred diet, ``clothing optional'' is a regular event and party
invitations hang in hallways next to envelopes of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Turning back toward New York in a rental van suddenly grown
still, we wondered how our parents ever adjusted to life as
proprietors of empty nests.
</P>
<P>
   Then we had an epiphany: we hadn't lost a daughter _ we had
gained a room.
</P>
<P>
   When offspring leave, it creates a hole in the household, both
physical and psychological. ``It means a whole stage of your life
is over,'' said one mother of three, Audrey Goldsmith Kubie, who
has kept her oldest daughter's bedroom pretty much intact since her
daughter enrolled at Duke University, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in cities where space is often in short
supply, the departure of college-bound offspring opens up some
valuable real estate. ``At first I just used his desk,'' said Dr.
Jeannette Lofas, a family therapist, recalling the thrill of found
space in her Manhattan apartment when her son left for college.
</P>
<P>
   Careful to respect borders, she resisted opening drawers and
poking around. ``Then I moved in my PC,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he graduated, the takeover was a fait accompli, and
the boy's bedroom no longer contained a bed. When her son
boomeranged back temporarily after college, she cast about for a
new place to put him and finally found it ``in a back room.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Burg, a New York writer, though careful not to let the
words ``what I could get for this if I put it on the open market''
pass her lips in front of her son, started mentally overhauling the
space he left over Labor Day weekend, when he entered Skidmore as a
freshman. During his last two years of high school, he had been
living in a studio apartment that is part of the family's co-op.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving it vacant, that's insane,'' said Burg, picturing its
potential as a guest room. She did suggest that he ``tidy up''
before taking off. Instead, he staked his turf (and temporarily
ruined it for anyone else) by leaving his shoes and other debris
all over the floor, ``as if Vesuvius exploded and then it was
frozen in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate, a number of psychologists and family therapists
explained, often has an emotional subtext.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home is not only Mom and Dad, it's your room, too,'' said Dr.
Harold S. Koplewicz, a child psychiatrist and director of the Child
Study Center at New York University. He still remembers his little
sister trying to seize his bedroom when he left New York for the
University of Maryland 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separation is one of the major tasks of adolescence,'' he
added. ``One thing we would counsel is, don't call the decorator
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   My parents didn't call a decorator, but they didn't have to. The
day after my college acceptance letter arrived, one of my brothers
appeared in the doorway of my 9-by-9 suburban bedroom, carrying his
collection of Rex Stout paperbacks and eyeing some display space
where my mother and I had hung a single roll of French wallpaper.
He was squeezed into shared quarters and thought my monastic single
would be an excellent place to spread his wings, the sooner the
better. During school holidays I moved in with my sister. I've
repressed the details.
</P>
<P>
   At least my parents stayed put (the wallpaper, pocked with my
brother's nail holes, hangs on). There are those parents who take
what one psychologist termed the passive-aggressive route: While a
child is away, they move.
</P>
<P>
   Every generation has to cope with the big handoff. What makes
this year's high school graduates different is their commitment to
higher education _ 65 percent will attend college, according to the
U.S. Department of Education _ and their large numbers. Reflecting
a growth spurt expected to peak around 2009, about 4 million
Americans turn 18 this year, up from about 3.3 million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents retain warm memories of coming home during their
raucous college years to comforting pink chenille bedspreads or,
more recently, ``Star Wars'' posters and Nirvana ticket stubs.
Bryan Burkhart, a co-author of ``Airstream: A History of the Land
Yacht'' (Chronicle Books), said he loved returning to San Diego
well into his 20s and finding ``no real changes except for the
sheets on the bed.'' His parents not only kept his younger siblings
at bay but maintained this historic site until he was 30, ``all
mine,'' he noted proudly, ``archaeologically speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The shrine syndrome can indicate other problems. Dr. David
Lowenstein, a family therapist, said he sees many couples who
preserve rooms as an emblem of a time when they didn't have to talk
about (or even to) each other. Fragile marriages, he said, often
crack under the strain of silence. ``They have done a great job as
parents and forgotten how to be husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually most fledglings need an assertive nudge out of the
nest, Koplewicz said, and once children are on their own, parents
can go about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing says goodbye more clearly than emptying closets of
sports trophies and prom dresses _ or taking down walls. Garry
McGrath, an architect in St. Louis, said he does a brisk business
redesigning empty suburban nests to incorporate long-deferred
master bedroom suites and dream kitchens, with plenty of space for
an espresso machine _ and a breakfast nook for two.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Nests can't be rebuilt until children make a clean break, and
college separations are often messy. Part of the problem, several
family therapists said, is the way baby boomers rear their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dwelling on every detail of the lives of their offsprings, from
first burp to last lines of college applications, baby boomers tend
be both solicitous and expectant, as if their children were
interesting extensions of themselves and their life work. When
families also inhabit small dwellings, the intimacy can overwhelm
children, forcing them to fight their way out.
</P>
<P>
   As college drew nearer, so did my daughter's secret identity.
Shedding her nice-guy act, she seemed suddenly irritated to find me
paging through one of her Cosmopolitan magazines, pausing to study
``Make Him Ache for You.'' Then came cruel attacks on my occasional
memory lapses and less-than-perfect pocketbook-organizing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Barkin, author of ``When Your Kid Goes to College: A
Parent's Guide'' (Avon Books, 1999), said she was inspired to put
pen to paper after her own son began to act oddly just before
leaving. Friends related the same thing about their college-bound
offspring. ``This was supposed to be this summer of family
togetherness,'' she said one friend told her. ``My kid won't even
talk to me long enough to say whether he needs extra-long sheets''
for the extra-long mattresses colleges have these days.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Ellyn Rackleff of Tallahassee, Fla., whose children are 16,
19 and 21, described the drama that occurred in seeing the older
two off to college in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They flop back and forth between incredibly childlike demands
and assertions of their `rights' as an adult,'' she said, adding:
``I think there is a natural impulse, maybe some kind of hormone
that gets released, that makes the parent and child do everything
to upset each other, so that the atmosphere in the nest is
sufficiently toxic to allow the bond to break enough for them to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents use the term ``separation anxiety'' to describe the
mutual feelings. While clinically inexact, the term is apt, said
Dr. Nancy Giles, a psychologist in New York and the mother of three
adult children. While working with a group of pediatricians many
years ago, she tuned in to the way adults address 5-year-olds,
clapping them on the back and saying heartily, ``You're going off
to kindergarten! You're going to learn to read!''
</P>
<P>
   She said she often saw children hunched over as if bearing the
weight of the world. ``We trumpet these milestones,'' she said, and
often forget the follow-up: `` `You've gone off and done it before,
and you'll do a great job again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a psychiatrist in Stamford, Conn., said he
had counseled a family whose only child was barely out of the house
when the parents announced they were splitting up, a development
that caught the son off guard. ``He got very angry with both of
them,'' Cohen said, because ``separation was already an issue,''
and the parents had made it much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even in solid families, breaking up is hard to do. Kubie, who is
studying for a master's degree in social work at New York
University, remembers the day she and her husband dropped off their
firstborn at Duke. They had driven to Durham, N.C., from New York
with a friend and her daughter, also enrolling at Duke, and the
friend's housekeeper. ``We cried most of the way home,'' Kubie said
of the three women in the car, ``and it was a nine-hour trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Kubies' third and last child is looking at
colleges, they have become philosophical. ``Every time one of the
girls left home, we bought another dog,'' Kubie said.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents weather the transition, said Dr. Robert L. Myers, a
psychologist in Chester, Pa., but for others the departure of
children can intensify the anxiety that 50-somethings face when
they look back on life and wonder what they have to show for it. To
ease this kind of post-parting depression, they head for the mall.
Mom's in charge of finding those extra-long twin sheets, and Dad
gets to exercise his wallet at the Wiz. This is the generation of
parents more likely than their own to treat children as equals,
taking them everywhere and conferring with them about every life
decision and consumer purchase. It may be one reason parents feel
guilty when they experience an overwhelming desire to turn a
child's private space into a retreat for watching television and
lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over a child's abandoned room can be seen as marital
therapy, a sign that parents have a joint mission and a desire to
get on with life.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Salley, who designs houses on Cape Cod, sees a lot of
interesting family dynamics played out on the drawing board. One
couple communicated their late-in-life romance to children from
their previous marriages by tearing down bedroom walls for a
massive master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in other popular student-destination cities report that
it's not loneliness they suffer from but their taxing new roles as
innkeepers. Blair and Helaine Kaplan Prentice, who run a design
firm in Berkeley, Calif., gamely rose to the challenge when their
son Asa brought three fraternity brothers home from MIT this
summer. To augment sleeping arrangements in the hillside house they
designed when Asa and his brother were little, the Prentices
borrowed mattresses from neighbors and jury-rigged a platform bed
with plastic recycling bins. In August, as Asa was heading east for
his sophomore year, his father was busy devising a system of
couches able to morph into beds.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents prepare long in advance. When their three children
were still small, Georgiana Allan, a designer, and her husband,
Jerry Allan, an architect, created a house with maximum flexibility
for their family in Afton, Minn. Allan designed an oversize bedroom
for their artistically inclined daughter and a suite with two small
bedrooms for the boys, with common space between, separated from
the rest of the house by French doors. The notion was to create
privacy during their teen-age years (and ``when they come back with
their own families,'' Allan said hopefully) and a room that could
be converted for use by guests when their daughter left for
college.
</P>
<P>
   We've acquired a few extra mattresses of our own, just in case
our daughter pops in, bringing along her new family. And we have

converting her bed back into our sofa and spreading out our

refamiliarized myself with the ceiling tiles at the corner gym; and

MUSEUM GOERS GET A VIRTUAL HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the ceramics, lacquer ware and hand scrolls by the
17th-century Japanese artist Hon'ami Koetsu on display at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art are protected under heavy glass and dim
lighting. But two fragile items have been digitally recreated to
allow museum visitors to experience them as the artist intended: by
handling them.
</P>
<P>
   The two reproductions _ of a ceramic tea bowl and a 27-foot-long
painted scroll, are the result of a three-year project of the staff
and students at the International Academy of Media Arts and
Sciences, in Gifu, Japan. In both cases, a reproduction of the
object, which the user handles, is connected to a computer system
that shows corresponding images of the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was not to make just a replica but to give a sense of
what it is like to hold a tea bowl, or turn the scroll,'' said
Felice Fischer, curator of Japanese/East Asian Art at the museum,
where the Koetsu exhibition is running until Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to bring these static items to life and to
show their use to an audience that is totally unfamiliar with
Japanese art.''
</P>
<P>
   Using technology to incorporate a tactile experience into the
exhibition was important, Fischer said, because of the way such
objects were used in 16th- and 17th-century Japan. During tea
ceremonies and poetry readings, tea bowls and hand scrolls were
passed around or read among small groups of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were luxury items, for special occasions, but meant to be
used,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   To recreate the original black Shichiri (``seven seas'') tea
bowl, a CAT scan was taken of it, which allowed the academy staff
and students in Japan to obtain precise information about the
clay's density and air pockets, and the subtle gradations in
Koetsu's pottery. (Like most artists during that time, Koetsu did
not use a potter's wheel, but molded his bowls by hand.) From the
CAT scan, the academy team produced an exact model of the bowl made
of hardened resin.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit uses a motion-tracking system developed by Polhemus,
based in Colchester, Vt. The resin bowl sits on a platform with a
flat-panel computer screen behind it. The bowl is tethered by a
cord containing a small receiver, with a transmitter underneath the
platform that creates an electromagnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   The system tracks the position and orientation of the receiver
as the resin bowl is picked up and handled, sending the data to a
PC, which uses graphics software to synchronize the replica's
movement with a three-dimensional rendering of the real bowl on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   If the clear resin bowl is turned upside down, for example, the
computer screen will show an image of the original bowl turning
upside down as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although the resin bowl is clear and the original is black with
brown spots, the handlers get a sense of the exact shape and weight
of the bowl, and they can touch the characteristic smooth insides,
which were thought to be necessary for whisking the fine tea
powder.
</P>
<P>
   And although they can't feel the heat from a cup of tea, they
can feel how Koetsu made the bottom of the bowl thicker, so as to
warm the hands of the drinker without burning them.
</P>
<P>
   The handscroll exhibit is a reproduction of Koetsu's Crane
Scroll, which he collaborated on with another Japanese artist,
Tawaraya Sotatsu. (Sotatsu painted streaming motifs of cranes on
the scroll, while Koetsu wrote 36 Japanese poems on top of the
artwork, in calligraphy.)
</P>
<P>
   The scroll was constructed much like the original, with dowels
on both ends and paper that is similar in quality to the original.
The paper, however, is blank, sits underneath a sheet of glass and
acts as a display screen for images from the original scroll from a
projector underneath it, which is connected to a PowerMac G4.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll's dowels contain sensors that detect the user's
scrolling motions, which are sent to the computer, so that when the
scroll is turned, the corresponding verse and images are projected
onto the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing a button on the glass causes the projector to show only
the calligraphy or only the cranes. The cranes alone can appear to
be either a group of cranes on the sheet, or the flight path of a
single crane, an effect that resembles modern-day animation
techniques, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Crane Scroll exhibit also plays the chanted versions of the
poems. The oral chants are synchronized with the scroll sensors to
stop and start as the scroll is turned.
</P>
<P>
   The original tea bowl, on loan from a Tokyo museum, is on
display in an adjacent gallery at the museum, and the original
Crane Scroll, lent by the Kyoto National Museum, will be added to
the exhibit on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said she had been pleasantly surprised at the level of
care museum visitors were taking with the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology can be a useful tool, but sometimes it's tricky
because images on a screen can turn an exhibit into a toy or
game,'' Fisher said. ``But we think this works because you're
handling the objects rather than only pushing buttons or a mouse.''

SPORTS DRINK IS FOR THE DOGS, BUT NOT ANDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looks at me with disappointment and resentment in his deep
brown eyes, as if to say, ``How could you do this to me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is Rebound, `The World's First Sports Drink for
Dogs,''' I tell my West Highland white terrier, Andy.
</P>
<P>
   He will not drink it. He looks at me as if I'd poured him
poison.
</P>
<P>
   This, from a dog whom I have caught drinking out of the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This, from a dog whose favorite food groups include anything
that has been dead at least one week.
</P>
<P>
   Andy will not drink Rebound, the canine equivalent of Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   He turns up his nose and walks away, not caring that this 1.5
liters of dog stuff cost me $2.49, plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound is the brainchild of Gene B. Reilly and Robert Kodobocz,
both in their early 30s. The pair concocted the formula in an
Atlanta garage, formed a company called National Pet Supply to
market the dog drink, then found national distribution through
Kroger to more than 3,400 grocery stores around the nation. The
drink is sold at other retail stores and on several Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound went on the market less than a year ago, and its sales
are likely to top $1 million this year, according to National Pet
Supply.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound is supposed to replace fluid and salts lost to the
process of panting during exertion. That's a reasonable concept.
Veterinarians in California and Alabama are quoted in the
Petsmart.com pet-care library as saying a dog will recover from
lack of water more quickly if it is given Pedialyte, a fluid
replacement for children, or Gatorade, a sports drink for people.
Just as these drinks are loaded with electrolytes, so is Rebound.
Electrolytes are minerals such as potassium and sodium that
transmit electrical impulses through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think my Andy has too many electrical impulses
running through his body, and come to think of it, that may be
what's going on during his frenzied attempts to catch his own tail.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound also has vitamin E to combat stress. Andy has not had
any stress in his life since the other day, when the mailman came
to kill us _ or at least that's what Andy appeared to be suspecting
as he ferociously defended us from the uniformed agent of the
federal government who was armed with a package of socks and such
from One Hanes Place.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound's label says, ``It is modeled after human sports drinks
but has been formulated to meet the needs of today's canine
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Canine athlete? I should have known. Andy is not a canine
athlete, not unless 18-hour naps are a sport. Maybe, if
synchronized twitching becomes an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebound contains less salt and sugar than sports drinks
intended for people,'' the label says.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably why Andy won't drink it. He likes things
intended for people. Once I left the table to answer the telephone
during dinner. I said ``no thanks'' to the telemarketer, turned
around, and saw Andy sitting in my chair, nose in my dinner,
looking for more salt and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   So we stand there, my dog and I, looking at each other. I have a
1.5 liter bottle of sports drink for dogs in my hand. Our eyes
lock. I lift the bottle of Rebound and take a swig, thinking that
this will make it desirable to him.
</P>
<P>
   It tastes like watered-down Gatorade, which is not at all
desirable to me.
</P>
<P>
   I splash some on the kitchen floor, knowing how enthralled Andy
is with anything that falls there. When I cook, he is right by my
feet, staring at the floor where a morsel may fall at any moment.
He is my ever-vigilant spill hound. I trip over him frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy does not lap up the puddle of sports drink for dogs. He
looks at it sideways. He looks at me sideways.
</P>
<P>
   I am sure there is a dog somewhere that likes sports drinks for
dogs. They all have different eating preferences. Andy likes
carrots and once tried to jump inside the refrigerator to get one.
But he won't eat any other vegetable, not unless it is covered with
salt or sugar, appears to be something I would like to eat and has
fallen on the kitchen floor in a place just out of his reach. Then
he wants it. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound might best be reserved for the real athletes of the dog
world. Andy and I, we will stick to plain water.
</P>

FRESHMAN CLASS GROWS AT CUNY, FIRST INCREASE IN 5 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of new freshmen in the senior colleges at
the City University of New York this fall has risen by 5 percent,
and at some campuses by more than 20 percent, according to
preliminary figures provided by the university.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, the first in five years, comes despite predictions
that CUNY's new policy of ending remedial instruction at CUNY's
senior colleges would cut sharply into enrollment. This is the
first year that the new policy is being applied on some campuses.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials attributed the gain to better-educated
applicants, more aggressive recruiting efforts and their efforts to
rebuild CUNY's image. They said that students who might once have
rejected CUNY as a remedial factory were now seeking admission and
that 87 percent of the applicants _ up from 80 percent a year ago _
were able to pass the entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This increase shows that the reputation of the university has
improved and is attracting more and better students,'' said Dr.
Louise Mirrer, CUNY's vice chancellor for academic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But there were more skeptical explanations as well.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the faculty union said they feared that CUNY was
bending its admissions guidelines to fill seats with unprepared
students, and that the numbers did not reveal whether minority
students were being squeezed out of the senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of students came in at the last minute, and the
first question is who these students are and whether they are
prepared,'' said Steven London, the first vice president of the
faculty and staff union, the Professional Staff Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He said that many of the students who signed up at on-the-spot
recruiting drives were admitted without providing academic or
financial records. ``How many of these students will be here in a
month or two, I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On at least one campus, Brooklyn College, where freshman
enrollment rose by 24 percent, there was a sharp increase in
students admitted through its SEEK program for economically and
educationally disadvantaged students who do not meet the regular
entrance criteria. (SEEK stands for Search for Education, Elevation
and Knowledge.)
</P>
<P>
   While the SEEK students will not be taking remedial classes,
their academic background is considered roughly equivalent to those
admitted as remedial students in previous years. SEEK is mandated
by the state Legislature. About two-thirds of the increase in
Brooklyn's freshmen enrollment (to 1,315 from 1,057 last year) can
be attributed to the increase in SEEK students.
</P>
<P>
   But Mirrer maintained that an improvement in CUNY's rigor and
reputation was responsible for the increased enrollment. She said
that at the senior colleges, which have been raising their own
entrance requirements in recent years, more students were arriving
with stronger high school records.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said that the number of students with four or more years of
high school English, for example, had risen by 10 percent to 11,381
this year, while those with three or more years of college
preparatory mathematics had climbed 6 percent, to 11,132. At the
same time, she said, the number of students with grade point
averages of 80 or higher (10,739) had risen by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She said that CUNY did not yet have data about the racial and
ethnic composition of the incoming class and could not say yet
whether it had changed since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in freshmen helped stabilize CUNY's overall
enrollment, which has fallen since 1994, when it reached a recent
peak of 212,634 students. Total enrollment late last week was
195,620, up 0.3 percent from last year. CUNY officials expect to
revise the figures when they take their formal student census next
month, but do not expect the trends to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to think of CUNY as not the school of
last resort,'' said Larry Edwards, the liaison between CUNY and the
Board of Education and deputy to both chancellors. ``It's all
perception, and perceptions are beginning to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Sohmer, president of the university faculty senate, said
he expected the enrollment figures to be slightly lower in October
when the formal student census occurs, but he expected the freshmen
totals to still show gains. ``I don't think the increase will turn
out to be 5 percent, but I do think something positive has
happened,'' he said. ``There seems to be a turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Many public universities, including the State University of New
York, have shown enrollment gains in recent years as a college
degree has become more important to earn a decent salary.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is $3,200 a year at CUNY's senior colleges, compared
with $3,400 at SUNY. A SUNY spokesman said he did not yet have data
on enrollments for this year, but that the number of freshmen at
SUNY's four-year colleges grew 4 percent (to 29,007) last year.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY began to lose enrollment in 1994, as it struggled with
cutbacks in its state aid and growing attacks from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki and its own board members, including
Herman Badillo _ now the chairman _ who asserted that the education
it offered was second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of rancor and negativity,'' said Matthew
Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor. He said CUNY lost students when it
put a one-year limit on remedial work at the senior colleges in
1995; he also said it lost more than 20,000 students on public
assistance when the city began to require welfare recipients to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, CUNY's trustees voted to stop admitting any remedial
students to the senior colleges. Under its new policy, students who
cannot demonstrate their readiness for college-level English and
math may not enroll in bachelor's degree programs, but may enroll
in the two-year community college programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy took effect on seven of CUNY's 11 senior college
campuses this year, and will take effect at the others next year.

 &HT;    HURRICANE EVACUATION ROUTES COULD BE OVERWHELMED, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Population growth in the Southeast over the past
decade has put a strain on hurricane evacuation routes, according
to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Meteorological Society said shelters should be set
up along the evacuation routes so that people can seek shelter if
they are still on the road during a hurricane's landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the increased population, relying strictly on
evacuation won't work,'' said Richard Greenfield, director of the
society's Atmospheric Policy Program, which developed the report in
response to a forum this summer sponsored by the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find, in effect, backups,'' explained John
Clizbe(cq), vice president of Disaster Services for the American
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, the number of people living in the
southern Atlantic states increased from 43.5 million to 49.5
million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation problem was highlighted by Hurricane Floyd last
year, when major roads were clogged by thousands of people being
evacuated in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that responses to evacuation warnings are often
uneven, with 30 percent of the population evacuating unnecessarily
and another 30 percent refusing to go.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of fatalities from hurricanes has diminished
during the past century, before satellites gave forecasters early
warnings of approaching storms, ``the last 10 hurricane seasons
remind us that we are still vulnerable,'' Greenfield said. ``It's
just a matter of time before a major hurricane hits a vulnerable
area of the coast.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, the director of Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in
hurricane-prone areas along the southeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem,'' he said, is that ``the infrastructure
has not kept up with the population.
</P>
<P>
   Among the forum's recommendation were:
</P>
<P>
   _ A national hurricane preparedness assessment. This
Congress-mandated survey would evaluate the nation's vulnerability
to hurricanes, the existing systems and services, and propose
policies to improve them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Year-round communication. Strengthening the present hurricane
warning and response system to a year-round, closely coordinated
system involving national, regional, and local public and private
sector agencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ More research money. Congress should develop legislation to
provide long-term, continuous financial support for hurricane
research and improved services.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Kelly, director of the National Weather Service,
stressed that no matter how good the system improves, ``it will be
nothing'' unless people and communities respond to them.

BOMB BLASTS THROUGH INDONESIAN STOCK EXCHANGE BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(This story does not carry a byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A car bomb exploded in the parking garage
of the Indonesian Stock Exchange building Wednesday, killing at
least seven people and wounding dozens in the latest round of
violence to hit this troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion was the latest unexplained bombing in recent weeks
in Jakarta and other cities, and came just hours before a
high-profile corruption trial against Indonesia's former president,
Suharto, was to resume on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Jakarta police detective said that anecdotal evidence linked
Wednesday's blast to the case against Suharto. The night before the
trial opened on Aug. 31, another car bomb exploded 300 yards from a
building in south Jakarta where the case was being tried.
</P>
<P>
   The police detective, Harry Montolalu, told reporters at the
scene, ``This is being done to create instability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, who uses only
one name, refused to speculate about the involvement of anyone
linked to Suharto or his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we haven't caught the suspects yet and the motive
is still not clear, we shouldn't conclude that way,'' the general
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has accused military and political
extremists linked to Suharto of planting bombs and inciting unrest
across the country to discredit him and destabilize his
democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wahid also accused elements within the army of responsibility
for an attack last week on a U.N. refugee agency office in West
Timor that killed three foreign aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The country's attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, who spent
eight months investigating the Suharto family, has contended that
Suharto's supporters were instigating violence in order to derail
the corruption trial as well as investigations into past human
rights abuses by the military, including in East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said those incidents included a bomb explosion at his
office complex in July, just one hour after Suharto's youngest son
was questioned in connection with the corruption case against his
father. No one was injured in that blast.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's short-staffed and poorly equipped police force has
failed to name a single suspect in any of the incidents, and
Wednesday's explosion was expected to increase international
pressure on Wahid to restore order in his country of 210 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rusdihardjo said, ``I apologize for not being able to solve the
previous explosion cases, but trust me, the Indonesian police are
doing our best, and we will guarantee an improvement of security.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred about 3:25 p.m. on the second basement
level of the 36-story building's underground parking garage in
Jakarta's central business district.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people fled as the blast reverberated throughout
the building and black smoke billowed into the sky from the parking
garage entrance.
</P>
<P>
   At least 27 people were rushed to the nearby Pertamina state
hospital, which soon overflowed with casualties. Police gave
conflicting reports on the number of fatalities, and the death toll
was expected to rise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Firefighters rushed to the scene to battle an underground blaze
in the garage that was apparently started by a power generator
damaged in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people were believed to have died from smoke
inhalation, some while hiding in their cars in hopes of escaping
the fire. Rescue workers pulled at least three burned bodies from
the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is confirmed that the explosion came from a bomb in a

   Wednesday's bombing appeared to further erode the public's faith
in the country's security forces and re-enforced the perception
that Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest nation, is spiraling out
of control.

   ``I think what has happened is that the capacity of the security
forces to control this has really broken down,'' said Andi

ONLINE SHOPPER: UNDERCOVER BUYING, FAKE NAMES AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of things I do on Amazon.com that I don't
necessarily want everyone to know about.
</P>
<P>
   The day I compared prices on home pregnancy tests comes to mind.
So does the time that I placed a Bruce Springsteen CD in my
shopping cart, then removed it after being teased by my husband
(who refers to the aging Springsteen as ``the Wayne Newton of our
generation''). I am embarrassed about the hours I waste checking
the sales ranks of books I have written.
</P>
<P>
   So it hit me hard when Amazon.com recently announced a change in
its privacy policy. Under the old policy, the company said it
didn't sell, trade or rent its customers' personal information to
other companies. Under the new policy? I have no idea how many
people are someday going to get hold of my ``click stream data''
and find out that I had once priced ``Jane Fonda's Yoga Exercise
Workout'' video. (It was a gag gift, I swear.)
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Amazon.com's cheery personal greeting _ ``Hello, M.
Slatalla. We have recommendations for you in Books, Music and
more'' _ seemed a little sinister. So the next time I shopped at
Amazon.com, I decided to slip on a disguise.
</P>
<P>
   I had a lot of choices. A number of escrow services and
online-payment companies have begun to act as go-betweens to limit
buyers' exposure to sellers. Last week, for example, American
Express announced that within a month, cardholders would be able to
use disposable credit-card numbers when shopping online. That is
happening because of growing concerns over how online shoppers can
preserve their privacy. (I think it's fair to say that all of us
who searched for Play-Doh at Disney's Toysmart.com felt a little
burned recently when the company threatened to sell its customer
list.)
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to hide everything about myself, so I went to
PrivateBuy.com, a new service from an e-commerce payments company
called Ecount, in Conshohocken, Pa. PrivateBuy promised to create
an untraceable online identity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. You give information to PrivateBuy _ your
e-mail address, your name and address, a credit card number and
expiration date _ and PrivateBuy issues you a secret identity to
use when shopping online. Your camouflage includes a name (the
worldly yet mysterious Private Buyer), a MasterCard account number
and expiration date to use when making purchases, and a billing
address (the stately 7156 Private Buy Lane, Privacy, PA 00000).
Before making a purchase, you must finance your PrivateBuy account
with a real credit card payment; PrivateBuy then will authorize
payments on your MasterCard up to that amount.
</P>
<P>
   That all sounded fine, but then something occurred to me: Why
should I trust PrivateBuy.com any more than Amazon.com? Just
because the service had the word ``private'' in its name? Call me
paranoid, but what if Ecount someday changed its privacy policy and
decided to share information?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's no guarantee,'' said Paul Raden, Ecount's
co-founder. ``But our whole product is based on getting people to
trust us. Our credibility would diminish.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat mollified, I then took a look at PrivateBuy.com's
prices. It costs $3.95 every time you put money into your
Privatebuy.com account. Either you put in a specific amount and
then spend it gradually _ most customers add $100 at a time, Raden
said _ or you wait until you are on the verge of making a purchase,
then add that exact amount. (PrivateBuy.com also charges online
merchants a standard MasterCard transaction fee.)
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but $3.95 seemed awfully steep for a single purchase. On
the other hand, you might as well spend: PrivateBuy.com does not
have a mechanism to refund unused balances you have deposited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a premium service for someone who might want to make
an anonymous gift or a discreet purchase,'' Raden said, ``and in
those instances, people are willing to pay for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Was I? I feared that I wouldn't be able to answer because when I
arrived at Amazon.com, the site greeted me by name as usual after
recognizing the cookie it had sent to my computer at an earlier
date. So I found the file on my computer where cookies are stored
and deleted those that seemed to relate to Amazon.com. When I
restarted my browser, Amazon no longer greeted me by name, but
after I anonymously put a few items into a shopping cart (don't ask
_ it's none of your business) and tried to check out, I was
informed that I would have to use an e-mail address to create a
customer account. PrivateBuy.com did not give me an anonymous
e-mail address, so I had to set up my own:
PrivateBuyer(at)hotmail.com. It was free, but setting it up took
about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned yet again to Amazon.com, I realized that I had
overlooked another obvious point: if I entered a fake shipping
address, where would Amazon.com send my stuff? To Privacy, PA
00000?
</P>
<P>
   Raden suggested that I get a post office box to use as an
anonymous shipping address, so he clearly has no idea just how lazy
a shopper I am.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, why don't I just buy a factory in Taiwan and make my own
merchandise?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's new policy was suddenly seeming much less ominous.
I phoned Amazon.com to find out how likely it was that the company
was planning to share my secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Smith, a spokeswoman for Amazon.com, tried to put things
in perspective: ``You are worried people will know you are looking
to see if your books are moving up in rank? Like, `I was ranked
112,000, and now I'm 98,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 24,497,'' I said coldly.
</P>
<P>
   She then explained that Amazon would share customer information
with a third party only under two conditions:
</P>
<P>
   1. If Amazon.com was sold or acquired.
</P>
<P>
   2. If a customer bought products from one of the independent
merchants who operate stores on the Amazon.com site.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Amazon.com has no control over what those
independent merchants, like Drugstore.com (which sells home
pregnancy tests), do with the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that our partners treat customers as
carefully as Amazon does,'' Smith said. ``But if you're going to
transact business with one of the partners on our site, read their
policy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe I'll just walk down to the real drugstore and plunk
down $9.99 in cash for the EPT pregnancy test. (It's a gag gift,
Mom.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's back-to-school time, and what your teen may be dreading
even more than the grind is the possibility of showing up looking
oh-so-last-year. I know you'd want to save him or her this
embarrassment. Here, based on a survey that my company, Youth
Intelligence, conducted for Fuji Film, is what 350 teens from
around the country said will be in _ and out _ this year on high
school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   PICTURES OF FRIENDS
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that 91 percent of the teens we surveyed stated
that pictures of friends are in this year. Teens trust their
friends more than anyone else. Their friends are their lifelines.
Pictures of friends are visible proof that you have a posse, that
your peeps are there for you, that you don't stand alone in the
crowd. Teens also know life can be tough, and they want to capture
the good times to help see themselves through the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Have to Have: Polaroid I-zone with sticker film or any digital
camera
</P>
<P>
   CELLULAR PHONE
</P>
<P>
   With 87 percent of teens saying cell phones are going to be in
this year, you may find your phone ringing off the hook until you
get one for yours. And don't think a simple little beeper will
suffice. Teens want to stay in touch with their friends anytime,
anywhere. In addition, cell phones afford them privacy, so their
friends can call them without annoying parents. Whether this is bad
news or good news depends on how you look at it. On the up side, a
teen with a cell phone is a teen with no excuse to miss a curfew.
The bad news _ your teen might be on the phone all the time. The
good news _ you can still talk on yours.
</P>
<P>
   Have to Have: Motorola V. series
</P>
<P>
   CARGO
</P>
<P>
   You can breathe a sigh of relief. You won't have to unload those
four pairs of cargo pants your teen couldn't live without last
spring. While fashion may be fleeting, this fad has managed to stay
hot. This is what 80 percent of teens say they'll be wearing in
school this year.
</P>
<P>
   Teens still love the practicality of these pants, with pockets
for cameras, cell phones and even an afternoon snack. However,
while the look may stay the same, the brands might be different.
Tommy is no longer as cool as Polo, and though Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch
still has a large piece of the market (72 percent of the teens we
surveyed say they want A&AMP;F cargoes), a slightly smaller number will
be wearing A&AMP;F than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Have to Have: Cargoes by 555 Soul, Polo, Ecko Unlimited
</P>
<P>
   BODY PIERCINGS
</P>
<P>
   I'm not recommending you run out and get your teen a nose ring,
but I am warning you that while this trend may be subsiding, it has
hardly pricked its last hole. Of the teens we surveyed, 76 percent
said piercing will still be in this year. The good news? Only 49
percent said tattoos will be in.
</P>
<P>
   Have to have: Their choice: Belly Ring. Your wish: Belly Chain
</P>
<P>
   DYED HAIR
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: at least dyed hair doesn't cost a lot. An
overwhelmingly large number of teens (72 percent) stated that it
would still be in this year. Interestingly, more males than females
said this, with 75 percent of boys giving it the thumbs up and only
69 percent of girls.
</P>
<P>
   The reason dyed hair seems so hot may be that teens are looking
for a way to express themselves. Hair is just as dramatic as
piercings and tattoos, but it's less permanent. Dyed hair can also
be changed based upon one's mood or needs. We didn't get a read on
which colors our teens favored, so maybe they just meant
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Have to have: Clairol Extreme EFX
</P>
<P>
   GLITTERY MAKE-UP
</P>
<P>
   This trend seems most popular among the younger teens in grades
9 and 10, which probably signals that it won't make the list by
spring. But with 55 percent of teens overall (and 65 percent of
9th-graders saying it's still in), you'll be seeing glittery hair,
eyelids and cheeks well into the fall. The great thing about
glitter is that it's fun and frivolous. Younger teens today are
increasingly optimistic, and this is one of the clearest ways to
put their brightest face forward.
</P>
<P>
   Have to have: Anything Glitter from Hard Candy, Bourjois or Jane
Cosmetics Glitter
</P>
<P>
   BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Man Who Ate the 747'' (book)
</P>
<P>
   Nelly Furtado (music artist)
</P>
<P>
   Rimless sunglasses

   SCHOOL DANCE
</P>
<P>
   Q: My full-time (but not live-in) baby sitter hinted that she
would like to use my address to enroll her daughter in my excellent
local public elementary school; her neighborhood school is awful.
The alternative is for her to send her daughter to private school,
a financial burden but not an impossibility. Should I offer my
address?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.A.B., Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: You should not offer your address; it is not ethical to
facilitate your baby sitter's fraud. It is, of course, entirely
admirable to help her get her daughter into a good school, but
there are better ways to do so. Help her apply for a variance that
allows her daughter to attend an out-of-district school. Since
that's an admittedly iffy proposition, see if the two of you can
find any good schools or special programs in her district. That
said, many districts, even in New York, a city with some excellent
public schools, offer sadly limited choices. As a consequence,
while what your baby sitter proposes is improper, I don't have it
in me to chastise a mother's deception in trying to get her
daughter a decent education. The best way to eliminate these sorts
of address gymnastics is not through calls for individual
rectitude, but by providing good schools in all neighborhoods.
Sometimes a personal ethical goal _ a good education for your
sitter's daughter _ can be achieved only through political action.
So beyond the immediate steps you take on her behalf, I hope you
and she actively support efforts for better public schools. If your
sitter does opt for private school, you might help her apply for a
scholarship or even, if you can afford it, aid her financially
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My neighbor, a twentysomething and quite good-looking, never
draws his blinds. The view from my apartment is extraordinary.
Every night at 8:15 he returns from jogging to shower and prepare
for bed, which I enjoy watching. Am I wrong to do so?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A: If the dreamboat across the way forgot one night to draw his
blinds, you should respect his privacy; it would not be right to
exploit a moment's carelessness. However, if he leaves them open
every night in a big city where he obviously has neighbors, you can
assume he knows what he's doing. Enjoy! It would be almost
insulting to avert your glance. Like Central Park or the Chrysler
Building, naked neighbors are part of the scenic splendor that is
New York. Alas, while there may be no ethical impediment to your
hobby, it is not without legal risk in some places for both the
observed and the observer. New York State law, for example,
proscribes various ``offenses against public sensibilities,'' and
although one is unlikely to be convicted of such a charge, the
arrest alone could be quite unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I love to find the day's paper on the subway seat next to me
when I am caught without anything to read. Naturally, then, I feel
inclined to leave my paper behind on the subway when I am done with
it, despite the Metro Transit Authority's posted admonition against
littering. Is it unethical to contribute to this silent network of
newspaper readers?
</P>
<P>
   _ Luis Perez, Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your volunteer subterranean bookmobile is the Transit
Authority's litter. It is reasonable of them to ask riders not to
strew newspapers around the subway; they must consider the possible
effects of millions of riders leaving their papers behind. And
while the commute would certainly be more pleasant if each train
included a library car (and while we're at it, a bar car), until
that utopian transit system arrives, you ought to follow the rules.

FARMER WHO LED VANDALISM AT MCDONALD'S GIVEN PRISON SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The farmer who became something of a national hero last
year for leading an attack on a McDonald's restaurant was convicted
of criminal vandalism Wednesday and sentenced to three months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Francois Mallet, who delivered the verdict as well as the
sentence in the nonjury trial, said he hoped the jail term would
make the farmer, Jose Bove, ``finally listen to reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was harsher than the token one-month prison
sentence, with another nine months suspended, that the prosecutor
asked for at the end of Bove's raucous trial in July.
</P>
<P>
   Bove, a sheep farmer who has proved media savvy since his action
made him a celebrity, looked somber as he left the courthouse. He
vowed to continue his fight against globalization and what he views
as bad food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the risk of going to prison that is going to stop us
from protesting,'' Bove said on the steps of the courthouse. ``The
important thing is for the movement to continue to grow whatever
the price is that we may have to pay here today.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, it was clear that Bove's attack on the U.S.
fast-food giant had tapped into a deep well of public discontent
and a feeling of powerlessness on subjects ranging from genetically
modified foods to the power of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   His particular protest was prompted by the United States'
decision to levy high tariffs on Roquefort cheese, pate de foie
gras and other luxury imported food in retaliation for the European
Union's decision to ban imports of U.S. hormone-treated beef. But
it came to represent much more.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial in the small southwestern town of Millau,
thousands of supporters showed up. For two days the atmosphere of a
French Woodstock prevailed as teenagers with green hair gathered
along with middle-aged men with ponytails and retirees wearing
T-shirts that read, ``The world is not merchandise and I'm not
either.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday only a few dozen supporters were on hand in
Millau, where the local industry is the production of Roquefort
cheese. Few people in France expected Bove, who organized the
attack, to be handed a jail term. In this country, protesting is a
national pastime and activists are rarely given prison sentences.
None of Bove's nine co-defendents were sent to prison. Three were
given two-month suspended sentences, five were fined about $300 and
one was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Bove, 47, said he was surprised by the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very severe judgment,'' he said. ``The
magistrate didn't understand the movement or the motivation behind
what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove said the appeal had already been filed and that the trial
would effectively take place again in about one year before the
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bove, who now has a busy speaking schedule, a
far more prominent job with his union and dinner invitations from
high-level government officials, said he would keep up with his
activities as usual.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the attack on the McDonald's, Bove was an activist and
union official living in a small stone farmhouse tucked in the
craggy hills of the Larzac region. His activism involved local
issues, like opposing the use of nearby land for an army base.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Bove, who has an amiable grin under his handlebar
mustache, trots the globe. He said he would be in Bangalore, India,
at the end of the month to take part in a protest against
genetically modified grain. ``The combat will continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bove has a flair for the dramatic. He arrived at his trial in a
hay cart pulled by a tractor, recalling victims of the French
Revolution who rode in carts to the guillotine. When he finally
climbed the courthouse stairs, he stood at the door with his fist
raised long enough for the pack of news photographers to get good
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The trial certainly seemed to offer the magistrate good cause to
be annoyed. The defendants, dressed in sports shirts, laughed and
joked as the charges were read and they were asked to respond to
them. One, accused of spraying the McDonald's with orange paint,
said he was only sorry he had not used green paint.
</P>
<P>
   Another, accused of using a screwdriver to commit vandalism,
acknowledged that he had, but said it was a small screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Bove appeared the most serious of the defendants. At one point
he compared himself to Gandhi, saying that Gandhi, too, had been
accused of violence in his day. ``The dismantling of McDonald's was
a strong action, symbolic and nonviolent,'' Bove said in his
defense, adding that the fast-food giant's arrival in Millau was a
``provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the McDonald's, Marc Dehani, saw it a bit
differently. He said $120,000 worth of damage was done to his
property, which was still under construction at the time.

`THE TRUMPS': THE GRANDFATHER, THE FATHER, THE DONALD 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Gwenda Blair's copiously researched study of the Trump
family, readers can learn the academic credentials of the director
of Donald Trump's nursery school and the fact that building with
blocks was a main part of this future mogul's curriculum. Also
established are the colors of the boys' uniforms (gray shorts and
green shirts) at Camp Hilltop and the fact that counselors kept
records about the bowel movements and other digestive progress of
their charges.
</P>
<P>
   On the psychological front the author identifies Donald, who was
born in 1946, as part of a faux-firstborn generation emerging
immediately after World War II and apt to be assertive and
successful, regardless of exact birth order. Maybe so, but not all
these people have been able to plaster their names across the New
York skyline. And only one of them has been able to treat the city
as his personal Monopoly board or modestly attempt to turn his name
into a modifier. (``You're looking very Trump today,'' read a 1987
billboard in Atlantic City, the auxiliary Trump playground.) As to
what really makes Donald run, Blair's investigative account doesn't
offer much of a clue.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that enough has been said about Donald Trump
anyway, mostly by Trump himself, and that this exhaustive book is a
no-win proposition. In her attempt to eclipse the mogul's own
self-puffery and his invaluable presence as a gossip-column
fixture, Blair has dug back two generations to the first Trump
(actually Drumpf) presence on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   She has doggedly compiled the family history of a grandfather
(Friedrich, later Frederick), father (Fred) and glitz-seeking
Wunderkind, but the focus of her account is uncertain. There are
readers who want to know about the Uniform Land Use Review
Procedure, known as ULURP, ``the city's complex zoning approval
process,'' and others who wonder what Donald Trump's former
consorts and employees might have to say. Try as she may to steer
an even course between these polarities, Blair winds up with a
landslide of ULURP and little dish.
</P>
<P>
   The book has its most obvious trouble in cobbling together the
mostly undocumented story of Friedrich, who arrived in 1885 from
southwestern Germany. (The family would later occasionally
represent itself as Swedish.) Before settling down to adult life as
a barber, he lived adventurously in the Pacific Northwest in the
midst of gold miners, for whose benefit he ran a series of
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Blair assembles evidence that the ``dressmakers'' who could be
found at these establishments were actually prostitutes, which
would not have been entirely shocking in that setting, and which at
least is better proved than some of the more dubious details here.
Did Friedrich serve horse meat in his restaurants, for example?
Maybe not, ``but if he was like everyone else, he did what the
locals did _ went out and cut up a piece of old Nelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair is on more solid ground with the story of how Fred Trump
carved out a real estate empire in Brooklyn. Also richly endowed
with the family moxie, he initially learned the building trade
through YMCA and correspondence courses while also developing
expertise in finding legal loopholes within Federal Housing
Administration regulations. ``Without the FHA, Fred Trump would
have been running a supermarket,'' Blair asserts. ``With the FHA,
he was the biggest builder in Brooklyn, employing hundreds of
construction workers and turning out 400 homes a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Christ Trump (whose middle name was his mother's
family name, and who did not create further hubris problems by
passing it on to Donald) earned a reputation for dedication. He
dressed in a coat and tie to tour the houses he had built and to
greet residents. During one construction project near Coney Island
he installed bathing lockers so workers could swim on their breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the height of his success, he remained ``a man who would
still spend an entire afternoon meticulously explaining to a
maintenance man how to mix liquid cockroach spray so as to avoid
calling an exterminator.'' In the words of one acquaintance, ``He
never tried to impress anybody with his wealth,'' and ``He didn't
seem to care if anybody had ever heard of him,'' proving how far an
apple can fall from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The section devoted to Donald (other relatives are all but
invisible) combines pearls of hindsight (``You could tell he was
going to get somewhere'') with a litany of deal-making details for
which an appreciation of tax abatements and housing codes would be
welcome. What emerges is Blair's portrait of her subject as a
germ-phobic anti-Gatsby:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no desire to pass for old money himself and considered
most of those who benefited from it to be phonies; likewise he was
not at all reticent about how he made his money but took every
opportunity to boast about just how clever he had been. Nor was
there a Daisy at whose feet he wished to lay himself and his
material possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of Gatsby's poignant display of his shirts, we have
Trump telling reporters: ``See this railing? Same railing Onassis
had on his boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Almost Golden,'' her haunting book about the driven
television reporter Jessica Savitch, Blair also wrote about raging
ambition, and did it in a way that made readers complicit in
Savitch's relentlessness. But in that regard Donald Trump has
beaten any biographer to the punch. ``The Trumps'' does trace his
apotheosis as a star and brand name more valuable than any
65th-story penthouse (which, incidentally, would in the creatively
labeled Trump Tower actually be on the 59th floor). But it also
finds him in full control of his own image and reputation,
impregnable to the kinds of details that emerge here. From his
father and grandfather, as Blair does illustrate, he inherited the
ability to make lemons into lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think,'' he remarked while heavily in debt and
having to sell property on the auction block. ``I think there's
something very sophisticated and intelligent about auctions.''

<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   No matter where your tastes lie on the broad spectrum of jazz
interpretation, there's something to like on Rene Marie's MaxJazz
debut. Applying an arsenal of styles to standards (''The Very
Thought of You,'' ``Tennessee Waltz,'' ``God Bless the Child'') and
originals like the title tune, Marie scats and yodels and purrs
with an exuberance that belies her 44 years. An added treat to this
release is the stellar piano/keyboard accompaniment from Mulgrew
Miller, Marvin Sewell's sultry strumming on guitar and Gerald
Cleaver's snappy drum work. Most alluring of all is the fourth
track, ``Four Women,'' in which the backup quintet lays down a
backbeat reminiscent of a Steely Dan ballad while Marie strings
tales of the struggles of red, yellow, tan and brown women
everywhere. Marie can't keep from singing because it'd be a
disservice to the listening public.

</P>
<P>
   For J.S. Bach, a mix-and-match approach to composition and
performance was the norm. He'd write a piece for violin one day and
transcribe it for harpsichord the next. Thus it's no surprise to
find double bass virtuoso Edgar Meyer playing three suites (Nos. 1,
2 and 5) that Bach originally composed for solo .

   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The American folk canon consists of tunes that have been
informally passed down through the years, their original authorship
lost to the ether as various generations adopted (and adapted)
music and lyrics for entertainment purposes. ``Public Domain,''
Dave Alvin's latest release, follows purest folk tradition with its
reworking of the railroad, murder/revenge and religious songs that
remain integral swatches in the American cultural fabric. Alvin
infuses fuller, richer sound into time-worn staples like ``Maggie
Campbell,'' ``Delia'' and ``Railroad Bill,'' while managing to
retain the underlying simplicity that made these works classic in
the first place. But some of Alvin's old Blasters rockabilly vibes
assert themselves on ``Don't Let Your Deal Go Down'' and ``East
Virginia Blues,'' pumping up the volume when necessary. Popular by
definition and populist at heart, the songs of ``Public Domain''
are those of the people, by the people, for the people _
quintessentially American, but thematically universal.

 &HT;    Famously fun odes to world of rock 'n' roll
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Almost Famous,'' Cameron Crowe's ode to the rock life of
the early '70s, opening in metro theaters Friday, you may want to
think about rock movies available for rental. Trouble is, there are
so many of them out there _ good, bad and indifferent _ you could
probably rock around the clock for a solid month in front of your
VCR and never get past Early Elvis (the earlier, funkier flicks
from his ``Jailhouse Rock'' period). And some of us do have school,
I mean, work.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, assuming you know about the Beatles and the Who and
Sting and the Sex Pistols and a zillion others who've made the
crossover from song to cinema, here are some other titles to check
into.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Doors'' (1991): Like every other picture he's ever made,
this one is more about Oliver Stone than anything else. This time
he lights a fire under one of the '60s sexiest myths of
self-destruction _ the crash-and-burn career of Jim Morrison,
played with galvanizing power by a pre-Batman Val Kilmer. The movie
is the sort of frenzied demon-god memorial Morrison would've loved,
with the rest of the band pretty much relegated to background noise
(they're played by Kyle McLachlan, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon).
There's also Meg Ryan in granny glasses as Morrison's flower-power
girlfriend, a classic Movie Acid Trip and enough pretentiousness to
light a bonfire. This is not a film for devoted fans of the Doors
or for anyone soul-sick of the '60s, but it does capture the chaos
of charisma.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rock 'n' Roll High School'' (1979): Sophomoric, crude, rowdy
and marvelously exuberant, this ``shameless display of adolescent
abandon'' stars P.J. (where are you now?) Soles as a Ramones freak
who has her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High dancing in the
halls. But the new principal (Mary Woronov) is putting static in
Soles' rock 'n' roll heaven. The Ramones appear as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``This Is Spinal Tap'' (1984): The movie that put the ``mock''
into mockumentary. This ``cinema verite'' head trip down the long
and winding road tour of a fictitious English band named Spinal Tap
is a peerless, pitch-perfect parody of every rockumentary made
since Dylan didn't look back. The film's caricatures are still
classic more than a decade and a half after it was made. Michael
McKean is the limp-locked vocalist; Christopher Guest, the moody
lead guitarist with his amp set on 11; co-scripter Harry Shearer,
the laconic bass player; and director Rob Reiner, the supposed
documentary's director. What happens to Spinal Tap on tour
shouldn't happen to Michael Bolton. Canceled concerts, getting lost
backstage, taking second billing to a puppet show. Too funny to be
true and sometimes too true to be funny, it's a splendid film.
</P>
<P>
   Note to DVD owners: A special edition has hit the stores
featuring an hour of never-before-seen footage and a Flower People
Press Conference (see the movie and you'll get the joke.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Still Crazy'' (1998): A poignant yet hilarious companion
piece to ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' this brilliant comedy takes us one
decade further, conjuring up a fictional British group from the
'70s called Strange Fruit. Twenty years after giving in to
factions, jealousies and even divine intervention, The Fruits, as
their fans call them, attempt a reunion tour. Loaded up on a bus
that was once used by the Psychedelic Furs, they hit the road. A
kind of tragicomedy for baby boomers, the movie is a celebration
and an elegy, reminding us that rock dreams take a long time to die
_ for those who made music as well as for those who listened. You
may recognize Stephen Rea (``The Crying Game'') as the keyboardist
or Billy Connolly (``Mrs. Brown'') as an ironic roadie. But the
standout is Bill Nighy as the group's lead singer, a tremulous
has-been heartthrob.

 &HT;    It's Emmylou, in her own words
 &HT;    By Eileen Drennen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has to be a little daunting to make an album as achingly
perfect as ``Wrecking Ball.'' Harris' adventurous 1995 release _
with its haunting versions of songs by folks like Neil Young,
Daniel Lanois and Lucinda Williams, in all their fuzzy grandeur _
was a moody break from past personas (``Sweetheart of the Rodeo,''
``Blue Kentucky Girl,'' ``The Ballad of Sally Rose'') and a hint of
what might follow. It was drenched in the bayou night sounds that
producer Lanois had perfected on albums for the Neville Brothers,
U2 and Willie Nelson. But Harris' seasoned voice, with its raw and
scraping grace, made it a completely distinctive listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Dirt Girl,'' produced by Lanois associate Malcolm Burn,
has much of the same dense atmospherics. But this time, Harris _ so
often an interpreter of other artists' music _ spotlights her own
poetic compositions. Love lost or never fully understood resonates
throughout, whether the song alludes to a parent (``Bang the Drum
Slowly''), a lover (``J'ai Fait Tout'' and ``I Don't Wanna Talk
About It Now'') or faith (``The Pearl'').
</P>
<P>
   Long respected for her generosity to her fellow singers'
projects, Harris gets ace backing vocals from Bruce Springsteen and
Patty Scialfa on the darkly beautiful ``Tragedy'' and Dave Matthews
on the C&AMP;W-flavored ``My Antonia.'' And in the process, she raises
the bar for herself yet again.

 &HT;    `Lie' about Dickey? Debate rages
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that James Dickey is as controversial in death as he
was in life. Henry Hart, who exposed the poet's propensity for
prevarication in the biography ``James Dickey: The World as a Lie''
(Picador, $35), has been caught in a critical crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewer firing the most darts is Hemingway biographer
Jeffrey Meyers. In a negative review in The New Criterion, Meyers
accused Hart of sloppy scholarship, factual errors and an
overemphasis on Dickey's drunken escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the September issue of The New Criterion, the two
biographers have engaged in an epistolary form of ``Dueling
Banjos.'' Hart counters Meyers' criticism point by point and
accuses him of ``swinging his demolition ball at the current Dickey
books to make room for his own. ... Many of Meyers' other comments
are distortions motivated by spite, or just careless errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, in response, writes: ``Hart's whining letter, which
wisely ignores my major criticism of his work, is as bad as his
book. ... I'm not writing a life of Dickey but, if I did, (I)
certainly wouldn't use his shoddy research.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Dickey's son, Christopher, whose memoir
``Summer of Deliverance'' was not overly kind, joined Meyers in
criticizing Hart's work. ``The poetry's greatness _ and that is not
too big a word _ is lost in Hart's relentlessly banal and often
credulous repetition of Jim Dickey's personal failings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey fans can hear more from Hart in a lecture at 5:30 p.m.
Monday at Emory University. Woodruff Library's Jones Room, 540
Asbury Circle. 404-727-6887.

   &QR;  Movie how-to: Aspiring directors who want to shoot the next
``Blair Witch Project'' would do well to pick up a copy of ``Making
Independent Films: Advice From the Filmmakers'' (Allworth Press,
$16.95).
</P>
<P>
   The handy book by writers/producers Liz Stubbs of Roswell and
Richard Rodriguez of Miami offers an informative and entertaining
behind-the-curtain tour of the independent film scene. One of the
people interviewed is Michael Shoob, whose critically acclaimed
film ``Driven'' began its festival circuit in Atlanta. Before doing
``Driven,'' Shoob, son of U.S. District Court Judge Marvin Shoob of
Atlanta, wrote a 3-D horror movie in the early '80s called
``Parasite.'' It starred an unknown (at the time) soap opera
actress named Demi Moore.

   If you're an Olympics fan with a comfortable couch, boy have we
got a weekend for you. NBC promises 441.5 hours of coverage before
the Sydney games are over, either on the network itself or on its
CNBC and MSNBC cable channels. And a good chunk of those hours come
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If you're quick on the clicker, you'll never have to watch
anything else, actually. Coverage starts on MSNBC at 10 a.m.
Saturday (women's basketball and beach volleyball) and 9 a.m.
Sunday (baseball), and runs till after 2 a.m. Prime-time events on
NBC include swimming, men's gymnastics and other sports from
7-midnight on Saturday, and swimming and women's gymnastics on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is tape-delayed, of course. Since Sydney is many
times zones away from the United States, NBC will rely on host Bob
Costas and its crack team of editors to shape hours of raw tape
into compelling competition. If you just want results, you'll be
able to get those much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you're wondering where all the new shows are on
the other networks, we have some bad news for you. The start of the
fall TV season has been delayed until the first week of October, so
all those new shows don't have to compete with the Games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS Saturday at 8: R is for reality, which this
show is not. (Continued tomorrow!)
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' CBS Saturday at 9: CBS continues its
counter-Olympic strategy with reruns of this summer sensation.
Tonight, episode 2: ``Generation Gap.'' B.B. gets voted off the
island, apparently because he's too useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Blaine: Street Magic,'' ABC Saturday at 10: Leonardo
DiCaprio and some of the Dallas Cowboys appear, but their appeal
pales next to the amazing sleight of hand by this young magician.
Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad TV,'' Fox Saturday at 11: Busta Rhymes guests. It's a
rerun, but if you usually watch ``Saturday Night Live,'' pre-empted
by the Olympics tonight, you should give this younger, more daring
sketch comedy show a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes,'' CBS Sunday at 7: Gossip columnist Liz Smith,
presumably talking about her forthcoming autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s: The Decade That Changed Television,'' ABC Sunday at
7: Two-hour infotainment special about the years that gave us
``MASH'' and ``All in the Family'' _ also ``Three's Company'' and
``The Love Boat.''

<P>
   ``The Simpsons,'' Fox Sunday at 8: The strange episode that saw
the passing of Maude Flanders in a freak accident at a stock car
race. Rerun.

</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Van Dyke Show'' marathon, TVLand all weekend: This
48-hour marathon gives you a terrific chance to introduce your kids
to great comedy that doesn't involve any ``South Park'' language or
``Friends''-style couplings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Birds,'' AMC Saturday at 8:05: We never get tired of this
1963 Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece about a natural uprising that's
all the more powerful because it's never explained. The phone booth
scene is on par with anything else he's done. Rod Taylor, Tippi
Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette and Jessica Tandy star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary,'' Cinemax Saturday at 8:
Hilarious and sick _ in a good way. A comedy with zippers, not-hair

star, with support from the demented Chris Elliott and musician
Jonathan Richman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Actor's Studio,'' Bravo Sunday at 8: Now this ought
to be worth watching. Big-screen star Faye Dunaway can talk to the
students about ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde,'' ``Chinatown,'' ``Network'' and
of course ``Mommie Dearest,'' which follows at 9 on Bravo. Maybe
she'll also talk about some of her legendary diva behavior on the
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadow of a Doubt,'' AMC Sunday at 8: This comparatively
low-key Hitchcock classic was the director's favorite. Joseph
Cotton stars as the debonair uncle who comes to visit his relatives
in a bucolic small town; Teresa Wright is the niece who thinks he
might be the Merry Widow killer. Watch for Cotton's chilling
dinner-table soliloquy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hendrix,'' Showtime Sunday at 8: Wood Harris stars as 1960s
guitar god Jimi Hendrix in a brand-new biopic that's reportedly
heavy on the 1960s decadence but devoid of any actual Hendrix
music. How groovy can it be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City,'' HBO Sunday at 9: The Los Angeles sojourn
continues, and now Charlotte joins her friends there. But with
these gals around, is it still the City of Angels?

AALTO ROOM MAY BE SHOWN THE DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Japan)   By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An architectural gem is in danger of becoming an
architectural millstone. A suite of conference rooms designed in
1964 by Alvar Aalto could join the list of extinct legendary New
York interiors, now that their owner has announced that it would
like them removed from an office building near the United Nations.
The interior is not protected by landmark status.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaufmann Conference Center, as it is known, is one of only
four existing works designed by Aalto in the United States, and the
only one in New York. It represents ``one of the unique
architectural treasures of New York City,'' Kenneth Frampton, the
architectural historian, said.
</P>
<P>
   Aalto is the renowned Finnish architect with a humanistic bent,
who brought a love of natural materials and organic shapes to the
rigid contours of international style _ not to mention his immortal
1936 vase. The office space is named for Edgar J. Kaufmann, a
professor of architecture and a patron of architecture and
education who talked his parents into hiring Frank Lloyd Wright to
design Fallingwater. In this case, Kaufmann believed that Manhattan
deserved an Aalto.
</P>
<P>
   He commissioned the conference rooms in 1961 on behalf of the
Institute of International Education at 809 U.N. Plaza. The current
owner, a Japanese nonprofit organization, wants to convert the
Aalto space into offices.
</P>
<P>
   A hastily anointed band of Aalto enthusiasts and friends of New
York's modern legacies are on a quest to find guardian angels to
come to the rescue. Dismantling the large portable elements of the
room would be possible, but expensive and somewhat destructive.
Finding a new home has proved elusive. Some supporters believe a
way must be found to keep it in place; others just want it saved
any way possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,500-square-foot, three-room space with retractable walls
offers a choice menu of Aalto's signatures. Visiting the space
today, it looks so original that one experiences the shock of
modernism's early impact. A white plaster ceiling still undulates
as it rises up to a peak of 22 feet. Textured walls _ some made of
cylindrical royal blue porcelain ribs, others of long thin birch
battens layered at intervals over ash paneling _ move in waves,
too. The real eye-stopper, however, is a sculptural relief of
curvaceous wooden staves, shaped like hockey sticks and set deep
into one corner, Aalto's poetic abstract of a Finnish forest.
</P>
<P>
   Along one side, floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows provide a
ringside view of the doings at the United Nations and along the
East River, while an enormous screen of wooden louvers in a
checkerboard pattern protects the space from glare. The gold-plated
copper lighting fixtures, sculptured bronze door pulls, standing
lamps with leather posts and Aalto vase-like shades, black leather
and birch chairs and a portable bar and speaker's desk, were also
all made by Aalto. His second wife, Elissa, assisted on the project
and made the variegated brown rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their inimitable significance, such rooms, said Roger
Lang of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, are ``very perishable,
and very hard to save.'' Tucked away on the top floor of a private
office building, the Kaufmann Conference Center doesn't meet the
legal criteria of public accessibility required for an interior
space to be granted landmark status. There is a another
disadvantage. ``It's modern,'' Lang said, ``and we're all trying to
come to grips with preserving things that are hard for people to
embrace because they belong to such recent history.''
</P>
<P>
   The space appears to have been barely touched for 36 years. An
old-fashioned pneumatic lever in a closet still raises an invisible
track to transform the space from three to four conference rooms.
Portability was an important theme of modernism, and Aalto designed
the rooms to be movable. In fact, much of the materials were made
in Finland. There are even spare parts _ mostly bundles of birch
battens and extra Arabia porcelain tiles _ in the basement, said
Gil Robinov, the exclusive agent for the building's Japanese
owners, the Foundation for the Support of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   When the foundation bought the building in 1998, it converted it
into a commercial condominium, and sold several floors to foreign
governments. Initially, they were unaware of the gem inside,
Robinov said. But a constant trickle of architecture enthusiasts
and students alerted the foundation to what it had. ``He's got a
fan club, no question about it,'' Robinov said about Aalto, adding
that security makes it difficult to allow people free access to the
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very sympathetic to the plight of the followers of this
architect,'' he said. ``These rooms should be in a place where they
are protected for posterity.'' He also noted that because the place
was private, ``whoever owns the building can do anything, including
taking it out and putting it in the Dumpster.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, the Consulate General of Finland has
been watching the space, even hiring Finnish experts to appraise
its condition. Maija Lahteenmaki, the former consul general, took a
special interest in the rooms but her tour of duty in the United
States recently ended.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, she said, ``I was informed by the new owners
that they planned to convert it to office space because the market
was so hot.'' Lahteenmaki, with the help of Caroline Zaleski, a
recent graduate of the Columbia School of Architecture's
preservation program, solicited Frank Gehry, Robert Venturi, Tadao
Ando and other prominent architects to write letters emphasizing
the importance of preserving the interior. The owners responded by
offering to donate all the portable elements to anyone who would
pay the cost of removal.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation and architectural community is not unanimous
about what should be done. Some believe that, if it cannot remain
where it is, then it should be dismantled and stored with the hope
of reinstalling it at some future date. Others say that it should
be removed to an institution that would use it and make it
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art was an obvious place to turn. The
museum's 1938 exhibition on Aalto's work was responsible for
bringing him to international attention. (A retrospective in 1998
worked up a new generation of midcentury modern fans.) This summer,
the museum did investigate the possibility of incorporating the
Kaufmann space into its new expansion plans, but concluded that it
wouldn't fit, said Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and
design at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, he added, ``Should museums be rescuing rooms
from the garbage can and become witting assistants to dismantling
rooms and removing them from their original place for the sake of
acquisition?''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Kaufmann connection, Lynda Waggoner,
Fallingwater's director, said she was approached to either
reinstall the rooms in a barn on her site or to store all the
elements. She said neither was a possibility. ``It's very urban in
a way that wouldn't be appropriate to Fallingwater,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other institutions, including the Guggenheim Museum and the
United Nations, have been approached but have not responded.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that it could cost $1 million to dismantle the
room, Lahteenmaki said. The porcelain tiles that line the walls _
setting the tone of textural sensuality at the entrance _ would be
especially expensive to take down and reinstall.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has expressed an interest
in incorporating the Aalto rooms into space undergoing renovation.
``But whatever we could do would never be as good as where it is,''
said Aaron Betsky, the museum's curator of architecture, design and
digital products, who spent his vacation touring Aalto works in
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   As Robinov handed over a sales brochure for condo space in the
building featuring the Kaufmann room on the cover, he hastened to
say that the building's owners were not going to throw the
conference space out. ``We don't want a frenzy,'' he said. ``It's
safe here as far as we can see.'' He added that he hoped that a
solution would be found within six months. The raw space could sell
for $75 to $80 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the New York City
Landmarks Preservation Commission, met with Robinov and acquired a
written agreement that the owners would do no work on the space for
90 days. During this time, the commission would not begin the
process of designating it a landmark, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a city as rich as this not to be able to save this
interior is scandalous,'' said Frampton, the architectural
historian, who continues to call to potential rescuers. Two weeks
ago, Donald Trump was contacted by Robinov. ``It would be a nice
amenity to his tenants,'' said Diana Gaines, an associate of
Robinov's, regarding Trump's condominium going up two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that although Trump appeared not to have heard of
Aalto when they met to discuss the project, and has yet to visit
the space, he quickly took up the proposal. ``I'm seriously
considering it for Trump Royal Tower,'' Trump said last week,
adding that it could go into one of the ``super spa areas.'' ``It's
not going to be easy. You're talking about sizes that don't fit.''
Trump said he plans to make a decision by next month.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Finnish Council maintains a watchful eye.
The ultimate option, Lahteenmaki said, would be to take the rooms
back to Finland. ``We're not going to stand by and see it
destroyed,'' she said.

SWEENEY FACES FULL SEASON WITHOUT BOURQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For a dozen years, when defenseman Don Sweeney would
arrive at Bruins training camp, there was one constant: Ray
Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since Sweeney's tenure began in 1988 that
Bourque, traded to the Colorado Avalanche in March, is notably and
permanently absent. But Sweeney said not having the former captain
around now isn't as weird as it was about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it felt strange when I was skating with him
beforehand (during informal practices in Salem, N.H.),'' said
Sweeney during a practice session in suburban Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I'd seen him in a Colorado Avalanche
practice jersey. Then, the strangest thing was when I knew he was
leaving on Wednesday and after we skated, you're sticking out your
hand and saying, `Have a good year and good luck.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque and Sweeney, both unrestricted free agents, decided to
stay put over the summer. Sweeney was assured by management that
the club was going to do everything it could to be competitive
again, which is what convinced Sweeney to remain in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think there's a lot of renewed optimism in the
fact that we're going to be healthier, starting with (Jason
Allison),'' said Sweeney. ``Not many teams in this league are going
to win without their No. 1 centerman.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little discussion about the missing free agents _
Joe Thornton, Anson Carter, and Sergei Samsonov _ but Sweeney, like
everyone in the Bruins' dressing room, believes they're an
important part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to see the other three guys because I think, without
saying anymore, they add a big part of our offense,'' Sweeney said.
``With Byron (Dafoe) and with Kyle (McLaren), those are big factors
in our lineup who weren't there for periods of time last year.
You're just not going to win without those horses. We've also gone
through a period of evaluation. We've seen where we have some
depth. With Cameron Mann, Andre Savage, Eric Nickulas just to name
a few. That's why you go through training camp and see if those
guys can re-emerge as players who can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bourque's trade, Allison talked about how it was time for
the club's young players to take over the leadership role and how
it hadn't been easy for them to assert themselves for fear of
stepping on toes. Allison said it wasn't because of anything
Bourque did, quite the contrary, it was just a bit intimidating
considering Bourque's immense stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it very well,'' said Sweeney, when asked if he
recalled the comments. ``Jason and I sat down and talked about it
because I thought the timing of it might not have been appropriate,
being the day after Raymond left, but the message was appropriate.
I think Ray was the first guy to say that. We'd be in a little bit
of a tailspin and he's say, `This is not my team. Look at Ally and
Kyle.' He was the first to say it. (The leadership) needs to be
spread around the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he believes the team has a terrific core of young
players, similar to the talent and leadership that were here during
coach Pat Burns's first season (1997-98).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we had that a couple of years ago but we lost that _
Tim Taylor, Dave Ellett, Ken Baumgartner, and Grant Ledyard,'' said
Sweeney. ``Things were in disarray a little bit. It was up to us to
correct that. I enjoyed reading (president/general manager Harry
Sinden's comments). It was a good analogy, that he brought a group
of individuals into training camp and it's up to them to make it a
team. It's part of Burnsie's responsibility, but that onus has to
be on us as players to go out and play together as a group. New
Jersey and Dallas have done it well. Colorado is looking to do
that, they have changed a few parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Sweeney was the Bruins' most consistent blueliner
last season. Partly because of injuries and the revolving door of
players, it was difficult for the team to have any cohesiveness.
Sweeney said he expects that to be much different this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got six guys who have played an awful lot of hockey in
the NHL,'' he said. ``We've got a pretty good blend of size and
Paul Coffey obviously adds an element since Raymond's departure
that we probably missed power-play wise and on the offensive side
of things a little bit. Now you've got a chance to move in Darren
Van Impe and Kyle and maybe Jonathan Girard into those offensive
situations with a little less pressure maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, as do Bruins' fans, knows that Feb. 21 in Colorado and
March 24 at the FleetCenter, he will be on the opposite side of his
close friend and former mentor. That likely will be even more
strange than when he wished him well earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray feels like (the Avalanche are) going to be together all
year and they'll be able to pick up where they fell a little short
last year,'' said Sweeney. ``He's really looking forward to it,
moving another step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Sweeney is too.

U.S. MEN OPEN OLYMPIC SOCCER COMPETITION WITH 2-2 TIE AGAINST
CZECHS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia _ Brad Friedel remembers the U.S. soccer
team that went to the Summer Games in Barcelona eight years ago.
``Two professionals on the entire team,'' he recalled Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   This time it is different. The United States started 10
professionals and one very impressive college forward, Conor Casey,
and outplayed the Czech Republic almost all the way in a 2-2 tie
Tuesday night in the opening round of the Summer Games tournament.
Soccer opens the Games competition despite the fact that the
opening ceremonies are not until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tie was definitely a blow to the Czechs, who lumbered and
labored to stay with the Americans for much of the night. A penalty
kick in the 52nd minute allowed the Czechs to break even, but they
treated the outcome as a loss. ``They got through our defenses all
night, no matter what we did,'' said the Czech coach, Karel
Bruckner.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has never won a medal in men's Olympic
competition, will now play Cameroon here Saturday and Kuwait in
Melbourne next Tuesday, but this was a huge point.
</P>
<P>
   Friedel, who is the reserve goalkeeper for Liverpool in the
English Premier Division, was called to the American team two weeks
ago when the regular goalkeeper, Adin Brown, was hurt. Friedel, 29,
and looking a bit grizzled with his fuzzy bleached crewcut, is one
of the team's three over-23-year-old players allowed under Olympic
rules.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know some of the younger U.S. players, but has been
impressed with forwards like Casey, from the University of
Portland, Josh Wolff from the Chicago Fire and Chris Albright from
DC United, both of Major League Soccer. The three put pressure on
the Czechs all night, with Albright and Wolff both scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MLS makes a huge difference,'' Friedel said afterward.
``This Czech team has lost something like two games in 17, and at
times we played them right out of the park. Our team is so much
better than in 1992. This proves that MLS is developing good young
players. Yet the European leagues will pay these Czech guys a lot
of money. They should be taking some of the American players,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedel remembers the discrepancy in 1992. The United States
opened against the Italian under-23 team, and he recalled:
``They've got guys playing in Serie A and I'm going back to UCLA to
play San Diego State. It's different now. Our guys belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Americans, coached by Clive Charles, began
moving the ball predominately on the left side and popping it in
toward the large forward, Casey, the only college player on the
squad.
</P>
<P>
   The approach paid off in the 21st minute when Wolff made a run
down the left side and fired a cross in front of the goalmouth.
Casey slid and failed to touch the ball, but Albright slid in from
the right and poked the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The United States held the lead for seven minutes until Marek
Jankulovski created a goal on his own, dribbling into traffic,
going right, faking Frankie Hejduk into an impromptu corkscrew, and
then dribbling left and firing a left-footed shot that Friedel
could not handle after his right foot slipped on the dewy grass.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans seemed recharged by the Czech goal and began
playing openly again. In the 44th minute, a long booming punt by
the keeper came back to haunt the Czechs when it was smartly
rebounded upfield. Casey controlled it on the left side, sent a
pass into the goalmouth that Wolff converted with his right foot
for a 2-1 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes into the second half, Chad McCarty, an American
defender, was called for taking down Marek Heinz in the penalty
area. Lukas Dosek converted the penalty kick for the fourth and
final goal of the match.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedel and Wolff nearly stunned the Czechs in the 64th
minute when Friedel spotted Wolff on the fly and made a
discus-thrower heave that put the ball in front of Wolff, who could
not quite beat the goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put it on a dime,'' Wolff said later. ``I just didn't
control it with my foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedel, who has great hand skills from his basketball days in
Ohio _ he could have been a walk-on at UCLA _ was proud of his long
throw, as well as the tie. The last time the United States won its
opening Olympic match was in 1984 in Los Angeles. The American team
has never even advanced to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of the doubleheader before a packed house of
24,800 fans, Germany defeated Australia, 3-0, in a women's match.
The American women, defending Olympic champions and 1999 Women's
World Cup champions, make their debut in Melbourne on Thursday
against Norway, the only nation to have an advantage in past
competition over them.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: A Plan for the national parks
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fog-shrouded Skykomish River served as a backdrop as George
W. Bush announced his plans in Monroe, Wash., today to fix up
national parks and protect endangered salmon. Bush said he would
push Congress to appropriate $4.9 billion over five years to pay
for a backlog of projects to fix deteriorating highways, repair
leaky roofs at tourist attractions and purify polluted streams in
national parks. He blamed the Clinton administration for rundown
parks, saying too many federal dollars were spent acquiring land
and not enough went to maintaining existing properties, leaving the
National Park Service with more property but less money to take
care of it.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY CLASS IN MAINE
</P>
<P>
   Returning his focus to education, Al Gore toured a high school
today in Lewiston, Maine, and declared that the importance of
lifelong learning is ``the single most important lesson the new
economy teaches us.'' To personalize his pitch, he spent a short
night at the home of local teachers, then met with Lewiston High
administrators, teachers and parents. ``I'm anxious to learn from
you,'' Gore told them before teaching a history class for nearly an
hour and talking up his higher education proposals at a rally. The
goal of Gore's swing was to hammer at his $170 billion proposal for
education, an issue that traditionally plays well for Democrats, in
an effort to counter George W. Bush's success promoting his own
education ideas.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD-GOVERNMENT GROUP SUES FEC
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of overhauling the campaign finance laws filed suit
in federal court today against the Federal Election Commission,
arguing that political party-financed ads in support of the
presidential candidates are illegal. The suit was brought by Scott
Harshbarger, head of Common Cause; ex- Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox and ex-Common Cause head Fred Wertheimer. The FEC has
refused to rule that the ads are illegal. Al Gore and George W.
Bush each received $67.6 million in public funds for their fall
campaigns after agreeing not to raise outside funds nor spend any
additional money, except for lawyers and accountants. The lawsuit
argues that both campaigns are violating the law by helping to
develop the massive political party-financed advertising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   GORE OPENS UP CLEAR LEAD IN POLL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has opened a 7-point lead over George W. Bush in the
latest Reuters/Zogby poll released today _ the first time his lead
has been outside the statistical margin of error. The poll of 1,005
people who said they were likely to vote in the Nov. 7 presidential
election found Gore leading Bush by 46 to 39 percent. Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader had 4 percent, and the Reform Party's Pat
Buchanan had 1 percent. Gore's lead was just outside the
statistical margin of error of 3.2 percentage points. The poll was
conducted Sunday through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   BOTH SIDES TO MEET ON DEBATE SET-UP
</P>
<P>
   Senior representatives from both major presidential campaigns
will meet Thursday to try to hammer out the number, dates,
locations and formats of the upcoming presidential debates. Al Gore
supports a proposal from the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates to hold three 90-minute presidential forums and one vice
presidential debate in October. All would be carried by the three
major TV networks, several cable outlets as well as public
television. George W. Bush had proposed appearing with Gore on two
TV interview shows and holding only one commission-sponsored
debate. He abandoned that stance last week, but the Bush campaign
now declines to spell out its position.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS BEGIN TO WONDER
</P>
<P>
   From Washington state, George W. Bush returned again to
California today to campaign, but some Republicans question whether
he is fighting vigorously enough for the nation's most vote-rich
state. Bush is taking a swing through Southern California regions
that are in many cases already Republican territory, including San
Diego, Irvine and Newport Beach. He is leaving the state Friday for
home just as California Republicans gather for their party
convention. Bush has shown little interest in boosting the
candidacies of fellow Republicans in California, even though the
party has signaled it is counting on him to lift its fortunes. In
interviews with the Associated Press, some Republican officials and
strategists expressed concern that Bush's efforts have been
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   WATTS TO BUSH: REV UP THE OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   A top House Republican said today that George W. Bush needs to
get back on offense after allowing Al Gore to control the political
ball the past three weeks. ``If you're on defense, you're probably
losing,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the House GOP
Conference chairman who was a University of Oklahoma Sooners
quarterback. Bush has struggled in recent weeks as Gore has pulled
ahead in some national polls and made races in some states
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   FARMERS AND THE ESTATE TAX
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney told farmers today that they shouldn't have to worry
about a federal estate tax when passing along the family farm.
Using a fourth-generation farm in western Michigan as a backdrop,
he told about 400 people about George W. Bush's plan to eliminate
the estate tax if elected president. ``We want to repeal the `death
tax,' `` Cheney said. ``We want to get rid of it.'' Wearing a
Michigan State University pullover, Cheney said it was part of
Bush's plan to return to the taxpayers about one-quarter of the
nation's expected tax surplus over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   YOU WANT A COMPLAINT? HERE'S A COMPLAINT
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic senators complained to the Federal Communications
Commission about the Republican ad that subtly flashes the word
``RATS'' across the screen. The ad is already coming off the air,
but Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and John Breaux of Louisiana asked
for an investigation in a letter sent today to the FCC. In 1974,
the agency adopted a policy saying that subliminal advertising was
contrary to the public interest. FCC officials said Tuesday that
they had not received a complaint about the GOP ad, but would
investigate if one were filed.
</P>
<P>
   DECRYING VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman decried a ``culture of carnage'' surrounding
America's young people and told a Senate committee today that the
government should stop the marketing of violent movies, music and
video games to children if the industry fails to police itself.
Lynne Cheney, wife of Dick Cheney and former head of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, espoused many of the same views as
Lieberman. But she took a swipe at the Democratic ticket, asking
that Lieberman and Al Gore deliver the message of accountability
when they attend a fund-raiser Thursday with Harvey Weinstein,
chairman of Miramax Films. She also decried the lyrics of rap star
Eminem: ``They could not be more despicable. They could not be more
hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON AN EASY PRIMARY WINNER
</P>
<P>
   Primary challenge behind her, Hillary Clinton looked to the fall
today. As expected, she swept past her little-known challenger,
soundly defeating Dr. Mark McMahon, an orthopedic surgeon, with 82
percent of the vote. Now she goes on tonight to her first debate
with Republican opponent Rick Lazio, who was unopposed in his
primary. The televised, one-on-one forum in Buffalo moderated by
NBC's Tim Russert, will give many voters their longest and most
substantial look at the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ALL UNDER THE BRIDGE NOW?
</P>
<P>
   In Selma, Ala., African-American businessman James Perkins
defeated Joe Smitherman, a reformed segregationist whose tenure as
mayor reaches back to 1964 _ a few months before civil rights
marchers were met at Edmund Pettus Bridge by troopers with tear gas
and clubs in a clash that became known as ``Bloody Sunday.''
Perkins received 6,326 votes, or about 57 percent of the vote, in
the nonpartisan runoff. Smitherman had 4,854 votes, or about 43
percent. Perkins said race wasn't a factor. But many voters thought
otherwise. ``This was the final step of the march over the
bridge,'' said Selma resident Burl Brown.
</P>
<P>
   UPSET IN THE MAKING IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   A 71-year-old ex-librarian is giving party-switching incumbent
Rep. Michael Forbes a run for his money in New York state. Regina
Seltzer, who raised $40,000 to Forbes' $1.4 million, was ahead by
39 votes of the 11,611 cast in unofficial returns Tuesday night.
Forbes said voting machines had been impounded for a recount that
would take several days. Forbes left the Republican Party last
year, saying the party had become too extremist. But Seltzer said
Forbes' opposition to abortion and votes to impeach President
Clinton proved he was no Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED MESSAGE ON GAY-COUPLES LAW
</P>
<P>
   Vermont voters had their first chance to weigh in on the civil
unions law _ and they sent a mixed message. Five Republican state
legislators who supported the law granting gay couples many of the
rights and benefits of marriage were defeated in their primaries.
One Democrat who opposed the law was also ousted. Four Republicans
and one Democrat who were targeted for defeat because they backed
the law survived their primaries. Another lawmaker who was
challenged for opposing the law was re-elected. It was the first
chance voters had to register their views since the Legislature
earlier this year enacted the closest thing in America to gay
unions.
</P>
<P>
   PACKERS TAKE IT IN FOR SCORE
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved a half-percent sales tax to help the Green Bay
Packers pay for a $295 million renovation of Lambeau Field, the
football team's home for the past 43 years. Brown County voters
favored it by 53-47 percent. The tax will provide a $160 million
public share for renovating and expanding 71,100-seat Lambeau
Field. The three-year project will add 10,000 seats, more bathrooms
and concession stands and a mall-like atrium.
</P>
<P>
   DELAWARE NOMINEE IN BY 46 VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Former Judge Bill Lee conceded the Republican gubernatorial
nomination in Delaware to former state Chamber of Commerce
President John Burris, whose narrow margin of victory held up after
a two-day review of the voting. Certified results of Saturday's GOP
primary showed Burris winning by 46 votes out of more than 27,000
cast, and the numbers stood after a recount. Lee plans to endorse
Burris, who will face Lt. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner in the Nov. 7
general election.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY'S PROFIT: $18.3 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney made an $18.3 million profit on the sale of 660,000
shares of Halliburton Co. stock late last month. It was a standard
divestiture of securities, and not connected to the election, said
his spokesman, Dirk Vande Beek. Cheney retired as chairman of
Halliburton, an oil services company based in Dallas, shortly after
being chosen as running mate by George W. Bush. ``These were
already vested options, and he cashed them in,'' Vande Beek said.
The 660,000 shares Cheney sold in August were valued at about $35
million, according to documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In June, Cheney sold 100, 000 shares for an
estimated $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   NADER FINDS COMEDY A TOUGH GIG
</P>
<P>
   The Green party's Ralph Nader pulled a rubber chicken from
behind a couch and choked it on Jay Leno's TV show to make his
point that George W. Bush and Al Gore are ducking debates with him.
The gag drew tepid laughter. Nader ended up in an impromptu debate
with a fellow guest, comedian D.L. Hughley, who was cracking jokes
at Nader's expense. ``I was actually thinking about a two-piece and
a biscuit,'' Hughley said, looking at the limp chicken. When Nader
said he would continue to fly coach class, Hughley said he wasn't
keen on the president sitting next to him. ``Hey, hand me the
peanuts, prez,'' Hughley mockingly asked. When Nader said 10,500
people attended his rally in Portland, Ore., recently, Hughley
fired back: ``In Portland, Oregon, they don't have nothing else to
do.'' The audience roared. Nader had to laugh, too.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY AND JOE _ TOGETHER IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   From the day last month that Joe Lieberman was selected as the
Democratic vice presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton has said
she would like to campaign with him as she runs for a Senate seat
in New York. On Friday, she will get her chance. Lieberman will
campaign with Clinton in New York City. Clinton and her strategists
have said they hope that some of Lieberman's popularity will rub
off on her, particularly with Jewish voters. Polls have Clinton,
who is in a tight race with Rick Lazio, leading among Jewish voters
by a margin smaller than New York Democrats usually need to win
statewide races. But those same surveys show Al Gore, helped by
Lieberman, leading George W. Bush by 20 points or more in New York.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S BACK TO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
</P>
<P>
   They sang, they danced, they laughed and they cried, but there
was no reprise of ``the kiss.'' Al and Tipper Gore headlined an
$800,000 Democratic Party fund-raiser in Camden, N.J., with stars
from the worlds of entertainment and politics. Bill Bradley,
defeated by Gore in the primaries, invited Gores to recreate the
lingering smooch Al delivered to Tipper on the night he accepted
the presidential nomination last month. Gore strode on stage and
played the moment, but settled for a demure kiss to Tipper's hand
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ALL WHO QUALIFY, LINE UP NOW
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush likes to say that anyone who pays income tax
would benefit from his proposed tax cut and has been trying to
dramatize the point by appearing with a supposedly typical family
at each campaign stop and crowing about the savings they would
receive under his plan. But becoming one of the ``tax families''
isn't that easy. An e-mail sent to New Mexico Republicans last week
said Bush was ``seeking two families in New Mexico to highlight his
plan for tax relief and prescription drugs.'' The qualification:
The family must make $35,000 to $70,000 a year, itemize its taxes,
have no children in day care, no children in college, no one
attending night school, no children younger than age 1, and ```no
substantial savings outside of 401(k).''
</P>
<P>
   CONTINUANCE FOR GORE'S SON
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's son won't be tried on speeding and reckless driving
charges until after the Nov. 7 election. Trial for Albert Gore III,
17, was delayed until Nov. 22 at the request of his lawyer, William
Brumsey III. It had been scheduled to begin today in Currituck
County, N.C. Brumsey said the presidential campaign wasn't a factor
in the delay. A defense memo said young Gore attends school in the
Washington area and a court date at the start of his Thanksgiving
break would reduce the loss of school time. The memo also said he
doesn't deny that there is a factual basis for the charges. The
teenager was charged Aug. 12 with driving 97 mph in a 55 mph zone
and reckless driving near the Outer Banks, where he had been
vacationing with his family.
</P>
<P>
   OH, THOSE CRAZY YARMULKES
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman, the nation's first Jewish vice presidential
candidate, has spawned another innovation: the country's first ever
campaign yarmulke. Zipple.com, a Web site devoted to Jewish
religion and culture, is selling the traditional Jewish skullcaps
emblazoned with the logo ``Lieberman 2000.'' Jory Rozner, the
company's president, said the idea came from the interest visitors
to the site expressed in Lieberman's candidacy. Rozner said she
wasn't concerned about the appropriateness of the Lieberman slogan,
adding that she has seen yarmulkes featuring Sesame Street
characters, the ``Rugrats'' and even one cheering on the University
of Michigan sports teams. ``People get crazy with them,'' she said.

&HT;     GORE LEADS BUSH AMONG KEY VOTING BLOCS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has widened his lead over
Texas Gov. George W. Bush among independents and among voters in
the $25,000 to $50,000 income bracket and has pulled even with Bush
among males, pollster John Zogby said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Gore is in the ascendancy and Bush is faltering,''
said Zogby, who is based in Utica, N.Y. ``I think he's at rock
bottom now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zogby said the race remains extremely close. ``If (Bush)can
get back on track _ and there's plenty of time to get back on track
_ we could be looking at a Kennedy-Nixon election.'' He was
referring to the 1960 battle when beat then Vice President Richard
Nixon by 118,574 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Zogby's latest poll of 1,005 likely voters questioned
Sunday through Tuesday shows Gore over Bush, 46 percent to 39
percent. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader had 4 percent and
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan had 1 percent. Zogby
conducted the poll for the Reuters news service.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 7-point advantage was a point higher than the last Zogby
poll, released Sept. 7. That survey showed Gore leading Bush 45.6
percent to 40.2 percent. Zogby's polls have a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore widened his lead slightly over Bush among independents. The
Wednesday poll showed him ahead of the Texan 43 percent to 32
percent in this category, compared with his 41.7 percent-to-33.8
percent lead last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the $25,000-$50,000 income group, Gore led Bush 51 percent to
34 percent this week. In last week's Zogby poll, Bush had a
razor-thin lead among these voters _ 45 percent to 44 percent. No
candidate since 1972 has won a presidential election without
carrying this income bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said Gore has consolidated his position with traditional
Democratic voters such as union members and minorities, and he said
the vice president's ability to ``make inroads among independents''
is an important gain.
</P>
<P>
   With male voters Gore made striking gains in Zogby's survey
Wednesday. He and Bush are now tied among men, at 43 percent each.
Men have tilted toward Republicans in recent elections, and in the
Sept. 7 Zogby poll they favored Bush over Gore 48 percent to 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby also said Gore leads Bush 48 percent to 38 percent in a
wide swath of Midwestern/Great Lakes states stretching from Ohio
west to Minnesota and south to Missouri. Analysts say these states
are a key geographic battleground in the election.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's poll, Zogby said, Bush led Gore in this region by
a narrow 47 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among parents with children under 17, Gore led Bush 45 percent
to 36 percent this week. In last week's Zogby poll, Bush led Gore
in this group by a narrower margin, 46 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like other pollsters, Zogby said Gore is consolidating his
support among women, particularly those who are independent voters.

A LITMUS TEST FOR ROMANTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many ways common and mysterious to use a book, from
reading to doorstop. But this summer a woman of my acquaintance
suggested one I had not thought of, although after some inquiries I
discovered it was not an uncommon convention or trick, albeit a
dangerous one. It is the book as litmus test, used mostly but not
always in measuring a lurking romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a boyfriend who wasn't an ideal choice and a potential
boyfriend who also wasn't an ideal choice,'' the woman explained.
Her litmus test had a rather charming absurdity about it. She gave
each man John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning risible
masterpiece, ``A Confederacy of Dunces'' (LSU, 1980), and that, in
fact, is what the two turned out to be. ``I wanted to see if they
cared enough about me to at least read a book I liked. I gave one
of them the novel a second time. Neither read it.'' She dumped them
both.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation led to an informal survey in which, for women at
least, two of the most popular test books were Tolstoy's tragedy of
a woman's faith in romantic love, ``Anna Karenina,'' and ``The Sun
Also Rises,'' Hemingway's so-called ``lost generation'' novel of
drinking, fighting, wandering and love-making among expatriates in
postwar Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For a woman who elected ``The Sun Also Rises,'' the novel was
not as absolute a measure as ``Confederacy'' but rather part of a
battery of tests. She described it this way: ``If they failed, I
didn't automatically dump them; I monitored them more carefully
about their sensibility. I liked the style and sensibility of the
novel's characters, particularly Lady Brett, and I wanted to see if
the guy could relate to a strong female like her. I even went to
Spain to give a guy a copy of the book. It was a bizarre little
dating test, and I ended up married to a guy who still hasn't read
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Several women used ``Anna Karenina.'' Melissa Bank, the
best-selling author, said that a friend of hers was involved with a
man who identified with Anna Karenina's husband, Alexei Karenin,
``a man of remarkably weak character who was bound by convention
and not the least passionate.'' One doesn't need to write fiction
to know how that relationship fared. Bank added: ``Once on a date,
I was talking to this guy about Anna Karenina, and he missed the
point of Anna driving to the train station. This didn't bode well.
I know you are totally separated from someone when they don't get a
book, or they love a book you thought was terrible.'' Pretty
unforgiving testing grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nan A. Talese, editorial director of her eponymous Doubleday
imprint, said: ``I've never directly used a book as such a test,
but I am very, very aware of what someone says about a book because
it says a great deal about themselves. You get a tremendous insight
into the character of people and their emotions from the books they
like.''
</P>
<P>
   So the book is pretty much established as an important psychic
tool, at least inferentially. One woman recalled that anyone she
had dated ``had to like Dickens because the importance of marrying
art to social justice was important to me, and if he didn't get
that he didn't get me. I gave `The Crisis of the Negro
Intellectual''' by Harold Cruse (William Morrow &AMP; Co., 1967) ``to a
guy who didn't get it, and I said, `I'm not sure about you,
buddy.''' She added, ``One guy never read novels, and I said to
myself, `Oh, my God, if I marry this guy our kids will lack the
genes for fiction.'''
</P>
<P>
   One woman, before marrying her second husband, gave him a
reading list of a novel each of Proust, Joyce and Henry James. ``If
he had not gotten through them, or said they were too boring, I
wouldn't have married him,'' she said. Actually, she read the Joyce
to him, ``and presumably he also read it himself.'' But she admits
she doesn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   There are variations on the book as litmus test. A female book
editor said that ``anyone who liked `The Bridges of Madison
County,''' Robert James Waller's 1992 wet-hanky read from Warner
Books, was off her list because of ``its terrible sentimental
dribble.'' But it must be admitted that there are others who for
the very same reason find it a must, and they made it a best
seller.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said that she was given a test book, Kenneth
Grahame's ``Wind in the Willows,'' to see ``if I would respond to
its magical quality. He gained points with his choice of the test
but lost points when he impregnated someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if it seems that using books as a relationship test is
mostly a woman thing, one male publishing executive recalled that
in his youth, ``Holden Caulfield spoke for me on some kind of level
and in making a new friend, male or female, I always managed to
find out early if they liked `Catcher.' If they didn't I felt a
little cooler toward them.'' He said that he read ``Catcher in the
Rye'' annually ``as an exercise'' until his mid-20s, when J.D.
Salinger's book stopped working for him at that intimate level. He
said that no book had replaced it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the litmus test is not a particular book but an
author. Jerry Howard, editorial director of Broadway Books, a
Random House Inc. imprint, said: ``If a person I am talking to
turns out to be a Don DeLillo fan, there's a good chance we are
going to get along because it indicates a quality of mind and a
certain appreciation of cosmic ironies. I love this guy's writing
so much I look for fellow admirers.'' Howard edited DeLillo's
``Libra'' when it was published by Viking in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for many the most basic test is simply whether the
other person ever picks up a book. Usually ``it's a woman asking if
she can be serious about a man who doesn't read at all,'' said John
Sterling, publisher of Henry Holt. ``It's not just what's your
favorite book. If he says `I haven't read one since ...' it isn't
going to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato said that books ``seem to be alive, but do not answer a
word to the questions they are asked.'' Clearly he was wrong. They
apparently answer a lot of questions about relationships.

 &HT;    ANIMAL ADVOCATES BACK BILL TO BAR SHIPMENT OF FIGHTING COCKS
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Animal welfare advocates urged Congress on
Wednesday to bar the interstate shipment of live birds for
cockfighting.
</P>
<P>
   They told the House Agriculture Committee they backed a
bipartisan bill that would close a loophole in federal law allowing
birds to be shipped to Louisiana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, the
only states where cockfights are still legal.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the United Gamefowl Breeders Association from
Texas _ which borders all three states _ and elsewhere urged the
panel to reject the bill, saying it would bring economic pain to
hundreds of thousands of family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society of the United States, a major supporter of
the measure, says cockfighting continues to take place in all of
the 50 states. It estimates there are more than 30,000
cockfighters, who rake in large undisclosed amounts of money from
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting birds so they injure themselves or kill one another
is the meaning of animal cruelty,'' Wayne Pacelle, senior vice
president of the Humane Society, told the committee. ``Cockfighting
is a gruesome, barbaric, and indefensible practice, and it should
receive no affirmation or approval from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the proposed legislation would help law
enforcement officials crack down on cockfighting in the 47 states
where it is banned.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, for example, one of 22 states where it is legal to
raise and possess fighting birds, people police believe to be
cockfighters often contend they are breeding the animals for legal
sale in other states or countries, said Lt. Sherry Schlueter of the
Broward County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Schlueter testified that even when police confiscate fighting
paraphernalia such as sparring muffs, blood clotting enhancers and
stimulants, prosecutors are often reluctant to press charges
because of the interstate transportation loophole.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 members of the United Gamefowl Breeders Association
who traveled from Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisiana and
Mississippi told the committee the bill could wipe out the gamefowl
business outside of the three states where cockfighting is legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will put breeders out of business,'' said Rep. Bob
Riley, R-Ala., a committee member who opposes the measure. ``You
are talking about disenfranchising a whole group of people who have
been doing this their whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns were also raised by animal breeders who travel
interstate with live birds to state fairs and other exhibitions.
Clell Agler of the American Poultry Association worried such legal
breeders would be ``unduly penalized and questioned.'' He also
pointed out there is no defining characteristic to differentiate a
fighting bird from one used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents of the bill said marked the beginning of an
attempt to ban all cockfighting, and perhaps other blood sports
such as hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a slippery slope between a back-door attempt to ban
cockfighting and other activities which members of this committee
support,'' said Rep. Chris John, D-La. ``It may be cockfighting
today, but it's bowhunting and fishing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, H.R. 1275, is a proposed amendment to the Animal
Welfare Act. It is sponsored by Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and
Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee approved a similar bill on
March 2.

 &HT;    GOP LOSS IN VETO FIGHT KILLS CHANCES FOR BIG TAX CUTS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans fell 16 votes short Wednesday in
their last-ditch attempt to override President Clinton's veto of a
bill that would have lowered taxes for all married couples.
</P>
<P>
   That ``absolutely'' killed any chances of big tax cuts this
year, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said after the 270-158 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Those voting to overturn Clinton's veto included 220
Republicans, 49 Democrats and one independent. Those upholding the
veto included 157 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Republicans lost a similar showdown over
Clinton's veto of their proposal to phase out the estate tax, which
they call the ``death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee, used lighthearted overstatement to sum up how
Republicans intend to exploit the issue in this fall's election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past six years, President Clinton has blocked marriage
tax penalty relief more often than Tiger Woods has won major
championships,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to pass laws, you want to pass bills that are
going to be vetoed,'' responded Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
the ranking Democrat on Archer's committee. The death of the GOP
bill, which would have cost $289 billion over 10 years, should
clear the way for approval of a more limited $89 billion ``marriage
penalty relief'' bill favored by Clinton and the Democrats, Rangel
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert and other GOP leaders said they would not consider
the Democratic proposal. While it would help all married couples
who use the standard deduction, the Democratic bill would help very
few of couples who itemize their deductions _ 25 percent of the
total _ the Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next choice on the table is paying down the debt,'' said
Hastert after the vote, as he posed on the lawn of the Capitol with
three recently married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The men in black tuxedos and the women in white bridal gowns
would have saved between $1,154 and $1,961 per couple under the
dead GOP plan. Republicans didn't calculate how much each couple
would have saved under the Democratic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Without debt reduction, each of those young couples would have
to pay about $190,000 in interest on the national debt during their
45 years in the workplace, Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the previous day he had asked Clinton to agree to
use 90 percent of the $268 billion surplus predicted for the next
fiscal year for paying off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated that he would go along, but only if that can
be fit into his own plan for paying off the national debt within 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's proposal would leave 10 percent, or about $27 billion,
available for tax cuts or spending increases to be agreed upon
between Congress and the White House for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. It wouldn't cover years after that.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said they believe any compromise
on the $27 billion will include $14 billion in tax cuts for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Both predicted that the $14 billion would include the first
year's portion of:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two bipartisan plans, including one re-wording some business
tax breaks so that they will conform with trade treaties, and
another prepared by Hastert and Clinton for ``community renewal''
tax breaks that encourage investments in poor regions and
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repeal of the federal telephone tax.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pension-related tax breaks, intended to make it easier for
people to save larger amounts in their tax-protected IRA or 401(k)
retirement savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some small-business tax cuts favored by Republicans, which
would be attached to a one-dollar increase in the $5.15 minimum
wage, which is favored by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' commented White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart. ``I think that (the Republicans) may be counting their
special-interest tax breaks before they hatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert told reporters he wasn't wedded to any particular split
of the $27 billion. ``As long as we set aside the 90 percent for
paying down the debt, you'd expect negotiations to settle the
details'' of how the rest is divided between spending increases and
tax cuts, he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's something irresistible about the designs of
Alexander Girard, and it's not just the bright colors and the big
patterns or the friendly folk influences and toylike motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The brass, glass-jewel suns for La Fonda del Sol, the
Latin-American restaurant that Girard designed for the Time-Life
building in 1961; the poster-graphic ``Palio'' fabric (and over 300
others) that he created for the Herman Miller Furniture Co. from
1952 to 1973; and the tropical-travel painted fuselages for Braniff
Airlines in 1965: the stuff looks happy.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the key to its appeal right now _ it looks like
news and not nostalgia. It's hot, not cool, at a moment when
contemporary taste has settled with a lengthening snore into the
industrial safety of mid-20th-century icons like the Eameses or the
ironic suavities of fashion: shag-carpeted Los Angeles boutique
hotels and the faux-Zen design stores in SoHo and TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   Girard, who died in 1993, was in love with living, and it shows,
in designs being newly reissued and in a retrospective of his work,
which opened on Tuesday at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design
Museum. It's design that has a face on it, like the folk toys
Girard collected: inviting, eager to share. You want to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   For all its playfulness, it's very grown-up, very adult in its
issues: the sophistications of going to good restaurants or
entertaining at home, the education in seeing other cultures on
holiday and knowing that common objects like plates or pillows can
make the world personal for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Eameses, American ambassadors of the power of ``good
design,'' traversed the globe to promote it. Girard, born in New
York City in 1907 and raised in Florence, Italy, was a diplomat of
the delight in domestic detail. With his wife, Susan Needham
Girard, he owned and renovated three houses, including a historic
adobe in Sante Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really interesting about him is how he integrated
fabrics, furniture, graphics, into interior design,'' said Donald
Albrecht, curator of the Cooper-Hewitt exhibition. ``It's the
ensemble of these things that is really remarkable. And all the
rituals of life at home are very important to him: the hearth, the
dining table, even how you store _ with elaborate displays of
utensils in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's utopia with a street address. ``Art is only art when it is
applied to living,'' said the designer, who trained as an
architect. He called himself a ``functionalist tempered by
frivolity.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his contemporary the graphic designer Paul Rand, who
created the company logo and corporate identity for IBM (the
alphabet-block-like ``Big Blue''), and who also illustrated books
for children, Girard introduced the pleasures of humor and whimsy
to the business of design, making them professionally respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Girard's savvy lack of cynicism _ his exuberant trademark, you
could say _ looks amazingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   With his undoctrinal mixture of modern, decorative and naive
elements, Girard practiced an eclecticism now well-known to
interior designers, but it is a source of discovery for recent
collectors of modern design.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ford, creative director of Gucci, grew up in Sante Fe, and
worked at the Compound, a restaurant that Girard designed. He was
later a friend, and remains a fan. Ford bought many of the
furnishings from the house when Susan Girard died, in 1996. It is
hard not to see the influence of Girard's ``opulent modernism'' in
Ford's fashion work: the clean, jetset cut and the brash materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Modernism is a stark aesthetic is just not true
_ people miss a lot of the fun,'' said Richard Wright, a dealer and
auctioneer in Chicago, who is assembling a body of designs by
Girard to exhibit in November at the Modernism show at the Seventh
Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in New York. Vintage textiles and
furniture from a line designed for Herman Miller in 1967 (it lasted
a year) have appeared sporadically for sale in the last few years.
Herman Miller for the Home re-introduced nine Girard fabric
patterns in 1998. Maharam, a New York fabric showroom, will
reintroduce six more in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is starting to open to decoration and Girard was
really blazing the trail there,'' Wright said. ``He was a master
colorist _ wild combinations and patterns. And at his core, he's
extremely good with composition. His style of juxtaposing folk art
and ethnic objects with a Modernist aesthetic became extremely
fashionable, and largely influenced the Eameses' famous house. The
feel of that house is very much like Girard. He had already done
his residence in Detroit when they were at Cranbrook.''
</P>
<P>
   Girard, who was a friend of the Eameses, collaborated with
Charles Eames in 1957 on a short film, made in Mexico, on the Day
of the Dead. He picture-edited the couple's photographs, helping
choose the images for their ``House of Cards'' playing-card toy.
The couples spent Christmases together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas must have been maddening,'' Albrecht said. ``While
they're trying to eat dinner, Charles and Ray are running around
photographing the Girards' beautifully set dinner table. `Charles,
sit. Eat.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, Girard returned to New York from Italy, as a young
architect. His second office, in Detroit, where he moved in search
of work in 1937, brought him to the attention of John Entenza, the
editor of the influential Arts and Architecture magazine. Girard
was introduced to Eliel and Eero Saarinen, the architects, at
Cranbrook Academy, where he also met the Eameses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Girard was asked to chose the 3,200 objects for the
Detroit Institute of Art's exhibition ``For Modern Living,'' a
showcase promoting accessible, affordable design for postwar Middle
America, and the precursor of the Museum of Modern Art's series of
``Good Design'' shows in New York, which Girard also worked on in
the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, recommended by Charles Eames and George Nelson, both
frustrated by the lack of modern textile designs available for
upholstering their furniture, Girard was asked by D.J. De Pree, the
chief executive of Herman Miller Furniture Co., to design fabrics.
A textiles division, which Girard headed, was created the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to understand how color could create so much
excitement, or controversy _ though the present historical moment
in design, dominated by unprepossessing shades of brown and gray,
could help explain the reaction to Girard's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a time when people got fainting fits if they saw
bright red,'' he said in an interview in 1983, speaking of the
1950s. Girard's vivid, '`untasteful'' blues, magentas, yellows and
reds broke with the prevailing, polite tradition of deadened ochres
and turquoises popular in interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really anticipating the '60s and '70s, and Op and Pop
Art,'' Albrecht said of the designer's use of color and pattern,
even in black-and-white schemes, which he employed with an
eye-catching exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Girard's most important residential commission, interiors for
and J. Irwin Miller's house in Columbus, Ind., in 1955, displayed
his talents on a large scale. The designer collaborated with the
architects Eero Saarinen and Kevin Roche, and landscape designer
Dan Kiley, to create broad, interior vistas and living spaces with
four distinct, color-sensitive seasons of furnishings, including
rugs, draperies, upholsteries, and storage. There are greens in the
spring; fire reds in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the outstanding innovator of color of his particular
time,'' Miller said in a telephone conversation last week. ``Mrs.
Miller said to Eero, `I don't want to live in the same house all my
life.' He said, `We've built you a neutral house, that can be
changed.' It was very much influenced by Sandro.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miller residence also includes Girard's inadvertent
signature in the evolution of the living room: the conversation
pit. The low ceiling height in the house was predicated upon
acoustics and the Millers' love of music. The designer suggested
sinking the central seating group, rather than disrupting the
dramatic horizontal lines of the architecture's open plan with
sofas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We constructed a model of it at a shop in New York,'' Miller
recalled. ``We sat in it and asked ladies in the shop to walk by,
to see if their skirts exposed too much.'' At home, the Millers
realized that they had an excellent view of the underside of their
piano from the pit. The designer painted it scarlet red.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Girard's most memorable commercial commission _ and for many,
his most sadly missed _ was La Fonda del Sol, a themed restaurant
conceived by Joseph Baum of Restaurant Associates. Girard was
recommended by Philip Johnson, who had created the Four Seasons for
Baum.
</P>
<P>
   La Fonda del Sol was Girard's love of folk art _ the joy that it
captured and radiated _ put on public display. The staff costumes,
designed with Rudi Gernreich, including ponchos embroidered with
gold suns; the potterylike place settings; and the 80 different
matchbooks, with their grinning high-noon faces; and the
checkerboard tiles of the open kitchen, with its chefs behind a
flaming grill were like a market day in Mexico, brought in a basket
to Midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that it is clearest why the simplicity of folk
tradition or craft would engage the empathy of modern design. It is
a humanizing lesson, still, for its latest audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Girards moved to Sante Fe in 1953, to more actively pursue
their interest in collecting. Their 100,000 folk art objects, which
Girard referred to as his toys, can now be visited at the
International Museum of Folk Art in the Girard Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The designer was asked in an interview why he collected folk
art. Was it inspiration?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as a way to recapture all the wonderful enthusiasm
and the spirit of discovery that we experience as children, but
generally lose as we grow older,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   It was a way _ design might be another _ of being happy.

 &HT;    Bush introduces $5 billion plan for national parksBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Wash. _ GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, eager
to get back on message, took his campaign to opponent Al Gore's
geographic and issue turf on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Washington state, Bush tried to highlight
the difference between Republican and Democratic approaches to the
environment, an issue that polls show is a Bush weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Bush campaigned in California, an electoral vote
megastate that polls indicate is solidly in the Gore column.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood along the Skykomish River here to pitch a $5 billion
national parks maintenance plan and assail the opposition's
philosophy and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has chosen to expand the
public ownership of land instead of tending to our parks,'' Bush
said. ``Their failure to make maintenance a priority has left our
parks at risk and at the breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested a 22 percent cut in maintenance funds in his
most recent budget request.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the use of our parks is increasing, the Clinton-Gore
administration has neglected their upkeep,'' said Bush. ``Under
this administration the parks are in worse shape than ever before.
Sewage runs untreated into the lakes and streams of Yellowstone
National Park. Civil War relics have been soaked by a leaky roof at
Gettysburg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his forceful, if sudden, interest in national
parks, Bush has not been an outspoken champion of state parks in
Texas during his two terms as governor. Reports by Texas A&AMP;M
University, the state auditor's office, the Texas Historical
Commission and the Legislature's Sunset Advisory Commission have
documented years of inadequate budgets, maintenance and land
acquisition. For example, San Jacinto Battleground and Monument, an
icon of the Texas revolution, needs millions of dollars for a
museum, visitors' center and landscape restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The governor acknowledged some of the problems in February when
he issued an executive order forming a conservation task force to
investigate and make recommendations. In his charge to the panel,
Bush noted that the state has ``an extensive system of state and
local parks that contribute directly to its quality of life, but
are currently overtaxed due to increased demand, aging
infrastructure and insufficient funding.'' The panel's report is
due Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was ready Wednesday with a counter-assault on
Bush's environmental record in Texas, including the state's
relatively low funding for state parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's anti-environmental record in Texas was real good for
polluters and real bad for families and children,'' said Gore
spokesman Douglas Hattaway. ``Under Bush, Texas is the most
polluted state in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attempt to score points on an environmental issue came as
polls continue to show Gore winning voters' confidence on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush was able to get widespread coverage and
discussion of his issue du jour. The National Parks Conservation
Association called it ``a bright spot in a presidential campaign
too often silent on environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Kiernan, the private nonprofit group's president,
also said the program would not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush has the beginnings of a good agenda for park
protection, but critical elements are still missing, such as
preservation of cultural artifacts, improvements in park air
quality, and the need to expand existing parks and even create new
parks to he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also prodded Gore on a key issue in Washington, which is
viewed as a swing state. There has been prolonged debate about
whether to breach dams, which provide hydroelectricity, in order to
protect salmon runs which are also a key economic component in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need to breach the dams to save the salmon,'' said
Bush. ``My opponent has refused to take a position on the issue of
salmon and the dams. . . . I think you deserve an answer. I think
you need to know where he stands on this important environmental
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for a ``salmon summit'' to discuss the issue.

 &HT;    CLINTON THREATENS JAPAN SANCTIONS OVER WHALE HUNT
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Firing a shot across the bow of the Japanese
whaling industry, the White House suspended Japanese access to U.S.
fishing grounds on Wednesday and threatened to hit Tokyo with trade
sanctions within 60 days unless Japan ends its seasonal hunt for
whales.
</P>
<P>
   In his first sanctions threat against Japan in five years,
President Clinton directed aides to begin drafting a list of
sanctions options with an eye toward implementing them unless Japan
stops killing whales in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're serious about this,'' White House chief of staff John
Podesta said at a news conference. ``We hope that the Japanese
government will reverse course on this, but the 60-day clock is now
ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government rebuked the White House, saying the
threats violate global trading rules and could undermine relations
between the giant Pacific allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is inappropriate and would immediately send a negative
message to world markets,'' the Japanese government said a
statement by the Japanese Embassy in Washington. ``We are strongly
concerned that any such sanction would adversely affect the trade
relationship between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government further threatened to file a suit
against the United States with the World Trade Organization, the
Geneva-based global trade court, if Clinton carries out his
sanctions threat.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta would not say what sorts of sanctions are being
considered, insisting that the matter is under review by the U.S.
trade representative and various other U.S. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever steps we take at the end of this process,'' said
Podesta, ``we believe we'll be able to defend within the WTO
process.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an annual hunt by Japanese whalers who kill several
hundred whales each year, citing the need for scientific research.
A global ban on commercial whaling permits limited whaling for such
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the meat is later sold, mostly to upscale Tokyo
restaurants specializing in whale dishes, U.S. officials have long
doubted the scientific value of the annual killings and have urged
Japan to use non-lethal methods instead. Twice, in 1988 and 1995,
the White House has charged Japan with undermining the global
whaling conservation regime.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's research argument wore particularly thin to U.S.
officials this year, when Tokyo broadened its self-described
research to include the killing of sperm whales, which can grow to
60 feet long, and the smaller Bryde's whales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting it plainly, Japan is killing whales in the name of
scientific research to satisfy a demand for whale meat in a few
high-end restaurants and gourmet boutiques,'' said Commerce
Secretary Norman Mineta. ``Our response must be clear and must be
decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta sent a letter to Clinton on Wednesday certifying that, in
the Commerce Department's view, Japan is engaged in activities that
undermine global whale conservation efforts as overseen by the
International Whaling Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The certification triggered a process wherein the president has
60 days to consider trade sanctions. In addition, the
administration placed Japanese vessels out of contention for rights
to fish for mackerel and herring in U.S. waters. Such rights are
expected to be granted, on a temporary basis, to the fleets of
other countries, before the fishing season ends this fall, as there
are surplus stocks of the fish in U.S. waters.
</P>
<P>
   The whale dispute is the sharpest to come between the United
States and Japan, this country's closest Pacific ally, since
Clinton threatened in May 1995 to slap $6 billion worth of
sanctions on Japanese luxury cars sold in this country. Those
sanctions never took effect, because the two countries reached an
agreement the following month on exports of U.S. autos and parts to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and a host of
other diplomats and heads of state appealed directly to Japan to
scrap this year's hunt, but Japan's whaling fleet set sail in late
July.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Japan intends to kill 440 minke whales this
year, along with 10 sperm whales and 50 Bryde's whales.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government said in its statement that it has scaled
back those plans, and a Japanese diplomat said the hunt is expected
to end in about 10 days.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The felon, the drug addict, the banker, the
dreamer, the staff sergeant, the next Golden Boy, a guy named Rocky
and another nicknamed Hawaiian Punch.
</P>
<P>
   They are the 2000 U.S. Olympic boxing team, and while they are
characters with rich personal stories, they are also considered the
strongest group of American Olympic boxers since the 1976 Games.
</P>
<P>
   When the boxing competition of the Sydney Games dawns Saturday,
the 2000 U.S. team will once again meet its arch-rivals, the
dominant Cubans, but they are also chasing the enduring memory of
the charismatic 1976 American squad.
</P>
<P>
   That team, led by Sugar Ray Leonard and the Spinks brothers,
Leon and Michael, won five gold medals in Montreal. This year's
team, with as many colorful personalities, is aiming even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has been in church praying for seven medals,'' said
U.S. coach Tom Mustin, though he did not specify gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long road back to respectability for the
Americans, who won just one gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the 1997 world championships in Budapest, we won just one
bout,'' the American team leader, Gary Toney, said Wednesday, ``Not
one medal _ one bout. But by last year's world championships, we
had won four gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   A change in philosophy has been credited with the improved
results as the U.S. team chose to compete more often
internationally. It has led to a seasoned, savvy and diverse team.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with welterweight Dante Craig of Cincinnati, who was not
even in boxing a little more than a year ago. After his mother died
of breast cancer in 1998, Craig had given up the sport and went to
work at a dry cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the fastest pants presser they had,'' Craig said.
``Seventy pants an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day his brother, Dion, came to him and said he had been
visited by their mother in a dream. She asked Dion to tell Dante to
resume boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Craig did just that and advanced to last year's world
championships, but a few days before he was to compete, he learned
that his three-month old son, Dante Jr., had died of a respiratory
infection. Craig, 22, pulled out of the tournament, then came back
again _ and in an upset qualified for a spot in the Olympic Trials.
He also had emergency root canal the day before the final bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My story is so unbelievable, I don't know if I believe it,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   American super heavyweight Calvin Brock has been boxing for 13
years, but with a college degree in finance he recently began a
management training program at a bank in his hometown of Charlotte,
N.C. During the spring, he asked his new bosses for time off in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the Olympics,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
   They asked how he got tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm going to be in the Olympics,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, who is 6-2 and 201, has had an enigmatic amateur boxing
career, including six losses in his first six fights. He has
certainly improved, even if he remains inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be showy, maybe people don't expect a lot of me when
they see me,'' Brock said, ``but I sneak up on people.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Michael Bennett is at the center of the Olympic
boxing tournament's most featured rivalry as he tries to unseat
two-time Olympic champion Felix Savon of Cuba. Bennett's path to
the Olympics, meanwhile, could not be more uncommon and his ascent
in the sport more meteoric.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two years ago, Bennett, 29, was serving a
sentence for armed robbery. Bennett had taken up boxing in prison,
then quickly adapted to the techniques and styles of international
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he and Savon, the six-time world champion, were
scheduled to meet in the world championship gold medal final.
Savon, protesting an earlier judging decision against a Cuban
teammate, refused to enter the ring. Bennett won in a walkover, but
he wants another shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about knocking off the king of the hill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett may be the best-known of the American fighters, but the
team is led by its smallest fighter, light flyweight Brian Viloria.
Viloria, also a reigning world champ, is the first Hawaiian native
on the boxing team in 44 years, and hence, his rather obvious
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaiian Punch isn't very original,'' the studious Viloria
said Wednesday in Sydney. ``But what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Viloria, who is 5-foot-4 and 106 pounds, is quick and powerful.
He began boxing 11 years ago when he was 8 years old _ mostly to
fend off his older brothers who kept stealing his toys. To
strengthen his hands, Viloria punched banana trees.
</P>
<P>
   Another reigning world champion is featherweight Ricardo Rocky
Juarez. He is named after Rocky Marciano, not Rocky Balboa.
</P>
<P>
   Olanda Anderson is the 27-year-old light heavyweight who was
added to the team when Michael Simms, the 1999 world champion in
the division, was thrown off the team for violating team policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight David Jackson is the American entry at 132 pounds,
although a year ago he weighed 174 pounds. Jackson had been living
on the streets of Seattle, battling drug problems. Retired from
boxing, he went back in the gym hoping the sport could save him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without boxing, I'd probably be dead,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Los Angeles, flyweight Jose Navarro was influenced
greatly by Oscar De La Hoya, a local hero and the 1992 Olympic
champion. With an easy smile, Navarro has been called the next
Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's saying a lot,'' Navarro, 19, said. ``I'm just getting
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Bantamweight Clarence Vinson, light welterweight Ricardo
Williams, Jr., light middleweight Jermain Taylor and middleweight
Jeff Lacy make up the rest of the U.S. boxing lineup, an engaging
team with high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk to us about the 1976 team all the time,'' Juarez
said today. ``Hopefully, we can win 12 gold medals.''

&HT;     GORE, BUSH RAID RIVAL'S FAVORITE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush staged raids on
their rival's centerpiece campaign issue Wednesday, with Gore
battling Bush for the role of education candidate and Bush taking
up the banner of conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying over issues took place as the Gore campaign turned
over to the FBI unsolicited documents and videotaped material that
had apparently been leaked from Bush's secret preparations for the
looming presidential debates with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The off-stage development took place as Gore, campaigning in
Lewiston, Maine, pressed his proposal to make the first $10,000 in
college tuition expenses tax deductible. Bush, appearing on the
banks of the Skykomish River in Monroe, Wash., announced a $4.9
billion cleanup of national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates pitched their campaign appeals on opposite coasts
as national opinion surveys underscored the closest election since
1980, with Gore holding a slight edge over Bush in the nationwide
popular vote and Bush holding a slight lead over Gore in the
state-by-state electoral vote.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolicited material on Bush's debate preparations had been
delivered Wednesday morning to the office of former Rep. Tom
Downey, D-N.Y., a Gore confidant helping the vice president prepare
for the expected debates. Gore campaign chairman William Daley
telephoned Bush chairman Don Evans to alert him to the development.
The material was turned over to the FBI to enable the agency to
determine if the information had been illegally obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, who briefly viewed the privileged material, withdrew
from Gore's debate preparations to avoid any question over misuse
of the material, Gore deputy campaign manager Mark Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign's swift turnover of the politically sensitive
material contrasted to 1980 when the GOP presidential campaign of
Ronald Reagan received secret material revealing the debate
preparations of President Jimmy Carter. The Reagan campaign used
the material to prepare Reagan for a showdown with Carter that
helped tip the outcome of the election in Reagan's favor. The
incident provoked a congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to seize the education issue from Bush by telling
teachers, parents and administrators at a high school in Lewiston
that his plan to make a portion of college tuition expenses
deductible would help 75 percent of the nation's high school
graduates pursue higher education by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a (high school) diploma is not the end of an education
but just the beginning,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal, part of a $170 billion plan to improve
education, calls for a series of federal actions and tax breaks to
help families bear the cost of college education with either a 28
percent tax credit or full tax deductibility for the first $10,000
of annual college or higher education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has devoted two days to touting his proposals for education
in hopes of blunting Bush's gains on an issue that has
traditionally favored Democrats. Voters rank education as their top
concern in the election, according to polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan was quickly dismissed by GOP vice presidential
candidate Dick Cheney as ``just financing failure.'' Cheney, the
former defense secretary who was campaigning in Michigan, said that
the Gore proposal provides ``more money for the bureaucrats'' than
schools and students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett, in a statement from
Austin, Texas, said that the Clinton-Gore administration had
presided over ``an education recession'' that permitted 68 percent
of fourth-graders in the nation's poorest schools to read below
their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett faulted Gore's proposed college tuition tax break,
saying it would only benefit families paying federal income tax _
potentially leaving out the college-age children of 29 million low-
and moderate-income families.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore tried to take back the education issue from Bush, Bush
laid claim to Gore's reputation as the conservationist. Recalling
the conservation launched by Republican President Theodore
Roosevelt _ who founded the national park system early in the 20th
century _ Bush vowed at the outset of a campaign swing to
Washington state and California that he would ``make conservation
an important commitment'' of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that, if elected Nov. 7, he would press Congress to
spend $4.9 billion over five years to finance a backlog of repair
projects at national parks. Bush faulted the Clinton-Gore
administration for spending too much money on acquiring new
parkland at the expense of maintaining land already under federal
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The White House ``failure to make maintenance a priority has
left our parks at risk and at the breaking point,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also challenged Gore to take a position on the politically
sensitive question of whether to breach federally-constructed dams
in the Northwest as part of an effort to revive endangered salmon.
Clinton deferred a decision on the dams pending the outcome of
alternative salmon recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, reflecting the position of farmers, shippers and power
users who benefit from the dams, favors federally-supported state
efforts to clean up salmon habitats without destroying the dams. He
visited a salmon pond known as Haskell Slough near Monroe to
spotlight the results of a $300,000 federal-state project that
enabled salmon to return to the area for the first time in 50 years
without throwing open the dams. Some environmentalists contend the
dams have imperiled salmon spawning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of command-and-control, we'll provide a helping hand''
because ``protecting our environment must be a shred
responsibility,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign struck back at Bush's bid to wear the mantle
of conservationist. Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway dubbed
Texas ``the most polluted state in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klain, a senior Gore adviser, cited the vice president's
efforts with Clinton to create 13 new national parks and to boost
the National Park Service budget. As governor of Texas, Bush had
allowed spending on state parks to rank 49th out of 50 states,
Klain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to parks, Al Gore has a record of achievement
whereas George W. Bush has a record of neglect,'' he said.

<P>
   Bush's effort on the west coast followed a furor on Tuesday over
a Republican Party campaign ad that flashed the word ``rats''
across the screen during criticism of Gore's proposal to expand
Medicare coverage to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Independent pollster John Zogby said that the Bush campaign
needs to overcome campaign setbacks _ such as the distracting ad
and earlier questions over Gore's credibility for raising 1996
campaign funds at a Buddhist temple _ in order to focus instead
upon potentially appealing GOP proposals to strengthen public
education and expand Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be positive on those kinds of issues,'' said
Zogby, based in Utica, N.Y. ``Those are the kinds of ads he should
be running. No rats, no Buddhist temple.''

MOGALL SHUTS DOWN AS WEB VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Software pioneer John Cullinane and former Boston TV
newsman Brian Leary have closed operations at Mogall Inc., the
business-to-business Internet venture they launched last summer,
and are working to repackage their product as corporate software.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cullinane said he is ``discussing a merger
with another organization,'' which he would describe only as a
company ``engaged in e-mail support services.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of 12 employees who worked in Mogall's leased office in
Watertown were laid off at the end of August, Cullinane and Leary
said. The office has been sublet to others and phone calls are
being rerouted to Cullinane's personal office in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Leary, the company's chief executive, and Matthew Morrissey, who
held the title of chief of staff, remain at work, overseeing work
to rewrite Mogall online service software so it can be sold as an
application for use with large corporate software systems.
</P>
<P>
   Mogall was founded last winter with a $2 million personal
investment by Cullinane, but couldn't raise more venture capital
after prices of many Internet and electronic-commerce stocks began
to plunge last March. Cullinane said he never intended to put more
money in himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mogall set out to be an online subscription database service
where companies could store data about clients, employees, vendors
and others and then retrieve it in ways that could provide new
intelligence for developing business leads.
</P>
<P>
   As Leary described Mogall last summer: ``We're talking about,
`who knows how to do what, who worked with the client before, who
has the relationship _ who can get us in the door.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Mogall was hosting local political, business, and media
figures at a kickoff cocktail party in June the company's future
was uncertain, Cullinane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plan that was geared to make money, but when you get
caught in a downdraft, that's it,'' he said. ``To me it was a roll
of the dice, and I learned a lot,''
</P>
<P>
   Leary said a Boston Globe article in July in which Cullinane
told about Mogall's touch-and-go status may have hurt fund-raising.
``It became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leary said Andersen Consulting, in Chicago, has shown strong
interest as a potential customer for a corporate ``enterprise''
edition of the Mogall software. He said Public Consulting Group
Inc. of Boston is also interested in marketing Mogall software.
</P>
<P>
   Leary and Morrissey are working at Dataware Inc., in Cambridge,
which wrote Mogall's core software. Cullinane said Dataware has a
stake in Mogall as a result of that work.

ARAFAT'S LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY WAS TO have been the day Yasser Arafat unilaterally
declared an independent Palestinian state in the absence of a
negotiated final-status agreement with Israel. But there has been
no peace accord and no unilateral Palestinian declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Arafat and his Palestinian Authority find
themselves in a situation of suspended animation, floating between
the compromises required for peace and the bravado of a gesture
that can only harm Palestinian interests. The reality is that
Palestinians and Israelis alike have no tolerable alternative but
to strike a bargain for peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this is what Arafat heard from the major powers he
consulted after his fruitless summer sojourn at Camp David. In
European capitals, but also in Russia, China, and India, the
Palestinian leader was told that of course his old friends support
him and the Palestinian cause but he needs to work something out
with Israel if he wants to bring into being a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the international diplomatic reality. There are also
chronological constraints of the political calendars in Israel and
America.
</P>
<P>
   As Arafat must know, even if he refuses to acknowledge it in
public, the committed mediator who presided at Camp David,
President Clinton, will soon be replaced. The chances are his
successor will be either less willing to press compromises on
Israel or reluctant to entangle his new administration in the tar
baby of Mideast peacemaking for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for political change in Israel are, if anything,
even less promising for Arafat. If the aging Palestinian leader
does not come to an agreement with Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the
next six or seven weeks, Barak may be replaced by a more
intransigent successor, or he could return to office with a secular
coalition that includes the hardline Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Arafat can hardly expect to receive better terms
for a negotiated agreement than those that are now on offer. He may
obtain more concessions from Barak in the next few weeks than he
received at Camp David, but he cannot count on pocketing any
concessions at all if he does not strike a peace deal by November.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat wants anytime soon to declare a state that is
recognized internationally and financed by wealthy Western and Arab
backers, he will have to seize a fleeting political moment and be
decisive.

RATED R, FOR RISKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONLY THE ENTERTAINMENT moguls can save us now. They're the ones
marketing R-rated movies, racy music, and shoot-and-splatter video
games to youngsters. And they're the best ones to change these
marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   If self-regulation doesn't happen, Vice President Al Gore has
threatened to take government action. That could be a low-budget,
horror-movie disaster _ with clumsy government wonks trying to
balance free speech and child-friendly speech.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the entertainment industry could save itself and the
First Amendment a lot of trouble by cleaning up its own act.
</P>
<P>
   The issue shook the country last year after the tragic Columbine
High School shooting. President Clinton asked the Federal Trade
Commission and the Department of Justice to determine whether
movies, music, and video games with violent content were being
marketed to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Released on Monday, an FTC report concluded that the answer is
``plainly `yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't news to frustrated parents who have been to G or PG
movies only to find that the previews are for R-rated flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing plans can be disturbingly explicit. One music company
identified its audience as ``Alternative/urban, rock, pop, hardcore
_ 12-34.'' Sometimes labels meant to warn parents end up as signals
to youngsters that this is a must-have item.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike music and movies, the games industry does consider
marketing inappropriate products to children to be a violation of
its self-regulatory code. But violations are common.
</P>
<P>
   What can the entertainment industry do? Disney is adapting its
policies. Entertainment executives attended Senate hearings
Wednesday. The industry should take other steps, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Stop marketing adult products through underage venues.
</P>
<P>
   --Set up a marketing code with real sanctions for offenders.
</P>
<P>
   --Do regular audits of ad placements.
</P>
<P>
   --Carefully develop public service announcements that feature
children and teenagers talking about how they think entertainment
violence affects real life. These messages probably won't advise
anyone to ``just say no.'' But they could bring missing insights to
the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   --Improve advisory labels and educate parents about them.
</P>
<P>
   --Enforce rules about refusing to sell certain products to
underage buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers should have their free speech and spare children
too _ because everyone will lose if this becomes government work.

 ARCHDEACON0914-COX &HT;    Sites in Sydney are worth seeing, as are the people
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ My first morning on the other side of the world, I left
my small room in the sprawling Olympic Media Village _ which
previously was a mental hospital, an appropriate place for the
press, some say _ and immediately was greeted by raucous chatter
coming from the fronds of the nearby palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   King parrots, which fly around here in the wild, were
everywhere. So were a few sulphur crested cockatoos and a flock of
lorikeets.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to my room in the moonlight, I heard a
thump...thump...thump on the other side of the fence flanking the
walkway. Studying the figures munching the underbrush in the eerie
glow, I realized several kangaroos _ including a mother with a joey
_ were having their late-night snacks.
</P>
<P>
   For all the exotica that bookended my first day in Sydney _
where the 2000 Olympic Games open Friday night _nothing quite
matched the spectacle that came in between. Long ago, Rudyard
Kipling called this place ``the city of pictures'' and now _ like
then _ the best portrait comes at the Sydney Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the monorail to the waterfront, you reach Circular Quay,
a series of piers from which cumbersome ferries, hydrofoils, water
taxis, racing yachts, luxury liners and myriad vessels continually
pull in and out so that the watery expanse becomes an ever-changing
tableau of sights and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who come through here say this is the best
harbor in the world,'' said Neva Williams, who pilots ferries
across the harbor. ``I never seen the other ports of the world, but
I can't imagine something better than this. What could you not like
about this?''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine, unless maybe you were one of the
Olympic triathletes who will paddle through these waters this
weekend. After all, in the past two months, there have been at
least nine incidents involving sharks in and around Sydney Harbor.
Off the harbor beach of Athol, a 61-year-old swimmer had his leg
chomped on and needed stitches. On the Parramatta River that
channels into the harbor, a boat load of high school rowers was
attacked by sharks. And at a nearby ocean beach, two boys were
knocked from their Boogie Board by a bulldozing shark.
</P>
<P>
   Granted none of this is quite as dramatic as the incident in
Queensland last month when a human head _ thought to belong to a
local fisherman who had fallen from a trawler _ was found in the
belly of a 97-pound flowery cod caught off the Great Barrier Reef.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Martin, head of the dive team that will accompany the
triathletes, scoffed at all that shark and cod talk. He said he and
his divers will be wearing something called Shark Pods strapped to
their dive tanks and ankles. He said the devices will emit
electrical fields that repel sharks within a seven-meter radius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a little nerve wracking if you think about it,''
American triathlete Hunter Kemper said. ``But how many times do you
hear of a guy getting eaten by a sharks. It doesn't happen, does
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the ocean and I really
don't like sharks. That's why I don't wear clear goggles. Out of
sight, out of mind. I don't want to see what's beneath me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither will anyone else. They'll be too busy looking up at the
two masterpieces that put a pair of exclamation points on this
harbor. On one headland jutting out into the water is the Sydney
Opera House, whose glorious white-tiled arcs and vaulted shells
spread like sails against the blue skies and glimmering blue
waters. Across the water is the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the world's
largest steel-arched bridge, a towering monstrosity that is longer
than five football fields. For about $100 Australian _ after being
fitted with a special moon-walk type suit, being instructed for an
hour and harnessed to a safety line _ you can scale it for an
unparalleled view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the bridge and the opera house is the Writers' Walk
that honors authors linked one way or another to Sydney. As Robert
Louis Stevenson put it: ``There is material for dozens of
buccaneering stories to be picked up in the hotels of Circular
Quay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, in Aussie speak, are pubs and they are everywhere along
the waterfront, especially the area called The Rocks _ the oldest
area in the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was here - at a 150-year-old hole in the wall called the Hero
of Waterloo - that I stumbled upon a colorful character named Dick.
He wore a beat-up bush hat with sunglasses propped atop it, had a
long, flowing ZZ Top beard and a schooner of ale in one fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bar right here is where the (press) gangs used to whack
unsuspecting landlubbers like yourself on the head,'' he said.
``They'd push them down a trapdoor out back and next thing they
knew, they were out to sea. There's a lot of history right here on
these streets.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the area where the first 11 ships from England _
carrying 736 convicts including 188 women _ disgorged that night in
1788.
</P>
<P>
   They made their presence known on that first night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond my ability to give a description of the scene of
debauchery and riot that ensued that first night,'' the ship
surgeon noted in his diary.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Australia began.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know something, mate,'' Dick said. ``Almost none
of those prisoners ever went back to England once their sentences
were done and their chains were taken off. And none of the children
from those convicts went back to the land of their parents' either.
Once you spend some time here, you don't want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with him. He showed up here from Melbourne
several years ago, got a job doing repair work beneath the bridge
and hasn't left since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I? I got it all here,'' he said. ``I live down the
street and I come in here every night with my mates.''
</P>
<P>
   He touched on a concept that differentiates this city from most
of its American counterparts. Sydney is a high-tech place, where
most everyone _ except Dick _ seems to be chatting on a cell phone.
A lot of the people seem especially Internet savvy, too, while in
America, technology seems to distance people from each other _
keeping them at home and conversing by computer. People here like
rubbing shoulders with their friends. They fill the beaches, the
sidewalks and especially the pubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about being a mate, `` Dick said. ``That's what this
country's built on. Convicts made it through by having a mate to
count on. It's the same for people in the bush. You survive if you
got a mate to count on. That's why, for generations, we've called
each other mate. These days it's gone from work to fun, too. ``
</P>
<P>
   With that openness comes more tolerance in some areas. Nudity is
less of an issue with 60-some topless beaches, a few totally nude
and several of Australia's Olympians posing sans clothes for
everything from calendars to a coffee table book.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams said when she saw one of the Matildas _ the
Australian women's soccer team that posed nude for a calendar last
year: ``Goodonya'' - an Aussie term that signals approval.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitution is legal, though the other night four hookers and
their madame showed up at the media village and caused a real stink
when they passed through the security checkpoints _because they
were credentialed _ and worked the bar several hours before they
were kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is legal too and every pub has slot machines and there
are 20 times as many pokies (poker machines) here as in America.
</P>
<P>
   That explained Australian water polo player Debbie Watson's
openness: ``You should be allowed to bet. If I could get the right
odds, I'd put a fiver on our water polo team for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with gambling, sport is like religion here with Australian
rules football, rugby, cricket and, Olympic swimming, too, all
drawing backers as obsessed as those Dawg Pounders in the Cleveland
Browns years of a decade past.
</P>
<P>
   As I readied to leave the Waterloo _ by the front door, not the
trap _ Dick told me to take out my camera, so we could get a
picture together. With that, he turned away, swept his beard up
over his face, tucked it into his hat, then turned around and fixed
his hair-covered face with sunglasses and a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd YOU? think of that?'' he howled to the delight of
others nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As Kipling's claim came to life right before my eyes, I could
only think of one thing to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodonya, mate.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On the day that Palestinians had hoped to declare
their state, some feuded among themselves instead, blocking
intersections, burning tires and hurling stones at cars in the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   But the mini-uprising, reminiscent of those against Israel, had
nothing to do with disappointment that this date, meant to be so
significant, was to come and go without either peace or a state.
Gazans are used to disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the row grew out of a power struggle among members of
the Fatah organization of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Many Fatah loyalists now fill the ranks of Arafat's security
forces, and they tend to be more loyal to their commander than to
Fatah itself. This has caused tensions, and the latest one began as
a petty dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazan Accountants Association held elections last week, and
Fatah emerged victorious. Fatah members gathered in the streets of
Gaza City, shooting their weapons to celebrate. The police, who are
also Fatah, were called. They arrested several of the celebrating
accountants, and several others said that they had been roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   After that incident, both sides claimed the other had kidnapped
some of its men. The rancor grew into Wednesday's rioting, which
sent plumes of black smoke into the air and rocks flying at cars
with the red license plates of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   In its account of the event, Fatah blamed everything on Moussa
Arafat, the head of police intelligence, who many think is a
divisive force. A leaflet warned him ``not to sink our society with
his cheap internal battles,'' saying he would be ``the address of
our next battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask President Arafat,'' the leaflet said, ``to remove this
cancer from our national body so we will be able to build our
independent state with its capital in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussa Arafat could not be reached for comment. Other police and
security officers noted that the forces acted with restraint
Wednesday, letting the scene play itself out and not using their
weapons to disperse the rioters.
</P>
<P>
   The episode distressed many Palestinians, who said they would
have understood demonstrations against Israel or over the decision
to delay statehood. ``But who the heck needs internal conflict on
this date in particular?'' one Gazan journalist asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Central Council voted last weekend to defer
making a declaration of statehood Wednesday in order to give the
peace effort another couple of months. Sept. 13 was chosen as the
deadline because it was the date set by the most recent interim
peace agreement for accomplishing a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That deadline was also broken. But talks, which are deadlocked
over the seemingly intractable issue of Jerusalem's status, are to
begin again on Thursday in Washington, where senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators will meet with American mediators,
according to Israeli television. Discussion on the issues are
expected to pick up where they left off at Camp David in July,
although both sides fear that there has been backsliding from the
concessions that were on the table then.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to give the peace effort more time, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, whose government is in shambles, is working this week to
build a minority center-left coalition of 50 members of parliament.
He is counting on the 10 Israeli Arab members of parliament to
support his peace moves from outside the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions are running high after a police crackdown on the
Islamic Movement party and a move to shut down a quarry in Nazareth
that employs many Arabs.

 &HT;    MP3.COM, BESET BY LAWSUITS, FINDING NEW WAYS TO DO BUSINESS
 &HT;    With ONLINE-DATA.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ While battling to stay alive at the center of the
controversy over copyrights, online music pioneer MP3.com Inc. has
been quietly redirecting its focus to less controversial _ and
potentially more profitable _ ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   So far, MP3.com isn't making much money off the new products,
which range from a Muzak-like service for retailers to a children's
channel where computer users can listen nonstop to songs like
``B-I-N-G-O'' for a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   But they're an indication of where the company _ and the online
music industry in general _ may be headed after devastating
lawsuits by big recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are the innovators,'' said Credit Suisse First
Boston Corp. analyst Heath Terry said of MP3.com. ``These guys come
out with a new idea, and three months later some Internet company
starts something exactly like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was MP3.com's pioneering of a service that lets
music listeners store _ and in some cases, exchange _ copyrighted
music on the Internet that got the company in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge in New York ruled that San
Diego-based MP3.com willfully infringed on the copyrights of
Universal Music Group, setting the stage for what could amount to
$118 million or more in damages. The ruling came a month before a
federal appeals court is due to decide the fate of Napster Inc.,
which also was found guilty of infringing on recording companies'
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, MP3.com founder and Chairman Michael Robertson
said he is still hoping to negotiate a settlement with Universal
before final damages are calculated in November. And, he said, the
company plans to reintroduce its bread-and-butter MyMP3.com service
within the next few weeks _ albeit this time with licensing
agreements from four other major recording companies in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, MP3.com also is turning its attention
toward new products that could help bring in badly needed revenues
should MP3.com be forced to pay a big damage settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried to do is define our legal team and put them
in a separate cage and said hey, we're going to move ahead,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's distracting. But even though in the last six months
we've been mired in all this legal action, we've been rolling out
new products, new technology _ and that's something I'm proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen, of course, is whether MP3.com can
generate any profits from the new ventures. Robertson said he has
no set goals for the new businesses, and doesn't know when they
might be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has more than $300 million in cash, like
many Internet companies it's still struggling to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this year, the company took in $38
million in revenues, but lost $195 million _ in part because it put
aside $150 million to settle its copyright suits. Its stock price
is down about 80 percent from a year ago, closing Wednesday at
$5.38.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers say the initiatives are just another sign
of the company struggling to find direction and survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the legal prospective, I think this is just (Robertson)
casting around for business model number three or four or whatever
number this is,'' said Jim Penhune, an analyst with the Yankee
Group research firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, MP3.com gets almost all its revenues from selling
advertising on its Web site. The new services would bring in
outside revenues from more predictable sources.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new products MP3.com is banking on is a service that
allows retailers and others to get customized music piped into
their stores and offices over the Internet. By the end of the
month, Robertson said the company will have 100 customers paying
anywhere from $30 to hundreds of dollars a month for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this you can have not just different flavors of music but
different flavors of (customized) advertising, depending on where
you are and what you sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Rubio Restaurants Inc. recently inked a deal to
use the MP3.com service in its 126 Mexican-style restaurants in
five states. Vice President Richard Rubio said the service is 40
percent cheaper than its current music provider, Muzak, and lets
the restaurant chain custom-pick its music.
</P>
<P>
   Another retailer, the PETCO pet supply chain, is expected to
complete an agreement in a few weeks to put MP3.com music in its
500 stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com also is pushing hard to expand its growing radio
service, which sells pre-formatted music used typically to fill
space in odd hours by nearly 200 radio stations, including
major-market stations like Atlanta's WBTS-95.5 and 99.5 Kiss FM in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   It also is experimenting with new products, including a service
it recently began testing with Qualcomm Inc. that would let users
listen to customized digital music in their cars and on their cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology marches forward,'' Robertson said. ``And as we're a
technology company, we must seize the opportunities as they come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of all its initiatives is what MP3.com claims to
be the biggest collection of digital music on the Internet, with
more 562,000 songs from more than 87,000 artists that it legally
owns the rights to use.
</P>
<P>
   With the new services, MP3.com is simply finding new _ and less
controversial _ ways to use that music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've already built this big library, I can really maximize
that same investment through subscription channels, the retail
model, whatever I want,'' Robertson explained.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com's new children's channel, for instance, contains songs
that the company has already paid to use. The channel _ akin to
digital music channels offered by digital cable companies _ costs
subscribers $4.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent licensing agreements, much of MP3.com's music
still is by little-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   But that typically doesn't matter with preschool kids and
restaurant patrons, or listeners who tune in to radio stations in
the middle of the night to hear new artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals is to give an authentic flavor to our
customers,'' said Rubio, the restaurateur. ``But I could listen to
a number of mariachi songs and I couldn't tell you who the artist
was.''

INKTOMI TO ACQUIRE FASTFORWARD NETWORKS IN $1.3 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Inktomi Corp., which specializes in Internet
infrastructure, said Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire
FastForward Networks Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $1.3
billion. FastForward, based in San Francisco, has developed
software technology for the distribution and management of live
broadcasting over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Inktomi, which is based in Forest City, Calif., fell
$2.25, to $108.75 in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisition was a logical one, which fit
Inktomi's strategy of expanding the capabilities of its network
services business.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi's network service products are aimed at improving Web
performance through the more efficient distribution of content, and
are typically bought by large Internet service providers like
Digital Island and Exodus Communications. Some major Web sites also
use Inktomi's network services to improve speed and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The core product of Inktomi's network services business is
Traffic Server, a software application that runs on servers
deployed around the Internet, monitoring network traffic and
storing frequently requested objects closer to the user. Traffic
Server is a Web cache, performing a similar function to the onboard
memory added to microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Brosseau, an analyst with SG Cowen, said the deal was
similar to Inktomi's acquisition last year of Webspective, a
company with a technology for managing the delivery of content over
networks. Adding this capability to Traffic Server, ``added the
intelligence to put the content into the caches in an intelligent
way and keep it up to date,'' he said. FastForward ``does the same
thing along a different direction, expanding the kinds of media
they're able to support.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet infrastructure companies like Inktomi have to broaden
their offerings to match the demand for rich media delivered over
the Web. As users come to expect graphics, animation, audio and
video, the need for higher performance increases exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that live broadcast and live streaming are going to
be a real factor on the Internet, and it's going to be very soon,''
David Peterschmidt, Inktomi's president and chief executive, said
in a telephone interview. ``These guys are just a real jump ahead
of anything on the market today.''
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi made a minority investment in FastForward last year,
along with America Online and Sun Microsystems. ``The more we
talked with them, the more I felt that this was a company that
reminded me of Inktomi two years ago,'' Peterschmidt said. ``It's
deep in scientists and engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   FastForward's technology has already been deployed by Digital
Island and Real Networks Inc., and Peterschmidt said the
acquisition would add $30 million to $40 million to Inktomi's
revenues in fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   FastForward's staff will remain in San Francisco, where they
will be joined by other members of Inktomi's live media group, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   FastForward Networks will operate under the Inktomi name as the
media division withAbhay Parekh, FastForward's co-founder,
president and chief executive, as general manager. All employees of
FastForward Networks will join Inktomi.

REPORTER WHO COVERED MOTORCYLE GANG SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds. Hells Angels is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A Quebec journalist known for aggressive coverage of
the Hells Angels and their bloody campaign for control of the
Canadian drug trade was shot and wounded Wednesday outside the
offices of the newspaper Journal de Montreal, where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal police described the shooting as an ``assassination
attempt,'' but stressed that it remains unclear if 55-year-old
Michel Auger was the victim of one of the biker hit squads that in
recent years have turned Quebec into a free fire zone, with many
killed in shootings and car bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush of Auger came only a day after Quebec's public
security minister made a highly unusual appeal to the Canadian
government to suspend certain constitutionally guaranteed civil
liberties to give police in the province greater leeway in fighting
the Hells Angels and their biker arch-rivals, the Montreal-based
Rock Machine.
</P>
<P>
   The attack also came a day after the Journal de Montreal
published Augur's two-page investigative piece probing the battle
between Quebec's biker gangs and the Mafia. Among other things, the
story identified prominent warlords living anonymously in some of
the city's most exclusive neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist was shot in the back and shoulder by assailants
in the parking lot of Journal de Montreal, largest-circulation
newspaper in the largely French-speaking province. He was able to
call 911 on his cellphone to summon medical assistance after the
late morning attack. The journalist remained in stable condition
under heavy police guard Wednesday night at Montreal General
Hospital
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has regularly assigned bodyguards to Auger in the
past, but he reportedly drove to work unaccompanied Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Auger had received numerous death threats during more
than two decades of covering organized crime, the targeting of
Canadian journalists by gangsters is extremely rare
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrage,'' said Journal editor-in-chief Paule
Beaugrand-Champagne. ``An attack against a journalist is an attack
against the free flow of information. And that's an attack against
the foundations of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A burning car was discovered a few blocks from the newspaper
offices after the shooting. Torching getaway vehicles in order to
destroy evidence is a trademark of Quebec biker gangs, but police
refused to speculate beyond saying the car was probably used by
Auger's assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Auger has been the top crime columnist at the tabloid newspaper
for the past 17 years, respected by both police and other
journalists for his in-depth reports on organized crime, especially
the biker gangs battling for control of drug trafficking,
smuggling, prostitution, auto theft, and other rackets worth tens
of millions of dollars in Quebec alone.
</P>
<P>
   The past decade has seen the Hells Angels emerge as a dominant
organized crime presence across Canada, with chapters in every
province except Ontario and tiny Prince Edward Island. In Quebec,
the gang known simply as ``les Hells'' has been locked since the
mid-1990s in a murderous war of attrition with the Rock Machine, an
outfit that serves as a sort of front line force for the Mafia and
other crime groups that have united against the Hells Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Quebec war is the bloodiest in the 52-year history of the
world's most infamous biker bunch. More than 100 people _ mostly
gang members, but also civilians cut down in the crossfire _ have
been killed by bomb blasts, wild street shootouts, and midnight
executions across La Belle Province. Scores more have been maimed
or seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate has the situation become that Quebec Public
Security Minister Serge Menard on Tuesday asked the federal
government to suspend constitutional freedoms to allow the province
more leeway in fighting the Hells Angels. Specifically, Quebec
wants authority to outlaw membership in biker gangs, an
extraordinary move that Menard himself acknowledged goes against
liberties guaranteed by Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
equivalent to the US Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is thought to be reluctant to act on
Quebec's appeal, but if biker gangs prove to be behind the shooting
of Auger, heavy pressure could mount on Ottawa to invoke the
country's seldom-used ``notwithstanding'' clause and suspend
guarantees of freedom of association and other rights.
</P>
<P>
   Auger's hard-hitting reports are known to have aroused the wrath
of Maurice ``Mom'' Boucher, widely seen as the most powerful Hells
Angel honcho in Quebec. But the reporter also angered the Rock
Machine and Montreal's Mafia bosses with exposes of shifting
alliances in the crime world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michel's job involved making enemies of some very bad men,''
said a police investigator with a Canadian anti-biker unit,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He angered lots of dangerous
people, not just the Hells.''

months ago, the young shipwreck survivor was perhaps the most

custody fight between his Miami relatives and his Cuban family,
Elian became a symbol of the decades-old conflict between communist
Cuba and its capitalist neighbor to the north. Now he is just

   FOOD-LATE _ It's 5:30...do you know what's for dinner? If you're
stuck in rush hour and you haven't the foggiest idea, you've no
doubt got lots of company. But if you think your only alternative
is takeout or something dumped out of a can, think again. With the
help of five notable metro Atlanta chefs who took our 5:30
Challenge, we show you how to get a delicious made-from-scratch
dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes, with a recipe that
uses no more than 5 ingredients that requires only the simplest of
sides. With these streamlined recipes, you also spend less time in
the supermarket and washing dishes afterward. What more could you
ask for on nights you long for the comfort of a home-cooked meal
but can't bear anything mentally or physically taxing in the
kitchen? This will kick off a new weekly feature in the food
section called The Five:30 Challenge, in which we share some of our
own 5-ingredient, 30-minutes recipes and invite readers to take the
challenge as well. (Langhenry, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

left guard, was so ineffective in Sunday's loss to Denver that he
was eventually replaced by Chris Banks, who has been with the team
only two weeks. Ephraim Salaam and rookie Travis Claridge have
split time at right tackle, neither player stepping up to solidify
their hold on the position. All of the inconsistency has limited
the effectiveness of running back Jamal Anderson and could possibly
jeopardize the health of quarterback Chris Chandler. (Winkeljohn,

centralized zone of activity downtown, Sydney's game plan involves
separating most of the athletic events. That essential difference,
designed to take advantage of the natural ebb and flow of this
harbor town, is paramount as Sydney takes center stage Friday,
hoping to avoid some of Atlanta's embarrassing mistakes. There are
similarities, as well, including transportation problems that need
to get fixed for these spread-out Games to work right.

flanking the walkway. Studying the figures munching the underbrush
in the eerie glow, I realized several kangaroos _ including a
mother with a joey _ were having their late-night snacks. For all

Texas and University of Texas swimmer. Four years ago he gained a
small measure of fame by missing the Olympics by the smallest of
margins, one-hundredth of a second as he was touched out for sixth
place in the 100 meter freestyle at the U.S. swim trials. In that
event, six swimmers can go to the Olympics for the 4X100 meter
freestyle relay team. This time around Walker could be anchoring
that race Saturday as well as later having a shot at medals in
another relay and two individual events. And that's after having a
couple of off swims and maybe one bad choice at the U.S. trials.

FUEL CRISIS IN BRITAIN DEEPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's fuel crisis worsened Wednesday despite Prime
Minister Tony Blair's pledge to end it, as panicky Britons hoarded
gasoline and food and the nation's biggest supermarkets began
rationing bread and milk.
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrators protesting a fuel tax continued to block the
nation's nine oil refineries, motorists spent all day hunting for
gasoline at the few stations still open. About 90 percent of
Britain's 13,000 service stations remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons showed little faith in Blair's promise that the
government would soon have the crisis under control. A BBC poll
found a surprising level of support for the fuel-tax protest. The
BBC said more than three quarters of the people it polled backed
the protest, while only 17 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 11 years, the National Health Service was
put on ``red alert,'' as the health minister, Alan Milburn, ordered
hospitals to implement emergency plans. Hospitals canceled
nonemergency surgery, saying doctors and nurses were having trouble
getting to work.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been put on standby to deliver fuel to essential
services, such as hospitals, if needed. A school system in Wales
closed, saying teachers couldn't drive to work, and other school
systems said they will probably close. The Royal Mail warned that
postal services have been curtailed and could be suspended. The
slowdown in deliveries and panic buying prompted the rationing of
the bread and milk, with one supermarket chain limiting shoppers to
three loaves and six bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Protests by truckers and farmers over fuel taxes continued
unabated across Europe, with disruption reported in Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Germany. Truckers in Ireland, Spain, and as far
east as Poland have threatened disruption unless their governments
cut the fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   But, as has been the case all week, the situation was most
serious in Britain. While Blair insisted he had gotten a guarantee
from oil companies that they would order their drivers to leave
Britain's nine refineries to resume deliveries, only a trickle of
gasoline was being brought to the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Britain uses about 22 million barrels of oil a day, but analysts
estimated that only about 10 percent of that total was delivered
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, about 2,000 oil trucks leave refineries in
Britain; Wednesday about 200 trucks made deliveries, government
officials said. Nearly all of that fuel was being reserved for
police, fire, and other essential services.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers who did leave the refineries were threatened by
protesters. At Stanlow refinery in northwest England, where the
protest began last week, one demonstrator yelled at a driver:
``We'll remember you!''
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, leader of the British opposition, called for
Parliament to be recalled from its summer recess for an emergency
debate on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has arisen because Tony Blair doesn't listen to anyone.
He should be brought to the one place he has to listen,'' said
Hague, who claimed that Blair owed the nation an apology for
fumbling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair's aides said it was hypocritical of the Conservatives
to criticize the Labor Party for refusing to cut the fuel tax, as
it was the Tories who implemented the tax in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Blair's aides admit his government is facing its
most serious crisis since assuming power in May 1997. Sensing the
Labor Party's vulnerability on the issue, the Conservatives, led by
Hague, are trying to exploit the popular anger at Blair's
government. Polls suggest most Britons blame the crisis on the
government, which collects the highest fuel tax in Europe, making
gasoline here, at nearly $5 a gallon, the most expensive in Europe.
More than 70 percent of the pump price goes to the tax coffers.
</P>
<P>
   A beleaguered Blair emerged from another day of closed-door
meetings at 10 Downing St. to acknowledge that his pledge on
Tuesday that things would be ``on their way back to normal in 24
hours'' was overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a considerable distance from where we need to go,''
said Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair remained defiant, saying he would not give into
demands from truckers and farmers to reduce the fuel tax, saying
the government would not negotiate under the threat of blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did give in,'' he said, ``how long before a new
grievance emerged?''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the crisis on the oil companies and its drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the determination exists, the supplies do indeed get
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Milburn, who accused the demonstrators of risking the lives
of those who need medical care, Blair warned the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real damage is being done to real people,'' Blair said.
``Lives are at risk. Businesses will shut down and people will be
put out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestors accused Blair and Milburn of engaging in ``emotional
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Stewart, a truck driver from London, said the fuel tax was
already inflicting serious hardship on his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to see this through,'' said Stewart, who
with dozens of other truckers brought traffic to a standstill on
busy Park Lane in London's West End Wednesday.

 &HT;    Male-female equality: true or a `myth'?
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The speed of track star Marion Jones, the
strength of Olympic weight-lifter Cheryl Haworth and the power of
tennis champions Serena and Venus Williams all suggest that
Collette Dowling could be right _ women might one day become the
physical equals of men.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a long way to go, and fitness experts are not
readily swayed by her arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Frailty Myth,'' Dowling asserts _ and few would contest
_ that women have long been held back by a culture that emphasizes
femininity and fertility over physical ability. She believes that
given the same athletic skill training and practice boys receive,
girls will approach equality. (In other words, they'll be able to
throw like a boy.)
</P>
<P>
   Dowling suggests the deficiencies go way beyond what was
rectified in Title IX, which established equity between genders in
athletic programs receiving federal aid. This feminist author, who
proclaimed in ``The Cinderella Complex'' (1989) that women have an
unconscious tendency to make themselves dependent on men, suggests
in her new book that it was men who for so long helped keep the
``weaker sex'' weaker. ``Men were certain that if women weren't
controlled, the very species was at risk,'' Dowling writes, and
``The dastardly effect of athletics on women's abilities to be
mothers . . . was continually proclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   She says vestiges of the frailty myth persisted ``even after
women began outdoing men in endurance marathons in the 1990s and
plunging victoriously into the contact sports _ ice hockey,
football, rugby _ for so long considered ineffably `male.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whether women are now on their way to equality is something to
ponder as you watch the elite women athletes compete in Sydney over
the next two weeks. They're running and swimming faster and, yes,
that's a 17-year-old girl hoisting more than 300 pounds over her
head in the first Olympic women's weight-lifting competition.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-Title IX and barely beyond frail ourselves, we turned to Jan
Todd, a University of Texas kinesiology and health education
professor once dubbed ``the strongest woman in the world,'' to
evaluate ``The Frailty Myth.'' A champion power lifter in the 1970s
and '80s, Todd at 48 is still about as far from frail as you can
get. She broke more than 60 records and appeared in the Guinness
Book of Records for 12 consecutive years before she retired to
teach and write books on fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The office in the basement of Anna Hiss Gym that she shares with
her husband, Terry, is filled with trophies and a library of
weight-lifting history. This former English major who reads the New
Yorker as avidly as she does fitness journals could hardly be more
sympathetic to Dowling's basic message. (It's the details she finds
faulty.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of what she's saying is dead-on,'' Todd said.
``For a long time most women were denied a full physical life.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled when she started to train in the '70s how hard it
was to find a gym that had free weights she was allowed to use.
``Even 10 years ago, women weren't really welcome. And in the '70s,
gyms would have a ladies' side _ no weights, just machines.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean men were always the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the support I had was from men,'' Todd said. ``It's
the women in my circle who were more concerned that what I was
doing was inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Todd balks at many of Dowling's assertions _ including the
biggest one. Asked outright if women will soon achieve physical
equality with men, Todd hesitated. ``Well (sigh, followed by long
pause), I have to admit that I think . . . oh, boy! _ as a feminist
I want to say yes. But as somebody in kinesiology and who's been
around lifting as long as I have, I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the 21st century, we'll see records much closer,
but I don't think we'll see women surpassing men in terms of
absolutes,'' Todd said. ``Not in weight-lifting. Possibly in
distance events _ for example, long-distance swimmers. Possibly in
cycling. There are some phenomenal performances by women (in
lifting), but they're nowhere close.''
</P>
<P>
   (When John McEnroe gave commentary on the U.S. Open recently, he
remarked on the Williams' strength and muscularity but said even he
could come back from retirement and beat them. Last week there were
suggestions that Serena Williams might give him a chance to try.)
</P>
<P>
   Todd particularly faults ``The Frailty Myth'' for its cursory
treatment of strength records. ``She has a section in the book
called `Men's Fear of Women's Strength.' Well, why doesn't she talk
about strength? Instead she talks about body building, which is an
aesthetic. I was very surprised by what short shrift she gave to a
real physical strength argument.''
</P>
<P>
   What will hold women back in weight-lifting? Body structure and
perhaps hormonal differences, Todd said, though the muscle is the
same. ``No matter what we want to say, women's physiology is still
somewhat different _ and men have the structural advantage in upper
body strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there's been lots of progress. Todd agrees Dowling is
onto something when she celebrates the new generation of women and
men's acceptance of their strength.

   CUBA-MIGRATION _ HAVANA _ The ever-smoldering war of words
between Cuba and the U.S. over immigration policies is flaring up
again after the shark-eaten bodies of two Cuban men were found off
the Florida Keys in August. Cuban officials charge that the U.S.
Cuban Adjustment Act encourages Cubans to risk the perilous voyage
across the Florida Straits by granting automatic asylum to any
Cuban who sets foot on U.S. soil. U.S. officials, meanwhile, say
the Cuban government has been blocking Cubans with proper visas
from emigrating. We profile the controversy, hopefully by finding
Cubans willing to talk about their problems in trying to obtain
visas. NOTE: This could prove difficult, and many interview
subjects are likely not going to agree to be named, for obvious
reasons. (Williams, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

Adults proudly extend as proof Russia's high education levels,

public schools to find out. Developing. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   DEATHROW-GOBSON _ Death row inmate Exzavious Gibson is best
known for being the only capital defendant in the modern history of
the death penalty to go through a habeas corpus appeal without the
aid of an attorney. The Georgia Supremes ruled last year that was
OK, making Georgia the only state in the nation not to require
lawyers at this stage of their appeals. Had the Georgia Supremes
sent the case back for a hearing, with a lawyer, the judge would
have learned new revelations that, when he was convicted and
sentenced to die, Gibson was represented by a lawyer who was
working as an assistant state attorney general -- a clear conflict
of interest. And this lawyer billed just 33 hours of work for the
case -- including 6 hrs for travel. Now, a federal judge in Augusta
has taken extraordinary steps to bypass the Georgia Supremes,
demanding new hearings. Saying he'd never seen anything like it in
his 20 years on the bench, federal judge Dudley Bowen even called
the state court judge to ask him to consider hearing the case.

Asian women who get divorced are considered ``discarded objects''
with little chance of re-marrying b/c divorce is such a cultural
taboo. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

ANALYSIS: REVISITING `THE GREAT WHITE HOPE' FROM A DECIDEDLY
DIFFERENT ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Note language in 3rd graf)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Arena Stage, the leading nonprofit theater
here, presented the world premiere of ``The Great White Hope,'' the
regional theater movement was in its infancy even though Arena
itself, founded by Zelda Fichandler in 1950, was already a
teen-ager. It was December 1967, and the show, directed by Edwin
Sherin and starring James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, and
financed partly by the fledgling National Endowment for the Arts,
made history.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Howard Sackler, it is set just before and during
World War I, but it was very much a play of the moment, rife with
the righteous anguish of the civil rights movement and the ire of
liberal opposition to the Vietnam War. It was based on the life of
the boxer Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion, who
was forced to flee the country on a trumped-up morals charge
because of his romantic liaison with a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of the play _ its flaming indignation _ was
fueled by a coincidence: The contemporary plight of Muhammad Ali,
who in April 1967 was stripped of his heavyweight title when he
refused to be inducted into the Army, having claimed conscientious
objector status and famously declared: ``I ain't got no quarrel
with the Vietcong. No Vietcong ever called me nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   With a mammoth cast of 62 actors (including Ned Beatty, Antonio
Vargas, Robert Prosky and Hector Elizondo), a virulent anti-racist
theme often evoked by characters mouthing the vilest language of
bigotry, a narrative that chases the characters all over the United
States, to Europe and back to Mexico and Cuba, and a towering
performance by Jones as the proud and beleaguered champ (he's
called Jack Jefferson in the play), this was not a work to be
contained by the theatrical provinces.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the following October Herman Levin, best known as
the producer of ``My Fair Lady,'' moved the show _ including the
director, the two stars and much of the supporting cast _ to
Manhattan's Alvin Theater on West 52nd Street (now the Neil Simon),
making it the first production ever to transfer from a nonprofit
resident theater to Broadway. There it ran for more than 500
performances and won three Tonys _ best play, best actor and best
actress. The play, which also won the Pulitzer Prize, has rarely
been staged anywhere since.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes the rousing, provocative and fascinatingly
problematic revival of ``The Great White Hope'' now at the Arena
through Oct. 15 an event of significance. Directed by Molly Smith,
beginning her third year as the Arena's artistic director, it is
the first production of the theater's 50th anniversary season, and
it is perfectly chosen as a celebration of its history.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a potent reminder of the vast changes that have been
wrought in the American theater landscape over the past three
decades, particularly at a time when the most prominent American
plays and musicals are developed in the regional houses before they
ever come to Broadway and when commercial producers and nonprofit
theaters routinely engage in financial and artistic partnerships.
It is astonishing to recall that in 1968 such arrangements were so
new that the Arena let ``The Great White Hope'' _ still the most
important production in its history, and at the time its most
expensive _ go to Broadway (and the movies) without claiming any
financial interest in it or any artistic credit.
</P>
<P>
   The play itself is a monster, a narrative with an epic arc,
tracing the rocketlike rise of Jefferson and the long, agonizing
persecution that costs him his livelihood, kills the woman he loves
and in the end unmans him entirely. ``The Great White Hope'' is
replete with mob scenes, party scenes, court hearings, gym workouts
and family gatherings, with settings in a German beer garden, a
Budapest cabaret and a barn in Juarez, among other exotic locales.
There are monologues by white and black characters who address the
audience with the rhetoric of race warfare, and there is one
sizzling bedroom encounter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a work of colossal immodesty that even admiring critics of
the original found occasionally overstuffed with bluster. But it
was theatrically outrageous in the service of grand spiritual
outrage, and in that, critics agreed, lay its power.
</P>
<P>
   The play, Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times, is ``about a
man who is afraid of nothing written by a man who is not afraid of
the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two kinds of boldness blinking, throat open for a cockcrow,
come together to create a blood-stained circus,'' Kerr wrote, ``the
most unabashed dramatic outburst we have had since `Long Day's
Journey Into Night.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely the spirit that Smith's vigorous staging seeks
out, often successfully. Indeed, a circus is the controlling
metaphor for her production, with the stage painted in bright icons
that suggest a Big Top _ the Arena's main stage is a theater in the
round _ and Calliope music introducing the Jefferson saga as a
savage tale of show business. She makes full use of the auditorium,
with characters parading down the aisles and around the top tier of
seats as well as entering from beneath the stage through sliding
panels in the floor. Pageantry abounds; the period costumes are
elegant. Props and scenery drop from the rafters on rope and wire.
And the cast, reduced to 28 actors, most in multiple roles, seems
to be in perpetual motion.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's terrific in its enthusiasms, even in the scenes _
like the Budapest cabaret, where Jefferson is humiliatingly reduced
to performing in a burlesque of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' _ that Smith
can't reclaim from the playwright's overindulgence. That particular
scene is a real squirm-inducer, played here for egregious
grotesquerie, but even so, like the rest of the production, it has
the director's bravado imprinted on it.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of this is that the spectacle overwhelms the story.
This may be purposeful, and it may be unavoidable. The race
relations depicted in Sackler's script are thorough, in a way;
Jefferson is criticized by some black characters (not all of whom
are noble or even likable) for his aspirations to success in the
white world, and he himself refuses to be a symbol of black pride.
But the rhetoric of the early 20th century is so blatantly and
viciously uncomplicated that many of the white characters sound
clownishly villainous, the black ones embarrassingly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   And without the palpable current of racial violence that was
running through society in the 1960s _ Martin Luther King Jr. was
assassinated between the play's original run at the Arena and its
opening on Broadway _ it's tough for actors to find credible
readings for the implacably racist lines. Such an attitude no
longer seems dramatic or even reasonably realistic as a widely held
or expressed position; it's merely dismissible stupidity. It's a
real problem when an actor's boldest, most earnest efforts in a
period role turn him into a buffoon for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the idea of a prominent black athlete who is a
wealthy, self-assured and even arrogant man and might well be a sex
symbol is not only no longer shocking or threatening, it's familiar
and even cool. Ali, announcing his conversion to Islam at a news
conference in 1964 at which he was accompanied by Malcolm X, was to
many white Americans a threat. Today he's our benign and
grandfatherly hero.
</P>
<P>
   Sherin, the director of the original production, said the
playwright, who died in 1982, ``didn't have Ali in mind at all; he
had Jack Johnson in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard chose this character because he reminded him of a
Shakespearean hero,'' Sherin said. ``What he wanted you to think of
was Coriolanus. I was with him through much of the writing and all
of the rewriting, and the name Ali never came up. That was just
happenstance. That was just hitting on a historic wave. But I was
present when Ali saw the production. He ran up on stage _ this was
when it was over and everybody'd left _ and said: `It's me. It's
me. This is my story.'''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see the original, but to judge from the 1971 film,
James Earl Jones played Jefferson as a supremely confident man,
intimidating in both his physical grace and the persistent rumble
of his self-possession. He was very much like the young Ali, albeit
pitched to a lower octave. Mahershala Karim Ali, the young actor
who plays Jefferson in the current production, strikes a much more
modern pose. He has a breathtaking physique, Nautilus-buffed, with
cobblestone abs and wide shoulders, but he's not the man-mountain
that Jones was. He's lithe. With his shaved head and sinewy
muscles, he calls up the image of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His performance, too, seems purposely derived from the
contemporary athlete, fickle and moody, the self-assurance
flickering. His Jefferson can intimidate with his anger and barbed
humor, the implicit threat of brawn, but it's a learned demeanor,
concealing the insecurity of youth. His most affecting scenes are
with the woman he loves, Ellie Bachman (Kelly C. McAndrew), when
they're alone, away from the world that demands so much of him.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable effect of all of this is to render Jefferson less
heroic, less of a symbol. Watching ``The Great White Hope,'' you
can't help but will yourself back into the past to find its potent
drama. Michael Jordan hasn't suffered like Ali, after all, and he
hasn't changed the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last scene, Jefferson is finally compromised, lured back
into the ring with the promise that if he loses to the white
challenger, his legal persecution will end. Whether he throws the
fight is unclear. At the final bell, sad and stoop-shouldered, he
tells a reporter: ``He beat me, dassall. Ah juss din have it.''
Meanwhile, the victorious challenger, his face awash in sweat and
blood, stands ebullient, draped in the American flag. The
metaphorical suggestions _ that black America has been evilly
sublimated and that white America, if triumphant, has been bloodied
_ seem almost quaint in their ardor.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years after its premiere, ``The Great White Hope''
is more than quaint; it's a theatrical monument, really, a
historical marker in more ways than one. This estimable revival at
the Arena Stage is very much at home.

 &HT;    Games all heart in Home Depot ad
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'll see no machismo or NASCAR-style rumble in Home
Depot's commercial tribute to the Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based retailer likes to show its sensitive side
during the Olympics. That soft spot seems to hit overdrive in Home
Depot's sponsorship ad, which debuts Friday night during Opening
Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of ABC's old ``the thrill of victory and the agony
of defeat'' sports theme, the commercial captures athletes in their
moments of glory and disappointment. First up is a teary-eyed
runner, then shots of a triumphant weightlifter, giddy basketball
players and young fans glued to the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the drama is a slow, pining rendition of the
children's song, ``If You're Happy and You Know It,'' performed by
members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the Olympics as an opportunity to tie into the
emotions of the Games ... so we decided to focus on the athletes
and their families,'' said Dick Hammill, senior vice president of
marketing and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot first sponsored the Olympics in 1992, when it
supported the 1994 U.S. Olympic team in Lillehammer, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement giant won't say how much it's spending on
Olympics advertising, but NBC recently said it has sold a record
$900 million in commercial time for its telecasts of the Games.
That's roughly 30 percent higher than NBC's $680 million in ad
sales for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports pegged the average price this year of a 30-second
commercial in prime time at $615,000, up from $420,000 in Atlanta
four years ago. Home Depot is running 30-second and 60-second ads
throughout the Games, which end Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot also sponsors NASCAR auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   Other major Atlanta-based sponsors of the Olympics include
Coca-Cola and United Parcel Service. Both will air commercials
during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's Olympic role also includes putting about 50
athletes on its payroll. The retailer employs athletes and Olympic
hopefuls through job programs by the United States, Canada, Puerto
Rico and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes work an average of 20 hours a week, and Home Depot
pays them full-time wages and benefits so that they can train for
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has hired more than 200 athletes since 1992, Hammill
said. About half made Olympic teams, and 53 won medals, he said.

AUSTRIAN CONDUCTOR HANS GRAF IS NEW HEAD OF HOUSTON SYMPHONY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
HOUSTON _ The Houston Symphony has named Austrian conductor Hans
Graf as its new music director. Graf's five-year contract will
begin with the 2001-2002 season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graf succeeds Christoph Eschenbach, who left the post of music
director in May 1999 after 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Graf was the overwhelming choice of the symphony's 19-member
search committee and the favorite of musicians, said Rodney H.
Margolis, president of the Houston Symphony Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel honestly honored and happy,'' Graf said from Bordeaux,
France, where he conducted Wednesday. ``I hope to keep going with
the wonderful (artistic) momentum created by Eschenbach.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf emerged as the leading candidate during a two-week visit to
Houston in March.
</P>
<P>
   Because of schedule conflicts, however, he will not conduct the
Houston Symphony again until May 12-14, when he leads
Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 3 and Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2,
with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Though not yet widely known in the classical music world, Graf
appears to be on the verge of a major international career.
</P>
<P>
   He is music director at the Calgary Philharmonic in Alberta,
Canada, and the Orchestre National Bordeaux-Aquitaine in France. He
will end his tenure in Calgary at the end of the 2002-2003 season.
His contract in Bordeaux also expires then.
</P>
<P>
   This season he will lead the Calgary orchestra on a European
tour, and will make guest appearances with the Stockholm
Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra
and the orchestras in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Graf will conduct at least five subscription series programs in
the 2001-2002 season, plus other concerts, including the
season-opening gala.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, he will lead 10 subscription series
programs and devote up to 16 weeks each season to the orchestra.
That is a typical commitment for the music director of an orchestra
like Houston, which presents 18 classical series programs, each
played three times.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the town of Marchtrenk, outside of Linz, Graf studied
violin with his father and earned a diploma in piano from the music
conservatory in Graz, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He attended master classes with such major conducting teachers
as Franco Ferrara and Sergiu Celibidache. In 1972-73, he studied at
the Leningrad Conservatory with Arvid Jansons, father of Mariss
Jansons, music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1977, Graf worked at the Vienna State Opera for
seven years, first as a pianist and coach, then as conductor.
</P>
<P>
   His key break came in 1979 when he won the Karl Bohm
Competition. The prize included two concerts with the Vienna
Symphony Orchestra, which provided valuable exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1979, I was already an old guy _ I was 30 years old,'' he
said with a laugh. ``I was a late-starter.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the famous Russian composer Kyril Kondrashin died
before the premiere of a Vienna State Opera Ballet production of
Stravinsky's Petrouchka. Graf stepped in.Similarly, his Boston
Symphony debut in 1995 resulted from the illness of Sir Roger
Norrington.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 to 1994, he served as music director of the Mozarteum
Orchestra in Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   Graf made his United States debut in 1989 at the Buffalo
Philharmonic. He became music director in Calgary in 1995 and
Bordeaux in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his main goal for the Houston Symphony is to build
on Eschenbach's artistic legacy. He expects to adjust the
repertoire, probably performing fewer Mahler works and adding
others by French and Russian composers.

 &HT;    China jails Atlanta follower of outlawed sect
 &HT;    By Saeed Ahmed
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Atlanta engineer who traveled to China to pay last respects
to a dying relative has run afoul of the law for carrying
literature tied to a banned meditation movement.
</P>
<P>
   Xiaohua Du, 29, and her husband, Shean Lin, were arrested at the
Fuzhou City airport Friday after a customs check revealed several
books and CDs on the Falun Gong faith in their possession. The
couple were placed under house arrest while authorities decide on
their next course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Atlanta's Falun Gong community fear the couple will
face severe penalties in light of the Chinese government's recent
pledge to intensify its crackdown on the movement's adherents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiaohua Du has been very active within the movement here, and
the Chinese government knows that well,'' said Yuan Li, a fellow
engineer and Falun Gong devotee. ``Their case is being taken as a
serious one, and sentences are very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   China considers Falun Gong _ a combination of yoga, meditation
and traditional breathing exercises _ the most significant
political threat to its national security since the 1989 student
uprising at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Chinese officials have sent thousands of Falun
Gong practitioners to labor camps and committed hundreds more to
mental institutions for ``re-education.'' At least 50 have died
while in custody, according to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Du, who holds a Ph.D. in engineering from Georgia Tech and works
for an electronics firm in Atlanta, was married less than four
months when she and her husband _ a graduate student at the
University of Alabama _ made the hastily arranged trip to China
last week to visit his ailing father.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both long-term practitioners of the Falun Gong
faith, took along their religious books. However, they weren't
looking to convert anyone, said Judy Lin, a relative who traveled
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even after they explained that to custom officials over
and over again, they wouldn't listen. They were immediately
detained,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who is an American citizen and has no association with the
movement, was permitted to return to the States on Tuesday. But Du
and her husband _ both Chinese citizens _ remain under government
supervision in Fuzhou province in southern China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their experience reveals the danger facing Falun Gong members
in America who travel to China,'' said Gail Rachlin, a spokeswoman
for the group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that other U.S. residents who were found to be
followers were held in the country for long periods and often
tortured. In one case, a Denver woman had her stomach pumped with
saltwater; in another, two San Francisco area residents were forced
to work 13-hour days cleaning pigpens and piecing together hair
brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the couple were allowed to attend the funeral
of Du's father-in-law, who had died in the meantime. But
authorities are expected to interrogate them again pending word
from the central government, which is now looking at the case.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated phone calls to the Chinese Embassy in Washington
seeking information about the couple's status were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's arrest came on the same day that a U.S. State
Department report took China to task for its continued repression
of religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The report, part of an annual survey of religious freedoms
worldwide, said the government's respect for Falun Gong has
``deteriorated markedly'' with the inaction of a recent law
granting law enforcement officials broad authority in dealing with
religious practices that aren't government-sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese government denounced
the report as ``rumors and lies'' and said the Falun Gong crackdown
was necessary to stop an ``evil cult.''

ITALIANS CLAMOR FOR `COLUMBO,' AMONG OTHER SHOWS, TO IMPROVE THEIR
ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Jason Priestley, the slouching star of ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' is not best known for his mastery of proper English
diction. But in Italy his high-school angst has been put to use to
help Italians learn English. Computer users can freeze a frame on a
CD-ROM version of the show and pause his mumbled delivery. If that
doesn't help, students can click to a more precise, mid-Atlantic
voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Installments of ``MovieTalk,'' CD-ROMs that convert popular
American television shows into interactive English lessons, are
being given away free by the newsmagazine L'Espresso. The marketing
strategy is intended to sell magazines by tapping into Italians'
thirst to improve their English.
</P>
<P>
   English has become the lingua franca of the world, but among
European countries Italy has one of the lowest rates of
proficiency. Only 28 percent of Italians speak any English,
according to a 1999 study by the European Commission, compared with
78 percent of the Dutch, 77 percent of Swedes and 41 percent of
Germans. Even the prickly French have a higher percentage of
English-speakers: 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Italians' longstanding insistence on having foreign movies and
television shows dubbed into Italian is an important reason, Furio
Colombo, a columnist, wrote in the daily newspaper La Repubblica.
He believes that the dubbing has lulled Italians into a false sense
of security. ``Unconsciously, Italians have this idea that Italian
is so universal a language that even Woody Allen speaks it
fluently,'' Colombo said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, however, Italians have scrambled to catch
up, prompted by the Internet and a desire to compete in the global
economy. Italy has more than 1,000 language schools, and many
newspapers and magazines provide written English lessons and,
increasingly, interactive lessons online.
</P>
<P>
   MovieTalk, a system designed by the American software company,
Softrade International, has already been marketed in Germany and
Japan using episodes of ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Columbo,''
``Murder, She Wrote,'' and ``Star Trek.'' Its debut here, however,
is the latest Italian effort to gain proficiency without too much
effort _ the linguistic equivalent of the electronic
cellulite-jiggling devices that are demonstrated on quivering
models on Italian cable television 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody who bought English lesson tapes, CD-ROMs and
books followed through all the way, we would by now be a bilingual
nation,'' Marco Barina, marketing director of L'Espresso, said as
he was preparing for the distribution of 700,000 cassettes of
``Columbo,'' the detective series starring Peter Falk. ``This at
least allows people to be entertained while they learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Italians are beginning to express embarrassment over their
poor grasp of English, particularly as Internet use spreads and
English terms like ``killer,'' ``top model,'' ``downsizing'' and
``welfare'' seep into Italian newspapers and conversation. When the
Democrats of the Left, the largest party in the governing
center-left coalition, held their last convention, in January, they
adopted the English words ``I Care'' as their slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, L'Espresso rated Italian politicians by their
fluency in English. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato was on the list
of those who spoke it well. His predecessor, the former Communist
Massimo D'Alema, was only ``so-so.'' Once he became prime minister
in October 1998, D'Alema began taking private English lessons on
his lunch break, worried that he might miss something at meetings
of the leaders of the major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Other Europeans improve their English by watching Hollywood
movies with the original soundtrack, accompanied by subtitles. Most
Italian move theaters, however, show American films dubbed into
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies in Italy now sell videocasettes of popular
Hollywood movies like ``You've Got Mail'' and ``There's Something
About Mary,'' with the original English-language soundtrack, and
also English-language subtitles, to help viewers follow the
dialogue. Speak Up, a monthly magazine intended for Italian
students of English, also sells videocasettes, along with
transcripts from the film.
</P>
<P>
   The personal ads in Speak Up suggest that at least some readers
cannot entirely accept Hollywood comedies as a serious language
study guide, however. ``Desperately seeking videocasette of `Sense
and Sensibility' or other rigorously British films,'' a reader
called Lina wrote this month.
</P>
<P>
   And some language instruction on the Internet includes a stern
moral lesson. Stephen Murrell, an Englishman who runs the English
Conversation Club, a language school in Genoa, supplies English
courses to Donna Moderna magazine, Italy's highest circulation
women's magazine, as well as the Donna Moderna Web site. Murrell,
who also teaches English to Italians on cruise ships, composes his
own texts to enhance vocabulary and reading comprehension _ asking
users to select the correct word from a list of five.
</P>
<P>
   One installment, ``Among the Slaves of the South in the
States,'' luridly recounts plantation life during the American
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   One segment: ``A one-legged slave (grow, whip, surrender,
hobbled, bent) by. `Good morning, Master.'''
</P>
<P>
   ```We had to cut off his leg to stop him escaping when he was
younger,' smiled the plantation owner.''
</P>
<P>
   The text, which describes ``Negroes'' cheerfully picking cotton,
might startle American readers, but Murrell, who noted that the
editors had actually persuaded him to tone down his original
language, said Italians needed to learn the painful parts of
American _ and English _ history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no good expecting students to read boring texts,'' he
said. ``They have to read something they would read in their own
language. We also do a lot of stuff on the English royal family.
Italians love it.''

   LEE-RELEASE (Albuquerque, N.M.) _ Dr. Wen Ho Lee, the former Los
Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets, walked
free from prison Wednesday under a plea agreement after the judge
in the case apologized to him and called the prosecution an
embarrassment. Lee pleaded guilty to one count of improperly
downloading nuclear secrets, a far cry from the 59-count indictment
and earlier suggestions by the government that he had spied for
China. The judge sentenced him to 278 days in prison, the time he
has already served.The judge apologized to Lee for the ``unfair
manner'' of his incarceration and said the Department of Justice
and Energy ``have embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who
is a citizen of it.'' By James Sterngold.

   EUROPE-FUEL (London) _ Oil trucks resumed limited deliveries
from petroleum refineries and storage depots on Wednesday, but
Prime Minister Tony Blair failed to break the siege that has left
almost all of Britain's filling stations dry. The flow of supplies
was estimated to be less than 10 percent of regular volume, and
almost all of it was designated for vital services like hospitals,
ambulances, fire and police departments rather than the nation's
gas pumps. The protests against high fuel prices that have
presented Blair with the most serious domestic crisis of his three
and a half years in office continued Wednesday, with pickets
monitoring the rigs exiting the oil company properties and creeping
convoys of truckers creating miles of traffic jams on major
intercity expressways and blocking the passage of cars in London
and other urban centers. By Warren Hoge.

THE REAL DUO BEHIND `DUETS'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
TORONTO _ In ``Duets,'' Gwyneth Paltrow plays a kindhearted if not
very bright woman in her 20s who meets the father she's never known
and upends her life to be with him, even though he doesn't want her
around.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In real life, the reverse was almost true: Six weeks before
filming was to begin, Paltrow, in her 20s and by all accounts both
kindhearted
 &UR; and &LR;  bright, feared she was about to lose her father. Respected
television producer and director Bruce Paltrow, who was to direct
``Duets,'' was diagnosed with throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trying time. Her paternal grandfather, who has since
died, had learned he had liver cancer less than two months earlier.
Doctors removed Bruce Paltrow's tonsils, lymph nodes and salivary
glands and began radiation treatments. The patient lost 40 pounds.
Nevertheless, he persevered, and ``Duets,'' an unlikely seriocomic
look at karaoke bar culture, opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Paltrow's burgeoning stardom is the reason the movie got
made, she plays a relatively small role in an ensemble cast that
includes Andre Braugher, Huey Lewis, Paul Giamatti, Maria Bello and
Scott Speedman. The movie consists of the interwoven stories of
various searchers, desperate pilgrims looking for freedom,
security, love or family. They're all on the road _ Braugher's
character is also on the lam _ and their stories converge at a huge
karaoke contest in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Paltrow says the prospect of losing her father _
she calls him ``Daddy'' _ helped her to play the role of a woman
whose father had abandoned her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a sense of how to play her because I was so close to my
own father and he has been so important to who I am and so
important to my life,'' she said while sitting beside him at a news
conference at the Toronto International Film Festival. ``The
thought of not having him in my life informed the way I played her.
The edginess I'd feel without him was the way I'd suspect she
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all, Paltrow won the Academy Award as best
actress for her role in ``Shakespeare in Love.'' Alluding to her
father's illness, she broke into tears during her acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Few people knew what she was going through. Her father had asked
her not to discuss it publicly. At the time she would say only that
his illness had been especially heart-rending because he'd tried to
make ``Duets'' for four years and the financing hadn't come
together until after he took ill. He'd worked on the movie for so
long, and it appeared he wouldn't be able to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bruce Paltrow, he said it was hard to go on, but focusing
on making the movie helped him to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to bed at night thinking about how the shoot went that
day or about what you have to shoot tomorrow as opposed to whether
I'll be here tomorrow to shoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying so hard to be strong for him, but it was very
difficult,'' Gwyneth Paltrow said. ``He was very, very sick and not
himself. My biggest challenge was to just be professional and grown
up and not be a scared daughter and just try to make his life as
easy as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, actress Blythe Danner, and the rest of her family
stayed on location during the shoot to give support. This
heightened the feeling that it was a Paltrow family production, but
Bello said the Paltrows were extraordinarily inclusive. ``It wasn't
like there were the Paltrows and then the rest of us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Gwyneth Paltrow was to act in the movie beside Brad
Pitt, whom she was dating. But when they broke up, it seemed
awkward to continue with him in the movie. The script made the
rounds at a number of studios, each time going through rewrites and
then being put on hold. Without Pitt's star power, it was difficult
to get the movie made.
</P>
<P>
   Not until after Paltrow became a star in her own right with
roles in such hit movies as ``Emma,'' ``Sliding Doors'' and
``Shakespeare in Love'' did it become a ``go'' project again.
</P>
<P>
   The movie faced another crisis when Disney refused to release it
unless Bruce Paltrow toned down two violent incidents. He edited
one shooting to make it less graphic; in the other case, he deleted
footage of a killing, although the scenes leading up to it remain.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Paltrow has directed his daughter before. When she was 17,
he cast her in a television pilot. The job allowed her to get her
Screen Actors Guild membership card. Before that, he admitted, he
and Danner had reservations about Gwyneth acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife always had the feeling she would be like Margaret Mead
and maybe go into anthropology,'' he said. ``We did not want her to
act as a child. We wanted her to go on with her schooling. And she
did _ she went on through high school.''
</P>
<P>
   When she decided she wanted to drop out of college to act, her
parents supported her.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked Bruce Paltrow whether he feels protective of
his daughter because of the pitfalls that often come with
celebrity. Of course he does, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But parenting is an evolutionary process,'' he said. ``I
wasn't thrilled when she told me she crossed the street by herself
(for the first time). . . .We all have fears for our children, but
I think she does exceedingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the major characters except Speedman's sing in the movie.
Though most of the voices are dubbed _ Paltrow is among those who
did their own singing _ the actors prepared in part by hanging out
at karaoke bars in and around Los Angeles and performing before
real audiences. What they learned, Bruce Paltrow said, was that
each bar had its own flavor and its own stars and ``weird
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   All of them said singing before an audience was exciting, and
scary, in a way that is different from acting. But Bello came to
love it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the movie, she said, she hadn't sung in public since the
fifth grade, when classmates made fun of her. ``I thought I would
never sing again as long as I live,'' she said. But the movie
changed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that I have, since ''Duets,`` become obsessed with
karaoke _ completely obsessed,'' she said. ``If you see an uptight
executive get up and become the sexiest Tom Jones in the world _
well, that's what karaoke is all about. It helps you express your
inner essence.''

SOAPS SUDS BUBBLE AS PARODIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Among our guilty show-biz pleasures, few are more pleasurable than
daytime soaps, those sudsy tides of tantrums, tackiness, fashion
victims, absurdly contrived plots and _ when we're lucky _ steamy
romance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even those who proclaim disdain of soaps find themselves hooked
when they are forced to stay home for a week and pass the time with
characters named Emerald or Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers certainly seem hooked. Fictionalized soaps often turn
up within films or TV shows, both as objects of mirth and
touchstones to emotional icons.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, such phony soaps overplay the real soaps' melodrama and
acting flubs to get laughs. But they also show the soaps' power to
affect viewers in very real ways.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``A Reason to Love,'' a phony soap that's central to the
plot of the new movie ``Nurse Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, Renee Zellweger is a waitress who falls
in love from afar with saintly physician Dr. David Ravell of ``A
Reason to Love'' _ the character, not the actor, who's played by
Greg Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   To show the program on TV sets in the course of the film,
director Neil LaBute shot several scenes for almost 30 minutes of
footage. These were mailed to journalists in advance _ fittingly,
in serial form.
</P>
<P>
   The intro for ''A Reason to Love`` is styled much like that of
''The Young and the Restless,`` with cast members taking turns in
swirling vanity shots, and a smirking Kinnear holding a bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   The title screen then has cursive pink letters atop a hospital
illustration akin to that of ``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``GH'' producer and director Shelly Curtis was a
technical adviser for shooting ``A Reason to Love.''
</P>
<P>
   She calls its scenes ``just slightly over the top,'' and in
truth, the phony soap is played fairly straight and on the level.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnear also spent two days on the ``GH'' set, where he learned
to respect the rigors of working so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Not so smooth was the phony soap of 1991's ``Soapdish,'' in
which Sally Field played the hysterical diva of the long-running
``The Sun Also Sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain transplants drove its plot, while jealous backstabbing
drove the movie proper, with Cathy Moriarity as a rival actress
with a soap name: Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Another fake soap arose in this year's ``28 Days,'' in which
Sandra Bullock played an alcoholic being treated at an institution.
There, patients became hooked in another way: on ``Santa Cruz,'' a
phony soap whose name was a nod to the real ``Santa Barbara.''
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Nurse Betty,'' the fake soap of ``28 Days'' eventually
entered the real world, when a character from ``Santa Cruz'' _
``Falcon,'' played by Jack Armstrong _ arrived at the institution
for treatment of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hoffman also had a dream of a drag role when he played a
struggling thespian disguising himself as an actress to land a soap
part in 1982's ``Tootsie.'' Jessica Lange won an Oscar as best
supporting actress for playing another actress on the ``Tootsie''
soap, which was called ``Southwest General.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, a fake soap appeared in a twisted series that was
convoluted and soapy on its own: 1990-91's ``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Twin Peaks'' characters raptly watched the daytime drama
``Invitation to Love,'' which had the nerdy Chett seduced by
temptress Emerald, twin sister of Jade, in a scheme involving yet
another Montana.
</P>
<P>
   On TV's ``Friends,'' aspiring actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc) once had
a fake soap role, but on a real soap, ``Days of Our Lives''
(conveniently on the same network).
</P>
<P>
   The clumsy Joey played an unconvincing surgeon, but he was
convincing enough for one fan, played by Brooke Shields _ a la
``Nurse Betty'' _ to fall in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even more phony and fun was ``As the Stomach Churns,'' a fake
soap that appeared as a recurring sketch on TV's ``Carol Burnett
Show'' in the '70s. Burnett, Harvey Korman, Lyle Wagner and others
played their mock soap parts with ``John!'' ``Marsha!'' fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is ``Grosse Pointe,'' a comedy premiering at 7:30 p.m.
Sept. 22 on Channel 39. Its soap within the sitcom is a nighttime
teen drama along the lines of ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' _ ample
fodder for cutting and comic looks behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Will Emerald prevent Heather from seducing Victor before Dr.
Ravell's long-lost brother returns to claim the fortune that Falcon
wrested from Jade when he learned she was carrying Montana's child?
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, as the soaps keep on churning.

TIMING IS PERFECT FOR CIRCLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Attaining rock-star status is, in at least one respect, not much
different from achieving success in any career field. Timing is
everything, and it always helps to know the right people.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a veteran studio engineer for such performers as David Bowie,
Tool and Smashing Pumpkins, songwriter Billy Howerdel knew lots of
people. Since matching his talents with those of Tool vocalist
Maynard James Keenan last year to form A Perfect Circle, his career
has been sweeping along like the hands of a finely tuned Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going well. We sold 10,000 copies (of debut
album `Mer De Noms') the first day it was released. Almost every
show is sold out,'' Howerdel, 30, says from a San Francisco tour
stop. ``It's much more than we could have ever expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer A Perfect Circle debuted its burdened and grieving,
deliberate metal rock at the Viper Room in Los Angeles. It was
Keenan's marquee power that drew Tool fans to hear unknown songs
from an unknown band written by an unknown Howerdel.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, and name-dropping Tool is becoming passe. A
Perfect Circle refined those songs and added a few more for the
release of ``Mer De Noms'' (French for ``Sea of Names'') in May.
The swooshing hands of synchronization started working for the band
when it decided to forgo a more widespread club tour in favor of an
opening slot on Nine Inch Nails' ``Fragility'' V2.0 tour.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to promote a debut album in the shadow of Trent Reznor's
Pretty Hate Machine could have been a huge gamble. In retrospect,
playing to giant arenas packed with thousands of fans agreeable to
aggressive music-assault therapy was a stroke of unintentional
marketing genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know if our songs would play to the Nail's crowd,
but it immediately felt locked in,'' Howerdel says. ``Now I think
the Nine Inch Nails record (last year's ''The Fragile``) helped
boost us a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the buzz strength of that tour and a first single,
``Judith,'' coupled with a dark video by director David Fincher
(``Fight Club,'' ``The Game,'' ``Seven'') ``Mer De Noms'' became a
summer hit.
</P>
<P>
   The album reached No. 4 on the Billboard charts, making it the
highest-charting debut album ever for a rock band. After 15 weeks
it still hovers around the Top 60 with help from second single, ``3
Libras.''
</P>
<P>
   Time hasn't always moved so swiftly for Howerdel. He began
crafting the tunes that would evolve into A Perfect Circle nearly
10 years ago, originally conceiving them in the acid-house, dream
pop vein that was popular at the dawn of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   He learned a lot about creating and producing albums in his day
job as a guitar technician for the likes of Bowie, Tool, Smashing
Pumpkins and Fishbone. They became valued contacts when Howerdel
finally quit working on guitars in 1996 to work full-time on his
own music.
</P>
<P>
   The members of A Perfect Circle came together soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Paz Lenchantin is primarily credited as a bassist, but she also
contributes piano, violin and even vocals when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Josh Freese was a friend of Howerdel's back when both
worked with Guns N' Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Van Leeuwen is a former guitarist for Failure who could
mimic the music Howerdel heard in his head.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult person for Howerdel to see in A Perfect
Circle was the already established Keenan. Aside from being a
little intimidated by sharing his creative power with the Tool
mastermind, Howerdel felt Keenan's gravestone-voice was the wrong
gender for the Bjork-like harmonies that Howerdel had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a female voice, and I hadn't even considered
a male,'' Howerdel says. ``I wanted a contradiction to this manly
music, but when I thought of Maynard I thought masculine.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed when the two started reworking songs like ``3
Libras.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got plans for that song,'' was all Keenan said to Howerdel
as he started working out lyrics and composition. Because the Tool
veteran was arranging the song at the same time as the last
bristling Tool album, ``Aenima,'' the hurt of Howerdel's writing
most surely provided Keenan with a needed contrast.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the acoustic guitar brushes and string backing were
flushed with Keenan's soft balladry, Howerdel was overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very emotional. I felt like I had graduated and gotten
my doctorate,'' he says. ``I knew I could trust Maynard from that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Howerdel always thought ``3 Libras'' and ``Mer De Noms'''
opening track, ``The Hollow,'' had radio potential, but was
surprised that ``Judith'' took off as the debut hit.
</P>
<P>
   With its slashing Soundgarden guitars sending Keenan's wavering
whimper into bursts of intimidation, it's probably the song most
removed from Howerdel's original feminine touches.
</P>
<P>
   As a student of the studio, Howerdel was smart enough to let
Keenan take over the song to see where it led.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around producers who get good reaction in songs and
I see what they do,'' says Howerdel, who is listed as the producer
of ``Mer De Noms.`` ``I just kept asking myself what he needed
emotionally to get to that performance and tried to give it to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The versatility learned in the studio and on the road already
has Howerdel thinking about life beyond A Perfect Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really banking on not being a musician,'' Howerdel says.
``I'm a visual guy, which could lead me to film. I want to be a
producer for albums and do a score for a movie''
</P>
<P>
   All that is on hold until A Perfect Circle runs its cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the band are always in demand for session work,
and Keenan will eventually return to Tool.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line all will find out if the worlds of both
Keenan's bands can be balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Howerdel the producer is smart enough to go with it
and see where it leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely confident that Keenan is committed to this
band. If he's not here, I'm not and vice-versa,'' Howerdel says.
``Whatever happens now, happens.''

 &HT;    Skins learning from Deion Sanders
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When Deion Sanders showed up for his first press
conference wearing a burgandy and gold suit, gold shoes, gold
buttons, and maximum-length jacket, the locals knew something about
the man was very different.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., was not prepared for such a fashion statement.
Redskin colors have always looked good _ on football uniforms _ but
Deion takes his wardrobe to another level. Green suits. Yellow
suits. Enough jewelry to fill a Brink's truck.
</P>
<P>
   This is someone who used to carry a hat box onto charter flights
to protect his headgear when he played in Dallas. When you're the
best cornerback ever to play the game of football, you can justify
any duds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Florida boys like to wear those loud colors, but when
you buy a purple suit in Texas, that's not cool,'' Cowboys receiver
Wane McGarity said, smiling at the thought. ``They've got to leave
that stuff down in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was the top free-agent prize of 2000, signing a
seven-year, $57 million contract with a team that is talented
enough to win the Super Bowl. The Redskins also brought in two more
defensive stoppers, end Bruce Smith and safety Mark Carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the attention is showered on Sanders, especially
this week. When Dallas and Washington meet Monday night in
Landover, Md., there is little doubt who will dance on the biggest
stage.
</P>
<P>
   It's Prime Time in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born on Monday night,'' Sanders told an ABC television
audience on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys know they will walk into a circus atmosphere next
week, and Sanders will be the ringmaster. With Sanders, Champ
Bailey and Darrell Green, the Redskins have the best collection of
cornerbacks in the NFL. Yet if there is a weakness, could it be
Sanders?
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders, a weakness? Yeah, and Marshall Faulk can't run.
</P>
<P>
   There is a shred of evidence to suggest Sanders is not as feared
as he used to be. On Sunday, with millions watching Fox, Sanders
looked ordinary in a loss to the Detroit Lions. Quarterback Charlie
Batch threw to Sanders' side of the field 10 times, completing
eight of the passes. Receiver Johnnie Morton made him look a step
slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my butt handed to me,'' Sanders said. ``That's the worst
I've ever played in 12 years in this league. Check the history.
Check the films. Never. I'm sorry to bring my worst game ever to
Washington. I had one of those days that Mama talked about. It
really hurts to play that bad and lose. I take full responsibility
for that one. Put it on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Sanders credit for accepting responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a player who used to play an entire game
without seeing a football thrown to his side of the field. This
year is different. At 33, he really has slowed down a little.
Furthermore, it makes no sense to throw solely to the other side
because Bailey and Green are super players in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys say they have no choice but to attack Sanders. Troy
Aikman or Randall Cunningham have to throw to his side of the field
for the Cowboys to be effective, Coach Dave Campo said. If the
Lions can find success with it, there is no reason Dallas receiver
Rocket Ismail can't play well against him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't limit ourselves to half of the field,'' Campo said.
``Deion knows we're going to go after him. He's sitting over there
thinking we probably won't. Our plan is to spread the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes special teams. Campo said rookie punter Micah
Knorr will not kick the ball out of bounds on purpose when Sanders
is on the field. Many teams have not challenged Sanders in the
past, electing to kick the ball where he has no chance to return
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a veteran punter who can angle the ball perfectly,
that's one thing,'' Campo said. ``When you have that, though, you
usually hurt yourself more than you help yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson said Sanders has made a ``big
impact'' with the Redskins, and not just with his football ability.
He quickly has become one of the most respected players in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got leadership,'' Johnson said. ``Someone like Champ
Bailey gets to see what being the best is really like.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys really throw at Sanders, they might regret it,
Cowboys safety George Teague said. After playing seasons with
Sanders in Dallas, he knows what motivates the former Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any dance he's got, he's going to dance a little harder,''
Teague said. ``You know he's going to be ready to play against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague continued, ``It's a risk any time you throw at him, and
once he gets his hands on the ball, there's a good chance he's
going to take it to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo knows this, and he accepts the challenge. There is one
challenge he does not want to take. Under no circumstances will
Campo start dressing like Sanders. No way. The coach was asked
Wednesday to describe the worst suit he has seen Sanders wear.
</P>
<P>
   Campo thought it over and said, ``I can name 20 of 'em.''

BUSH NOW SEES DEBATES AS TURNAROUND VEHICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Coming off a couple of bumpy of weeks on the
campaign trail and facing a continuing downdraft in opinion polls,
George W. Bush turns to an unlikely source for political revival.
</P>
<P>
   His aides will be in Washington to talk about the debates the
Republican presidential contender had tried so hard to shape to his
own sense of the most advantageous timing, setting, and format.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem to be the ultimate indignity, being
forced to negotiate with Vice President Al Gore over an issue Bush
had said was non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   But the imminent prospect of debates _ and even a breakthrough
on their scheduling _ could be just the shift of focus Bush needs
at this time. For despite his recent run of bad luck, attention may
now turn to what may prove a silver lining for Bush: Even as news
coverage has focused more on his miscues than his message, the
Texas governor has remained close with Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee, in most public opinion surveys. Projections
of the electoral vote count also have not changed much since the
party conventions, although there has been a tightening in Florida,
a state Bush is counting on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the debates that Gore has so confidently sought
pose a risk to Bush also come at a peril to Gore. The protracted
negotiations over debate logistics have served, if anything, to
lower the already low expectations about Bush's performance. The
vice president, by contrast, has been cast as a champion debater,
leaving him little reward for performing up to par but plenty of
downside should he falter.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Gore has excelled by attacking debate opponents
like Ross Perot or Bill Bradley. But his strengths in debate _
aggression, reliance on wily debating technique, and encyclopedic
command of policy arcana _ may not wear well in a presidential
debate or may serve to remind voters of a side to Gore that, until
recent months, led many to question his likability and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big news from the last month hasn't been what Bush has
lost as much as it has been what Gore has gained,'' said Kellyanne
Fitzpatrick, a Republican and head of The Polling Group. ``Gore has
finally become an opponent worthy of George W. Bush's poll
position. It's finally a contest. I was always wondering why in the
world a sitting vice president had been hovering around 39-40
percent for month after month.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday on Capitol Hill to his fellow Democrats, Gore
adviser Bob Shrum said the vice president still has plenty of work
to do. He particularly needs to solidify his Democratic base
despite making strides with independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore message in the coming weeks, according to someone who
attended the briefing, will be to portray the vice president not so
much as a supporter of government, but as one working to meet
people's needs through government programs. The campaign is most
fearful when Bush tries to label Gore a supporter of big
government, said Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   If his campaign is trying to come off a slump, it would be
impossible to tell from watching Bush, who spent two hours telling
jokes on his campaign plane earlier this week. The campaign spin is
the same: Aides insist they are doing just fine, and that the last
two weeks are a natural part of the election pendulum.
</P>
<P>
   With 54 days left in the campaign, there is still ample time for
Gore to hit a rough patch himself. And with the vice president now
apparently a narrow frontrunner, Bush is, by default, the underdog
_ a role he played in his 1994 Texas gubernatorial campaign to
great success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh about it,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush communications
director, ``because the truth is, the hidden truth is, that we're
exactly where we expected to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that may be a stretch _ certainly, the Bush campaign
hoped to keep some of the lead they enjoyed following the
Republican convention _ the campaign does not seem as rattled as it
did last February, after Bush unexpectedly lost the New Hampshire
primary to Arizona Senator John S. McCain and it appeared he might
lose the entire race.
</P>
<P>
   After the first batch of disappointing poll numbers was released
last week, Bush shifted his tactics slightly, introducing a new
slogan _ ``Real Plans for Real People'' _ and focusing more on
policy. Wednesday, he took a step to bolster his campaign team,
hiring veteran Washington operative Ed Gillespie to come to his
Austin headquarters and help the Bush team deliver their campaign
message.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, two new polls quantified the challenge: a
Reuters/Zogby survey had Gore leading Bush 46 percent to 39
percent, an increase of 1 percentage point from last week and just
outside the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage
points. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed Gore leading by 8 points
_ 49 percent to 41 percent _ a reversal from Bush's 17-point lead a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a growing chorus of complaints from Republican officials
on Capitol Hill, some Republican strategists are confident that
Bush will stay close to Gore until Nov. 7, when one candidate will
win by a tiny margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic about Bush's chances to win,'' said Scott
Reed, a GOP strategist who ran Senator Bob Dole's campaign in 1996.
``All these polls show the race so close _ and they show a strong
45 percent do not want Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, Reed said, is greater discipline by the
campaign, especially in the aftermath of the controversy over his
being caught on an open microphone using a vulgarity to describe a
reporter or, more recently, the Republican National Committee which
flashed the word ``RATS'' into a commercial attacking Gore and HMO
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``His team needs to stop making these silly mistakes. But I'm
more optimistic than ever,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes agreed, pointing out the long stretches over the summer
when Gore took a hammering, instead of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cycles in the news,'' Hughes said. ``Vice President
Gore and Senator Lieberman have been in a bit of an up cycle, but
that means they're next in the down cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican official agreed, but stressed the need for
Bush to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, over the course of the campaign, you will see these
transitional points,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It's a lot like a football game, where you look back
and say, this is where these guys have to make a play, or it's
going to get away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the mere fact that the Bush visited Washington
State, long seen as a state likely to go Democratic, Wednesday was
proof of his optimism overall.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a salmon slough in Monroe, Wash., the governor even
displayed confidence that he could address Gore on his pet issue:
the environment. In his fifth visit to Washington State since the
primaries, Bush criticized the Clinton administration for not
protecting the environment sufficiently, despite promising to do so
for two terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years, this administration has talked of
environmentalism, while our national parks are crumbling,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the trip itself was evidence Bush is still very much
in the race. ``We're competitive and within striking distance in a
number of states that should not be competitive states _
Washington, Oregon, California,'' she said, suggesting the Bush
campaign's internal polls in those places are not as discouraging
as the public ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to states around the country that are
traditionally thought of as Democratic states. We're fighting on
their turf,'' she said.

HOUSE APPROVES HATE-CRIMES BILL, 232-192 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Giving a breath of hope to one of President
Clinton's fondest legislative priorities, the House Wednesday
approved a measure supporting the expansion of federal hate-crimes
legislation to protect victims of violence based on gender,
disability, and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   By an unexpectedly wide 232-192 margin, the House voted for a
measure instructing House and Senate negotiators to include the
hate-crimes language in a Defense Department authorization bill the
two legislative chambers are finishing this month.
</P>
<P>
   The vote does not force the conference committee, which works
out the differences between the House and Senate defense bills, to
include the hate-crimes provision. But it does put heavy pressure
on the bipartisan panel to make the hate-crimes language law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important step forward,'' said Representative Barney
Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and a strong proponent of gay and
lesbian rights. ``Unfortunately, it's not binding,'' and Republican
House leaders _ who fought to thwart the measure _ could take the
unusual route of rejecting a direct request from the entire House,
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the hate-crimes measure, which passed the Senate
57-42 in June, argue that it unfairly creates two classes of
victims and unconstitutionally punishes a perpetrator's thoughts,
however offensive those thoughts may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecute people not for their motives but for their action,''
said Representative Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina,
during the floor debate. The bill ``will ultimately divide
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was hailed by gay rights activists and by Clinton, who
has taken a strong interest in getting the hate-crimes legislation
passed. Invoking the cases of Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming man
who died after being tied to a post and beaten, and
African-American James Byrd Jr., dragged to his death in Texas, the
president has pleaded with Congress to expand the federal
hate-crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sad and painful irony that at the beginning of a new
century ... with all the modern gadgets we enjoy, we are still
bedeviled by mankind's oldest failing: the fear of the other, which
so quickly can lead to distrust, then to dehumanization, then to
the kind of violence'' that killed Shepard and others, Clinton said
Wednesday at a White House event urging passage of the hate crimes
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not ever fully conquer the disease that afflicts human
hearts everywhere, the compelling need to define ourselves up by
defining someone else down,'' the president said. ``But at least we
can do more to make sure that no one in our country is violated
simply becuase of who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   If the conference committee does not include the hate-crimes
language, Clinton could still insist on adoption of the language
during a possible post-election legislative session, threatening to
hold up spending bills unless the lame-duck Congress agrees to the
hate-crimes provision.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's tally had a surprising 41 yes votes from
Republicans, including Representative Bill McCollum, who was one of
the floor managers during the impeachment debate and is now facing
a tough fight for a Senate seat from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The hate-crimes legislation would expand a 1968 law to allow
greater federal prosecution of victims of crimes motivated by bias.
Current law allows federal intervention only if the victim is
prevented from engaging in a federally protected activity, such as
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored in the Senate by Edward M. Kennedy, would
also expand the groups protected by the current hate crimes law,
adding gender, sexual orientation, and disability to the existing
categories of race, religion, color, and national origin.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two states have hate-crimes laws, but some localities are
reluctant to prosecute such crimes or lack the resources to do so,
backers of the federal proposal argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just absolutely elated. It's a stunning victory,'' said
David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the leading
gay and lesbian rights lobby.

FUEL CRISIS IN BRITAIN DEEPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's fuel crisis worsened Wednesday despite Prime
Minister Tony Blair's pledge to end it, as panicky Britons hoarded
gasoline and food and the nation's biggest supermarkets began
rationing bread and milk.
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrators protesting a fuel tax continued to block the
nation's nine oil refineries, motorists spent all day hunting for
gasoline at the few stations still open. About 90 percent of
Britain's 13,000 service stations remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons showed little faith in Blair's promise that the
government would soon have the crisis under control. A BBC poll
found a surprising level of support for the fuel-tax protest. The
BBC said more than three quarters of the people it polled backed
the protest, while only 17 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 11 years, the National Health Service was
put on ``red alert,'' as the health minister, Alan Milburn, ordered
hospitals to implement emergency plans. Hospitals canceled
nonemergency surgery, saying doctors and nurses were having trouble
getting to work.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been put on standby to deliver fuel to essential
services, such as hospitals, if needed. A school system in Wales
closed, saying teachers couldn't drive to work, and other school
systems said they will probably close. The Royal Mail warned that
postal services have been curtailed and could be suspended. The
slowdown in deliveries and panic buying prompted the rationing of
the bread and milk, with one supermarket chain limiting shoppers to
three loaves and six bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Protests by truckers and farmers over fuel taxes continued
unabated across Europe, with disruption reported in Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Germany. Truckers in Ireland, Spain, and as far
east as Poland have threatened disruption unless their governments
cut the fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   But, as has been the case all week, the situation was most
serious in Britain. While Blair insisted he had gotten a guarantee
from oil companies that they would order their drivers to leave
Britain's nine refineries to resume deliveries, only a trickle of
gasoline was being brought to the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Britain uses about 22 million barrels of oil a day, but analysts
estimated that only about 10 percent of that total was delivered
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, about 2,000 oil trucks leave refineries in
Britain; Wednesday about 200 trucks made deliveries, government
officials said. Nearly all of that fuel was being reserved for
police, fire, and other essential services.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers who did leave the refineries were threatened by
protesters. At Stanlow refinery in northwest England, where the
protest began last week, one demonstrator yelled at a driver:
``We'll remember you!''
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, leader of the British opposition, called for
Parliament to be recalled from its summer recess for an emergency
debate on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has arisen because Tony Blair doesn't listen to anyone.
He should be brought to the one place he has to listen,'' said
Hague, who claimed that Blair owed the nation an apology for
fumbling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair's aides said it was hypocritical of the Conservatives
to criticize the Labor Party for refusing to cut the fuel tax, as
it was the Tories who implemented the tax in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Blair's aides admit his government is facing its
most serious crisis since assuming power in May 1997. Sensing the
Labor Party's vulnerability on the issue, the Conservatives, led by
Hague, are trying to exploit the popular anger at Blair's
government. Polls suggest most Britons blame the crisis on the
government, which collects the highest fuel tax in Europe, making
gasoline here, at nearly $5 a gallon, the most expensive in Europe.
More than 70 percent of the pump price goes to the tax coffers.
</P>
<P>
   A beleaguered Blair emerged from another day of closed-door
meetings at 10 Downing St. to acknowledge that his pledge on
Tuesday that things would be ``on their way back to normal in 24
hours'' was overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a considerable distance from where we need to go,''
said Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair remained defiant, saying he would not give into
demands from truckers and farmers to reduce the fuel tax, saying
the government would not negotiate under the threat of blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did give in,'' he said, ``how long before a new
grievance emerged?''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the crisis on the oil companies and its drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the determination exists, the supplies do indeed get
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Milburn, who accused the demonstrators of risking the lives
of those who need medical care, Blair warned the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real damage is being done to real people,'' Blair said.
``Lives are at risk. Businesses will shut down and people will be
put out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestors accused Blair and Milburn of engaging in ``emotional
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Stewart, a truck driver from London, said the fuel tax was
already inflicting serious hardship on his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to see this through,'' said Stewart, who
with dozens of other truckers brought traffic to a standstill on
busy Park Lane in London's West End Wednesday.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High pressure moving off the New England seaboard will promote
sunny skies over most of the Northeastern states. Farther to the
west, isolated showers and thunderstorms will accompany a front
moving east from the Great Lakes. Showers and thunder will linger
in the south-central Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   Florence, a minimal hurricane, continues to disrupt shipping off
the East Coast as it remains nearly stationary. The hurricane is
producing dangerous seas, including riptides, along the
southeastern beaches, although it is 400 miles east of South
Carolina.The storm should move north and east during the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Lane will produce patches
of clouds and isolated showers in the Pacific Northwest. Southern
California will be very warm.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FICKLE RAIN
</P>
<P>
   Near Dallas, Monday was a testament to the fickle ways of summer
showers. More than an inch of rain drenched parts of the
metropolitan area while no rain fell at the official gauge,
extending the record streak of days without measurable rain to 73.
In summer, the jet stream that carries large scale storms typically
stays close to Canadian border. Much of the rain in the South
occurs when the strong sun helps produce rising currents in the
very warm, humid air. These currents can become showers and
thunderstorms a few miles wide which dampen some areas while
others, by chance, remain dry.

SENATE CLEARS LAST HURDLE TO PASSING CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With surprising and decisive ease, the Senate
cleared the last major hurdle Wednesday to passing a landmark trade
bill with China and handing President Clinton one of his top
remaining foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Senators rejected a contentious amendment to impose sanctions on
Chinese companies that export sophisticated weapons to hostile
nations, setting the stage to vote in a few days on legislation to
give China permanent normal trading privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was defeated on a bipartisan vote, 65-32, after a
furious last-minute lobbying campaign this week by pro-trade
business leaders and several of Clinton's cabinet officers, who
argued that the measure was redundant and could scuttle the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The vote virtually assures that the Senate will join the House
in ending the annual congressional review of China's trade status,
a ritual for 20 years that Beijing considers humiliating but that
opponents argue is a lever for improving human rights. More than 70
senators are generally expected to vote for the overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the big enchilada,'' said Sen. Max Baucus of Montana,
a pro-trade Democrat who led the fight against the amendment.
``We've got it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the situation in the House, where the trade bill survived
intense opposition from a coalition of labor and religious groups,
final passage in the Senate was never been in doubt, only the
course to get there. Supporters of the legislation have pressed for
a bill free of amendments because they say there is not enough time
before Election Day to reconcile an amended Senate bill with the
version that the House passed in May.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, amendments to improve human rights, religious
freedom and labor standards in China have fallen by lopsided votes
this week, not because senators opposed them on merit but because
of their potential harm to the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment sponsored by Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., to penalize Chinese companies that
traffic in nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as
long-range missiles, struck a strong chord with lawmakers who are
increasingly alarmed by intelligence reports of Chinese arms
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Under the amendment, the president would have been required to
conduct an annual review of China's proliferation activities. If
Chinese companies trafficked in the prohibited weapons, Clinton
could have cut off sensitive technology exports and U.S. government
loans or credits. The president could have waived the sanctions if
it was in the national security interest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Thompson is asking us to put national security ahead
of greed,'' said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who supported the
amendment. ``What's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, added: ``This amendment is not just
about holding other nations accountable as proliferators. It is
also about holding our president accountable as the world's
principle proliferation enforcer.''
</P>
<P>
   But other senators, including Phil Gramm, R-Texas, voiced
support for the overall bill and its trade benefits and objected to
any amendments that could imperil them.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson mocked Gramm for naively believing that trade could
help reverse Beijing's penchant for selling missiles and missile
technology to countries like North Korea and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``His response is trade with them and one day we will magically
wake up and they will be dismantling their armaments,'' said
Thompson, who has clashed with Gramm in recent months over a bill
to govern export controls. ``When that happens, I will present the
tooth fairy on the floor of this body.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Thompson had watered down his amendment to address
administration complaints that it focused too narrowly on China and
that its sanctions would hurt American farmers, the Clinton
administration strongly objected.
</P>
<P>
   This week, several cabinet members, including Defense Secretary
William Cohen and the national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
telephoned senators who were wavering on the amendment, warning
that it overlapped existing law and hindered the president's
ability to compel China to curb proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 35 Democrats and 30 Republicans voted against
Thompson's measure, while 23 Republicans and nine Democrats voted
for it. Several Republicans who favored the amendment as a separate
bill, including Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Connie Mack of Florida
and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, voted against it as an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it, it's settled, it's all over but for the
shouting,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has
championed the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Thompson's aides said he had not ruled out
bringing up the measure again before the Senate adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and China reached agreement last fall on a
deal to help pave China's eventual entry into the World Trade
Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for
global commerce. China will enter the WTO no matter how the Senate
votes. But without the blessing of Congress, Beijing could withhold
some of the trade benefits, including lower tariffs, from the
American farmers and companies that it will extend to other members
of the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders hailed the surprisingly wide margin of the vote
and predicted speedy passage of the overall bill, perhaps as early
as Thursday.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I have decided not to buy cheap ``throwaway'' roller covers
any more because they don't leave a really smooth paint finish. For
my next job I'm going to buy a top quality cover for use with latex
flat paint.
 &HT;    I would like some suggestions on how best to clean such roller
covers, especially when I will be switching from dark to light
colors?
 &HT;    A: Start by scraping as much excess paint out of the fibers as
you can, using a tool sold for this purpose or even the end of a
wooden stirrer.
 &HT;    Immerse the cover in a pail of warm water with a little
detergent added and squeeze the nap with your hand along its entire
length so as to distribute water through the fibers.
 &HT;    Rinse thoroughly in clean warm water and keep squeezing the
fibers until no more color comes out.
 &HT;    Then use a spinner (sold for use with brushes or roller covers)
to spin the cover rapidly while holding it inside a large garbage
pail or five gallon bucket.
 &HT;    After spinning it till it is almost dry and fluffy, stand it up
on edge to store.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: When it rains heavily, water runs down off a long sloping
hill in back of my house. The water tends to accumulate against the
foundation, creating puddles and occasionally leaking into my
basement around the windows.
 &HT;    What can I do to solve this problem without extensive
re-grading?
 &HT;    A: One solution would be to divert the ground water running off
the hill by digging a trench across the slope, at least 10 feet
uphill from the house and roughly parallel to the house.
 &HT;    This trench should be about 12 inches deep and 12 to 18 inches
wide and should be filled with gravel.
 &HT;    It should be long enough to extend past the house on each side,
and at each end the trench should gradually slant up to the surface
so that water can flow out easily.
 &HT;    The trench will then serve to catch water as it comes down off
the hill and divert it so that it runs off around each side of the
house.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: There is a damp spot on my upstairs bedroom ceiling where the
paint has peeled.
 &HT;    Before painting I had scraped off the old paint down to the bare
plaster and although the plaster does look like it is water
stained, there is no evident sign of a leak in the attic above this
room.
 &HT;    Any idea what could be the problem?
 &HT;    A: I would suspect condensation in the attic, probably on the
roof beams. This moisture then drips down onto the top of the
ceiling and soaks into the plaster, causing the paint to peel.
 &HT;    It could be that some of the eave vents are blocked or that the
attic simply needs more ventilation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: There are a number of very fine hairline cracks in the walls
and ceiling of my living room and I am just getting ready to
repaint this room.
 &HT;    How do you recommend I should repair these before starting to
paint?
 &HT;    A: If the cracks are only in the paint, not in the plaster or
surface under the paint, then it is possible that simply applying a
fresh coat of paint will fill them in.
 &HT;    However, if the problem is due to a previous painting problem _
for example, poor application of previous coats, inadequate drying
time between coats, improper thinning, or failure to prepare the
surface before the last coat of paint was applied _ then the
cracking may reappear.
 &HT;    Either way, fine cracks are usually repaired by filling with
spackling compound, but loose or peeling paint should be scraped
off first.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``USING A SPINNER TO CLEAN ROLLER'' goes
with this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Spinning washed roller cover inside bucket will remove
water after thorough washing and will serve to dry fibers.

BUSH CLAIMS CLINTON-GORE ALLOWED NATIONAL PARKS TO DETERIORATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Wash. _ Turning the environmental tables on Democratic
rival Al Gore, George W. Bush on Wednesday ripped into the
Clinton-Gore administration for allowing national parks to
deteriorate into ``worse shape than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the bank of the scenic, but foggy Skykomish River
north of Seattle, the Republican presidential nominee also
criticized Gore for not taking a stand on a key issue pitting
environmentalists against landowners in the Northwest _ a proposal
to breach four dams on the Snake River to protect salmon, one of
the region's best-known natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes breaching the dams and backs alternatives that, he
says, can protect the salmon's upriver spawning grounds. Gore has
proposed a regional summit to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's third visit to Snohomish County, one of a ring of
mixed suburban and rural counties surrounding Seattle that could be
key to winning Washington's 11 electoral votes. Polls indicate Gore
is leading in Washington but that the state is competitive.
</P>
<P>
   After being on the defensive for much of the time since last
month's Democratic National Convention recharged Gore's campaign,
the Texas governor tried to take the offensive Wednesday on the
environment, an issue that Gore likes to claim as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed spending an additional $3.75 billion on national
park maintenance over the next five years and an extra $100 million
to improve natural science management at the parks.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when more people than ever before are visiting the
national parks, Bush said, the Clinton-Gore administration is
neglecting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sewage flows untreated into the lakes and streams of
Yellowstone National Park,'' he said. ``Civil War relics have been
soaked by a leaky roof at Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, who has been criticized frequently by
Democrats over air and water pollution in Texas, said the
Clinton-Gore administration had requested a 22 percent decrease in
funding for major park maintenance for fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their failure to make maintenance a priority has left our
parks at risk and at the breaking point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backlog of repairs runs into the billions of dollars. For
eight years, this administration has talked up environmentalism
while our national parks are crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the National Park Service has a $4.9 billion
backlog for major maintenance and resource protection, which he
wants to eliminate within five years. The $3.75 billion he proposes
over five years would be in addition to $230 million a year that,
he says, is already in the agency's ``baseline'' for major
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign responded that the administration has created
13 new national parks, and has required that 80 percent of park
entry fees go into park maintenance rather than into the general
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to parks, Al Gore has a record of achievement
whereas George W. Bush has a record of neglect,'' said
Gore-Lieberman senior adviser Ron Klain, claiming that Bush has not
made state parks a priority in Texas during his tenure as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks to a few hundred invited guests in a farm
pasture outside Monroe, where he viewed a restored slough, a
waterway off the Skykomish River that now serves as a nursery for
young salmon, allowing them to grow before they swim down river to
Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The slough was reopened on private property with the help of
state and federal funds. It was hailed by Bush as an example of
public-private cooperation that would be a better way of protecting
salmon than breaching dams.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also supports ``fish-friendly'' turbines or the
installation of devices that divert fish around dams as ways of
letting adult salmon swim up river to their spawning grounds and
their offspring to make the return trip down river.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have advocated breaching, or tearing down part
of, four dams on the Snake River in eastern Washington that were
built between the mid-1960s and 1970s. They help make much of the
Snake and the Columbia River into which it flows navigable, and
they provide irrigation for farmers and hydroelectric power.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said all of those uses are important to the economy of the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need to breach the dams to save the salmon, and
should I become the president, we won't,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee said that Gore had failed the leadership
test on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has refused to take a stand on the importance of
salmon and dams,'' he said. ``He has refused to say whether he
would breach the dams or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said residents of Washington and the Northwest deserved to
know Gore's position before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later left Washington state for southern California, where
he planned to campaign Thursday and Friday in Orange County and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush continued his efforts in California, polls there and
nationally continued to give Gore an edge, and the Bush campaign
announced it has hired Washington consultant Ed Gillespie to help
Bush hone his message.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, who oversaw the communications operation at the
Republican National Convention, will work for Bush communications
director Karen Hughes, who offered him the job last week.
</P>
<P>
   Considered an expert at melding policy and politics, Gillespie
will help Bush shape and deliver his agenda from the campaign's
headquarters in Austin. He has been an informal adviser to the
campaign for months. He is former policy and communications
director of the House Republican Caucus and held the same title
under Rep. Dick Armey, R-Irving, during the congressman's first
year as House majority leader. Gillespie will take a leave of
absence from his private sector consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Reuters/Zogby poll, released Wednesday, had Gore
leading Bush 46-39 nationwide, with Green Party nominee Ralph Nader
at 4 percent and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan at 1 percent.

   TEMPER (Phoenix) - In America's polite cubicle culture, anger
has become the new taboo. That old school of militant factory
foremen and coaches with tempers like Bobby Knight is fading in
favor of zero tolerance policies and company-sponsored anger
management classes. Somewhere in Bobby Knight's 29 years of
coaching, between being inaugurated into the hall of fame and being
fired Sunday for that trademark temper, society changed. ``That old
routine of being a screamer and a cusser is completely out of
fashion all through the business world'' said John Crawford, a
communications professor at Arizona State University who studies

APPLE GIVES PUBLIC A PEEK AT NEW OS X OPERATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of tinkering with the bodywork of its
Macintosh computers, the engineers at Apple Computer Inc. are
popping open the hood.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative and radical styling of its iMac and iBook
computers has brought Apple back from the brink of ruin to a new
position of prestige and profitability. But all along, the
company's computers relied on an aging operating system that lagged
far behind the Windows software from rival Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. In Paris Wednesday Apple CEO Steve Jobs
unveiled a preview version or ``public beta'' of the new Mac OS X,
the company's long-delayed operating system upgrade. And a radical
upgrade it is _ the most dramatic redesign of the software since
the Mac made its debut during the 1984 Super Bowl. The new OS X
(pronounced ``ten,'' for Roman numeral 10) is built around a set of
advanced features that compare favorably not only to Windows, but
even to Linux, the fashionable free operating system that's
developed a worldwide following.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, OS X isn't free _ not even the unfinished beta
version. Apple is selling the software on CD-ROM for $29.95, and
the program will automatically cease to function in May 2001. No
price has been announced for the finished version, which is still
set for release early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, OS X has been profoundly affected by the free
software movement. The most basic part of the operating system, its
``kernel,'' is available at no charge to anybody who wants to
tinker with it. The kernel, named Darwin, is itself based on free
software products similar to Linux. Software developers around the
world are being welcomed to study Darwin, and even produce
modifications, that Apple may incorporate into future versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing incredible response and feedback'' among free
software developers, said OS X product marketing manager Chris
Bourdon, who added that 40,000 programmers have signed up to work
with Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Apple is placing much of the future development of
its core software in the hands of strangers. A few years ago, such
a strategy would have been unimaginable. The raw ``source code''
from which software is made was regarded as a company's crown
jewels, never to be revealed to outsiders. Microsoft is fighting
efforts to force the company to reveal the underlying ``source
code'' for Windows as part of a settlement in its antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular success of Linux, which boasts publicly
available source code, has changed a lot of minds. Apple now
welcomes the assistance of smart outsiders in devising improvements
to their core software.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, while the Darwin kernel is free, there's a great deal
more to Mac OS X, including a flashy new user interface and a
variety of built-in software utilities. These are the features
customers pay for, the ones that make a computer user-friendly and
attractive. Needless to say, Apple has no intention of giving away
this code.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS X has something else in common with Linux _ both products
are descendants of the advanced Unix operating system developed in
the 1970s by AT&AMP;T Corp. for demanding data networking jobs. Linux
was designed as a cheap but powerful Unix alternative; with OS X,
Apple has done much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the beta software provided to the Globe reveals
dramatic improvements over the present Mac operating system, as
well as additional complexities that are likely to confuse some
experienced users. Still, these advanced features can largely be
ignored by current Mac owners, who'll be able to run most of their
present software exactly as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   For experienced users of advanced operating systems, OS X brings
an old-fashioned command-line terminal, where the user can control
the computer by typing complex commands instead of clicking icons.
The terminal accepts standard Unix commands and gives the user
direct access to the heart of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   OS X has plainly borrowed some ideas from Windows. For instance,
OS X has adopted the Windows convention of displaying icons in a
bar at the bottom of the screen, to show which programs are
running. Of course, in traditional Apple style, the Mac taskbar is
a lot prettier _ the animated icons bounce up and down and seem to
pour themselves onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The new software seems to be a good deal more robust than
earlier versions. For example, a program crash that might have
forced a reboot in earlier Mac OS versions had no effect on the
rest of the system.
</P>
<P>
   This ``hardening'' of the operating system was a key goal of its
developers, and to achieve it they had to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The present Mac OS descended from software written for Apple in
the early 1980s for computers that were far less powerful and
sophisticated. To make sure that older programs could run on newer
Macs, the company was forced to keep using old-fashioned features
in newer versions of the operating system. For example, the early
Macs weren't very good at letting a user switch between multiple
tasks _ copying a file, writing a letter and working on a
spreadsheet, for instance. And the current Mac OS 9 still has
problems with this.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was the way that a failure of one program often
caused the entire computer to crash. This could be fixed by adding
``memory protection,'' a feature that ensures that each program
runs in its own private space and can't interfere with others.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had confronted the same problems with its old MS-DOS
operating system. By 1995, it had found the answer in Windows 95.
While far from perfect, Windows 95 and its successors tended to be
more stable than Macs and were better at multitasking.
</P>
<P>
   Apple officials knew they needed something similar. So in the
mid-'90s the company decided to upgrade its operating system by
basing it on a piece of software called Mach _ a Unix-like kernel
developed at Carnegie Mellon University. Jobs, who'd cofounded
Apple, had been ousted in 1985. He'd started his own company, Next
Computer, which made NextStep, a Mach-based operating system. In
December 1996, Gil Amelio, Apple's CEO at the time, stunned the
computer industry by purchasing Next and bringing Jobs back to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also brought Avie Tevanian to Apple. He'd helped create
Mach as a grad student at Carnegie Mellon, and then worked on the
design of NextStep.
</P>
<P>
   Amelio planned to use NextStep as the basis for a new, robust
Mac OS to be called Rhapsody. Jobs liked that part of the plan, but
had no use for Amelio. In July of 1997, he forced Amelio's
resignation and took over.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs presided over a rapid renaissance at Apple, driven by the
company's restyled computers and high-speed PowerPC processor
chips. But only now has the new operating system project begun to
bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian and his colleagues combined his earlier Mach work with
code from another free Unix-like operating system called BSD, which
is especially well-suited for use in computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it because the Mach-BSD combination is an incredibly
robust operating system,'' Tevanian said.
</P>
<P>
   But they faced another problem. If the new OS was too different,
old Mac programs wouldn't run any more, and thousands of people who
write Mac programs would have to be completely retrained. The Mac
OS team responded by building in a set of code called Carbon, which
makes it easier to modify old Mac programs to work under the new
system. They also built in a ``compatibility layer'' of code that
works just like the old Mac OS. When an OS X user wants to run an
older copy of, say, Microsoft Word, the computer boots up the older
Mac OS inside the new one. Then the user can easily hop between the
old and new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Software writers who've worked with OS X agree that it should
make their lives a good deal easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superior Mac interface is already a lot faster, but now
with the modern Mach kernel under the hood, both the human
interaction and raw computing will be so much faster,'' said Glenn
Carnagey, former Web master of the Chicago Sun-Times and now a
programmer in Round Rock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But industry watchers doubt that a new operating system, however
impressive, will do much to expand Apple's popularity beyond its
present market niche. Dan Kusnetzky, an industry analyst with
International Data Corp., said that in 1999, Apple computers made
up only 5 percent of the desktop machines sold worldwide, compared
to 88 percent for Windows. He doubts that OS X will do much to
raise Apple's batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a large number of things in the marketplace
that consumers and users look at,'' said Kusnetzky, ``and for the
most part the operating system is secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Apple's Tevanian hesitates to predict any big market share
breakthrough from OS X.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that we make it so good that it attracts even more
customers to be Mac customers,'' he said. But he adds that the OS X
development team wasn't driven by a desire to have a rematch with
Windows in the desktop wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think of it in those terms,'' said Tevanian. ``Our
goal is to build the best products.''

MIT ADMITS POLICIES LED TO DRINKING DEATH OF STUDENT IN '97 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Institute of Technology admitted
Wednesday that its ``inadequate'' alcohol and housing policies
played a part in the 1997 death of freshman Scott Krueger, and
agreed to pay his family $6 million to avoid a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came only after MIT president Charles M. Vest
flew to Buffalo two weeks ago to apologize personally to Krueger's
parents, Robert and Darlene.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger, 18, was found unconscious in the basement room of MIT's
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house in September,1997 after a night of
apparent hazing. His blood alcohol level was .401.
</P>
<P>
   During nine hours of mediated talks last month, Vest gave his
word that he would crack down on under-aged drinking on campus _
chiefly, by barring freshmen from choosing to live in Greek houses,
as Krueger did.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the day, he offered a hug to Mrs. Krueger, who
had long criticized MIT for not owning up to responsibility in her
son's death. The president's compassion, she said in an interview,
moved her enough to accept the settlement agreement, as well as a
long embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this isn't too late, Mrs. Krueger,'' she recalled him
whispering.
</P>
<P>
   Vest followed up last week with a letter to the Kruegers, in
which MIT formally acknowledged for the first time that it was at
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite your trust in MIT, things went terribly awry,'' Vest
wrote. ``At a very personal level, I feel that we at MIT failed you
and Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   The $6 million settlement ended a dramatic chapter in the
Krueger case, in which the family sought to make the university _
and by extension, higher education institutions nationwide _
accountable for alcohol-related deaths of students.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some MIT students said the campus faced a deeply entrenched
culture of drinking at the pressure-laden school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how MIT can really attack drinking,'' said
Danielle Schumaker, a sophomore and a member of Sigma Kappa. ``Even
in the dorms, students can get away with drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT officials acknowledged that drinking was sometimes a problem
in dorms, but said they felt resident advisers could discourage
alcohol use there. More broadly, they said, memories of Krueger's
death have led so many students to see the danger of excessive
drinking that the campus has undergone ``a cultural change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five fraternities that are now alcohol free that
weren't three years ago,'' said MIT spokesman Ken Campbell. ``We've
had a lot more community events that are great times, with no
alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's death still casts a palpable pall over the MIT campus.
Several students clearly recalled details of Krueger's death in
interviews Wednesday, almost three years after he fell into a coma
and died from severe alcohol poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The student newspaper reported this week that about 15 percent
fewer freshmen than last year were pledging membership to Greek
houses, and some fraternity members said bad publicity may be one
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County District Attorney's office charged the local
chapter of Phi Gamma Delta of involuntary manslaughter and hazing.
But the case effectively came to an end after MIT permanently shut
down the fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruegers plan to soon file a civil action against the local
and national chapters of Phi Gamma Delta, according to the family's
lawyer, Leo V. Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   The family and MIT, meanwhile, had discussed negotiations over
the last several months. Boyle would not say why the apology and
settlement took three years, but said Vest's apology and assurances
were enough for the family to drop plans to sue the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT promised Mr. and Mrs. Krueger that campus life at MIT will
forever be changed,'' Boyle said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in August 2002, all freshmen will be required to live
in university dorms. At the same time, fraternity enrollment events
will not be held during freshmen orientation. MIT has also moved to
place a resident adviser in all Greek houses and ensure its police
will patrol fraternity and sorority houses across the Charles River
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $6 million settlement, $4.75 million will go to the
Kruegers as compensatory damages, and the remaining $1.25 million
will be used to create a scholarship fund in Scott Krueger's name.
</P>
<P>
   An admission of responsibility and a monetary settlement is
unusual for an institution that has neither been sued nor promised
a confidentiality agreement in return, Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawyer, as well as MIT students, credited Vest with a
reputation for admitting when MIT was at fault, as he did last year
when he approved findings that some female professors had suffered
discrimination in pay and office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what was important to the Kruegers, and I think in his
heart he knew what was important to him,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Vest was not available for comment. In a statement, he said,
``We can now move on with the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Krueger agreed, saying she, for one, wanted to put MIT
behind her. ``There's no way I'll ever go back there,'' she said
after a press conference in Downtown Crossing, just a mile from the
campus. ``My son died there.''

DELTA TO BEGIN FLIGHTS TO LONDON FROM BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Get ready for price wars to London from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, which began Boston-Los Angeles service this
summer and drove the fares down on that route, said Wednesday it
will begin service to London's Gatwick Airport from Logan
International Airport on June 1, pending federal government
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Four airlines _ American, United, British Airways, and Virgin _
fly nonstop from Boston to London, making it Logan's busiest
international route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to begin service on the largest international
market from Boston,'' said Mark Drusch, Delta's senior vice
president of network management, in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   While Delta, which flies more passengers to Europe than any
other US carrier, was expected to begin international service from
Boston when its new $400 million terminal is built and opened in
2004 or 2005, the proposed service for next year caught many by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Even Massport officials were not aware of the decision until
Wednesday's press release was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of this flight underscores Delta's long-term
commitment to growth in Boston,'' said Drusch.
</P>
<P>
   Massport aviation director Thomas Kinton said if the service is
approved it will bring the number of daily flights to London to
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks to the strength of the Boston international long
haul market. To support seven frequencies to London is remarkable.
This gears it up to almost a New York shuttle type frequency,''
Kinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's daily flights will seat 195 passenger, 48 in
BusinesssElite and 147 in economy.
</P>
<P>
   The eastbound flight will start in Los Angeles, stop in Boston
for two hours and continue on to London. The westbound flight will
end in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-Gatwick route was originally held by Northwest
Airlines, and they dropped it. It was then picked up by American
(which also flies to Heathrow), and American dropped it last year,
Massport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is asking to use the route because it is dormant. If the
airline receives federal Department of Transportation approval, it
will begin selling tickets and an introductory fare is likely, a
Delta official said.

 &HT;    Coke sees new bottle, can dispenser as a sales booster
 &HT;    By Scott Leith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The Coca-Cola Co. is rolling out a way to sell
everything from Coke to iced tea to orange juice, all from the same
vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``glass front vender,'' the new device is likely to
turn heads when it starts showing up around the nation. Made by
Maytag Corp., it offers a view of the products inside, much like a
candy machine or store cooler. It also holds different-sized
containers, enabling Coke to stock its full line of brands in one
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is pitching it as a whole new vending experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost is the variety that the machine provides,''
said David Karpan, director of vending for Coca-Cola North America.
During test runs last year in Greensboro, N.C., and Dallas, the
machine boosted sales significantly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A new Coke machine might not sound like a breakthrough, but a
unique device can be important to a company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines account for about 13 percent of soda sales,
said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest. ``The more interesting
the machine is, the more likely it is to attract customers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke thinks its new device is entertaining, too, largely because
a little elevator moves up and down to get individual bottles and
cans before shooting them to the buyer. The practical benefit:
Bottled soda doesn't get fizzy due to dropping from the top.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are equipped for ``online'' vending, although not
all will have the feature from the start. With online vending, the
machine keeps track of its inventory and notifies the bottler when
it's getting low.
</P>
<P>
   The new machines will cost more than the current $2,500 models,
but Coke declined to discuss exact costs. The machines were
developed by Coke and a unit of Maytag, the Iowa-based appliance
maker. Production just started at Maytag's Dixie-Narco
manufacturing plant in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag is promoting the machine under its own name rather than
Dixie-Narco, as in the past. ``This is unique to the industry,''
explained Doug Drenten, group vice president of research and
development for Maytag's Commercial Solutions group.

 &HT;    Aikman appears ready to play Monday against Redskins
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys Quarterback Troy Aikman returned to practice Wednesday,
a sign that he will play in Monday night's game in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman traded snaps with Randall Cunningham, who played well
Sunday in Arizona. Aikman did not complain about the headaches he
had after suffering a concussion 11 days ago against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo said Aikman's status for the next game might be
made today. If Wednesday is any indication, there is little doubt
Aikman will play if he continues to feel good throughout the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks exactly the same to me,'' wide receiver Wane McGarity
said. ``He looks fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Norv Turner said Aikman will be a tough
challenge for his secondary. Just last year he threw for 362 and
244 yards in two games against the Redskins. He had seven
touchdowns, five in the season-opener in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my first-hand experience, I believe Troy's still one of
the better quarterbacks in the league,'' said Turner, who was
Aikman's mentor when he was a Dallas assistant from 1991 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   NOTEWORTHY
</P>
<P>
   Turner said cornerback Champ Bailey, a two-way player at
Georgia, might play offense Monday. The Redskins are looking for
help in the wake of receiver Michael Westbrook's season-ending
injury....
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Redskins limited Detroit to five field goals, the
first time Washington has held an opponent without a touchdown on
the road in eight years....
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has won five straight games against Washington, the
longest streak for the Cowboys over the Redskins since Dallas won
six straight between 1979 and 1982. The longest winning streak for
the Redskins in the series is four, from 1986 to 1988. Dallas leads
the series 45-33-2....
</P>
<P>
   Washington has explosive players on offense, but the longest
completed pass in two games is only 26 yards....
</P>
<P>
   Rookie cornerback Mario Edwards of Florida State, who has not
played in about a month, returned to practice this week and could
work himself into nickel-package defenses.... Washington rookie
linebacker LaVar Arrington of Penn State might get his first NFL
start on Monday....
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been burned by big plays on defense. They have
yielded three pass-interference penalties for 44, 37 and 26 yards.
The have allowed pass plays of 63 and 26 yards....
</P>
<P>
   Washington receiver Irving Fryar needs one catch to move ahead
of Henry Ellard into sixth on the all-time NFL reception list with
815. He needs only six catches to pass Steve Largent into fifth
place....
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have allowed one defensive touchdown this season.
It was in the opener against Carolina....

   RATINGS GAME: Nielsen//NetRatings has launched a monitor of
Internet traffic to Web sites covering the Sydney 2000 Olympic
Games. It will provide extensive reports of Internet traffic to key
sites from 14 countries in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe.
Not surprisingly, the data already reveals U.S.-based Web traffic
is surging to key sites. Traffic to NBCOlympics.com rose 41 percent
from July to August to 236,000 unique visitors. Nearly 63 percent
of those visiting the site were female; males made up 37 percent.
The official site, Olympics.com, jumped 51 percent in the U.S. to
184,000 unique home visitors. Females made up 54 percent of its
traffic; males 46 percent. In Australia, the number of unique
visitors to Olympics.com grew from 36,000 in May to almost 200,000
in August. Page views were up from 440,000 to more than 4.4
million.

   STATUS QUOKKA: WSJ.com's ``Nothing But Net'' has a Q&AMP;A with
Alvaro Saralegui, the former business manager for Sports
Illustrated who went on to become COO of Quokka Sports. Saralegui
defends his site's switch from specializing in less-popular sports
_ mountain climbing, sailing races _ to more mainstream fare.
Deciding not to change would have ``limited the magnitude of the
business,'' he said. Quokka has lined up a deal with NBC to cover
the Olympic on the Web.

   Today's daily checklist: Five players who may have a hard time
this week, and sites where you can monitor their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Batch: Last Sunday against Washington, the Lions QB was
throwing against Deion Sanders, who said he played the worst game
of his career. Still, Batch couldn't find the end zone. He will be
better _ remember, he missed the preseason _ but probably not this
week against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   www.mlive.com/lions
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Conway: A few red flags for the Chargers WR. He's getting
older, he's had injury trouble, and Ryan Leaf is his quarterback.
Kansas City is next, and the Chiefs have one of the best
secondaries in the league. For the time being, lay off the
Chargers.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Warrick Dunn: He and fellow Bucs RB running back Mike Alstott
share carries, meaning it'll be tough for either to gain too many
yards, and Alstott is the better option in close. Dunn led the team
in receptions last year, but the addition of Keyshawn Johnson means
his chances there are diluted as well.
</P>
<P>
   bucs.tbo.com
</P>
<P>
   Jake Reed: The Saints brought in WR Reed and QB Jeff Blake to
pump up the passing game. Blake has done his part, but it looks
like he prefers Joe Horn (17 catches for 174 yards and two
touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   www.nolalive.com/saints
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith: The Cowboys RB will go down in history as one of
the great backs, and may yet pass Walter Payton's all-time rushing
total. But, 1) he's getting older and 2) his team will be behind a
lot, meaning he might not get many 20-25-carry games anymore.

 &HT;    Discount airlines leading way in online ticket sales
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - AirTran Airways' Web site has never been busier.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando-based airline, which operates an Atlanta hub, now
generates about one-third of its revenue through its Internet site,
compared with just 1 percent two years ago. During a fare sale last
week, tickets booked at airtran.com accounted for 42 percent of all
revenue taken in that day, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two years we've seen phenomenal growth,'' said
Kevin Healy, vice president of planning.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines large and small began luring customers to their Web
sites in the late 1990s with frequent-flier perks and sales.
Discount airlines now lead the pack when it comes to selling
tickets through these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most major carriers airlines sell 4 percent to 6 percent of
their tickets through their home sites, far lower than percentages
reported by AirTran and Southwest Airlines. Southwest, the
Dallas-based low fare airline, generates about 30 percent, or $1
billion, in revenue through its site annually.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why discount airlines fare best is because
they have always encouraged travelers to book tickets directly
through them instead of through third parties; now they are
retraining customers to visit Web sites instead of calling 800
numbers. These companies also cater to tourists and entrepreneurs
willing to use the Internet to hunt for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: the sites are easy to use, requiring visitors to
click through as few as six pages before they buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simplicity of their sites helps tremendously,'' said Terry
Trippler, a consultant and writer for travel site Onetravel.com.
``AirTran has had to think differently from the start, and low fare
airlines were quicker to embrace the idea of booking a ticket
online.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have a big motivation to push online bookings, which
dramatically cut processing costs. For example, a ticket booked
through AirTran's Web site costs the company 30 cents to 40 cents,
compared with $5 through its reservation desk, according to the
company. Commissions push the costs of a ticket sold through a
travel agent up to between $10 and $11.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest pays $1 to sell a ticket through its Web site, between
$3 and $7 through its reservation desk, and about $10 through a
travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, the nation's third-largest
carrier, now generates about 4 percent of its revenue through its
Web site and 10 percent through all sites at which it sells seats.
They include its own site, delta.com; name-your-own-price site
priceline.com; and online agents Travelocity.com and Expedia.com.
</P>
<P>
   Delta hopes to boost the percentage of tickets sold through all
online venues to 30 percent by 2003 but doesn't have specific
targets for its Web site, said spokesman John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   An airline's Internet site is easily the cheapest place for it
to sell tickets because bookings aren't subject to commissions paid
to both online and traditional travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Big carriers also have invested in other online ventures. Delta
and four other top airlines are co-owners of Orbitz, the online
agent expected to start business in about a year. Delta was also
the first big airline to sell seats through priceline.com, which
gave it lucrative stock rights and the right to keep competitors
from selling through priceline.com flights on certain routes.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Web sites and travel agencies like Travelocity and
Expedia now split the share of tickets sold online evenly, but
airline sites eventually will win over more travelers as they
aggressively advertise their brands, said Heidi Kim, a travel
analyst at Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, airline sites will sell online 55 percent of air travel
purchased, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppliers were essentially asleep, but now we're at that
turning point,'' Kim said. ``(Airlines) have the advantage of using
their brand to pick up bookings. They can transition people from
the off line world to the online world.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel experts say consumers should not book a ticket through an
airline site without investigating other options. Before booking
through an airline site, always compare prices with an independent
online travel agency or a traditional travel agent, Trippler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``There could be a big deal on one
and not the other. Three words for the consumer to remember are
compare, compare, compare.''

 &HT;    Aikman appears ready to play Monday against Redskins

NEWSPAPER SEEKS TO PRESERVE EXECUTED PRISONER'S DNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRUNDY, Va. _ The Boston Globe asked a court Wednesday to
prevent Virginia officials from destroying DNA evidence that would
determine if Roger Coleman, who was executed by the state eight
years ago despite his claims of innocence, was indeed guilty of the
crime for which he died.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also asked Judge Keary R. Williams of the Buchanan
County Circuit Court to reconsider his decision that the state, and
not his court, is the legal custodian of the evidence, and to
permit DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was executed by Virginia in May 1992 for the rape and
murder of his sister-in-law, Wanda McCoy. He was convicted on the
basis of circumstantial evidence, and his ability to appeal the
verdict was curtailed when one of his lawyers was a day late in
filing the necessary court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Coleman case is often cited by the American Civil Liberties
Union and other foes of capital punishment as a wrongful execution.
He appeared on the cover of Time magazine before he died, and a
book, ``May God Have Mercy,'' has been written about the case,
raising doubts about his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its reknown, the Coleman case is unique because the DNA
evidence from the case has been frozen and preserved by a
California laboratory since his death. Unlike other cases where
executed inmates had proclaimed their innocence, there are no
questions about a chain of custody of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ongoing effort to test the claim of death penalty
foes that innocent men and women have been executed in America, the
Globe asked Judge Williams to authorize further testing in the
Coleman case last May.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe based its argument on the Virginia Freedom of
Information Act, the guarantees of the public's right to know and
the media's freedom of access contained in the US and Virginia
Constitutions. The Globe also cited, as a precedent, the order it
won in Houston County, Ga. this summer authorizing post-execution
testing of DNA material there in the case of Ellis Wayne Felker.
</P>
<P>
   In the Georgia case, Judge L.A. McConnell Jr. ruled that ``the
rights reserved to the public...would be hollow if the court only
allowed a visual inspection. . . . In order for the inspection to
be meaningful, the public should have a right to know what, if
anything, is contained in the subject evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A rudimentary DNA test conducted in 1990 by Edward Blake, a
california-based expert in DNA testing, failed to exclude Coleman
as the murderer. At the Globe's request, Blake told the court in
July that today's DNA technology could yield a more definitive
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an analysis,'' Blake wrote Williams in a July 26 letter
urging the judge to approve new tests, ``could resolve any
lingering factual issues.'' Blake conducted the 1990 tests, and has
stored the DNA samples ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When the Attorney General's office learned of the Globe's
efforts, however, it moved to block the testing and regain control
of the DNA samples. Senior Assistant Attorney General Donald R.
Curry, who lobbied against the testing, declined to discuss his
reasons with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Williams' predecessor, retired Judge Nicholas Persin, had
asserted his court's authority and ordered the 1990 DNA test. But
Judge Williams was persuaded by Curry's argument that the court did
not have that power, and that the legal custodian of the DNA
evidence is the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the Attorney General's argument, Judge Williams issued
an order on September 7, ordering Blake to return the DNA evidence
to the state police detective who had led the prosecution of the
Coleman case.
</P>
<P>
   Williams informed the Globe's lawyers of his order on Tuesday,
and the newspaper filed its response Wednesday: asking Williams to
reconsider, and urging the judge to stop Virginia officials from
destroying the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case earlier this year, state authorities
incinerated the evidence that might have been tested from another
capital case, that of Joseph O'Dell, who had been executed in 1997
for a 1985 rape and murder. The Catholic Diocese of Richmond hoped
to test the evidence in the O'Dell case but lost its suit in the
Virginia Supreme Court, in part because there was not an intact
chain of custody.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Enzinna, the lawyer in the O'Dell case, filed a petition on
behalf of further testing in the Coleman case Wednesday on behalf
of Centurian Ministries, a non-profit group that helps inmates
prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned the Commonwealth of Virginia will do
everything in its power, as it did in the Joseph O'Dell case, to
destroy the evidence and, therefore, prevent the truth from coming
out,'' said James McCloskey, the minister who heads Centurian
Ministries and once worked with Coleman's defense team.
</P>
<P>
   David Botkins, press secretary for Virginia Attorney General
Mark Earley, appeared to leave room for a compromise Wednesday,
saying ``there have never been any conversations or discussions by
anyone in the Commonwealth about destroying any evidence.'' The
Attorney General's office acted only because it believed that
``whatever testing is going to be done, or should be done,'' should
be conducted in Virginia, Botkins said.
</P>
<P>
   McCloskey, in turn, said he would not object if the state used
its own forensic experts to test the samples. ``Let the chips fall
where they may, and let's discover the truth together,'' McCloskey
said.

VERIZON TO MOVE MASSACHUSETTS JOBS TO DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Verizon Communications said Wednesday it will move 500
to 550 of its 1,000 jobs at a Middleton directory publishing
business to Dallas over the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The company, created from the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE,
said it has no idea yet how many if any people could be laid off.
It said anyone not offered a new position in Dallas will be offered
extensive job-placement assistance. Only management positions, not
union jobs, are involved, Verizon said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bell officials had warned employees in Middleton in
January that some jobs there might be moved as part of the merger,
people familiar with the office said many employees were devastated
by the news, especially those nearing retirement and
pension-collecting age, and unhappy about the prospect of moving to
Texas. However, several expected they could easily find another job
in the state's booming telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Middleton site was headquarters of the Bell Atlantic unit
that oversees and publishes all paper and electronic directories,
including the Yellow Pages. About 400 to 450 jobs will be kept at
Middleton in sales, billing, customer care, and field staff, said
Verizon spokesman Jack Hoey.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date the only decision we have made so far is about
location,'' Hoey said. ``We haven't made any decision about
staffing. We're going to of course offer many employees an
opportunity to move to Dallas, and all other employees we will be
offering significant transition assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most job transfers will be completed by next March, Hoey said,
although it could take until fall 2002 before all transfers are
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Hoey characterized the move as part of an expected reshuffling
of Verizon sites in the wake of the Bell-GTE merger, which has
included merging the company's headquarters into Bell's New York
City site and moving and consolidating other offices.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon said that despite shedding 500 jobs in Massachusetts, it
will continue to rank as the state's largest employer of people in
full-time jobs, with more than 19,000, and has added over 1,700
management and union jobs here in the last three years on its
landline and wireless phone businesses.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each actor in the all-star political cast _ Joseph
I. Lieberman, Lynne Cheney, and John McCain _ gave dramatic
performances Wednesday, blaming the entertainment industry for
polluting the popular culture and making it nearly impossible for
parents to police the films, recordings, and video games that amuse
their children.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was the Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by McCain,
and the background was a scathing Federal Trade Commission report,
released Monday, that accuses Hollywood of deliberately marketing
violent entertainment to teenagers, a practice McCain called
``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman broke away from his Democratic vice presidential
campaign to testify on what he called ``the growing concern'' about
the decay of the nation's moral fabric and the ``culture of
carnage'' that influences youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than helping to shoulder some of the growing burden on
parents, the entertainment industry too often has chosen to go
behind parents' backs, targeting the sale of violent, adult-rated
products directly to children,'' the Connecticut senator said.
``This practice is deceptive, I believe it is outrageous, and it's
got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a longtime Senate critic of Hollywood's values, said
he and presidential candidate Al Gore are demanding the industry
immediately end its marketing of R-rated entertainment to children.
If self-regulation does not occur, he said, the FTC should take
action under rules that bar false and deceptive advertising. If the
FTC determines it lacks such power, Congress should pass
legislation expanding the agency's authority, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, wife of GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney and
herself a cultural warrior, said moral authority, not new
regulation, should pressure the entertainment industry to reform
itself. In her equal-time testimony, she hinted at hypocrisy on the
part of Gore and Lieberman because they will appear at a
fund-raiser in New York Thursday night hosted by Miramax studio
executive Harvey Weinstein expected to raise more than $5 million
for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't people of stature go to Harvey Weinstein and ask him
to pledge that he will not fund works that debase the culture and
corrode our children's souls?'' asked Cheney, who was appointed to
head the National Endowment for the Humanities by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said it was shameful for major companies to represent rap
artists like Eminem, whom she described as ``a violent
misogynist.'' His song, ``Kill You,'' describes the rape and murder
of his mother. Cheney said she wrote letters to two female
executives at the Seagram Co., which produces Eminem's best-selling
CDs, citing the offensive lyrics and warning that Congress could
move against the entertainment industry if it does not clean up its
act.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was furious that none of Hollywood's studio executives
agreed to appear at his hearing, and he reissued an invitation for
13 of them to testify before the committee on Sept. 27. Heads of
two record companies and two video-game manufactuers did appear,
defending their marketing and First Amendment protection against
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``By some uncanny coincidence, every single studio executive was
either out of the country or unavailable,'' McCain told the
standing-room-only crowd. ``I can only conclude the industry was
too ashamed of or unable to defend their marketing practices. Their
hubris is stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, Hollywood's longtime Washington lobbyist,
testified for the film studios and insisted that the 32-year-old
voluntary industry rating system works for the majority of parents.
But he pledged to meet with his members, as well as theater owners,
to address issues about marketing and access of teens to violent
movies.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Valenti scoffed at Wednesday's session, saying
it was more about politicians vying to sound earnest and
family-friendly in an election year than about regulating or
legislating. His request to have the hearing delayed one week so
the Hollywood executives could participate was denied by McCain's
staff, said Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the senators on the committee said they deplored
the coarsening of the culture and expressed angst about their own
helplessness as parents, the only calls for legislative remedies
came from Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Even Robert Pitofsky, the FTC chairman who called the
entertainment industry's marketing of violent material ``brazen,''
said he was reluctant to move against Hollywood because it would be
unprecedented and sure to end up in court for years. ``We can't
wait forever,'' Pitofsky said, ``but I hope we can find ways to
cooperate.''

SUIT HOPES TO REOPEN BOSTON STRANGLER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Relatives of Albert DeSalvo, who confessed to being the
Boston Strangler, and those of his last victim, will file a lawsuit
Thursday to reopen the case, armed with what they say is new,
exculpatory proof that DeSalvo was not the killer.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney representing the families told the Globe Wednesday
that DeSalvo made a crucial slip-up in his confession to the murder
of Mary Sullivan in 1964, a confession that was captured on a tape
they recently obtained.
</P>
<P>
   In the tape, DeSalvo admitted to ``penetrating and ejaculating
into'' Sullivan during her murder, but according to relatives'
attorney Elaine Whitfield Sharp, autopsy reports they obtained
Tuesday show no evidence of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of the major parts of the confession that he
made, and he got it wrong,'' Sharp said. ``He just plain got it
wrong, and the reason he got it wrong, we believe, was because he
was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you murdered somebody, wouldn't you remember what you
did?'' Sharp continued. ``So our position is, let's reopen the
case, but the government has put up road blocks for no apparent
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which the families will file in Suffolk County
Superior Court, demands that the attorney general's office, the
Boston Police Department, the county medical examiner's office, and
the state police return forensic and other evidence they have held
onto since Sullivan's 1964 killing. From there, they will attempt
to solve the case privately, and in the process, yank DeSalvo's
name from the shadow of the label ``Boston Strangler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive to the families' concerns, but this is no
different from any other unsolved homicide,'' said Ann E. Donlan a
spokeswoman for Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly. ``Like we've
said before, no one has ever been charged, and as with any other
unsolved homicide, the investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the murders remains open. We will continue to work with
the Suffolk District Attorney's office and the Boston Police
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Reilly said he was ``inclined'' to give the
families access to the evidence in the case _ which is still
technically open. Since then, however, Reilly's office sent a
letter to Sharp, who is representing the families for free, saying
no evidence was forthcoming, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   DeSalvo, who confessed to 13 murders that took place between
June 1962 and January 1964, was killed in Walpole Prison in 1973 by
a fellow inmate while serving time on unrelated charges. He was
never charged with the Stangler murders.
</P>
<P>
   This spring the Boston Police Department issued a statement
saying it would no longer investigate the Boston Strangler case,
due to deterioration of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp hopes to disprove that assertion at a press conference
Thursday. She and the families will convene to play the confession
tape, in hopes of persuading Reilly and others that the case is
still worthy of investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation would be led by James E. Starrs, a well-known
forensic scientist from George Washington University who has
volunteered to take on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The families also hope to exhume the bodies of DeSalvo and
Sullivan in hopes that modern DNA-reading technology would also end
questions once and for all about the connection between DeSalvo and
the Boston Strangler.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was the killer, if not DeSalvo, Sharp declined to
speculate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get over this first step first,'' she said.

 &HT;    Austin swimmer Walker shrugs off talk about Olympic pressure
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ When you talk about the Olympics, you have to talk
about the pressure. Unless you're Neil Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be really fun,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any athlete who's just happy to be in Australia, it's
Walker, a lanky Austin resident and former University of Texas
swimmer. Four years ago he gained a small measure of fame by
missing the Olympics by the smallest of margins, one-hundredth of a
second when he was touched out for sixth place in the 100-meter
freestyle at the U.S. swim trials. In that event, six swimmers can
go to the Olympics on the 400 freestyle relay team.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Walker might be anchoring that race Saturday
and might later have a shot at medals in another relay and two
individual events in the 2000 Summer Olympics. And that's after
having a couple of off swims and maybe making one bad choice at the
U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with how things went,'' Walker maintained. ``It was
a scary thing going into the trials. For the last six months I'd
looked past it. I saw myself on the Olympic team. It was a huge
relief to make the team in the 100 backstroke. I made the team and
won an event, the 100-meter freestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker might be the least intense looking athlete in the Olympic
pool. Your typical Type A swimming personality, he's not. He
doesn't move quickly on land or in the warm-down pool and likes
nothing better than to spend a lazy day fishing. Could you imagine
Alexander Popov as a cheese head? Walker, a former Wisconsin
resident and still a Green Bay Packers fan, owns one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, looks can be very deceiving. In the Short Course World
Championships earlier this year, Walker won seven medals and set
five world records. In a way, he's almost too talented. At the U.S.
trials, Walker had so many races he decided to pass on the
100-meter butterfly _ a race in which he's the American record
holder.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Walker's first race will be the 400 freestyle relay. It's
a race the American men have never lost in the Olympics. They're
well aware of that and so are the Australians, who knocked them off
at that distance at the Pan Pacific Championships here in 1999.
Both teams know that one race can be huge for team momentum,
something the Americans can't let the Australians build in a swim
center that can hold 18,200 fans screaming ``Aussie, Aussie,
Aussie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we've managed to muster up some really good confidence
that we can hang with the Aussies,'' Walker said. ``The team
concept is very important. It's contagious. It happened with the
Texas guys at the trials. One guy starts doing well, and then
everyone does.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first individual race, the 100 backstroke, Walker rates
as a medal threat behind the stroke's master, Lenny Krayzelburg.
Walker chuckles about their race in the U.S. trials, in which he
faded to second.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said, ``I took it out way too fast in the first 50
meters. I wound up going a lot slower than I usually do in the
final 50 meters. You don't want to go out too fast or too slow. In
that first 50 I used up all my energy and burst my energy bubble.
Lenny did the same thing. He took it out with me and faded more
than he usually does. I know I can go a lot faster in the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. trials, Walker took the 100 freestyle, in which he
was a clear favorite. Here it's a different matter. He might win.
He might not medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most heated race in the world,'' Walker marveled.
``The field is fast and deep. You've got the world record holder in
Alexander Popov and two or three other guys who should be right
there with him. Popov is swimming really well, and I think Gary
Hall will go a lot faster than he did in the trials. Anybody has a
shot at it. There are so many times when a huge underdog wins it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker won't be competing in his favorite race. He has said he
likes the 50 freestyle because, ``It's the only race where you
actually go anywhere, even if it's just the other end of the pool.
The other races you get out where you start.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs off the third-place finish at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd feel more disappointed if I got third by just a
little,'' he said. ``Three-tenths of a second doesn't sound like
much, but that's a lot in the 50 meters. Usually you can't even
tell who won. There were two guys that were above and beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50, however, was a race he picked over the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in there with the 50 free being my better race. I was
debating whether just to swim the butterfly for a time for the
coaches. But our butterfliers will be fine. Now, I get those days
off,'' he reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Walker thought of posting one butterfly time in the prelims at
the trials to give himself and the coaches another option in the
400 medley relay. Now, it might come down to whether he's picked
for the freestyle leg or if that goes to the resurgent Hall, a
great freestyle talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tricky. It's up to the coaches as to who wins
the gold medal and who doesn't,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was worried about that. But it didn't sound like it.

VOTER BACKLASH EJECTS PRO-CIVIL UNION LEGISLATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A voter backlash against civil unions for same-sex couples
claimed the careers of several veteran Republican lawmakers in
Vermont, Tuesday, but the state's Democratic auditor running for
the US Senate was not one of the victims. In fact, Edward Flanagan
now appears to be the nation's first openly gay US Senate nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, who is Vermont's only openly gay statewide
office-holder, won the Democratic nomination by 1,000 votes out of
34,000 cast over challenger Jan Backus and will now face incumbent
US Senator Jim Jeffords, who won 79 percent of the vote in the
Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   But Vermont, which has been riven by the new law allowing gay
couples most of the rights of married couples, bounced six
lawmakers who had supported the measure. Five of the state
legislators who were ousted were Republicans and one was a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who supported civil unions and were swept
out of office was Marion Milne of Williamstown. She said that
during the campaign, her 13-year-old grandson became the target of
an ugly anti-gay epithet when he was collecting signatures for her.
</P>
<P>
   Also defeated was John Edwards of Swanton, which is near the
Canadian border. A three-term Republican incumbent, he serves on
the House Judiciary Committee and was also targeted by the
opponents of civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote was the first opportunity for Vermonters to cast
a ballot since the civil unions law was approved in April and took
effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably something that's going to take a generation
to resolve,'' said Thomas Little, the Republican chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee. Although Little was one of the sponsors
of the legislation, he beat back his challenger, Rod Fisher, by a
vote of 617-428.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund of Washington, D.C., a national
advocacy group that works to elect gay and lesbian candidates to
public office, hailed Flanagan's primary victory. It said that,
based on its research, he was the first open gay or lesbian
candidate to be the nominee of either major party for a seat in the
US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently three members of the US House who are openly
gay or lesbian, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartening that despite the gay baiting and backlash
against civil unions, a great candidate was able to prevail on his
merits as a candidatate,'' said a spokesman for the group, Sloan
Wiesen.
</P>
<P>
   But Flanagan, the auditor whose campaign mascot was a bulldog,
said that the upheaval over civil unions was less of an issue in
his race and noted that he drew support in some of communities that
turned against the lawmakers who voted for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a minor factor,'' Flanagan said of the
first-in-the-nation law. ``Yes, there is a roiling debate in
Vermont over civil unions. But Jim Jeffords and I have precisely
the same stand on the issue. We won because we spoke to the issues
of concern to voters, such as the need for health-care reform,
funding for special education and campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much of an issue civil unions would be in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of it will be familiar: Governor Howard Dean, a
Democrat, who was renominated Tuesday with almost 90 percent of the
vote, will face Republican Ruth Dwyer, an outspoken opponent of the
civil unions law who took 58 percent of the vote in her party's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the race will be a rematch of the 1998 face-off
when Dean won his fourth full term by a 56-41 margin over Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief features of the primary campaign was the
surprising strength of the opponents of civil unions, who succeeded
in plastering their adopted slogan, ``Take Back Vermont,'' all over
the landscape. Signs proclaiming that message _ which was used
previously in the fight against the controversial Act 60 property
tax _ were tacked to utilitly poles, hung from front porches,
nailed to the sides of barns posted in yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer did not specifically mention that civil unions law in her
acceptance speech late Tuesday night, but she did signal the main
message of the ``Take Back Vermont'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue is listening to Vermonters,'' she told
supporters in Montpelier. The people control their own state. We
want to give it back to them.''

   CONSENT-LAPD (Los Angeles) _ In a climax confrontation, the U.S.

THE ULTIMATE REMOTE MEANS NEVER HAVING TO LEAVE THE COUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Pa.)   (Circuits)  
 By JENNIFER 8. LEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Alpert, president of an Internet startup called
MarketingInfo, admits that he is addicted to remote controls. He
estimates that the members of his gadget-oriented family have
accumulated about 55 remote controls over the years around their
house in Old Westbury, N.Y. There was one for the air-conditioning,
one for the lights. They needed five remote controls to watch a
movie and 12 to listen to the stereo, with separate controls for
components like the subwoofers and the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point,'' Alpert said, ``the extra features stop
being convenient and become overwhelming. It's not worth it.
Remotes are supposed to simplify things.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 50th year, the remote control population outnumbers the
human population in the United States. Households often have more
remote controls than they have family members. Alpert's family of
four, for example, keeps a basket of a dozen or so old remote
controls. ``I don't know what they do,'' Alpert said. ``They're
like Gremlins. You get them wet, and they multiply.''
</P>
<P>
   The average household now has more than four remote controls,
according to the Consumer Electronics Association. Most of these
operate televisions and stereos, but remote controls have expanded
their domain into other areas of the house. They are now available
for fireplaces, ceiling fans, air-conditioning, house lights and
window blinds. They have hopped out of the house and into the car,
and even onto the Internet. For people who find using a mouse too
onerous, PlanetPortal is introducing the WebRemote Control, which
browses through Web sites with a touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from this landscape awash with remote controls are
supergadgets, the universal remote controls that have emerged in
the last three years. The latest high-end universal remote controls
are sleek. They are chic. They have LCD touch screens. They can
talk to personal computers. And they can cost several hundred
dollars apiece. In short, they are more akin to personal digital
assistants than to the clunky black rubber-button remotes of yore.
</P>
<P>
   These remote controls can take one to two hours to set up, often
with software on a PC. They can also learn directly from other
remotes by reading their infrared signals.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert found his salvation in a touch-screen universal remote
control. Sleek and black, it put all his controls in one place.
``It was awesome,'' Alpert said. ``There was everything right in
front of you, including lights, air-conditioning, TV, VCR _
everything in just one touch of the screen. Life was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the off-the-shelf universal remotes with touch-screen LCD
displays on the market are the Pronto from Philips Electronics, the
Take Control TC1000 from Harman Kardon and the RM-AV2100 control
from Sony. Universal Remote Control says its Home Theater Master
MX-1000 will be on the market by the end of this month. The Pronto
and the Take Control let users use their PC software to design LCD
interfaces with their own virtual buttons.
</P>
<P>
   While the hefty price tags _ about $130 to $400 _ may raise
eyebrows, buyers who have spent thousands of dollars on home
entertainment systems may not balk at paying that much for a single
device that can run everything.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Trueman, who runs a software consulting firm outside
Philadelphia, recently paid $300 for a Philips Pronto touch-screen
universal remote to replace the 10 remote controls he had in his
house. ``It definitely makes it much, much easier,'' he said. ``I'm
not constantly searching for the right remote.'' The old remote
controls are now relegated to a drawer under the couch. ``They are
pretty much happy because they are under the sofa, where they tend
to go anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His new universal control has been programmed to start DVD
movies at a touch of a button. ``It's even less of a reason to get
up,'' Trueman said. ``If the remote control could bring me a beer,
that would be it.'' The remote control might not be able to deliver
beer quite yet, but it can fetch pizza. In Honolulu, viewers can
use the remote control to order from Pizza Hut through a service
provided by PowerTV.
</P>
<P>
   If the remote control visionaries are to be believed, these
touch-screen remote controls may one day be integrated with PDAs.
(Is there anything that the PDA isn't going to merge with?) Each
person could carry around a personalized remote control that could
be updated with software from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the convergence is already starting. People can use
software to transform Palm and Visor PDAs with infrared
transmitters into short-range remote controls. On
Remotecentral.com, a Web site devoted to remote control, users have
posted games, calendar programs and even musical selections for
remote controls.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Harmsen, marketing manager for the Philips Pronto, said,
``There are theme songs for `The Simpsons,' `Indiana Jones' and
`Star Wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   But for all their increasing complexity, these high-end remote
controls cannot avoid the problems that plague their lower-end
brethren. They still break, and they still sink behind couch
cushions. Alpert's new all-in-one remote control broke seven months
ago, so he had to lug his basket of old controls out of storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the innocence is gone,'' he said. ``We know what life is
like if the remote breaks. We know the chaos.'' Alpert's family, he
said, just stopped watching television. ``TV is supposed to be
relaxing,'' he said. ``Just to turn on the TV took five steps. It
was too stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zenith Radio Corp., which became Zenith Electronics, did the
early work in remote controls. Zenith was awarded an Emmy in 1997
for that work. The first television remote control, aptly dubbed
Lazy Bones, was introduced in 1950 and was connected by a wire to
the television set. The original purpose of the remote was to let
viewers mute the sound of television commercials, because the
president of Zenith, Eugene F. McDonald Jr., detested commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the remote control has become a cultural icon, a
bane of television advertisers, a focus of household power
struggles and an enduring symbol of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a remote-controlled world,'' said Dan Williard,
president of Replacement Remotes. ``People are lost without it.''
The most frantic calls to his company come from people who need
replacements sent overnight before ``the big game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, users manipulate their remote controls. But in
reality, remotes often seem to manipulate their users, creating a
kind of behavior that might appear peculiar to the generations that
grew up without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get up from the couch to turn on the TV,'' said Mike
Jaeggi, a recruiter in Atlanta who finds applicants for technology
jobs. ``Instead I'll spend 10 minutes looking for the remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Remotes have not simply propagated _ they have become mobile.
The first wireless remote, which used, in effect, tightly aimed
flashlight beams, was introduced by Zenith in 1955. After remote
controls won their freedom, they exercised it fully. Their
preferred habitat is the small dark environs under couches and
between seat cushions. ``The smallest possible spot they can fit
into, they can get into,'' said Scott Scheider, a software
consultant outside Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Remotes also scurry to other areas of the house, turning up in
refrigerators, under kitchen sinks and in bathrooms. Once Jaeggi's
Sony universal remote was misplaced by his brother. ``We were
looking for over an hour,'' Jaeggi said. ``I kept saying he was
going to owe me a hundred bucks.'' They finally found it in the
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Nabat, president of Ambitious Ideas, a company that makes
a remote control locator called Findit, says that most Americans
lose remote controls at least once a week, then waste time looking
for them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where do runaway remote controls go?
</P>
<P>
   Williard said that dogs and children were common remote-nappers.
People often throw them away accidentally when they are cleaning
up, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes remote controls escape the house altogether. Scheider
was confounded when he found a remote control that did not belong
to him in his living room a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be someone out there looking for the remote,''
Scheider said. He suspects that it might have accidentally dropped
when his sister's family visited, but he has hesitated to ask her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I find out it's not theirs?'' he said. ``What is the
alternative? What if there is someone breaking into my place and
leaving a remote there?''
</P>
<P>
   Remotes and televisions are sometimes forcibly separated from
one another. ``We had our house broken into a few years ago,'' said
Michael Kearl, a sociology professor at Trinity University in San
Antonio. ``They stole the equipment but left the remotes. So in
memory of things that once were, we still have the remotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the remotes are the desired commodity in burglaries,
said Linda Tranchetti, a service representative for Replacement
Remotes. ``When people get robbed,'' she said, ``sometimes they
don't take the TV or stereo, but they take the remote controls. I
don't know why. I've heard that many, many times.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to resort to restraining measures to keep
remote controls from meandering, that seems to undermine the
essence of the technology. ``We all acknowledge the remote's need
to wander and hide under things,'' said Trueman, who replaced his
10 remote controls with a Pronto. ``How awful is it to see a remote
control nailed or screwed into the nightstand of most hotels?''

   EQUAL TIME: We all know that males are more click-happy with the
TV remote. It seems the same is true when it comes to the mouse.
While teen boys and girls use the Internet in equal numbers, the
boys are zipping to far more sites each month, says a Jupiter
Communications / Media Metrix study of 12- to 17-year-olds. The
breakdown:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  301.2 to 271.0: The number of pages viewed per month by a male
teen surfer compared with the girl surfer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  47 to 32: The domains visited by the average boy each month
vs. the average girl.
</P>
<P>
   Their choices in sites pretty much go along the gender fault
line, too:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Similarities: Search, e-mail and instant messaging are the
most popular services for boys and girls. They average five hours a
month online. With adults ages 35-49, the average is 13 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Guy thing: Technology, entertainment, time diversion,
downloads and games are the focus of teen boys. Although said to be
fickle, their top sites: cheatcc.com, cmgsccc.com, gamesages and
other game sites that list ways to cheat through computer games.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Girl thing: Girls appear more goal-oriented. They spend their
Internet time reading periodicals, sending e-greetings and doing
homework. They're more loyal to their known online communities. Top
sites: seventeen.com, alloy.com, delias.com and teenpeople.com.
</P>
<P>
   WONDER WOMEN: Another recent Web trends report showed how
strongly women are embracing the Web. Those stats haven't been
ignored. To help corner ``a huge combined audience of women,''
Lifetime cable network, women.com and mutual partner Hearst
Magazines are aligning to ``capture more than 10 percent of the
entire Web audience.'' Hearst, publisher of Cosmopolitan and Good
Housekeeping, already is a partner in Lifetime (available in 78
million households) and women.com (a top-50 Web site). This move
accelerates ``the convergence of the Internet, television and the
print world,'' says Marleen McDaniel, women.com chairman/chief
executive officer. Watch for co-branding, mutual site links and
other enhancements.

   WWW.MADONNA: Madonna's fight for the domain name madonna.com is
a little more bizarre than first thought. The singer indeed
cherishes it and won't settle for second-best, baby. But then
there's the Catholic-run Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in
Lincoln, Neb., which owns madonna.org and wants the dot-com, too.
Finally, there's Dan Parisi, a New Jersey entrepreneur who owns the
domain and previously used it for pornographic material. He claims
the Material Girl has no more right to it than anyone else with the
same name. And: He offered the name to the hospital last spring. A
decision on ultimate ownership is due from the United Nation's
World Intellectual Property Organization soon.

 &HT;    When it comes to chores, poll shows partners don't see eye to
eye
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The sound of harmony in the Hughes household is a
whining vacuum cleaner _ when David, 29, is pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to vacuum,'' says Rachael, 31, David's wife.
</P>
<P>
   David also helps cook and clean, and he pitches in on the
laundry at their metro Atlanta home. Both Hugheses work full time:
He sells pagers, she sells computer hardware and software. They
agreed to halve the housework when they married four years ago, and
generally they've stuck to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that both of us are equally responsible,'' David
says.
</P>
<P>
   Says Rachael, ``If one person does everything, I think that
person just ends up going insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hugheses are a happy exception, according to the findings of
an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll of 547 married adults in 12
Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the South, husbands are claiming to do more housework
than wives say their husbands are doing. Men took more credit for
cooking, laundry and housework in general than women allowed, the
poll found. In the housework category, for instance, 40 percent of
men said they either do it themselves or are an equal partner in
the housework. Meanwhile, just 23 percent of women said men do it
all or equally.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jhung, author of ``How to Avoid Housework,'' isn't
surprised. ``I think housework is like sex in that people lie about
it a lot,'' she says. ``Everybody claims they're doing more'' than
they are.
</P>
<P>
   What percentage of the housework should working husbands and
wives do to keep harmony? Chloe Bird, formerly of Brown University
and now a behavioral scientist at the think tank Rand, led a team
of researchers last year that asked 1,256 men and women what share
of the housework they did _ then correlated it with their reported
psychological well-being and stress. The conclusion: Each spouse
should do 45.8 percent of the housework.
</P>
<P>
   Who does the rest, the remaining 8.4 percent? The children and
hired help, Bird says, or maybe it just doesn't get done.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of domestic bliss, however, Bird cautions couples
against ``bean counting.'' ``If everybody's trying to make sure
they don't do more than half, this isn't going to work very well,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   AJC poll respondent Johnny Depew, 50, considers himself an equal
partner. He's a carpenter and musician who lives in Gainesville,
Ga., and has been married 33 years. His wife, a nurse, does most of
the laundry, he says, while he does most of the yard work.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, ladies, just as you say men overstate their
housework contributions, you claim to do more yard work than men
say you do, according to the AJC poll.)
</P>
<P>
   Depew can't name a household chore he won't do. ``Everything has
to be done, and I don't not do any of it,'' he says. ``It's
probably why I've been married a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some evidence that things may gradually become more
equal. Overall, women say they cook more than their mates do. But
women and men younger than 30 are more likely to say ``both
equally'' prepare meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a single-parent household,'' says poll respondent
John Bray, 32, a customer service agent for Delta Air Lines. ``I
learned early how to cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Says his wife, Cassandra, 31, who writes training material for
Delta: ``In my house, my mother did all the cooking. My father
viewed it as being a woman's job. I knew when I married somebody I
didn't want it to be that way, and I didn't start out our marriage
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jhung approves. ``I think if more men get involved, they'll find
their love life improving,'' she says. ``Maybe they need to put a
little Pledge behind their ears instead of slapping on the
aftershave.''
</P>
<P>
   She also advises that some women need to lighten up. ``Women in
general are just more caught up in details, and we certainly read
more decorating magazines (where) you never see the Sunday paper
strewn about the living room, or the laundry overflowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Poll respondent Jeanne Revis, 67, of Mountain Home, N.C., admits
she can't let go of making the beds just so, or of doing the
laundry. ``That's no-man's land, the laundry,'' she says. ``There
are probably those out there who could do an adequate job, but I've
yet to see it.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: LESS ILLNESS AND INJURY IN WORKPLACE AIDS ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN B. KRUEGER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With little fanfare, the workplace has become a much safer place
to be. Since 1992, the number of work-related injuries and
illnesses has fallen 25 percent, from 8.9 to 6.7 per 100 full-time
workers. This unexpected improvement translates to at least a $125
billion annual lift for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in injuries is remarkable because it reverses a
historical pattern discovered by Robert S. Smith of Cornell in
1972: injuries usually rise when unemployment falls because work
intensity increases and many inexperienced workers are hired. Yet
the tightest labor market in a generation has coincided with the
lowest work-related injury and illness rate since the Bureau of
Labor Statistics started tracking it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the latest year with available data, there were 5.9
million cases of work-related injuries and illnesses _ mostly
injuries _ in the private sector. If the pre-1992 cyclical pattern
had held, one would have expected three million more.
</P>
<P>
   For more serious injuries and illnesses _ those requiring time
away from work _ there were 2.8 million cases in 1998, about a
million fewer than expected from the past relationship with the
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when researchers looked across states in the
1990s, an inverse relationship between unemployment and work
injuries was discernible. In all likelihood, strong economic times
still impair workplace safety, only this effect was masked by an
even stronger nationwide downward trend in injuries in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   All major types of injuries have declined. Since 1992,
missed-workday cases are down 36 percent for sprains and strains,
31 percent for broken bones and 30 percent for carpal tunnel
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The decline does not appear to be a mere reporting phenomenon.
Although audit studies have found that employers tend to
underreport injuries about 10 percent, the underreporting appears
constant over time. Also, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Census of
Fatal Occupational Injuries _ which are unlikely to be
underreported _ indicates a 13 percent drop in the fatality rate
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the trend toward fewer work injuries remains
something of a mystery. So far, it has been easier to rule out
potential explanations than to find a smoking gun (or should that
be safety lock?) that is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The decline does not result from shifts in employment toward
jobs in safer industries. Instead, injuries and illnesses fell in
most industries _ 22 percent in manufacturing, 33 percent in
construction and 27 percent in services.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have attributed the decline to the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration's shift in emphasis from safety
inspections to compliance assistance in the mid-1990s. But the
decline began before the new OSHA policy was in place. Also, the
drop-off is slightly greater in the states that administer their
own OSHA programs, which suggests that federal OSHA policy was not
the key.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Professor Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the
University of Texas at Austin, show that when workers become
wealthier, they are quite willing to forgo some extra pay in
exchange for safer working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rising income probably explains the long-term decline in
accidents both at work and away from work. Concerning the recent
decline in work injuries, however, Hamermesh said: ``Why all of
sudden? Why the effect should suddenly be so large, since there was
some rise in real earnings before 1992, is the hard part to
explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation involves the costs of workers' compensation
insurance, which swelled in the 1970s and 1980s as states raised
benefits and medical costs soared.
</P>
<P>
   In response to escalating costs, some states tightened
eligibility standards for benefits and restricted employees' choice
of medical providers in the 1990s. But a new study by Leslie Boden
of Boston University and John Ruser of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics suggests that only a small share of the decline in
injuries and illnesses can be traced to these factors.
</P>
<P>
   Probably a more important effect of ballooning workers'
compensation insurance costs is that many managers recognized that
occupational injuries had a significant effect on the bottom line.
Instead of viewing injury costs as unavoidable, they developed
safety programs to cut risks. The 1990s investment boom in new, and
safer, plant and equipment probably abetted this effort.
</P>
<P>
   Injury rates have also fallen sharply in Canada and Britain. So
changes in work practices and technology that cut across borders
and industries, perhaps in response to higher injury costs,
apparently reduced workplace hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for lower injuries, the economic
implications are sizable.
</P>
<P>
   Econometric studies suggest that workers are willing to forgo at
least $33,000 in earnings to take a job that entails no risk of
injury as compared with one that carries a certain risk. Thus, the
3 million fewer injuries and illnesses than expected in 1998 are
implicitly valued by workers at around $100 billion _ a sum not
counted in the gross national product. This amounts to $1,000 per
private-sector worker.
</P>
<P>
   Another economic benefit is that employers save on workers'
compensation costs. Adjusted for inflation, these costs, per
covered employee, fell by a third from 1992 to 1998. The aggregate
savings in 1998 was $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in injuries also raises the supply of labor available
for work. Although most injuries are of short duration, a study of
cases arising in Michigan in 1986 suggests that when an injury or
illness results in lost work time, the average duration of missed
work is four to eight months. So the one million shortfall in
lost-workday cases in 1998 could eventually expand the labor force
by the equivalent of 333,000 to 667,000 workers employed full time
for a year. Consequently, there may be some relief for labor
shortages in sight.
</P>
<P>
   When he worked as a claims adjuster for the Bohemian Workers'
Accident Insurance Institute, Kafka decried jobs in which ``danger
defied all caution.'' Although many jobs still entail grave
dangers, occupational injuries are now viewed as controllable
thanks to technological progress and economic incentives.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally in this election year, the politicians
found something they can agree on: the entertainment industry
should be taken to task for marketing violent movies, music and
video games to children.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic candidate
for vice president, went before the Senate Commerce Committee on
Wednesday and said, ``This practice is outrageous, it is deceptive
and it has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour or so later, Lynne Cheney, whose husband, Dick, is the
Republican vice-presidential candidate, said the problem was even
worse than the marketing practices. ``There is a problem with the
product they market,'' she said, ``no matter how they market it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
weighed in: ``While I do not begrudge anyone's honest profits, I do
not think they need to come at the expense of our children's
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   But the presidential campaign was not far in the background.
Lieberman, for example, mentioned Vice President Al Gore several
times. If he and Gore are elected, he said, they intend to take
government action against the entertainment companies if they
persist in their marketing practices with children.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheney, the former chairwoman of the National Endowment for
the Humanities, noted pointedly that Gore and Lieberman planned to
attend a fund-raiser this week thrown by Harvey Weinstein,
co-chairman of Miramax, the movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   That led McCain to remark that the film industry had made $18
million in campaign contributions so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing on Wednesday was called to examine the report
released Monday by the Federal Trade Commission, which found that
the vast majority of adult-rated movies, recordings and electronic
games were marketed to underage customers.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein and a dozen other movie executives refused to appear,
outraging McCain. ``Their hubris is stunning and serves to
underscore the lack of corporate responsibility so striking in this
report,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief lobbyist for the movie studios, Jack Valenti, did
testify. He said the movie executives had declined to come to
Washington ``not because they were ducking and running but because
they have other things on their schedules they could not erase.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain demanded that they come to a second hearing in two weeks,
and without making a specific commitment, Valenti suggested they
would comply.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti, who has been a prominent lobbyist for more than 30
years and who was a special assistant to President Lyndon B.
Johnson before that, is so comfortable at the witness table and so
familiar to the senators on the committee that their exchanges
seemed perfunctory, as if each side was making moves in a board
game.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti conceded that ``some marketing people'' seemed to have
``stepped over the line.'' He said there was no excuse, for
instance, in testing violent movies on focus groups of 10- and
12-year-olds, a practice the Federal Trade Commission cited, and
added: ``I can guarantee you that's not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   On balance, Valenti said, the Congress ``should feel an immense
pride in this unique American creative asset and the daily
contributions of the movie and television industry to this nation's
art and commerce and the endurance of its responsibility to
American parents.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the falling crime rate in recent years and said
that was good proof violent films did not cause crime.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who has been
in Washington since 1967, almost as long as Valenti. Rolling his
eyes, Hollings declared: ``To come here and have the unmitigated
gall to take credit for lowering the crime rate _ whoo-hee!''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheney said the problem with popular culture was not merely
the marketing to children but the actual content of the movies and
music. The solution, she said, was not government regulation, which
would breach the First Amendment, but community pressure on the
entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   To make her case, she handed out to the committee members the
lyrics from ``Kill You,'' a song by Eminem, the rap and hip-hop
artist, filled with vulgarities, blood and rape. One line goes:
``Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheney said: ``It is despicable. It is horrible. This is
dreadful. This is shameful. This is awful.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had written to female board members of Seagram Co.,
the parent company of Universal Music Group, which made the CD of
the song, and urged them to stop the distribution of such songs.
</P>
<P>
   Long after Mrs. Cheney had left the hearing, Danny Goldberg,
president of Artemis Records, became the first person of the day to
defend popular culture. ``Millions of people like it,'' Goldberg
said. ``In a free society, what do you do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg suggested that one of the reasons young people were
disaffected with politics was that ``politicians and academics who
obviously have no real understanding of their culture make sweeping
generalizations about their entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not represented here today,'' Goldberg said. ``There
are no music fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Goldberg could not resist drawing the presidential campaign
into his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are many Americans who are offended by curse
words and don't want children exposed to them,'' he said.
``However, those people have no moral or legal right to impose such
a standard on my family or on the millions of other Americans who,
like George W. Bush, are comfortable with cursing.''

COMMENTARY: DANGER FROM WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were no safeguards. Although the facts were
clear, no one in the criminal justice system was willing to blow
the whistle on the unscrupulous prosecution of an honest cop named
Zaher Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking officials in the Police Department, the Brooklyn
district attorney's office and the office of the U.S. attorney for
the Eastern District ignored the overwhelming evidence that Zahrey
was innocent. Some exculpatory evidence was deliberately concealed.
And cops and prosecutors aggressively sought out and promoted the
outrageous lies of a violent predator named Sidney Quick, promising
him leniency and providing him with all sorts of favors, including
a conjugal visit in prison, in return for his perjured testimony
against Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were even willing to close their eyes to Quick's
apparent involvement in a murder, as long as he was willing to
testify against Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   The question I'm asked most frequently about the Zahrey case is
why the Police Department was so anxious to nail this guy. I don't
know. Did some higher-up dislike him? Was there pressure to crack
down on some cop _ any cop _ in the aftermath of the Mollen
commission report? Rumors had circulated among cops about Zahrey's
possible involvement in criminal activity, but as far as I can tell
the source of those rumors was never determined. What is known is
that the cops out to get Zahrey, whose nickname was Zack, managed
to find a crank, a discredited former police informant, to parrot
the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The crank's name was Carlos Torres. Torres was a drunk who was
known to be utterly unreliable. His own daughter told police he was
delusional, that he honestly believed he worked for the FBI and the
CIA. Torres had once been arrested when he showed up at a police
officer's funeral with a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in the truth would have turned away from this
pathetic individual. But Robert Boyce, then a sergeant in internal
affairs, used Torres' nutty stories to help launch the official
investigation of Zahrey.
</P>
<P>
   Two things ultimately saved Zahrey _ the fine work of a fiercely
dedicated lawyer named Joel Rudin, and the intelligence and common
sense of a jury that could not be swayed by the government's
deceit.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to those who are falsely targeted by police and
prosecutors and who don't have a Joel Rudin to fight for them?
</P>
<P>
   Rudin showed beyond any question that the case against Zahrey
had been crudely and deliberately manufactured. Every alarm bell in
the criminal justice system should have been clanging the very
first time anyone heard the tape of Boyce telling Quick, during an
interview in Sing Sing Prison: ``If you give me Zack, I'll drive
you home.''
</P>
<P>
   But what we found out, thanks to Rudin, is that prosecutors in
the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, were
concerned not with the outlandishness of the offer, but with the
fact that Boyce had been so careless as to tape it.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Theresa Corrigan was asked about the
propriety of the Sing Sing tape, in which Boyce told Quick he could
have a ``sweet deal'' if he could implicate Zahrey in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Under oath, Corrigan said: ``There wasn't a discussion about
proper. I know at some point there was statements about there was
nothing wrong with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were discussions in Hynes' office about why Boyce and
a partner, Michael McWilliams, taped so much of their encounter
with Quick. Prosecutors made it clear they would have been happier
if only the comments damaging to Zahrey had been taped. And for a
while the tape was conveniently ``lost'' by the DA's office, and
would have remained buried except for the fact that Quick himself
blurted out to federal authorities that he had been taped at Sing
Sing.
</P>
<P>
   What is most frightening about this case is that it is not all
that unusual. The use of false testimony from criminal lowlifes to
manufacture cases against innocent defendants is far more
widespread than most Americans realize. The unusual aspects of this
case were the existence of the damning Sing Sing tape, and the fact
that the defendant was a cop.

COMMENTARY: THE SNICKERING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest smirks in politics today are on the faces of
participants in the rhetoric of ridicule known as ``the snickering
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridicule focused on minor characteristics is nothing new; we
taunted Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter about their regional
accents, and made one of our most athletic and physically
coordinated presidents, Gerald Ford, into an incredible klutz.
Until recently Al Gore was the butt of jokes about his wooden
demeanor and forlorn use of earth tones to achieve
alpha-masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Now a withering fusillade of sneers is being fired at the
campaign of George W. Bush. It began with a question that few could
answer about the names of foreign potentates; his embarrassment at
thus being mousetrapped incurred the hooting of pundits who keep
those names on crib sheets.
</P>
<P>
   He stumbles over words unfamiliar to him: In the manipulated
hooh-hah about the flash of the last four letters of
``bureaucrats'' on a TV spot, Bush's rejection of ``subliminal''
ads came out ``subliminable.'' This brought catcalls from
commentators who would praise their own dogged efforts as
indefatigable if they could pronounce it.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulated hooh-hah? The ``rats'' frame, for a thirtieth of a
second, was first noted publicly with amusement by Tony Snow, a
former speechwriter for President Bush, on a Fox TV program on Aug.
28. Nobody noticed (proof again that if an event is not reported in
The New York Times, it hasn't happened).
</P>
<P>
   But Snickery Central in Nashville noticed, and the Gore campaign
held the precious information for two weeks to be recycled for
maximum effect after Labor Day. It was then passed to The New York
Times, which dutifully noted the Gore source and gave the story
front-page treatment, which led to this week's media frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, primed well in advance, expressed profound
``disappointment'' at this Orwellian mass hypnosis. Joe Lieberman
bowed his head, presumably in prayer for the Republic in its moment
of peril.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this hyped hysteria drive the reading on the Richter
Snickery scale toward 10, its highest level? Because the TV
spotmaker's miscue gained resonance from a previous
snicker-generator: The locker-room derogation of a colleague of
mine by Bush, unaware of a nearby live microphone. (People forgive
politicians for using such language in private about journalists;
more damaging was Thomas Dewey's ``idiot engineer.'')
</P>
<P>
   Snickery Central made the most of it. For days after Bush's
foolish scatological reference (thankfully not a career-ending
ethnic slur), Gore spokesmen slyly repeated the phrase's compound
adjectival component, ``major-league,'' which succeeded in causing
mild after-snickers. Listen for Gore in debate using
``major-league'' rather than ``world-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the room of politics been filled with gaffe gas,
awaiting a blooper's spark to ignite an explosion of derision that
echoes endlessly through the media. Bush even endured a pop from
the mythical DAM (Mothers Against Dyslexia).
</P>
<P>
   Democratic partisans equate Bush's occasional verbal stumbles
with Gore's too-careful verbal legalisms, like ``community
outreach'' to conceal illegal fund raising, and his Clintonesque
obfuscations like ``no controlling legal authority.'' That ignores
motive: Better an honest bumble or dopey crack than a practiced
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   But the snickermongers now encouraging the bashing of Bush have
to worry about another swing of the pendulum. A need for the
appearance of fair play may soon induce some current Bush-bashers
to turn elitist smirks on Gore or even Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, we can hope that the symbiotic spinmeister-media
snickering campaign, demeaning to voters and candidates, will be
condemned as ``negative.'' Then the silly sniping will give way to
the worthier business of assessing Bush's grasp of foreign affairs
and the teachers' and trial lawyers' grasp of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of ridicule has its traditional place; don't knock
the mock. But September has seen the shadowboxing on debates
(Bush's fault), the primacy of piety (Gore's fault), the play of
contradictory poll guesswork as news (the media's fault), sustained
inattention (the public's fault), and the failure to sneer snappily
at the snickering campaign (my fault). Eight weeks to a fateful
decision; let's all shape up.

`SURVIVOR' SKILLS PAY OFF IN WORKPLACE

   The hit show ``Survivor'' is old news by now _ except, perhaps,
to me. I never watched it. But I've read the postmortems with
morbid fascination.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, I've read about Richard, the $1 million winner
who survived the island head games better than 15 other
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Articles describe Richard as (BEGIN ITALICS)evil, manipulative,
conniving, Machiavellian, smug, domineering, derisive, imperious
and Rasputinlike(END ITALICS), to reprint only the printable ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellation that puts Richard in a workplace column is
(BEGIN ITALICS)corporate trainer(END ITALICS). Before Richard
became famous for being naked and forming secret alliances, he
trained employees.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a juicy coconut to milk.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate trainers, as most any corporate employee knows, are
hired to help improve morale, build teamwork, relieve stress and
teach leadership skills. Cynics are known to brand corporate
trainers as water-bearers for the management fad of the month club.
That may be true.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unfair to leave it at that. I've sat through
many corporate training sessions, both in-house as an employee and
as research for my workplace and careers beat.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, I've heard much wise counsel about workplace
politics, co-worker relationships, career satisfaction and job
improvement. So I don't want every workplace trainer I've ever met
to take offense.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about Richard. And the training session I would most
like to hear him present is the one on ``building alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard understood the power of alliances and used them to his
benefit better than anyone else on the island. And that, fellow
workers, is a template for the career path of many highly
successful business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The altruistic, the capable, the personable were voted off the
island, victims of the Richard-made alliance that stood strong to
the end. The workplace parallel hardly needs explanation:
</P>
<P>
   Individual talent and nice people are prized in the workplace
but rarely get anywhere without successful, strategic alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a mentor-protege relationship, a strong team,
star-struck employees who will follow you anywhere, mutual respect
from co-workers who go way back, or a pure ``scratch my back, I'll
scratch yours'' pact, some kind of alliance is essential to advance
in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, television viewers and fellow contestants hated
Richard. But he won the vote because of grudging admiration. The
others rewarded his ability to figure out the game and play it
better than anyone else, partly by fashioning the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Look back at the italicized words describing Richard. Do
employees want to work for someone described that way?
</P>
<P>
   Most workers would say of course not. But the fact is many do
work for Richardesque leaders. And if they don't, there's probably
a wannabe waiting in the wings, plotting entrance on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Cynical? Yes. Real world? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean workers need to claw each other for the
spotlight. Not everyone wants it. But everyone should be very, very
aware of the alliances made to get there.

HIGH PRICES, LONG LINES, AND PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SHAW AND BILL BRINK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Jerry Patel, a retired coach from Orlando,
Fla., reached Sydney late Tuesday without Olympic tickets. Early
Wednesday he joined the long, last-minute lines for seats to the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are selling at 50,000 a day as Australians, and visitors
like Patel, are rushing to join queues that stretch hundreds of
yards outside downtown agents.
</P>
<P>
   As he faced a three-hour wait on Wattle Street, Patel said he
was willing to pay $900 for good seats for Friday's opening
ceremony. A marshal told him there were only a ``handful'' left _
but there were several hundred potential buyers ahead of Patel.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a customer for seats for volleyball and table tennis
_ both of which he coached in India and the United States _ and
men's field hockey. The spring sunshine was warm _ and the forecast
is fair for the first Games days _ and Patel was unconcerned about
the long wait. ``I'll pay top dollar if I can get what I want,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the line, mostly Australians, complained of delays,
box-office bungles and lack of suburban ticket outlets _ all
criticisms familiar to Sydney's Olympic ticket managers,
battle-scarred by 18 months of marketing problems, including
ill-fated attempts to hide reservations of seats for corporate
customers.
</P>
<P>
   With Games turnstiles about to start clicking, officials point
to the bottom line when customers, or reporters, point to the long
lines. Eighty percent of tickets have been sold, and Sydney is on
track to match or exceed Barcelona s 1992 record of 82 percent.
Through Wednesday, some 5.8 million of the 7,605,065 Olympic
tickets available had been sold, bringing overall ticket sales to
about $400 million (U.S.) so far.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet Crawford, a designer waiting to ask for gymnastics
tickets and willing to pay $240 for a family package, said, ``This
is a last-minute decision _ when I saw the torch on TV and the
Olympic flags in the streets, I got caught up in the emotion of it
all.`
</P>
<P>
   With lines getting longer, and time getting shorter, John
O'Neill, a ticketing spokesman, announced that some selling offices
would stay open 24 hours and express lanes would operate for
collection of pre-paid seats.
</P>
<P>
   Need a Ticket? How About Sailing?
</P>
<P>
   The sport with the highest percentage of tickets sold was
rhythymic gymnastics, according to figures released by the Sydney
organizing committee. Rhythmic gymnastics has sold 99 percent of
the 23,034 tickets available for five sessions at the 6,000-seat
pavilion at Olympic park. The triathlon, which has limited seating,
had sold out 98.48 of the 7,410 tickets available. Also popular in
this country mad about water sports was the swimming, with 98
percent of the nearly 200,000 tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest number of tickets sold? Sailing, only 6,449 of the
21,000-plus available _ just 30 percent. Perhaps that was because
of the price tag _ the seats are on spectator boats in Sydney
Harbor _ with full-day packages ranging from $112 to $167. With the
lower package you get a seafood buffet; with the higher one, a
lunch hamper.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Men Gymnasts Seek to Upstage Women
</P>
<P>
   With his flamboyant gymnastics routine and attention-getting
tattoos, Blaine Wilson would be a difficult athlete to overshadow.
But Wilson and the other members of the U.S. men's team rank second
to their female counterparts in popularity, as well as Olympic
success, and Wilson wants that to change, beginning Saturday when
preliminary competition starts in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we're proud of the girl's program,'' he said, ``but I
consider men's and women's gymnastics to be totally separate
sports. I don't do four events, I do six events. We're proud of
what they did in 1996, but we're out there doing our own thing this
year, and we're not going to be overshadowed by the women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people that want to talk about men's
gymnastics as compared to women's, but as I said before, would you
want to watch three hours on beam, or three hours crashing on high
bar. I'd rather watch high bar, personally. High bar's more
exciting. I think men's gymnastics is just a little bit more
exciting. But that's my opinion. And it will be up to the people at
home watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Bus Bungles
</P>
<P>
   First it was Sydney's trains that troubled Olympic organizers,
but now with the railroad mostly running on time it's the city's
buses that make officials anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear the size of the task has been underestimated, we
need more drivers,'' conceded Olympics Minister Michael Knight, a
man not noted for apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The bus bungles, which involve rosters, routes and supply of
drivers and vehicles, are politically sensitive because they are
mostly affecting the passengers who can complain loudest _
international officials, foreign media and Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Bus managers are not yet coping well with special Olympic
demands and fleet expansion from 2,500 vehicles to 3,800. The 750
new drivers, new routes and changing schedules are causing delays
and no-shows on Olympic shuttles. These new services link the
athletes and media villages to training venues and press centers,
and ferry Games officials, national delegates and team coaches
between hotels, meetings and arenas.
</P>
<P>
   This week rookie drivers were blamed for leaving International
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch waiting on a
sidewalk, arriving three hours late to collect a group of
Aboriginal women artists, delaying the Australian shooting squad
two hours and causing the Australian water polo team to miss a
training session.
</P>
<P>
   Australian and IOC officials define the bus bungles as the usual
pre-Games ``teething problems.''

Redskins have potential for QB controversy
<TEXT>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. _ Depending how the fickle winds of public opinion
are blowing, he is one of the most popular or most despised men in
the nation's capital. His every decision is analyzed, his private
life is not really private, and he faces an almost daily referendum
on his fitness for the job.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the president, the quarterback of the Washington
Redskins doesn't have Secret Service protection or a guaranteed
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   As the Redskins (1-1) began preparing for Monday night's game
with the Dallas Cowboys (0-2) at FedEx Field, Washington began a
balloting of another kind after Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson
threw four interceptions in a 15-10 loss at Detroit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that at least two of the interceptions weren't his
fault. Never mind that Michael Westbrook, his best wideout,
suffered a season-ending knee injury in the third quarter. Never
mind that Johnson is coming off a terrific 1999 season, having led
the Redskins to their first playoff appearance in six years and
earning himself an invitation to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that Johnson is a fellow of uncommon decency and
humility, one universally respected by both his teammates and
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   With the hated Cowboys coming to town, Johnson's job seemed up
for grabs. In the offseason, Redskins owner Daniel Snyder signed
free agent Jeff George to a four-year, $18.5 million contract. Now,
after a close defeat and four Johnson interceptions, the debate has
begun. The Washington Post posted a pick-the-quarterback ballot on
its Web site. The city's all-sports radio station became an open
forum on the Johnson-George debate. Some wondered when the ``Honk
if you love Jeff'' bumper stickers would be next.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its sophistication and feelings of self-importance,
Washington has for years taken the Redskins as seriously as Green
Bay or Dallas follows its NFL team. And no position on the team is
more scrutinized than quarterback. Many a family dinner has been
disrupted over the years as fathers and sons and husbands and wives
debated the merits of Redskins quarterbacks, probably beginning
with Sonny Jurgensen and Billy Kilmer's friendly competition in the
1970s. Later it would be Joe Theismann-Jurgensen, Doug Williams-Jay
Schroeder, Mark Rypien-Stan Humphries, Heath Shuler-Gus Frerotte
and Frerotte-Jeff Hostetler.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Brad Johnson and Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's going to be with a high-profile position
like quarterback,'' Redskins coach Norv Turner said in an interview
at Redskin Park. ``It's not an issue inside this building. Brad is
our quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner knows the Redskins brought this debate on themselves.
George's signing was the brainchild of Snyder, the 35-year-old
telemarketing executive who plunked down $800 million to buy the
franchise from the estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke 18 months
ago. Snyder had owned the franchise for about 10 minutes when he
announced he would like to win a Super Bowl very quickly _ like
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He fired most of the front-office staff members after promising
to keep them. He became heavily involved in player personnel,
called a team meeting or two, and pretty much told Turner a playoff
appearance would be required for his continued employment.
</P>
<P>
   Turner caught a break. Just before Charley Casserly was
dismissed as general manager _ he is now GM of the Houston Texans _
he acquired Johnson from the Minnesota Vikings. For the first time
in six seasons in Washington, Turner had a bona fide quarterback,
and he rode Johnson's 24 touchdown passes to last year's NFC East
championship and a first-round playoff victory over Detroit. The
Redskins were eliminated by Tampa Bay in the second round, and
Snyder promptly announced this would be a Super Bowl-or-bust
season.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Snyder shelled out around $60 million in
signing bonuses to lure a who's who of free agents to Washington,
including Bruce Smith, Deion Sanders and Mark Carrier. Snyder also
signed George, almost guaranteeing there would be a quarterback
controversy. George was the NFL's third-rated passer last season.
Johnson was rated fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, George hasn't exactly been regarded as a good
citizen during his 11 NFL seasons. The Redskins are his fifth team,
and although no one questions he has one of the league's best arms,
he has not always been viewed as a harmonious presence in the
locker room. ``Coach killer'' is the term one former teammate used
to describe George.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder might have relieved the problem a bit if he had extended
Johnson's contract. Instead, he allowed his Pro Bowl starter to
begin the year unsigned beyond this season _ a move tantamount to
daring him to have another good season. Some in the organization
speculated Snyder wanted George to play because Johnson was a
Casserly acquisition, and if the Redskins won the Super Bowl,
Casserly would have to get a chunk of the credit (he acquired most
of the rest of the team as well).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Snyder) invested so much in this team doing well that
he wanted to have someone if something happened to me,'' he said.
``Jeff was out there, and they went out and got the best
quarterback they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Turner, who argued against the move, knows it could turn
out to be a smart decision if Johnson gets hurt. He points out that
history is against Johnson's starting every game for a second
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time since 1996 Johnson made it through
an entire season without an injury. It is not just Johnson, either.
Two years ago, only five of the league's 31 starting quarterbacks
went the entire season without missing a game because of an injury.
Last season, only eight of the 31 starters went the distance.
</P>
<P>
   So if Johnson gets hurt, the Redskins have more than a backup.
They have the league's best backup.
</P>
<P>
   George stepped in for the injured Randall Cunningham last season
in Minnesota and went 9-3 as a starter, throwing for 23 touchdowns
and 2,816 yards. Despite his past problems, he still has managed to
compile an array of impressive numbers in his career _ 147
touchdown passes, 26,000 yards and 15 300-yard passing games.
</P>
<P>
   What he never has done is be part of a Super Bowl team, and even
though he has started 120 of his 126 career games, he said
Washington simply was too good an opportunity to pass up. He also
has gone out of his way not to make trouble, saying the best
situation is if he never plays a down this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to win championships. That's the only reason I
came,'' he said, calling the decision to sign with the Redskins ``a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   George once was viewed as the league's next great quarterback.
The Colts made him the No. 1 choice of the 1990 draft and hoped to
build a champion behind him. After four seasons of losing games and
enduring his tantrums, the Colts traded him to Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was three games into his career with the Falcons when he got
into a sideline shouting match with coach June Jones. He was
suspended for four games and then released. He played two
relatively calm seasons in Oakland before joining the Vikings to be
Cunningham's backup.
</P>
<P>
   When Cunningham got hurt in the sixth game of last season,
George stepped in and led the Vikings to the playoffs. He threw
three touchdown passes in a playoff victory over the Cowboys and
four more in a loss to the St. Louis Rams. Still, after the season,
Vikings coach Dennis Green let George go and gave the starting job
to Daunte Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   These days, George seems calmer, more thoughtful and certainly
less inclined to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a young age, I made some mistakes,'' he said. ``Obviously,
I went through things at an early age not a lot of people went
through. (But) I just turned 32. I'm a husband now, a dad. I'd like
to think that the best years are still ahead of me. Steve Young won
his first Super Bowl when he was 33. I feel young; my body feels
good; my arm feels great. Hopefully, I have another six, seven
years ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson laughs off suggestions that he has been bothered by
George's presence or his unsettled contract situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at my history,'' Johnson said with a chuckle. ``I've been
with Rich Gannon, Warren Moon, Jim McMahon, Randall Cunningham,
Andre Ware, Charlie Ward you name it, I've had someone who'd either
won a Super Bowl or a Heisman or was going to the Hall of Fame.
There's always going to be someone else. I've been through all of
that.''

<P>
   Turner, the man charged with orchestrating the show, emphasizes
that Johnson is the guy he is counting on to get the Redskins back
into the playoffs. But Johnson has stirred the controversy by not
playing particularly well in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Both Carolina and Detroit played soft pass defense to prevent
the Redskins from hitting the big plays that characterized last
season, when they scored 443 points, the third-highest total in
franchise history. As a result, Johnson has forced some throws into
coverage. His 67.8 quarterback rating is 25 percent below last
season's 90.0 rating, and he is ranked 24th among all NFL passers.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner said he remains convinced he can keep the swirling
waters of a quarterback debate away from Redskin Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``After visiting with Jeff before he signed with us, I found out
he's a very mature guy, very professional,'' Turner said. ``He's
been a great help to Brad and a plus in our locker room. But Brad
is our quarterback. All you have to do is go back and look at our
games a year ago and see what he did for this football team. He's
going to have more big games this year. I can say that a hundred
times, and some people are still going to ask when Jeff is going to
play. But I learned a long time ago you can't do anything about
what perceptions might be.''

   Note to anyone running into director Robert Zemeckis in the next
couple of &QL;
</P>
<P>
   months: Don't ask him about ``Survivor.'' He's a little touchy
about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you would be, too, if you had spent two years of your life
on a movie project called ``Cast Away,'' a realistic drama about a
workaholic (Tom Hanks) who winds up marooned on a desert island and
must cope with problems that go beyond the trifling troubles that
Rich and Rudy and the other ``Survivor'' contestants faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is about one man's spiritual and psychological
journey,'' Zemeckis says. ``There are no tiki torches here, no
radios made from coconut shells.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis shut down production of the film for nearly a year so
Hanks could lost weight and add a beard. In the interim, Zemeckis
and the ``Cast Away'' crew made ``What Lies Beneath,'' a decision
that the director calls an ``exaggerated Roger Corman thing, making
two movies for the price of one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was damn hard,'' Zemeckis says.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks had difficulties of his own losing 50 pounds after beefing
up to play a prison guard in ``The Green Mile.'' (``In all honesty,
I was as big as a house there for a while,'' Hanks says.) But worse
than the diet, worse than the bushy beard (``It horrifies people,''
Hanks says, ``and everybody hates it, including me'') was acting in
so many scenes by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard and pretty lonely sometimes,'' Hanks says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing,'' he adds, laughing, ``is that you don't have
to memorize so many lines because you're not talking to anybody.

MERGERS OF MALAYSIAN BANKS APPEAR TO BE BACKFIRING

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Efforts by Malaysia to strengthen its banking system
by forcing its 54 financial institutions to merge into just 10
appear to be backfiring, as concerns about government interference
revive doubt about the industry's health and the risks of investing
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The banks had until Aug. 31 _ Malaysia's independence day _ to
complete their plans and gain tax incentives for doing so. They all
made it, but the deadline was followed by a drop in Malaysian
stocks, reflecting investor doubts about whether the hasty unions
represented workable matches.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of concern about the bank mergers was a deal
between two of them, reached the day of the deadline, that
undervalues the larger bank and overvalues the smaller one, which
also happens to be connected to one of the country's top
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the concern over the mergers also reflects further
exasperation among investors. Malaysia, some complain, seems to
prefer back-room economic deal making over a more open and
accountable system that enables banks and companies to find their
own solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big doubts in investors' minds as to whether
restructuring is driven by business sense or more by political
interest,'' said Cher Hung Jin, a fund manager at Daiwa Securities
in Singapore. Many investors wonder, he said, ``whether management
has a free hand to do what's good for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   With stocks available for purchase from Wall Street to Shanghai,
``you have to offer things like transparency, earnings growth and
corporate governance,'' said Chong Yoon Chou, an investment
director at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. ``In Malaysia's
case, they've lagged behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors have felt frustrated with Malaysia _ and vice
versa _ since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. The country's
prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has blamed foreign speculators
for the crisis, pointing to their withdrawal of capital. In turn,
foreign investors blame him for turning the country into a global
pariah of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for much of this year, Malaysia has been globalization's
gadfly. Despite refusing to let capital flow freely and vilifying
speculators, the country's economy grew, foreigners plowed money
in, and its stock market rose while a number of other markets in
Southeast Asia tumbled. Mahathir gained a following as an opponent
of Western free-market proselytizing, and the country has pushed
ahead with its own brand of financial reform, rejecting the
prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But then in June, foreign investors began voting with their
feet. According to government statistics, they have withdrawn
roughly 4.4 billion ringgit, or $1.16 billion, from Malaysia in the
last three months.
</P>
<P>
   The economy appears to be doing fine. Exports and domestic
demand, combined with government spending and low interest rates,
are fueling economic growth that J.P. Morgan predicts will reach 10
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the withdrawals is the fear that foreign investors
have of government policy changes that come without warning and
sometimes with disregard for investors' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perceived unfriendliness toward foreign investors is
stopping investments to Malaysia,'' said Chew Ping, an analyst at
Standard &AMP; Poor's in Singapore.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The story of Malaysia's bank merger plan is a case in point.
Cautious lending and stronger government oversight helped insulate
Malaysian banks from some of the weakness suffered by banks in
Indonesia and Thailand. Mahathir has in fact criticized Malaysian
banks as too prudent, depriving enterprises of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most financial executives agree that there are too many
banks and that the government's plans to deregulate the industry
means that some of those banks must be merged with others. But in
July 1999, the central bank decreed that there be only six banks in
the country within eight weeks and told each bank who would be
taking over whom.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers were stunned. Smaller institutions in some cases were to
take over larger banks and weaker banks to take over stronger ones.
The shotgun engagements also threatened to reduce the financial
power of the country's economically dominant ethnic Chinese in
favor of its numerically dominant Malays.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, there was an abrupt policy reversal. The
government capitulated to private lobbying by bankers and agreed to
let them find their own partners. This past February, the bankers
won approval to merge into 10 institutions by the end of this year.
A package of tax incentives was later thrown in for those who made
their merger plans final by the end of July. Progress toward
meeting the deadline was delayed by a group that fund managers say
is often ignored in Malaysia: Shareholders. But they were not just
any shareholders. Plans for the country's largest financial
institution, Malayan Banking, to take over a smaller one, Phileo
Allied Bank, stalled when a minority shareholder controlled by
Mahathir's son balked at the sale price. Such disputes led the
central bank to extend its deadline by a month, to the end of
August.

<P>
   Val Kilmer has played many legendary heroes: Batman, The Saint,
Doc Holliday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he seems particularly pleased by his latest good guy, whom
he humbly refers to as The Space Janitor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Red Planet,'' an ecologically-themed, colonization-of-Mars
adventure set a few decades in the future, Kilmer is part of a
terraforming expedition to our celestial neighbor that runs into
all kinds of trouble, man-made and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very selfless character who's in charge of the
maintenance of the ship,'' the actor explains. ``He's not on the
science team or the military side of it. He's a reluctant hero;
Harrison Ford would've enjoyed it a while ago. It's a great part,
though, and the whole style of the film is a fantastic balance
between subtle, small moments and large, epic-size adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Which required epic-size locations. When a planned shoot in
Iceland didn't pan out, the production moved to blazing deserts in
Jordan and Australia. Outside temperatures reached well into three
digits and some cast members' space suit ventilation systems
malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   But for Kilmer, who spent childhood summers in Chatsworth and
currently resides in New Mexico, the heat was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I revelled in it,'' he admits. ``Whenever a Warner
Bros. executive who I knew from the `Batman' days would call the
set, he'd say `I bet you're the only one who's loving it out
there!' And it made an incredible difference that we were in such
rough terrain; it really gave us and the film the feeling that we
were on Mars.'' (Nov. 3) &QL;

<P>
   The last time out, writer-director Don Roos impressed the heck
out of &QL;
</P>
<P>
   everybody with his witty, acidulous reworking of romantic comedy
conventions, ``The Opposite of Sex.'' Whether he can pull off a
similar miracle with the dramatic love story ``Bounce'' is the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote `Bounce' literally a month after `The Opposite of Sex'
because I just wanted to do a movie without attitude and irony in
it,'' Roos reveals. ``To me, those elements come so naturally, it's
kind of cheating. It's like saying, `Try to take what's on screen
seriously, but if it doesn't work I'm just kidding.' I wanted to be
really exposed up there. You either believe my story and my
characters and feel something of what they feel, or it doesn't work
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Roos reckons he was greatly aided in the feel-it department by
stars Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow. Playing an emotionally
remote playboy and the young widow whose husband's death he was
inadvertently responsible for, the stars -- former lovers and good
friends themselves -- brought a certain emotional availability to
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked very well, in terms of the performances, that these
people clearly had a history with each other and a chemistry,''
Roos says. ``To watch Ben watching her and to watch Gwyneth
watching him was a real pleasure; there was a connection between
them that, maybe, they were acting, but it really seemed like a
bonus. They had broken up when this movie began, but they were
still very close, talked to each other every day. Whoever they end
up with, they'll be the best of friends, and it was great to see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like that might make a pretty good movie, too. (Oct. 7) &QL;

COALITION CALLS ON CONGRESS TO EASE IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS BEFORE
ADJOURNING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER HOYT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress nearing the end of its session,
immigrant groups and a coalition of businesses are calling for
lawmakers to ease immigration restrictions before adjourning for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The business coalition says the vibrant U.S. economy has created
a demand for unskilled and semi-skilled workers and the United
States must look to foreign labor to help fill job vacancies. The
national unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   The request to ease restrictions differs from legislation to
help overcome a shortage in the coming years of high-tech workers
for the nation's growing technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   To help fill future vacancies, lawmakers are pushing to increase
the number of temporary work visas for highly skilled workers from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But with Congress trying to wrap up and go home by Oct. 6 to
campaign for re-election, chances are considered slim for passage
of any major changes in U.S. immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats blame Republicans for blocking legislation supported
by the immigrants from passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans don't want to deal with this stuff, it's
pretty clear,'' one congressional aide said. ``Everytime they've
had an opportunity to do something on these issues, they've chosen
not to. And unfortunately they control what comes to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at the Capitol on Wednesday, several hundred
immigrants pushed for passage of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness
Act, which would allow non-citizens who have lived in the United
States for at least 14 years to become permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are modest measures designed to provide relief for folks
who have given so much to our country,'' California Rep. Xavier
Becerra said. ``They've paid their taxes, worked hard and raised
their families here in America. We must do the right thing by
moving these measures forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the legislation would:
</P>
<P>
   1) Allow immigrants who have been in the United States since
1986 to become permanent residents. Legislation approved that year
gave amnesty to immigrants who have lived here since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   2) Revise immigration law to allow non-citizens already in the
United States to remain here while waiting for the government to
declare them permanent residents. Since 1997, many immigrants have
been forced to leave the United States before they can receive
visas to become permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   3) Ease restrictions on immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras and Haiti to become permanent residents. The rules were
relaxed in 1997 for Nicaraguans and Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Becerra was less than optimistic the legislation would pass this
year, but he did not rule it out. ``We're closer than we've ever
been if you compare it to, say, five years ago,'' he said, adding
that ``the clock always works against you.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure pushed by Becerra and the immigrants is supported by
Democrats and has the backing of President Clinton. One of the bill
sponsors is Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also touting the bill is Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we lack is the clear signal from leadership
from the Republican side,'' Becerra said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to lawmakers, the Essential Worker Immigration
Coalition wrote, ``There simply are not enough workers in the U.S.
to meet the demand of our strong economy, and we must recognize
that foreign workers are part of the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gay, co-chairman of the coalition and senior director of
governmental affairs for the American Hotel and Motel Association,
said industries have tried to recruit American workers and programs
such as welfare-to-work have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been great, but it clearly has not been
enough,'' he said. ``We're looking at a serious labor shortage in
several areas of the country right now that's not getting any
better.''

<P>
   After winning Emmys for directing ``ER,'' Mimi Leder logically
figured that &QL;
</P>
<P>
   her film career would be marked by equally compelling human
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Peacemaker'' and ``Deep Impact'' later, that may finally
come to pass with ``Pay It Forward.'' The Good Samaritan story
certainly has the acting talent to pull it off -- Oscar-winners
Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt, and cinema's most admired child star,
Haley Joel Osment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This felt like I was going home,'' says Leder, a
second-generation, Valley-raised industry veteran. ``It wasn't an
unusual thing for me to do at all. It's where I began, and I always
look at material and storytelling from a dramatic point of view.
It's how I always thought my first movie would be; not my third.''

<P>
   Leder says she wasn't intimidated by her high-powered cast --
even when the formidable Spacey won his second Academy Award in the
middle of the production schedule. After all, the filmmaker could
claim her own significant milestone: ``Deep Impact'' is the
highest-grossing feature film ever directed by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that also adds another layer of expectation to a
movie that definitely has a lot to live up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to tell the best story we could,'' Leder shrugs.
``I tried to keep it as real as we could. We all dove into the
material ferociously, tried to make every moment honest, and these
people became their characters to me. I didn't look at them as
people with statues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I just want to put it out there. As proud as I am of
having made this movie, I'm trying not to have any expectations.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Showing no desire to steal attention from Gov. George
W. Bush's troubles, Vice President Al Gore went about the hard work
of not making news Wednesday as he manufactured gauzy pictures in a
Maine high school and avoided the missteps that have tormented his
rival in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent possible, Gore and his aides are essentially
trying to run out the clock during this stage of the campaign,
letting Bush struggle on his own while Gore emphasizes and
re-emphasizes policy positions that seem to be touching a chord.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Gore campaign plans to turn its full attention to
debates with Bush, which will be the subject of a critical meeting
between the campaigns on Thursday, and to battling the
better-financed Republicans on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   And so Wednesday, Gore came to Lewiston High School in southern
Maine, where he devoted most of the day to a series of
photo-friendly encounters that conveyed his concern about
education. As he did so, his aides drew attention to a letter
written by two Democratic senators asking the Federal
Communications Commission to investigate a Republican television
commercial that, they alleged, may have violated a 1974 federal
rule against subliminal advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said nothing on that topic Wednesday, leaving the task to
Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and John Breaux of Louisiana. The
senators wrote the FCC to express concern about a Republican
National Committee ad that shows the word ``rats'' in a single
frame.
</P>
<P>
   David Fiske, a spokesman for the FCC, said that the request
would be studied, but that the commission would only have the
authority to sanction stations that knowingly broadcast an illegal
ad, not the political strategists who produced it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flew from Maine to Boston on Wednesday afternoon for a
rally with his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and a
fund-raiser expected to collect close to $2 million for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the day's primary images came from the Gore campaign's
eight-hour occupation of Lewiston High. Throughout the day, Secret
Service agents patrolled the corridors along with hall monitors,
and bomb-sniffing dogs examined the backpacks of slouching
students. Gore's speeches were interrupted repeatedly by intercom
announcements from the principal's office, and the vice president
sampled Lewiston's cafeteria cuisine, downing two cheeseburgers and
some fries.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh ``school day'' of Gore's campaign. As always,
he spent the night before at the home of teachers, in this case
Donald and Susan Jalbert, both of whom teach at the school. Gore
arrived at 1 a.m., stayed up talking with the Jalberts and their
two children until 2, and then rose at 6:15 a.m. to eat the
blueberry scones that Mrs. Jalbert had been baking since 4:30.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the day was spent in a succession of meetings _ with
parents, school counselors, teachers and students. He provided
research help to the juniors in Joan M. Macri's American history
class as they scanned textbooks and Internet sites for the answers
to questions about the Constitution and political history. He
instructed Seth Morin, a 16-year-old junior, how to find an Elvis
Presley letter to Richard Nixon on the National Archives Web site.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, cameras recorded the scenes. If there was a slip
in the stagecraft, it was only that Gore, in his meeting with
teachers, allowed himself to be photographed while seated beneath a
picture labeled ``prehistoric man.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore devoted a midday session with students and teachers in the
library to promote his plans for making college more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of high school, kids in middle-class families are
under a lot of pressure, and their parents are under a lot of
pressure,'' Gore said. ``Many of them have no idea where they're
going to get the money to pay tuition.'' Gore's proposals include
increasing an existing federal tax deduction so that families could
deduct 28 percent of annual tuition payments _ up to $10,000 in
tuition for each child _ instead of the current 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal has been criticized by the Bush campaign because
it would only assist those who pay taxes, and would thus exclude
many low-income families. Gore's aides said that those families are
already eligible for a variety of federal college grants.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also would create savings accounts that would allow parents
to make pre-tax contributions that would be matched by the federal
government and could be withdrawn without penalty to pay for
college tuition. And he would create new tax-free accounts, similar
to 401(k) accounts, that would permit individuals and their
employers to put money away for adult learning and training.

 &HT;    Under new coach Amato, N.C. State has shaped up and is 2-0
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something weird, wild and, well, amazing is going on at North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack football team, with an entirely new coaching staff,
with only four returning starters on offense, without All-ACC
quarterback Jamie Barnette for the first time in four seasons, is
shaking up college football.
</P>
<P>
   Give some credit to Chuck Amato, the new coach. The former FSU
assistant head coach directed the defensive line and then
linebackers for Bobby Bowden's program for 18 years and earned his
reputation as a defensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But with Amato's defensive experience, how to explain N.C.
State's sudden offensive surge? The Wolfpack is averaging 39.5
points a game with a freshman at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Amato first made headlines when he hired his coaching staff. His
assistants' combined salaries totaled more than $1 million; their
combined years of experience is more than 200. One of those
assistants is Norm Chow, who orchestrated Brigham Young's offense
for the past 24 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then he signed Philip Rivers out of Athens, Ala., a 6-foot-5,
221-pound quarterback who was coached by his father and named
Alabama player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, who looks like a weight-lifter but never has lifted
weights, then issued an ultimatum. His team was fat and out of
shape, and he wanted it lean and mean. To facilitate, he installed
a ``Belly Board'' in the weight room. The Belly Board consisted of
more than 20 frontal shots of the players without their shirts and
their bellies exposed. When they met his weight requirements, they
got to remove the embarrassing snap shots from the board. The
result was a net team loss of 700 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he has done seems to have worked. The Wolfpack opened
the season with two wins, a double-overtime victory over Arkansas
State and a 41-38 come-from-behind win at Indiana last week after
trailing 21-3. They host SMU on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Amato isn't fooled by his team's 2-0 start. ``If you looked at
the films, you wouldn't say that we are doing this well,'' he said.
``It shows you how important winning a close game is. We're that
close to being 0-2.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference-maker has been Rivers. The savvy quarterback has
completed 60 of 109 passes for 798 yards and 8 touchdowns. He leads
the nation in total offense and is third in completions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little bit different,'' Rivers said. ``Last year,
you're looking at it in high school in your own local newspaper.
Now, you're leading the country.''

   U.S. men find positives in 2-2 tie with Czech Republic
</P>
<P>
   By Wendy Parker
</P>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia - The best way to counter an occasionally
shaky defense is to keep pushing _ and don't let up.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. men's soccer coach Clive Charles used a football term to
describe how his offensive-minded club set the pace early in a 2-2
draw with the Czech Republic in its Group C opener Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best defense was the fact that we attacked and played in
their end a good part of the game,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans were tested on the back line, however, they
showed where they are most vulnerable. The U.S. twice lost leads,
with the Czechs equalizing fast both times.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest blow was a penalty kick called against American
captain Chad McCarty, who brought down Marek Heinz from behind two
steps inside the box in the 52nd minute. Lukas Dosek converted the
penalty kick, and the U.S. settled for one, instead of three points
in what figured to be its toughest group match.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. men, who never have advanced out of group play in
the Olympics, squandering such a chance is a significant letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``A part of me is disappointed,'' Charles said. ``But the
players were very disappointed, and that's what made me feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the fast-paced American striking trio was
ex-Parkview High standout Josh Wolff, who scored a goal and
assisted on the other. Wolff barely missed a marvelous chance to
get the winner in the 63rd minute when he nearly finished off a
superb throw almost the length of the field from goalkeeper Brad
Friedel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled away, and the ball was in the air and came right at
me,'' Wolff said. ``I should have put that one away. It could have
won us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A replay showed that he might have been bumped off the ball just
as he neared the Czech goal. But Brazilian referee Carlos Eugenio
Simon said to play on, just as he did when Wolff took a dive with
two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will need to equal their debut performance against
medal hopeful Cameroon here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we surprised them with the way we came out early, with
a lot of confidence,'' Wolff said. He is a third-year pro enjoying
his best season for the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff assisted on the first goal on a cross that Chris Albright
tapped home for a 1-0 lead early in the first half. Then Wolff
scored on a feed from Conor Casey just before the end of the first
half. Both goals were triggered by alert long balls from defender
Jeff Agoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting all our defensive formations no matter what
we tried,'' Czech coach Karel Bruckner said. ``Nothing was working.
Their fast, constant penetration of our defense was very
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. outshot the Czechs 13-8 and put eight on goal to three
for the opponents. After Wolff's dramatic near-miss, Agoos drilled
a volley that Czech keeper Jaroslav Drobny parried away before
turning aside a point-blank attempt from Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We earned some respect out there,'' Wolff said. ``Now, we have
to go out and duplicate it in the next game and show it's not a
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Other games
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon 3, Kuwait 2: At Brisbane, Lauren Etame Mayer scored
with five minutes left. Nicolas Alnoudji gave Cameroon the lead in
the 36th minute. Patrick Mboma connected in the 75th and Mayer
scored the winner off a setup by Patrice Abanda. Italy 1, Australia
0: Andrea Pirlo, frustrated by the crossbar and a goal-line
clearance, finally scored off the inside of the goalpost with nine
minutes to go. A packed stadium of 93,252 at Melbourne Cricket
Ground went home disappointed, although the hosts had plenty of
scoring opportunities. Nigeria 3, Honduras 3: At Adelaide, Nigeria,
the defending Olympic champion, scored twice in the final 13
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Agali scored in the 77th and Yakubu Ayegbeni in the 89th,
nullifying a two-goal performance by Honduras' David Suazo. Bright
Igbinadolor had tied the match for Nigeria in the 50th.

SUITS CHARGE CONSPIRACY TO EXPAND RITALIN USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Texas, Miss.)   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in class-action lawsuits against the tobacco
industry, gun makers and health maintenance organizations filed two
lawsuits Wednesday against another target, the widely used drug
Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in California and New
Jersey, charge that Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., the drug's
manufacturer, and the American Psychiatric Association, a
professional group, conspired to create a market for Ritalin and
expand its use.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Ritalin has been increasingly prescribed
for children who have been given a diagnosis of attention deficit
disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That trend
has prompted debate among scientists, psychiatrists and government
officials over whether children are receiving too much medication
or are being given incorrect diagnoses of behavioral disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both Novartis Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Novartis
AG, and the American Psychiatric Association said that they had not
seen the lawsuits and so could not comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the groups said the accusations sounded
similar to those in a class-action lawsuit brought earlier this
year against them in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Novartis said that Ritalin, also known by its
chemical name methylphenidate, had been used safely and effectively
in thousands of children for more than 40 years and that it was the
most studied drug used for attention deficit hyperactive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatric association called the accusations in the Texas
suit ``groundless'' and an ``opportunistic attack on the scientific
process that underlies this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuits seek to halt what they call unlawful practices
and ask that profits from the drug sales be returned to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those bringing the latest lawsuits is Richard Scruggs, a
lawyer from Pascagoula, Miss., who represented dozens of states in
actions brought in recent years against cigarette makers. This
year, Scruggs also filed suits against several HMO's charging that
they had defrauded consumers by failing to provide them with
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   John Coale, a Washington lawyer who is also involved in the
lawsuits, said the litigation was brought because Novartis and the
psychiatric group promoted the idea that large numbers of children
had attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder as a way of expanding the market for Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were giving this stuff away like candy,'' Coale said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House this year announced a major effort to reverse a
sharp increase in the number of preschool children using Ritalin,
Prozac and other powerful psychiatric drugs. The trend had been
reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association.

THE JUKEBOX COMES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the word jukebox and most of us imagine some garish,
pot-bellied machine that spins a few records (or compact discs) for
a handful of coins.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The new jukeboxes, born of a fledgling marriage of
traditional audio and newfangled computer technology, are intended
for home use and play music in MP3 and other digital formats. They
come in different sizes, shapes and prices (none cheap), but all
are designed to store or sort large collections of music for easier
playback. They are being aimed at music lovers with crates full of
CDs or hard drives overloaded with music files.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really needs any of these players (except perhaps some
traveling, tech-forward DJ). That, apparently, hasn't stopped their
makers from introducing more and more of these hybrid players in
recent months. Of all the models I have seen and tried, at least
one of them could be hard to resist, if you have the cash.
</P>
<P>
   The AudioReQuest ARQ1 Digital Music System by ReQuest
Multimedia, at $800, provides a place to store and play back an
entire music collection. The device, which is crammed with PC
technology including a 17.3-gigabyte hard drive, is about the size
of a large multidisc CD player. It is designed primarily to copy
songs from CDs (it can also copy from cassette tapes and vinyl
records), translate their tunes into MP3 files, store them and play
them back. It can also play individual CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The AudioReQuest, which was introduced this year, can hold up to
320 hours of music if the songs are recorded at the near-CD-quality
bitrate of 128 kilobits per second. The device is capable of much
higher-quality recordings, but at the expense of holding fewer
songs. No matter what rate is chosen, translating CDs into MP3
files is a bit of a chore. Recording a 55-minute CD at 128 kbps,
which is recommended, took 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a standard computer keyboard, which is not included, and
plugging the system into a conventional television set for a
monitor, I was able to create playlists of my favorite songs. The
AudioReQuest also permits users to quickly locate music on its hard
drive by song, album and artist via the device's wireless remote
control. The remote is more than a handful, mostly because it has
too many buttons, including a keyboard that is close to useless _
the tiny keys are laid out in alphabetical order, forcing you to
hunt and peck.
</P>
<P>
   The device comes with cables to make connecting the unit to a
PC, a PC monitor or TV very simple. But to take full advantage of
the AudioReQuest's best features, you need to link it to a home
stereo system, an Internet-linked PC and a television set. But the
length of its cables are too short to connect everything together
at once.
</P>
<P>
   Once the music is placed on the AudioRequest hard drive _
existing MP3 files in a personal computer can also be imported into
the device _ playback of the music files is remarkably good. This
machine is expensive and may be a harbinger of the future of home
audio, but it is easy enough to resist buying right now.
</P>
<P>
   The only device I tested that is truly tempting was made by
Creative, a Singapore-based technology company that was an early
innovator in PC sound. Its Nomad Jukebox, introduced this month, is
a portable music player about the size of a portable CD player, but
heavier, and holds the equivalent of 150 CDs of music.
</P>
<P>
   The Nomad Jukebox has a modest-size LCD screen and a smattering
of buttons on its contoured face and a headphone jack on its right
side. But the device's resemblance to a CD player stops there. The
Nomad Jukebox doesn't play CDs. What it does, once linked to a PC
or Mac by way of a USB cable, is store more than 100 hours of MP3
music files on its six-gigabyte, shock-resistant hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Nomad Jukebox will also store up to 2,600 hours of
spoken-word files as well as store and read multiple sound file
formats, including WMA and WAV.
</P>
<P>
   The Creative PlayCenter 2 software for the Nomad was easy to
install on a standard PC, but not always the easiest to use. I ran
into a few glitches in setting up the encoding, often called
ripping, of scores of CDs I eventually loaded into the Nomad
Jukebox. Once I got underway, each CD took about 10 minutes to be
turned into MP3 files and moved into the jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Once the music was in the Nomad Jukebox, its sound, heard on a
set of included headphones, was very good. There are spatialization
effects that can make, for example, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sound
as if they were performing in an empty recital hall. And the
jukebox reverb, bass and treble controls were good. Best of all was
the easy access to all the music, which can be called up by
playlists, artist, album or style.
</P>
<P>
   The player also lets you search for a song by typing in a few
letters of the title. But typing is more like pecking, using a
couple of tiny buttons. Another downside is that for a device that
is touted to be so mobile, its battery life is extremely limited. I
never got more than four hours of continuous play from four
rechargeable nickel-hydride batteries.
</P>
<P>
   At $500, the Nomad Jukebox may seem expensive, but compared with
equally costly MP3 players, all of which have only a fraction of
the storage capacity, it seems like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That could not be said for the Escient TuneBase 100. It is a
$3,000, 15-pound set-top box, 3 and a half inches tall and 17
inches wide. The TuneBase plugs into an Internet connection, a CD
changer holding 100 or more CDs and a television, or an optional
$2,000 LCD touch-screen controller.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to use this device, you can already have a CD
changer with at least 100 slots (more expensive models come with
much larger CD changers). Then, presumably you have a lot more on
your mind other than remembering where ``James Brown Live at the
Apollo'' is in slot 191, or that Joni Mitchell's ``Misses'' is the
20th CD out of 300 ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   So, since you obviously are the sort of person who spends a lot
on music, you might buy the TuneBase, too. Here's what it will do
for you:
</P>
<P>
   It will list every CD loaded into a changer. Drawing upon PC
technology, the TuneBase locates a unique identification code and
automatically goes online to the Compact Disc Database, which
contains all the information a CD would ordinarily display on its
cover, like the name of the artist, each song title, album cover
art and liner notes. That information is then downloaded into the
TuneBase's hard drive and shown on any display screen connected to
the system.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is done at PC speed and usually works without a
hitch. Sometimes the database doesn't have any information on an
obscure CD. But usually the result is a real-time listing, by name
of artist, genre or song, of every CD loaded into the system. Then
you can create a playlist and hear the songs you like in the order
you like.
</P>
<P>
   And with additional CD changers, either large and expensive ones
or daisy-chaining multiple changers, the TuneBase can handle more
than 4,500 CDs. A similar $7,500 system by Escient called PowerPlay
works with DVD movies as well as CDs. The number of people who have
enough DVDs to warrant a $7,500 sorter is probably even smaller
than the number of people who want a $3,000 CD sorter, but
technology marches on.
</P>
<P>
   The most time-consuming part of the process is the physical
loading of your CD collection into the changer and the wait for the
TuneBase to read, retrieve and remember all of the music data it
requires to operate. But if you give it a weekend, the TuneBase can
slice and dice your music collection into favorite playlists or
call it up at the touch of a remote-control button to display and
play any piece of music you have in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the TuneBase does not actually play the CDs. It has
neither speakers nor amplifiers. Your music system has to be all
set up and ready to go. What it does, for $3,000, is store,
identify and organize the tunes.

<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The 40-foot dike around Lake Okeechobee leaks
and needs a $180 million overhaul, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
officials told local emergency managers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The corps plans to submit an $80-million proposal in the 2002
federal budget for the first part of the repair job, a shoring up
of the 22 miles of levee from Port Mayaca to Belle Glade, said Ed
Middleton, Chief of Engineering and dam safety officer for the
corps' Jacksonville district. If the money is approved, work would
start that year and probably would take about four years. Middleton
explained the project Wednesday at the monthly meeting of Palm
Beach County's Local Emergency Management Network, gathered at the
county's Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no chance of the dike breaching and sending a
deadly wall of water onto the 40,000 people living around the lake,
Middleton said. But the possibility can't be ruled out, he said,
and the danger grows greater the more leaks show up in the dike,
which rings the lake for about 120 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The problems so far have shown up only on the lake's east side,
from around Okeechobee to Moore Haven, Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty, Michael Loehr, an administrator with
the Florida Department of Emergency Management, said at Wednesday's
meeting that he'd probably suggest an evacuation of cities along
the lake if it were high to brimming and a major hurricane was
aiming at it.
</P>
<P>
   The corps has had anecdotal evidence of leaks for decades and
has documented seepage and stability problems since 1984, but
undertook a $4 million survey after heavy rains in 1995 and 1998
sent the lake level past 18 1/2 feet and sparked major leaks,
Middleton said. The corps considers the dike at dangerous levels
for failure at about 21 feet; its highest recorded level was 18.9
feet in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   There's no danger of flooding right now. Following a recent run
of low rainfall, the lake stood Wednesday about 11.8 feet above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   Water is not squirting, but rather seeping out at various spots.
But what is causing the most damage is the dirt and rock the water
carries with it, undermining the walls of the dike, which was built
over four decades to protect the Glades from a repeat of the
catastrophic 1928 hurricane. That storm killed as many as 3,000
people when the 6-foot dike then surrounding the lake gave way.
</P>
<P>
   The corps does not believe the lake would spill over the top,
but the higher the water, the more it pushes against the base of
the dike. In some cases, water actually seeps into the ground under
the pyramid-shaped dike, undermining its foundation and causing
water and sand to boil out of the ground sometimes hundreds of feet
from the dike.
</P>
<P>
   The repair work would involve adding a 5-foot-thick blanket of
rock and other fill that, like a coffee filter, would let any
leaking water pass through while holding in the materials that form
the dike, Middleton said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The founder of DragonCon, a popular sci-fi and pop
culture convention, is in the Gwinnett County jail without bond on
child sex abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Eliot Kramer, 39, of Duluth, Ga., is scheduled to appear
in court this afternoon for a bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer is charged with aggravated child molestation of a
13-year-old boy who was sodomized in July, according to the
criminal arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, James Altman, of Atlanta, said only that:
``Everybody's presumed innocent until proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's convention in downtown Atlanta drew an estimated
40,000 who share a love of Star Wars, Star Trek, comic books and
horror flicks.
</P>
<P>
   The case remains under investigating and additional charges
involving more victims are possible, prosecutor Nancy DuPree said.

 &HT;    Polish native amazed by homeland's transformation
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many ways, the Poland of today is ``a different country''
from the one Hubert Tworzecki left in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   After 44 years of Communist rule ending with the free elections
of 1989, the country has moved rapidly toward an economy led by
private enterprise, now accounting for about 70 percent of Polish
jobs. After wrenching market reforms in the early '90s, growth has
averaged around 6 percent a year since mid-decade.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors have pumped $40 billion into Polish industry.
Wages now average around $400 a month, compared with $50 a month in
neighboring Ukraine. Stores are filled with consumer goods _ to the
point today's young people ``can't remember the endless queues for
the most basic necessities of life,'' Tworzecki says.
</P>
<P>
   And in small ways _ for instance, the fresh paint on houses _
the sense of newfound prosperity is tangible. ``The place looks
much more tidy and well taken care of than was the case just a
little while ago,'' Tworzecki says.
</P>
<P>
   This different world fascinates Tworzecki, an Emory University
political scientist who continues to keep a keen eye on his
homeland's development. On a recent day, he sat in his office on
the Atlanta campus analyzing the latest polling figures for the
upcoming Polish presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Televised campaigning is just beginning but the race for the
Oct. 8 election looks all but finished. Incumbent Aleksander
Kwasniewski, an ex-Communist turned social democrat, continues to
enjoy high approval ratings and is far ahead of his main rivals _
centrist technocrat Andrzej Olechowski and Marian Krzaklewski,
leader of the Solidarity bloc, which controls the reigning
coalition in Poland's parliamentary government. Barring a major
turn of events, the rivals' only hope _ an unlikely one _ is to
force Kwasniewski into a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity, rooted in the pre-1989 anti-Communist coalition, has
controlled parliament since 1997, but its members are divided and
the party is the target of criticism from Poles concerned about
unemployment and a shrinking social net. Besides the presidential
race, Solidarity also faces the prospect of crashing badly in the
more important parliamentary elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders had hoped that recently approved legislation
to turn over state-owned housing and other property to ordinary
Poles would help. But polls showed voters sharply divided on the
plan, and Kwasniewski _ saying it would throw property rights into
disarray _ vetoed it this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Polish leader best known to Americans, Lech
Walesa, wallows far behind in the 13-candidate presidential race.
Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to create a
free Poland, was elected president in 1990 but lost to Kwasniewski
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa is still respected as a historical figure, Tworzecki
says. ``But people wish he would stay as a historical figure and
not get involved with politics. ... Walesa was a great fighter but
he was not a very good manager.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its progress since it swept the Communists from power in
1989, Poland today still faces serious problems. At the
governmental level, a need to strengthen its court system and
efforts to stamp out corruption rank high on the list, Tworzecki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues are perhaps predictable outgrowths of the
transition from communism. Some people have fared better than
others. And a sizable pool of people are still stuck in the
mentality that assumes the state will provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   To various degrees, attitudes toward the Communist era remain a
major fault line. But the current interpretations of history are
not simple ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even Walesa, who led the fight for liberty and democracy, now
cautions against both ``a monopoly of Solidarity'' and unfettered
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time shipyard electrician turned freedom fighter
recently ripped the current version of Solidarity as ``a debased
bureaucracy'' run by ``third-rate militants'' who ``would do
anything to keep their place.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism, too, he said, ``must change its face. ... At the
dawn of the 21st century, capitalism needs some regulation. God has
not given everyone the same things, and the markets must be
controlled and regulated to be complementary so everyone can profit
from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Walesa might not be making a dent in the polls, but he is not
alone in his reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   Among people who express ``various degrees of fondness'' for the
Communist era, Tworzecki says, are those who recognize the
oppression and lack of freedom of the period but who also feel some
pride in post-World War II Polish reconstruction efforts and in the
social and economic advancement that took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism in Poland after 1956 was quite distinct from its
variants in Russia or Czechoslovakia or East Germany or Romania,''
Tworzecki says. The Communist leadership was not as repressive as
that in some countries nor as paternalistic as others, and it
allowed a certain amount of access to the West and to Western
goods.
</P>
<P>
   While interpretations of that era's history likely will continue
to influence Polish politics for some time, no one expects Poland
to turn the clock back.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of Poland's trade now is with the European
Union, compared with only 10 percent with countries of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Poland that was an anchor of the Warsaw Pact is now a member
of NATO _ a step that was even more important than the still
pending effort to join the European Union, Tworzecki says. ``Among
the (new) countries that joined NATO, Polish opinion was the most
supportive'' of the air campaign to end Serb ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo last year, he says. ``The balance of opinion was we are in
it now and we have to do our share.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Poland is ``a trusted ally'' of the United States, he
adds, and a nation whose ``relations with the U.S. are quite
exemplary'' on all fronts.
</P>
<P>
   And even the intricacies of the election illustrate a larger and
far more dramatic change: In the past decade, once-Communist Poland
has rapidly transformed itself into a country where, as Tworzecki
puts it, ``the fundamentals of democracy are firmly in place.''

CANADA TRIES TO DEFINE LINE BETWEEN HUMAN AND NATIONAL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (Eds: Legwaila Joseph Legwaila in 9th graf is cq) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan shocked many
nations last year by arguing that leaders who abuse citizens can no
longer escape reckoning by hiding behind national sovereignty. Now
Canada is about to announce that it has asked a panel to write the
first concrete guidelines for making the tough calls between human
rights and national rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most important debate that we face at this
juncture,'' Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Wednesday. In an
interview, he said the divide between those who say prominence
should be given to international standards of human rights and
those who hold to ``more classic nation-state interests'' has
widened and sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   Some, but not all, the nations most strongly opposed to
international intervention aimed at saving people _ or sometimes
saving democratic institutions _ are in the developing world. There
is also a strong lobby in the United States, reflected in the
Republican leadership in Congress, against any erosion of the
principle of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, however has been impossible to avoid, diplomats say.
From the creation of the United Nations in 1945 and throughout the
Cold War, the protection of national interests was almost
inevitably prominent, Axworthy said, adding: ``Our take has been
that since the end of the Cold War we have to focus on individuals,
on the people. That is as much in the charter as sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said that a year ago, just after Annan's groundbreaking
speech to the General Assembly, Canada offered to pay for a program
within the United Nations to study the legality and the
implications of what diplomats call ``humanitarian intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't considered to be prudent, because there was so
much opposition to it by certain countries, as well as within the
bureaucracy,'' Axworthy said. ``It became too controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   So Canada decided on its own to commission a study, with the
help of four U.S. foundations, the Carnegie Corp., the Hewlett
Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and
the Rockefeller Foundation. Canada is to announce its plans on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two former foreign ministers, Gareth Evans of Australia and
Mohamed A. Sahnoun of Algeria, will be chairmen of the panel, to be
called the International Commission on Intervention and State
Sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members, not all of who have been chosen, will include Lee
H. Hamilton, a former Democratic Congressman from Indiana and
member of the House International Relations Committee; Michael
Ignatieff, the writer; Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, Botswana's
ambassador to the United Nations; Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Duma; Cornelius Sommaruga,
former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
and Ramesh Thakur, an Indian who is vice rector of the U.N.
University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said the study would look at all types of material like
case studies, public opinion surveys and published research to draw
up guidelines. ``We hope, to use the buzzword of the day, that this
can be a little bit of a tipping agent toward actually getting the
adoption of some criteria, some understanding _ maybe simply
conventional practice, as opposed to something that's codified in
law,'' he said. ``But at least we'll get the debate out there.
We'll flush people out and get some serious research.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The weather and lifestyle have always been
hospitable to sports in Australia. The sun shines frequently and
temperatures in the major cities enable Australians to play all
manner of games year-round.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1976, something had changed. Australians failed to bring
home any gold medals that year from the Summer Olympics in
Montreal. That outcome _ a sharp reversal from the eight golds won
by Australians at the 1972 Games in Munich _ was unacceptable for a
country that had grown accustomed to defining itself through
international sports success.
</P>
<P>
   Sports officials devised a plan to become more competitive after
1976, and one of the models was East Germany, a country whose
population of 16.7 million was comparable to Australia's but whose
athletes had won 40 gold medals in Montreal to finish second in the
overall count behind the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The East Germans had developed a centralized,
government-sponsored sports system. Australians decided to do the
same, and in January 1981, the Australian Institute of Sport opened
its doors in Canberra, the capital. The goal, based on the East
German example, was to bring together athletes, coaches,
scientists, trainers, physiotherapists and nutritionists on a
large, leafy campus to maximize elite athletes' performances.
Institutionalized doping was certainly not part of the plan,
although it later became clear that it was an essential reason for
East Germany's success.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later, with the Sydney Games set to open on
Friday, Australia has nearly completed its comeback. It is again an
Olympic power, and with the help of home crowds and
hyper-motivated, well-prepared athletes, it could set a new
national standard by winning as many as 60 medals in everything
from field hockey to trap shooting to tennis. Australia might
finish as high as fourth in the medal count.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a remarkable achievement for a nation of only 19
million people. (The United States, with 260 million people, won
101 medals in the 1996 Games in Atlanta.) And what makes the
prospect even more noteworthy is that most Australians prefer to
play and watch sports that are not even on the Olympic program.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are celebrated Australian swimmers in abundance
(Ian Thorpe, Grant Hackett, Susan O'Neill, Kieren Perkins, Michael
Klim) and one celebrity runner (Cathy Freeman, the two-time world
400-meter champion), the majority of Australia's most prominent
athletes will not be splashing or sprinting for gold. Steve Waugh
and Shane Warne play cricket. Greg Norman and Karrie Webb play
golf. John Eales and George Gregan play rugby union, the
15-man-a-side version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Australians won world titles in rugby union, cricket
and netball, a popular women's game here that resembles basketball.
They also won the Davis Cup in tennis and individual world titles
in sports as diverse as alpine skiing and track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport in this country is the No. 1 thing,'' said an Australian
assistant swim coach, Gennadi Touretsky, a Russian who was once a
national swim coach in the former Soviet Union. ``I don't know
another country with a sports culture like this. Not one. I think
we had a similar thing in Russia from the 1950s up until the 1970s.
But this sport culture here is supported financially, because sport
is one of the most successful businesses in Australia. It was never
that kind of business in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The team representing Australia at the Sydney Games will include
628 athletes, the biggest contingent at the Olympics. More than
half of the athletes, 320 in all, have received scholarships at one
time or another from the Australian Institute of Sport and others
have received aid from state sports institutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Institute does not help every Australian athlete:
Wealthy tennis players like Pat Rafter and Mark Philippoussis no
longer require its financial assistance, nor do well-sponsored
stars like Freeman and Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   For those in residence in Canberra, life is hardly luxurious.
Long jumper Jai Taurima calls the dormitory rooms ``cells'' and a
quick glance at the spartan, charmless confines of a room that
recently became vacant makes it easy to see his point. Stipends are
not large. Taurima, for example, who lives off-campus, receives the
equivalent of less than $400 in American dollars to cover his
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But as at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs,
Col., the hundreds of athletes at the Australian Institute have
subsidized access to healthy food, excellent coaching, good if not
necessarily state-of-the-art facilities, medical treatment and one
of the world's most respected sports science departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got everything at your beck and call,'' said Taurima,
who left Brisbane and his beloved surfboard behind for Canberra
three years ago. ``At home, I don't get any of that support stuff.
The only thing is that no one is very keen to come down here.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because Canberra is geographically isolated and
provincial in feel. But the national sports institute does get
results: In Atlanta, 76 percent of the Australian medalists were
former and current scholarship holders.
</P>
<P>
   The national and the state institutes are not the only reasons
for Australia's Olympic renaissance. As is customary when a nation
hosts an Olympics, public and private spending on sports has
increased significantly. Regional and municipal facilities also
have improved dramatically in the last 10 years throughout
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Eastern Europe's communist regimes has also
contributed to the resurgence of Australian athletes. Countries
like the former East Germany no longer accumulate Olympic medals.
Of course, East Germany's remarkable Olympic success has now been
discredited because of systematic, government-sponsored doping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element of irony there certainly,'' said John
Boultbee, the director of the Australian Institute of Sport.
</P>
<P>
   The East German model was not the ideal model after all. ``A lot
of the stuff from the east was replicated here, but to say it's the
same in every respect would certainly not be true,'' Boultbee said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been a doping scandal at the Australian
Institute. In 1987, a javelin thrower, Sue Howland, tested positive
for steroids and then implicated coaches and other athletes
connected to the institute whom she believed were using drugs. A
government inquiry in 1989 was critical of the sports institute's
drug-prevention efforts, particularly in track and field and
weightlifting, and the institute was stripped of some of its
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, however, Australia has been one of the
most vocal advocates for improved drug testing, and scientists at
the national institute helped develop the new blood test for the
banned substance EPO. The test is being used in conjunction with a
French urine test for EPO in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit pious to say it, but I do think we are relatively
clean even in the at-risk sports compared to a lot of our
competitor countries,'' Boultbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Host nations traditionally perform much better than usual at the
Olympics. The last time the Games were held in Australia, in 1956
in Melbourne, Australians won 13 golds, a national record. This
time, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee, John
Coates is predicting as many as 20.

&HT;     AT LAST, THE VALOR IN WORLD WAR II MAY BE COMMEMORATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Earlier this month our country commemorated the
55th anniversary of the end of World War II, and this week the
government may make the final decision on how and where to honor
the victorious warriors of that devastating conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The war, a bloody ordeal of more than three and a half years for
the United States, cost more than 400,000 American lives, totally
changed the international balance of power, ushered in the nuclear
age and gave birth to the United Nations and the Marshall Plan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seminal event of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2 we marked the anniversary of the signing of the peace
agreement in Tokyo Bay in 1945. On Wednesday, the National Capital
Planning Commission is to meet in special session, presumably to
determine at long last the design and placement of the proposed
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The logical location is the National Mall, which now is the site
of memorials to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. The lives
and deeds of Thomas Jefferson and Franklin D. Roosevelt and the
wars in Vietnam and Korea are recalled in memorials near or along
the side of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   But a plan to place the World War II memorial in the middle of
the mall has ignited a firestorm of controversy. Some critics
object to the design _ a plaza featuring a pool and pillars adorned
with bronze wreaths, created by architect Friedrich St. Florian.
Others oppose breaking the open sweep between the Lincoln Memorial
and the Capitol with a new structure.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was so impressed with the view that he moved the
presidential inaugural in 1981 from the east side of the Capitol to
the west side so he could see the Washington Monument and Lincoln
Memorial as he took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Some people propose that a tunnel be constructed to carry
traffic under the mall and that the World War II memorial be
constructed on the land above the tunnel. In doing that the
government would have to keep the new structure low enough so that
it would not break up the mall's majestic vista.
</P>
<P>
   But the continued haggling should stop. Time is of the essence
if any of the men and women who served in the war are to witness
completion of the memorial commemorating their valor. Almost all of
them are now in their seventies or older.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, their number dwindles. By the time the memorial is
built and dedicated, few will around to savor it.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II experience was unique in our history. As soon
as Americans learned on Dec. 7, 1941, that Japanese bombs had
decimated the Pacific fleet, killing and wounding many service men,
old animosities suddenly were replaced by new kinships.
</P>
<P>
   Then four days after the Pearl Harbor attack, Adolf Hitler, who
had conquered most of Western Europe, and his ally, Italy's Benito
Mussolini, declared war on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After that, something remarkable occurred in America.
Isolationists and interventionists, laborers and industrial giants
as well as friends and foes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
locked arms in the march to victory over the hated Axis.
</P>
<P>
   For one magic moment in the consciousness of America, business
and industry leaders, who had spent much of a decade fighting
Roosevelt and his revolutionary governmental reforms, converted
their factories to the production of arms and military equipment,
and many accepted high governmental positions for $1 a year.
</P>
<P>
   By war's end, Americans had fought the enemy in Europe, Asia and
Africa. In addition to those killed, nearly 700,000 were wounded,
bringing total U.S. casualties to some 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   All of the famous World War II military heroes are gone. But
during the war, everyone could identify Gens. George Marshall,
Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, Omar Bradley
and Mark Clark and Adms. Chester Nimitz and William Halsey.
</P>
<P>
   The sites of decisive battles now are but part of a dynamic
legend. They include Bastogne, Bizerte, El Alamein, Guadalcandal,
Iwo Jima, Midway, Monte Cassino, Normandy, Okinawa, Salerno, St.
Lo, Tobruk and Wake Island.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers, sailors and Marines indulged in the usual amount of
griping, but in battle they stood together, united by a joint
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   A horrendous year-long battle that began on May 6, 1944, with
the invasion of Normandy ended in Germany's unconditional surrender
at Reims, France, on May 7, 1945. By that time, Hitler had
committed suicide in his Berlin bunker, and Mussolini had been
executed by Italian partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt had died of a stroke on April 12, 1945, and had been
succeeded by Harry Truman, who gave the order to drop atomic bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and later advanced the Marshall Plan that
rebuilt devastated Western Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The events of World War II _ the heroics and the heartbreaks _
should be commemorated so that future Americans and their foreign
friends can reflect on the sacrifices made by plain, peace-loving
men and women when their country and their way of life were
threatened by tyrants from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As the Civil War was America's defining event of the 19th
century, World War II was defining event of the 20th century. It
should be commemorated as such _ not just for those who lived
through it but also for those who continue to share the fruits of
victory over tyranny.

ASTRONAUTS USE HAMMER, CHISEL TO REPLACE AGING BATTERY ABOARD SPACE
STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Encountering an unanticipated obstacle, the visiting
Atlantis astronauts grabbed hammer and chisel on Wednesday to
replace an aging power storage battery aboard the international
space station.
</P>
<P>
   The brute force approach worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew did a little bit of garage work today,'' chuckled
NASA's Mark Ferrying, the space station flight director who
authorized the unusual repair tactic with Russian ground teams.
</P>
<P>
   After a long midday rest, the shuttle's five American astronauts
and two Russian cosmonauts planned to re-board the orbital outpost
late Wednesday for more work on the expanding electrical power
system.
</P>
<P>
   Giant solar arrays that jut from the station generate electrical
power while the outpost circles the Earth in sunlight. When the
station slips into darkness, power soaked up by the batteries is
discharged to keep critical life support, communications and
computer systems operating.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew docked with the station Sunday to kick off a
week of high tech housework intended to prepare the outpost for the
arrival of its first resident crew in early November.
</P>
<P>
   After a spacewalk that linked external power cables to the
station's latest major addition, the Zvezda crew module, the
astronauts streamed aboard to bolster the internal distribution of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   With its living and working accommodations for three, Zvezda's
late July addition rendered the station habitable for the first
time since orbital assembly began nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Zvezda was launched with just five of its eight
batteries installed, a weight-saving tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and astronaut Ed Lu had little
difficulty Wednesday installing three more.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story in the station's neighboring Zarya
compartment, the Russian-built propulsion module that became the
new station's cornerstone with its launching in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There, astronaut Dan Burbank and cosmonaut Boris Morukov were
trying to remove two aging storage batteries slated for
replacement. Four of the propulsion module's six batteries had been
replaced with little difficulty by another shuttle crew in May.
</P>
<P>
   Much to their dismay the two men found that fasteners securing a
bracket they needed to remove had been riveted rather than bolted
into place.
</P>
<P>
   So with hammer and chisel retrieved from the station's tool kit,
Burbank, a former Coast Guard search and rescue pilot, and Morukov,
a medical doctor, popped eight unwanted rivets.
</P>
<P>
   Though successful, the battery replacement task took longer than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise. We weren't aware they would have
problems,'' Ferring explained later. ``What was really good,
though, was that we had the tools on board and the know how on the
ground to find a way to work around that.''
</P>
<P>
   The final Zarya battery replacement was planned for early
Thursday as was the installation of a charging device to ensure
that Russian Soyuz crew transport and Progress cargo capsules that
dock with the station have plenty of electricity.

 &HT;    Golf club drops '98 noise lawsuit against pig farmer
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Golfers at the Florida Club will soon be hitting
balls off pig-decorated tees, eating pork sandwiches in the
clubhouse and dodging a new ``yield for pig crossing'' sign at the
15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Club officials will no longer be battling pig
farmer/neighbor Paul Thompson in court.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners Wednesday dropped their 1998 lawsuit in which they
accused Thompson of playing loud music for his 135 hogs and pigs to
harass golfers and thwart home sales.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting in court, club officials decided to
capitalize on the infamous squabble that has drawn worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged,'' Thompson said after learning the suit was
dropped. ``It's been going on for 2 1/2 years, and it's cost me a
lot of time, money and aggravation. I've lived there since 1957 and
haven't violated anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Club President Bob Kramer said club officials decided to
drop the suit because the music levels from Thompson's farm has
dropped significantly in recent weeks and because a landscaped berm
recently added near the farm has reduced the intrusion of the music
on club residents.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the noise level dropped on Thompson's farm after a
judge ordered his neighbors, Thomas and Faith Rossano, to lower the
volume of the music they play for their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told them to lower the level below that allowed by the
county's noise ordinance and to point their loudspeakers away from
the Florida Club property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling in the Rossano case several weeks ago and the
implementation of the new county noise ordinance clearly
establishes that playing loud music that impacts a neighbor, be it
The Florida Club or anyone else, is not acceptable,'' Kramer said
in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson said he has never reduced the music that he plays
to keep his pigs fat and happy _ and has always played it within
the levels required by the county noise ordinance that was adopted
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say anything they want, but the (sound) meter reading
hasn't changed,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's attorney, Lance Richard, also refuted the club's
reasons for dropping the suit that was scheduled for trial Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's total nonsense,'' he said. ``I think they never
intended to try this case. They just tried to squeeze Mr. Thompson
and his wife out.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and co-counsel Deborah Gowen said the Florida Club's
sound expert, Bernard Kinney, previously testified that the berm
built across from Thompson's farm a year ago did not block the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's attorneys filed court documents two weeks ago asking
Circuit Judge Ben Bryan to throw out the case without a trial. The
judge was set to hear that argument next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thompsons had a 100 percent defense to a nuisance suit,''
Richard said. ``Legally (the Florida Club) had no basis to bring
this suit, because they never could win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Club attorney Tom Wackeen said the request for the judge
to throw out the case before trial played no part in the club's
decision to drop the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the high visibility of the lawsuits against both pig
farmers has brought additional golfers to the club about 7 miles
southwest of Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   A charitable tournament is scheduled at the club this year to
benefit the Martin County Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said he will ask the Florida Club to pay for some of
Thompson's costs in defending what he described as a frivolous
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should sponsor a golf tournament to benefit the
Paul Thompson recovery plan,'' Gowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he would settle for a cut of the club's
pig-promotion profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want royalties to pay my attorneys' bill,'' he said.

   If you had to follow-up the biggest surprise hit in recent
memory, you'd feel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   a little intimidated, right?
</P>
<P>
   But that's why you're not M. Night Shyamalan and he is. The
Philadelphia-based writer-director confesses to some stress over
the post-production schedule for ``Unbreakable,'' but nly because
the film's Thanksgiving release is coming up fast. Potential
comparisons to his previous supernatural thriller, ``The Sixth
Sense,'' do not trouble him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a cool opportunity to have a really big audience
be excited about what I'm doing next,'' he says. ``That's just a
really nice thing. But the same challenges that were there on
`Sixth Sense' are here again: hoping that we can tell an exciting,
meaningful story in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   The new film stars ``Sense's'' Bruce Willis as the unscathed
only survivor of a terrible train wreck and Samuel L. Jackson as
the mysterious, brittle-boned stranger who has an unusual theory
about why Willis was spared.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film contains its eerie elements and, Shyamalan
promises, a twist or two a la his previous blockbuster,
``Unbreakable'' is a different movie thematically _ just as its
maker is a different artist than he was 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tough time getting up in the morning and coming to
work just because it's a fun or exciting movie,'' Shyamalan admits.
``It really has to have some meaning for me _ and hopefully for an
audience. The characters need to learn lessons that have resonance.
You know, `The Sixth Sense' was as much about parenting and
balancing your work and your marriage as about the kid who saw
ghosts. At the time I wrote it, I'd just become a new parent and
having a career I needed to balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for `Unbreakable,' I'm now wondering what I'm going to be
10 years from now, what is my potential versus my tendency to
laziness or whatever; or if I take the wrong path, which way would
it go. These movies tend to reflect what I'm going through at the
time in my life.''

 &HT;    IXL reaches major deal; stock drops

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - IXL's troubles continued Wednesday despite the
announcement of a two-year, multimillion-dollar deal with
telecommunications giant BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   IXL stock tumbled to a 52-week low at midafternoon but bounced
back slightly after the Midtown-based Internet consulting firm said
it had the contract to create a new look for BellSouth's Web site.

   Bert Ellis, chairman and chief executive officer, said iXL will
begin the first phase of what it said was a ``multimillion-dollar
initiative that will utilize a full range of disciplines ... to
create an individual, personalized experience for BellSouth
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is hoping the BellSouth announcement will help revive
iXL's stock price, which hit a 52-week low of $4.63 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, after the BellSouth announcement, the stock
rose slightly but still finished down 63 cents for the day at
$4.75.
</P>
<P>
   The stock's initial public offering was $14 and hit an all-time
high of $58.75 Jan. 20. The previous low of $5.25 was set on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Overby, an analyst with Forrester Research, says that
it is part of iXL's culture and marketing strategy to announce big
client wins to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw when they announced relationships with GE, we saw them
announcing they had signed the largest Internet services contract
of all time. This type of overcommunicating with the market that
iXL has always done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Overby said that announcing big wins isn't a bad thing ``in and
of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But given iXL's current financial troubles and corporate
reorganization, she said iXL needs not only to land big accounts
but to prove it can deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a lot of noise, people are going see if you can
deliver on quality. I wouldn't say iXL isn't the only company to
fall victim to this. The excitement is legitimate. But you have to
have the products and services to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   IXL has been working with BellSouth since May on a number of
projects, and Wednesday's announcement marks a more formalized,
long-term expansion of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher said iXL has been
straightforward about its financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been very honest with us about everything that's
going on and reassured us that everything we want to get done gets
done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they are the right people. The recent issues have no
bearing on the work we think they do for us. Bert is totally
committed to BellSouth and making sure this whole process works and
this whole contract is something we'll be happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   Overby said she is ``more interested in hearing iXL talk
candidly about how they are going to deliver quality services to
the clients they already have and build out their business
development efforts and get their internal operations in order.''

 &HT;    Motorola names manufacturing chief
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a move aimed at bolstering its ties to key
customers, Motorola Inc.'s Austin-based semiconductor business
named a top sales executive as its head of worldwide manufacturing
and related services.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Wildenberg, 44, formerly the top sales executive in
Motorola's chip business, was named to the post Wednesday,
succeeding Bill Walker, who last week became general manager and
No. 2 executive in the company's $7.4 billion chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Harris, a senior executive in the company's service and
logistics operations, was promoted to Wildenberg's former job of
vice president and director of global sales.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Wildenberg, a native of the Netherlands and a
longtime executive of Motorola in Europe, heads a
manufacturing-related operation that employs 23,000 of Motorola's
33,000 chip workers worldwide, including more than 4,000 of the
company's 10,000 employees in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Wildenberg said one of his top priorities is to push Motorola to
conduct more of its business and exchange more of its information
with customers over Internet-based software systems.
</P>
<P>
   The object, he said, is to give Motorola's chip customers more
timely information on the company's manufacturing operations and
order-delivery process to help them plan their own operations
better.
</P>
<P>
   More electronics companies, Wildenberg said, want to use the
Internet to operate more efficiently, much as Cisco Systems and
other companies have learned to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an e-business environment and we are going to be very
active in that,'' Wildenberg said. ``It's a big, big thing right
now in the electronics industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 43, a former manufacturing manager with National
Semiconductor Corp., has worked at senior manufacturing and
operations management jobs at Motorola since 1991. She was named
director of manufacturing operations in 1997 and became vice
president of customer service in 1998. Later that year, her job was
expanded to vice president of service and logistics.You may contact

   As the fall TV season gets under way, network honchos find
themselves trapped in their own version of ``Survivor,'' with a
nemesis more treacherous than a rat, a snake or a fat naked guy: a
new electronic device called TiVo, which eliminates TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But TiVo may just be the beginning. If it proves successful, it
is only a matter of time before manufacturers produce other
TV-altering devices to complicate network executives' lives even
further:
</P>
<P>
   TeenGo: Filters out vapid dialogue from teen-age drama shows;
voice-recognition feature activated by the words ``popular,''
``unfair'' and ``duh.''
</P>
<P>
   VeTo: Instantly zaps a despised program that is regrettably the
favorite of one's spouse; popular settings include ``WWF
Smackdown'' and ``Antiques Roadshow.''
</P>
<P>
   SleaZo: Eliminates blatant, shoddy network rip-offs of HBO's hit
``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   KathieLeeVo: In a nod to the ratings surge enjoyed by ``Live
with Regis'' since the departure of Regis Philbin's co-host,
removes Kathie Lee Gifford from all other shows in which she might
appear.
</P>
<P>
   SqueaKo: Excises all subliminal references to rodents from
negative campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   GeeZo: Prevents the broadcast of heavyweight boxing matches
between former champions over the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   DeleTo: Instantly edits out all FTC officials' Hollywood-blaming
speeches that feature the phrase, ``This isn't about censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   HeaveHo: Seeks out and eliminates all programs destined for an
early cancellation; device is set to be especially sensitive to
programs featuring single dads coping with unruly broods of
smart-mouthed children, and any talk shows involving Roseanne.

<P>
   EAGLE LAKE, Texas _ When doctors, insurance agents and auto
dealers form unions, organize boycotts and otherwise band together
against larger corporate forces, economic changes are at work that
can also alter the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these groups of traditional Republican voters behaving
like working-class Democrats of old? Because they face a greater
threat to their livelihood than big government ever posed. And it
could change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is from the large corporations with which these small
businesses deal as franchisees, sales representatives and providers
of health care. And it is a fight for their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with record profits derived from Wall Street, the
sales floor and underwriting over the decade of the '90s, big
business wants even more. It wants all the business now, even if
that means competing against and destroying the very partners that
made the big boys big in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   My own industry is one example. The Big Three automakers are
working actively in all 50 states to change dealer franchise laws
that prohibit them from retailing directly to the public through
the Internet and factory-owned stores.
</P>
<P>
   If the automakers' strategy is successful, they could eliminate
or marginalize 20,000 dealerships, dramatically altering the lives
of the 1 million people they employ and the welfare of thousands of
communities. Bankruptcies and the selling off of capital built up
by families over decades would precede the fundamentally new
arrangement in the retail marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the travel industry, big companies' embrace of the Internet
is already causing massive shakeouts. Travel agents are being
squeezed as the public books directly with the airlines, hotels and
Internet businesses. Airlines have cut the commissions of travel
agents in half in a clear effort to eliminate their former business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   A third industry following the trend is insurance. Big companies
have pressed doctors, hospitals and consumers to the limit with
scant reimbursements, poor service, rules that dictate which
doctors can be used and unjustified premium hikes. More than
one-third of hospitals nationwide are not profitable. Group health
premiums rose by 12 percent, on average, this last year.
</P>
<P>
   My own small business' premiums went up 22 percent, and though
the ostensible reason was spiraling health costs, my insurance
company's net profits increased 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a squeeze on independent insurance agencies.
Although 90 percent of all small businesses and homeowners choose
to write their health, life, property and casualty insurance
through independent agents, big insurers have cut their commissions
to these agents in half. If the strategy is to eliminate the
independents, it is working: Since 1987, the ranks of these
agencies have been reduced by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an economy putting this kind of pressure on small independent
business people, the old political paradigms _ capital vs. labor,
free enterprise vs. big government _ are less relevant than a new
one: big capital vs. small capital.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers tempted to think the consolidation of power in the
hands of big companies may streamline costs and lower prices should
ask themselves how well airline deregulation worked in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations' seeking to maximize profits is nothing new. What
is new is the degree to which big business is cannibalizing its own
small partners and displacing arrangements in retailing, health
care and insurance that give customers someone in their community
to connect with directly.
</P>
<P>
   This new fault line in the American economy has the capacity of
putting traditional political allegiances up for grabs. Small
business owners are looking for political help when franchise laws
are attacked and commission payments are gutted. Doctors, patients
and independent insurance agents are looking for help when the
insurance companies are calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   In this new, fundamentally different fight between competing
capitalists, it would be difficult for the Republican ticket to
champion the small business banner, given George W. Bush's and Dick
Cheney's personal and political ties to corporate America. The
Democrats, therefore, have the opening they need to lay claim once
again to being champion of the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's populist rhetoric and Joe Lieberman's service on the
Senate Small Business Committee may help them articulate just what
is at stake in this new cleavage in American politics (although
Sen. Lieberman's longtime links to Connecticut's big insurance
companies could pose a problem).
</P>
<P>
   But can they ally the Democratic Party in two months with the 13
million small business voters who have been hammered for two
decades with the message that Democrats are their enemies?
</P>
<P>
   Once the Democratic Party was the undeniable defender of the
little guy, the worker, in the face of corporate oppression. Then
the Republicans usurped that role, among small business owners at
least, by defending small business against the excesses of big
government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the Democrats can convince small business that their
party stands with them in their biggest battle, they have a real
opportunity to win this presidential election and regain a majority
in Congress as well.

RUSSIAN COURT REAFFIRMS ACQUITTAL OF CAPTAIN ACCUSED OF TREASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As onlookers applauded from the gallery, the Supreme
Court Wednesday rebuffed a final government plea to reopen a
treason case against Alexander Nikitin, the former naval captain
who gave details of radioactive pollution by Russian submarines to
opponents of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ended _ for good, apparently _ the government's
five-year prosecution of Nikitin, a pursuit that had become an
international human rights and environmental issue.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives support to President Vladimir Putin's claim that
he is establishing supremacy of the law in a society that has
operated mostly outside the rules since the collapse of the Soviet
Union nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has suggested that Russia's environmental movement is a
threat to national security and a tool of foreign interests. And it
was during his tenure as head of the Federal Security Service, the
successor to the KGB's domestic arm, that the government's campaign
against Nikitin reached a head.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin stood aside this year when the Supreme Court
first ruled that the government had no case against Nikitin, and it
seemed to stand aside again now when the court rejected prosecutors
requests' to reopen the charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday a jubilant Nikitin called the decision ``a very, very
small step toward creating a state ruled by law.'' One expert and
former American diplomat in Russia, Thomas Graham of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, seconded that appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court made an encouraging decision,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Washington, ``but there are a lot of other
worrying signs that this might be the exception as opposed to the
pattern in Russia. It runs contrary to a lot of what we've been
getting out of Russia in the last couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's progress toward democratic rule has fallen into doubt
lately among some critics, who see a shift toward authoritarianism
in the Kremlin's attempts to silence critical news media and in its
disregard of human rights questions about its conduct in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin is not the only environmental activist under legal
attack. Grigory Pasko, a journalist for a naval newspaper in
Russia's Pacific fleet, was also acquitted last year of treason
charges brought after he discussed the fleet's environmental and
financial policies with Japanese journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are seeking to reopen that case as well, although
Pasko's lawyers argue that military censors had cleared all his
information before it was ever discussed with the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Pasko and Nikitin argue that the prosecutions show
not only the continuing power of the Federal Security Service and
the intelligence apparatus within Russian society, but also the
service's refusal to recognize that the nation now has a more open
political system.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service arrested Nikitin in 1996 after he
wrote reports for Bellona, a Norwegian environmental group,
detailing radioactive pollution in the Arctic seas. He also
reported on the Soviet Union's practice of dumping nuclear waste at
sea from the 1960s through the 1980s, and about past disasters
involving Soviet submarines.
</P>
<P>
   And he reported on reactor safety systems aboard nuclear subs of
the same class as the Kursk, which sank almost a month ago in the
Barents Sea, killing 118 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors imprisoned Nikitin for 10 months and
charged him with espionage and high treason for discussing
submarine accidents and reactor safety systems with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin and Bellona insisted that the information was
unclassified and, in any case, did not threaten Russia's national
security, arguments that eventually won over the judge in a trial
in St. Petersburg City Court last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court affirmed that decision this year, and refused
Monday to let the prosecutors try again.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Frederic Hauge, the Bellona president, said the verdict
showed Russians that ``if you fight, you can win _ and they need to
see that in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin said he would remain in Russia and would continue to
work on environmental issues for Bellona.

   HBO has announced it bought the rights to Jeffrey Toobin's book
``A Vast &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly
Brought Down a President,'' a behind-the-scenes look at President
Clinton's impeachment proceedings. So this being cable, we wonder
if we'll get more explicit details than the networks would give us?
</P>
<P>
   And while HBO didn't comment on casting, it won't stop us from
speculating. With Monica Lewinsky's wild weight loss/gain swing, is
HBO looking for an actress to do the Robert De Niro-``Raging Bull''
thing? How many starlets in Tinseltown can do that? (Hint: Monica
has experience.)
</P>
<P>
   And what about playing the Prez? John Travolta, who did good
pseudo- Bill in ``Primary Colors,'' might be available (especially
after ``Battlefield Earth''). But you know there's this Arkansas
politician with the right looks who will be unemployed in
mid-January, and we hear he is looking for a break in Hollywood.

By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has illuminated signs and billboards, on streets and for the
movies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's created cities of neon, a 60-foot American flag for a
Lenny Kravitz music video, background for scenes of Chinatown or
red-light districts filled with XXX strip clubs. She is the person
credited with lighting up the Batmobile in two of the ``Batman''
movies. Every time she sees neon prominently featured in a movie or
TV program, she has to check her archives to remember whether she
was the person who created it. (More often than not, she was.)
</P>
<P>
   So, what can Lisa Schulte -- neon pioneer and founder of the
largest female-owned prop house in the nation -- possibly do for an
encore? (Hint: It doesn't involve going to Disneyland to rebirth
the Main Street Electrical Parade.)
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Schulte hopes one day to flick an ``on'' switch and have
the Hollywood sign burst into light.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my one last signature piece that I'd like to say that I
did before getting out of this business,'' says Schulte. ``Knowing
that I was responsible for lighting that Hollywood sign and keeping
it lit. I want to do it and I want to do it on the Academy
Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte has a file on the sign at her office. Between
transportation costs, wiring and maintenance, she figures the
endeavor would take $25 million to $30 million to do it right and
keep it lighted. Where movie stars once donated major bucks to
restore the Hollywood sign, Schulte thinks this time the studios
should each kick in several million to sponsor a letter. Paramount
can take an ``O,'' Universal a ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what this city needs, to have that sign lit,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, if you're going to dream, why not dream in big, wild,
larger-than- life color?
</P>
<P>
   Why not dream in neon?
</P>
<P>
   The dream Schulte is currently living might never have happened.
Schulte, the subject of a documentary segment for the Romance
Classics series ``Cool Women,'' walked away from a job that paid
her more than $100,000 per year. She was a medical sales
representative, working with the early pioneers of a medical
procedure that was cutting-edge at the time and eventually attained
a certain popularity. Perhaps you've heard of it: laser vision
correction surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was newly diagnosed with breast cancer, and Schulte,
still in her 20s, felt the time was right to make changes. That
meant getting out of the medical research field. It also meant
losing everything _ house, car -- and starting over.
</P>
<P>
   During a stint as a caterer for Along Came Mary, Schulte worked
on the 1984 Olympics and helped create a futuristic city for an
Olympic Committee event. When she discovered there was no single
place she could assemble, say, a bunch of neon flamingos and palm
trees, Schulte decided to create a niche market for herself: a prop
house that could figure out new and inventive ways to use neon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, I started it out of the trunk of my car,'' says
Schulte. ``I didn't have any money for public relations or taking
ads out. I had a great idea, but I didn't know how to facilitate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte went to school to learn the art of neon bending -- a
craft, she says, that requires seven to 10 years to master. Nights
of Neon trains people in the art of bending, but you won't find a
lot of people out there who can walk in and create magical lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old trade and secrets are kept,'' says Schulte. ``If
anything, it's passed from generation to family members. They're
not really receptive to teaching other people because they worry
about their job security.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, through word of mouth, she began to get work
creating neon for music videos and then for film. Nights of Neon
got its name because Schulte's work was generally used only for a
single evening.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial spirit runs in her blood, says Schulte, who
credits her mother with cultivating that spirit in herself and in
her siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so ahead of her time. She had a clothing company and
an import/export business, and she raised seven kids,'' says
Schulte of her mother, Lorraine, who died when Lisa was in her 20s.
``She was always telling me, `Don't get married. Don't do what I
did.' I think if my mother could have had it another way, she would
have been a career woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte took her mother's advice, creating a business in an
industry that isn't necessarily friendly to women in positions of
power. Those efforts make Schulte and her business more than a
little bit cool, says director/choreographer Debbie Allen, the
woman behind the ``Cool Women'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty amazing that here was a woman who, on
her own wherewithal, saw an opportunity and created a major
business,'' said Allen, whose series was inspired by a book and
also profiles a fire captain, a ballet teacher, a community
activist and the staff coordinator for the New York Taxi Workers
Alliance. Schulte's segment, which is introduced by ``The
Practice'' star Camryn Manheim, airs at 5 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that a woman could go into a world that was so
male-dominated and be so successful and learn practically
everything she knows about it from men -- she was a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Schulte hopes, potentially an inspiring one as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally a behind-the-scenes person, but for 18 years, I've
done a lot of really incredible things. (The `Cool Women' segment)
tells me I'm going to be able to share what I do. Maybe inspire
young girls.'' &QL; 
From an office window in the Van Nuys warehouse that houses Nights
of Neon, Schulte can look out and see sculpture after sculpture of
neon, lighting up a giant room. Signs, displays, animals, figures
and lettering, some static, some in constant back-and-forth
movement. It's neon she has created and neon she has preserved when
somebody was about to destroy it. Part of her goal in creating this
company -- and purchasing the office space -- was to be able to
flick one switch and have the whole room light up.
</P>
<P>
   It may be old hat now to Schulte's workers, a few of whom
shuttle in and out via miniature scooter, but to the non-Vegas
dweller, that neon- plastered room is a sight to behold. Nights of
Neon may have fewer than 10 visitors a day, so the display is for
the benefit of her 15 employees. And for their boss, the Neon Lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my own world, and it costs a lot of money,'' says
Schulte, 44, who shares her work space and her Hancock Park home
with an affable mutt named Harley. ``I have a big office window
where I can see neon all day. This is the energy I like to have
around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, so does Hollywood. The neon you'll spot on screen or
on television won't necessarily look as dazzling as it does in
Schulte's warehouse; it's often simply part of the scenery. But
keep your eyes open for neon in recently released movies like
``Coyote Ugly'' and ``Hollow Man,'' last year's ``Man on the
Moon,'' and the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``Bedazzled'' and
``How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'' Or look at those huge lighted
letters in the WB network's ``Tonight on the WB'' ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's all created in the warehouse by professional neon benders
who trap atmospheric gases in glass tubes, stimulate them with an
electric charge into liquid form and bend them into shape. The
glass-encased gases become restaurant signs, animals, elaborate
lettering or anything else you can dream up.
</P>
<P>
   When film representatives come in needing X amount of neon in
five days, Schulte puts her crew to work. They'll supply as much
neon as they can in the time they're given, and they'll contract
out to hire additional sign makers if the need arises. The work
won't come cheap, but the quality will match the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually get very good products because there are very few
places that do this,'' says Schulte. ``When you walk in here and
you give me $300,000 to do seven miles of neon for a Macy Gray
video and it's Tuesday and you're shooting Saturday, you're
trusting me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte recently added digital graphics and printing to her
business. But even with so many sign-making companies using
computers to create their product, Schulte doesn't see the art of
neon dying out. At least not as long as she's around to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always has been a magical light source,'' she says. &QL; 
---The show: ``Cool Women.'' &QL; 
What: Documentary series on women created by director/choreographer
Debbie Allen. &QL;

STING'S WORLD: EXOTICISM, TORCHY BALLADS AND THE GOOD LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The general mood surrounding Sting can be read almost
as an economic indicator, like the number of new cars recently
sold. In austere times the enduring hit-maker's gentility seems
pompous, the privilege of an aristocrat in need of a quick
beheading.
</P>
<P>
   But when consumer confidence is up, Sting's aura seems graceful
rather than pompous, his good life and smooth art enviable
properties. This year, everybody loves Sting: his latest album,
``Brand New Day'' (Interscope), is riding a slow wave to the top on
the strength of the catchy ``Arabian Nights'' tale ``Desert Rose.''
Even the critics who love to pillory him admit that this latest
effort is a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night he joined the elite club of pop stars who have
staged special events in Central Park, performing in the Great
Meadow before 20,000 fans who obtained free tickets from the chain
music store Best Buy, celebrating its entry into the New York
market. This event capped a period in which Sting became the most
sponsored star this side of the Backstreet Boys: his Web site
(www.sting.compaq.com) and summer tour received support from the
computer company Compaq, and ``Desert Rose'' gained popularity
through a video and complementary television commercial featuring
him promoting Jaguar luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed the least bothered by Best Buy's ubiquity at
Central Park; such deals do not undermine Sting's credibility
because they are utterly congruous with his image. Sting's music is
the sound of money well spent. His signature mix of torchy balladry
and uplifting dance pop can absorb almost any outside influences,
and he furnishes his songs with cosmopolitan touches like the
Algerian rai music that underlies ``Desert Rose'' or the Cuban
conjunto rhythms that occasionally enlivened Tuesday's show. It's
the old colonialist way, updated for an age of corporate, rather
than state, domination: if you love something, buy it up.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to view Sting's genre-shopping as artistically
commendable. After all, this is pop, whose essence is assimilation.
In his groundbreaking band the Police, Sting rubbed reggae against
punk to create a hybrid whose energy reflected the anxiety caused
by such miscegenation. As he matured, Sting grew suspicious of
rock's amateurishness and moved toward an ideal based in poised
musical interplay instead of conflict. His belief in a true world
music led him to form outstanding bands, including the one
appearing Tuesday. It also pushed his music toward a rootlessness
that can seem decadent.
</P>
<P>
   His cosmopolitanism illuminates when it holds that seed of
self-awareness. It's there in ``Desert Rose,'' in the amazing
second vocal by Cheb Mami, the Algerian rai vocalist who joined
Sting as an opening act at the concert. Sting, the Englishman, can
nearly match the North African's sinewy technique, but Sting's
fairy-tale lyrics about a veiled seductress are undermined by the
immediacy of Cheb Mami's voice. Performing the song with him, Sting
finally surrendered, allowing his partner to lead its final
crescendo. Humbly giving over to his inspiration, Sting proved
himself a sensitive collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened on his many jazz-inflected songs when he
let his instrumentalists break out. The drummer Manu Katche added a
suave French rap to ``Perfect Love Gone Wrong'' and agile
syncopation throughout. The keyboardist Jason Rebello stood out as
the most authoritative soloist, moving the band toward serious
swing with his confident runs. The trumpeter Chris Botti and the
guitarist Dominic Miller showed great skill but erred toward the
side of vagueness; they settled for atmospherics when they should
have shown some guts.
</P>
<P>
   That was easier to do when Sting's songs themselves had a
tougher core. He has a weakness for the poetry of rain, moon and
sun, which turns his lyrics toward banality. He's not so great at
dispensing moral lessons, either; the sentimental conclusion of
``Fill Her Up,'' for example, sapped the life out of that country
music parody, despite charming cameos by Sheryl Crow on vocals and
Jonny Lang on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon Over Bourbon Street,'' a wandering torch song in which
Sting fancied himself a vampire, and the Police's ``Roxanne,''
which allowed for an extended foray into dub reggae, had the edge
Sting could always muster. The bass player also switched to guitar
and showed off some dazzling Spanish fingerwork in ``Fragile,'' the
hymnlike final encore.
</P>
<P>
   That devilish side that leads him to play with his musical
sources and not just absorb them and to write from the perspective
of a man who might be as corrupt as he is enlightened is the source
of Sting's integrity. In this time of easy acquisition, few people
care to wonder if he always maintains it. Times will toughen,
though, and he'll need it again.

VIEWS DIFFER ON NUMBER AND NATURE OF JOB CUTS THAT MORGAN DEAL WILL
BRING 
</HEADLINE>
   by JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moments after e-mail messages went out to tens of
thousands of employees of Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan on
Wednesday morning announcing a proposed union of the two companies,
Fritz Georges was one of the few willing to discuss publicly what
many preferred to remain private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is a little concerned,'' Georges said as he leaned
against his black sedan outside J.P. Morgan's headquarters at 60
Wall St., where he works as a driver for executives. ``They don't
know who is going to be next, who is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   As company officials announced their plan for Chase Manhattan to
acquire J.P. Morgan for more than $30 billion, some industry
analysts speculated that the merged company could shed as many as
10,000 employees. Company executives, who declined to discuss
specific numbers, acknowledged that they had several duplicate
areas of business, as well as buildings and support services, that
could be eliminated. But they said their target was to save about
$500 million in employment costs, suggesting that cuts are likely
to involve no more than a few thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, to be called J.P. Morgan Chase, would have
about 100,000 employees worldwide, with roughly 18,000 based in New
York, where both companies have their headquarters. Several
thousand Chase employees in Manhattan are scheduled to move into a
45-story tower planned for Jersey City, N.J., in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have two giants, you are going to have a lot of
people with the same job titles,'' said Gary Goldstein, president
of Whitney Group, a recruiting company.
</P>
<P>
   To increase efficiency, Chase and J.P. Morgan will probably move
quickly to to cut jobs, the analysts said. Generally, the acquired
company is the one that loses the most jobs, but analysts said it
was unclear how that would play out, given J.P. Morgan's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Georges was concerned, however, Chase, as the
acquiring bank, can be expected to impose most of the cuts on J.P.
Morgan employees. ``There is an old saying that goes, `Every new
current carries its own fish,''' he said. ``People are worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Diat, a Chase Manhattan spokesman, declined to comment in
detail about potential layoffs. Company officials said the merger
could be completed by the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction is about growth,'' Diat said. ``There is
obviously some overlap between the two organizations. However,
there should be a smaller percentage of job loss in New York City
than in other mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to employees, William B. Harrison, Chase's
chief executive, was a bit more candid. ``Our merger is all about
growth, but it will also provide opportunities to increase
efficiency and reduce expenses,'' he wrote. ``We expect savings
from combining facilities and systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison added that each employee would be given consideration
based on merits. ``Where there are overlapping jobs, some positions
may need to be eliminated,'' he said. ``Any decisions will be made
fairly and objectively on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. eliminated more than 6,000 jobs. In 1995, the acquisition of
Chase by the enlarged new Chemical Bank, which assumed the Chase
name, led to the elimination of even more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those mergers, this deal involves two banks that
complement each other more than they overlap. Chase has been a
full-service bank, weakest in investment banking, while J.P. Morgan
focused on raising capital for top-tier corporations and managing
the wealth of the monied elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some natural benefit because they have different
strengths,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when Chase and Chemical combined, it was the union
of two companies with large commercial bank operations.
</P>
<P>
   But those caveats did not allay employees' concerns. Members of
the banks' support staffs are vulnerable, while investment banking
units with overlapping corporate managers, stock analysts and
Chase's European operations probably face layoffs, analysts said.
Chase's retail banking division, which has no counterpart at
Morgan, is unlikely to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   From investment bankers to data processors and executive
secretaries, the mood outside the Manhattan offices of both
companies was skittish, even as most reassured themselves that, in
view of the strong economy and healthy demand for talent, they
could manage a soft landing even if the worst happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncertainty, that's the key word,'' said one recently hired
J.P. Morgan investment banker. ``Especially in areas like foreign
exchange and derivatives, where there is a lot of overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations he had in the weeks before the planned
deal was announced, Georges said ``the secretaries of the big shots
seem the most concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know,'' he explained, ``if their bosses go, they are the
next to go.''

AFTER CHASE-MORGAN ANNOUNCEMENT, WALL STREET WONERS WHO'S NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who will be next?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question being asked on Wall Street on Wednesday
after Chase Manhattan announced that it would buy J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
for $30.9 billion. As with squads of teen-agers huddled in the gym
bleachers at a high school dance, the gossip was endless. Mid-size
firms, like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, will be the next to
pair up with larger rivals, traders said. Merrill Lynch, a
perennial takeover candidate, surely could not survive on its own.
Even powerhouses like Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter were considered vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is a familiar ritual the day a big merger is announced
and, usually, the gossip is indeed just that. ``The market is
evolving,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, an
advisory firm in New York. ``No one really knows what is going to
happen.'' Still, he added, the industry is changing and investors
and corporate clients alike could benefit from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having the top three players,'' Burnett said,
referring to the large investment banks of Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley and Merrill Lynch, ``we are going to have a top six or
seven.'' With that comes more competition. ``Why pay $30 million in
fees for a banker when you can pay less?'' he added. ``There is
room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Wall Street firms are merging is to dominate in the
lucrative global merger advisory business, as well as lead in stock
and bond offerings. That is one of the reasons Credit Suisse First
Boston agreed to acquire Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette for $11.5
billion two weeks ago. In July, UBS AG said it would buy
PaineWebber for $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But not every firm offers the same benefit. Henry McVey, a
securities and banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, said a competitor
might buy Lehman Brothers, for instance, to increase its presence
in Europe. Nearly half of Lehman's revenue is from outside the
United States, he said. Bear Stearns, for its part, earns much of
its revenue processing trades and providing capital for smaller
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming a scale game,'' McVey said. ``The bigger the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks are feeling pressure to grow, in part because
they market their expertise using so-called league tables that rank
how active they are in merger advice, initial public offerings and
other investment banking services. But being involved in a
high-profile transaction does not always guarantee big profits.
J.P. Morgan, for instance, advised Exxon Corp. in its merger with
Mobil Corp. but was paid a paltry $8 million. For a deal that size,
investment bankers can make five times that. But in the Exxon-Mobil
merger, most of the details were worked out between the chief
executives, not investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   As such, league tables are more about bragging rights than a
sign of how profitable a firm can be. ``The beauty contests are
driven by who is No. 1,'' Burnett said, referring to the
presentations investment banks make to win a client's business.
</P>
<P>
   But one risk that few people consider until after a Wall Street
merger is announced is how well the culture of any two firms will
mesh. When Credit Suisse announced two weeks ago that it was buying
DLJ, tongues wagged about whether the collegial and almost clubby
DLJ bankers would thrive at Credit Suisse, where bankers are said
to have sharper elbows. In fact, some Credit Suisse bankers at the
time privately complained that they would be hard pressed to report
to their new colleagues at Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've learned from the Salomon Smith Barney merger
is that integration is difficult,'' McVey said, referring to the
merger of Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney. ``There is the vision
and the integration, and the two can be at odds.''

ART OR ADVERTISING? EITHER WAY, SEOUL IS MESMERIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word underscore in parentheses has been
used in the 2nd graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to some newspaper systems.) 
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ A digital and media art exhibition here
features not only museum pieces but also work shown on huge
electronic screens on streets throughout the city and on walls and
pillars in subway stations.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Media(underscore)City Seoul 2000,'' includes
more than 60 pieces of interactive media art at the Seoul
Metropolitan Museum downtown and at two adjacent exhibition halls.
Visual works by internationally known artists also appear randomly
on 42 electronic Jumbotron screens throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``A city that's so dynamic and constantly growing _ that's the
landscape,'' said Barbara London, an associate curator at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York and coordinator of one of the
exhibition sites.
</P>
<P>
   Works by Nam June Paik and 29 other artists from around the
world are inserted between advertisements and news briefings on the
Jumbotron screens. A Yahoo! Korea commercial, for example, is
followed by ``102,'' a brief visual presentation of scenes of Seoul
by the French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster in which he
stresses certain colors that to him characterize each scene.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the 13 subway installations, the German artist Bernd
Halbherr wrapped panoramic photographs around pillars in stations
in the downtown area. The photos, with the overall title
``Transplantation,'' depict the street scenes just above, creating
the illusion that the viewer has been transported to the ground
level.
</P>
<P>
   Another subway display, ``Subway Comic Strip'' by two South
Korean artists, Kang Young Min and Lee Dong Ki, is a horizontal
series of colorful and playful images in contrast to the sober
functionality of the subway passageways.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the country's population, or 16 million
people, are Internet users, so South Korea is no stranger to the
digital revolution. Yet exposure to digital art has not been
widespread, said Song Misook, general artistic director of the
exhibition. By using a wide range of public venues, the organizers
hope to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has a short history when it comes to media art,'' Song
said. ``We put together a program that could expose and satisfy a
wide range of people. It's a textbook exhibition that tells people:
`this is what media art is about.'''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition aims to get viewers not only to see but also to
``touch, experience and become one with the works of art,'' said Yu
Hyun Jung, a computer design professor at Dongduk Women's
University who has created a work for children for one of the
viewing spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cathartic User Interface'' by the Brooklyn-based artist, Perry
Hoberman consists of 39 keyboards mounted on a 12-foot-high
vertical frame that serves as both viewing screen and target.
Spectators throw rubber balls at error messages that flash on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We insist,'' says one message. ``Click OK to agree to
something that you probably won't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   If a viewer hits it with a ball, a new message says: ``Warning:
you can try to complete this operation. But if you do, your
computer will probably burst into flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoberman described his piece this way: ``It's kind of a cross
between a drive-in movie and an arcade game. The inspiration for
the piece was really the daily frustration one has in working with
digital technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the main exhibition hall is a high-tech journey into
children's fantasy based on Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' Danny Rozin, a professor of interactive
telecommunication at New York University, said: ``What's amazing
about children is that they have imagination and don't need
structure. They intuitively understand, whereas grown-ups will just
stand and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Seoul appear to welcome the explosion of art in their
everyday surroundings. On the sidewalk of a major intersection in
downtown Seoul one recent evening, Lee Mi Ok, a 24-year-old college
student, and her boyfriend, Hong Sung Hee, a 28-year-old office
worker, seemed absorbed by three Jumbotron billboards but uncertain
whether they were seeing advertisements or art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here for close to an hour, but I don't think I saw
any works of art on the electronic billboards,'' said Hong, adding,
``I don't think I'd be able to recognize them even if I did see
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee admitted that she had not visited the exhibition proper but
said that she welcomed the concept of artists reaching out to the
public. ``I would love to see more works of art in the streets and
subways, where many people can enjoy them together. It would be
like a breath of fresh air.''

BLAIR CALLS ON PROTESTERS TO LIFT BLOCKADE OF OIL REFINERIES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Facing the most serious challenge to his leadership,
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday night called on protesters
to lift their virtual siege of oil refineries and storage depots,
saying their actions were paralyzing the country and endangering
lives.
</P>
<P>
   After a second day of emergency meetings at 10 Downing Street
aimed at easing blockades that have left 90 percent of the
country's filling stations dry, Blair grimly told a news conference
that despite the pledge he had made on Tuesday of showing progress
within 24 hours, the situation had only worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, by refusing to accede to the protesters' demands to cut
fuel taxes, has increasingly become the target of the protesters,
and on Wednesday night he upped the stakes by angrily denouncing
the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of these blockades and this intimidation, real
damage is now being done to real people,'' he said. Doctors,
nurses, police officers and firefighters are having problems
getting to their jobs and ``lives are at risk if those people can't
get to work,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated his determination to resist pleas for a
sudden cut in fuel taxes, which are the highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the protesters' feelings,'' he said, ``and I repeat
that I understand the real difficulties people have over the high
price of petrol, it cannot be right to force a change in policy by
these means.'' Any government that did, he added, would lose all
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Although both businesses and labor unions have called for an end
to the protests, the opposition Tories on Wednesday joined in the
attacks on Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ancram, chairman of the Conservative Party, scorned
Blair's characterization of the picketers as ``an insult to the
many decent, law-abiding people conducting lawful protests.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the real problem was ``a prime minister in
panic,'' Ancram said: ``Last night Tony Blair confidently strode
into a press conference and said, `Give me 24 hours and I'll solve
the fuel crisis.' Twenty-four hours later, he skulked back into the
same room and admitted the crisis had got far worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil trucks resumed limited deliveries on Wednesday, but the flow
was estimated to be less than 15 percent of normal volume. Almost
all of it was designated for the police, fire departments,
hospitals and ambulances, rather than the nation's gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The Petrol Retailers Association warned that it could be three
weeks before Britain was back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The protests intensified Wednesday across the country, with
pickets monitoring the rigs leaving oil company properties and
creeping convoys of truckers creating miles of traffic jams. At
some refineries, drivers refused to take on oil either out of
sympathy with the protesters or in fear at possible retaliation
from them.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, which caught the Blair government off guard, have
been mounted by truck owners, farmers and self-employed workers
claiming that rising fuel prices _ gasoline costs about $4.37 a
gallon _ are putting them out of business. Supermarkets reported
empty shelves from panic buying, the Royal Mail said it could not
guarantee deliveries, banks said they were running short of cash
and many schools closed because they had no bus service.
</P>
<P>
   The National Health Service was put on ``red alert'' _ in which
it is supposed to prepare for treating only emergency cases _ and
the Ministry of Defense on Wednesday night deployed 80 oil trucks
at strategic points around the country to deliver fuel for
emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the severe inconveniences, the protests continued to
attract substantial sympathy from the public and to focus anger on
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Blair say he wouldn't cave in to the protesters, but
he should know that 90 percent of the public are with them, not
him,'' said Dave Cummings, a taxi driver in Edinburgh who said he
backed the movement even though he had only a half tank of gas left
on Wednesday morning and no likelihood of a refill. ``Here we have
all this oil in the North Sea, and we're paying the highest petrol
prices in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons why gasoline is so expensive here is the
76.2 percent tax on gasoline, about triple the rate in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   After Blair made his high-risk pledge to get the fuel situation
``on the way back to normal'' within 24 hours, protesters reacted
with defiance of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair said last night this will all be over in 24 hours,
and we want to ram those words down his throat,'' said Julie
Charles, a truck owner from Yeovil, Somerset, in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is determined to appear decisive, aware of the power of
popular protest in Britain to bring down governments. A so-called
winter of discontent in 1979 began the fall of the Labor
administration of Prime Minister James Callaghan, who was perceived
as failing to get a grip on the wave of strikes that brought
Britain to its knees. ``We are all bound by history,'' Education
Secretary David Blunkett said pointedly on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blair summoned oil company executives on Wednesday morning to a
second blunt-spoken session in Downing Street, and the executives
emerged saying they would do everything they could to resume normal
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   They had argued that they were unwilling to order drivers to
make shipments because of fear for their safety. ``We will be
stepping this up as soon as possible to get back to normal, `` said
Shell Oil's chief executive, Malcolm Brinder, reading from a joint
statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were largely incident-free until Wednesday, when
the police were ordered to clear routes for oil trucks and arrested
some demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Evans, of the Association of Chief Police Officers,
said he had received reports of intimidation and was offering to
put constables in the cabs of trucks if necessary.

   The thrill of victory, the agony of getting voted off the island
amid tiki &QL;
</P>
<P>
   torches.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can experience it all again as ``Survivor'' (otherwise
known as ``Rich's Lessons in How to Eliminate Your Competitors and
Gain Riches 101'') returns for 13 straight nights in reruns
starting Friday at 9 p.m. on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough of a fix? Buy the book ``Survivor: The Ultimate
Game'' by Mark Burnett with Martin Dugard (TV Books, 240 pages,
paperback; $17.95). Burnett is the executive producer of the show
and is reportedly selecting contestants here in L.A. for ``Survivor
II,'' which takes place in the Australian outback and premieres
after the Super Bowl in late January. The book promises to ``take
readers behind the scenes, share stories not seen on any broadcast
and explore what it takes to survive on Pulau Tiga.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reruns, we suggest you study the moves of ultimate
million- dollar survivor Richard Hatch. You may not win any cash,
but you might be able to get rid of a pesky office rival. Wonder
how the sales of tiki torches are doing?

 LONDON: if necessary.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both business and labor groups condemned the protests and called
for their immediate end.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Trades Union Congress said the
demonstrations were an unlawful attempt to bully the government.
``They must not succeed,'' the statement said. ``The blockades are
not a legitimate form of industrial action but a challenge to
democracy and crude attempt to hold the country to ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of
British Industry warned that many businesses were being hurt and
said that while they sympathized with the pleas for lower taxes,
the government must not give in to the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister's promise to get fuel flowing from depots
must be delivered rapidly, using whatever means are available,''
said Chris Humphries, the director general of the chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, who brought the
taxes to their current level, said, ``We will not fall for the
quick fix and the irresponsible short-termism of making tax policy
this afternoon because of blockades this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the increased revenues were being used for much needed
investment in hospitals and schools and in transportation and
public services. He also argued that while Britain had higher fuel
taxes than its European neighbors, it enjoyed lower rates of income
tax and business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party leader, William Hague, said, ``The whole
country has now paid the price for having an arrogant out-of-touch
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused however, to endorse an immediate reduction in the
gasoline tax, saying only that if the Tories returned to power, it
would be a ``strong candidate'' for a cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Tories' unease may stem from the fact that when they were in
government, they introduced a ``fuel-duty escalator'' that
committed the Treasury to raise the tax on gasoline and diesel
annually above the inflation rate. Though it was put forward as a
means of encouraging conservation, it became notorious with
motorists, and Brown ended the escalator in March.
</P>
<P>
   Overall taxes on fuel have continued to rise, however, and Brown
failed to anticipate the anger they would draw from consumers as
crude oil prices also rose. What is a current windfall for the
Treasury could become a liability for Labor as it prepares for a
national election expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Riddell, the chief political writer of The Times of
London, predicted, however, that a tough response from Blair would
limit any electoral damage. ``This is a test of the Government's
will,'' he said, ``not of its political future.''

   MONROE, Wash. _ Gov. George W. Bush aggressively challenged Vice
President Al Gore on one of his signature issues Wednesday, calling
Gore's commitment to the environment into question by saying that
the Clinton administration had seriously neglected the upkeep of
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed spending an additional $3.75 billion in federal
money over five years to repair and maintain them. And he framed
that plan in terms of his own love of the outdoors, which he
extolled from the wooded banks of a salmon-filled river here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this administration, the parks are in worse shape than
ever before,'' said Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
``Sewage flows untreated into the lakes and streams of Yellowstone
National Park. Civil War relics have been soaked by a leaky roof at
Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years,'' Bush added, ``this administration has
talked of environmentalism while our national parks are
crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not stop there. He also lashed into Gore for not saying
whether he supported breaching hydroelectric dams in Washington
that have hindered spawning salmon. Environmentalists are pushing
hard for such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes it, saying that technology should be developed to
save both the dams and the salmon, a position supported by many
prominent Democratic officials in the state for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has courted the support of nationwide environmental
groups, has said he would convene a summit meeting of people on
different sides of the issue to discuss possible resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's refused to say whether he would breach the dams or not,''
Bush said Wednesday, after first emphasizing his concern for
salmon. He was standing on a piece of private property that, with
government aid, had established a kind of salmon nursery to feed
and fatten the fish and increase their chances of surviving and
reproducing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the people of this good state vote,'' Bush said, ``I
think you deserve an answer. I think you need to know where he
stands on this important environmental issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had spent much of the past few weeks of the presidential
campaign either on the defensive or immersed in subject matters
unrelated to his chosen themes. But his strongly worded remarks
were a clear attempt to seize the offensive against Gore and leave
the vice president with some explaining to do. Bush was also
tapping into issues of special concern to residents of Washington,
the West Coast state that his aides feel he has the best chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the Bush campaign would like to do well enough
along the West Coast, which Gore is counting on winning, to force
the vice president to spend precious time and money here. After
Washington, Bush was scheduled to spend two days in California.
</P>
<P>
   The environment is especially important to voters in this region
and one reason they often tilt Democratic. But Bush has been
devoting this entire week trying to blunt Democrats' typical
advantages on health care, the environment and education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said Wednesday that Bush's environmental record in
Texas contradicted his claims. The Sierra Club, a liberal advocacy
group, echoed that assessment, quickly issuing a statement that
expressed deep skepticism about the genuineness of Bush's
commitment to national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign and the Sierra Club noted that Texas ranks
near the bottom of states according to several environmental
measures, including spending on parks. Gore's aides further noted
that Bush supports oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, a wilderness area that Gore has pledged to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laughable that Bush would reinvent himself as an
environmentalist,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides took issue with Bush's portrait of a national park
system in decline. Literature distributed by the Bush campaign said
that the Clinton administration, for the coming fiscal year, had
requested a 22 percent decrease in financing for maintenance of
national parks, to $180 million from $230 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's aides said that those figures ignored the fact that
the administration had developed other sources of revenue, outside
the appropriation process, for the maintenance of parks. They also
said that the administration was spending much more on parks than
the last Republican administration _ that of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the spending was too focused on converting more and
more private land into public parks and that, as a result, there
was a roughly $5 billion backlog of necessary maintenance work in
parks. He said that he would eliminate this with the additional
spending he was proposing, which he cast as a cultural and moral
imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national parks contain America's memories and America's
grandeur,'' Bush said in a 13-minute speech rife with poetic
flourishes. He read it from teleprompters, an incongruous addition
to the sylvan surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said that he also wanted to increase, to $38
million a year from $18 million, the federal spending on scientific
surveys and monitoring of the land and water in national parks.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that while he welcomed federal responsibility for
national parks, he felt that local wilderness areas and natural
resources should be managed by local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the roots and the depth of his environmental
sensitivities, he talked about his ranch in a remote, unspoiled
patch of central Texas and of the many birds there.
</P>
<P>
   And he was close to rhapsodic in his praise of the salmon being
nurtured in the ponds of the nursery along the Skykomish River that
he was visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us,'' he said, ``these fish are a wonder.''

THE RECLUSIVE BEACH BOY REVISITS A BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Brian Wilson fans never expected to see him onstage
performing the Beach Boys' groundbreaking 1966 album, ``Pet
Sounds,'' from beginning to end. He made the album in isolation
after he stopped touring with the Beach Boys, working in the studio
oblivious to commercial prospects or to whether the elaborately
orchestrated songs could ever be played in concert. Yet there he
was on Sunday night at the Jones Beach Theater with a band and
orchestra behind him, introducing ``Pet Sounds'' as ``about 40
minutes of really nice music.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that and more. ``Pet Sounds'' is more touching now than
it was in the experimental heyday of 1960s rock. It was the work of
a 23-year-old songwriter who was painfully diffident and bursting
with ambition at the same time. Wilson sang about how hard it was
to find love, friendship and a kindred soul: ``Every time I get the
inspiration to go change things around/No one wants to help me look
for places where new things might be found,'' he sang in ``I Just
Wasn't Made for These Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The tunes don't move steadily like most pop songs; they pause
and ruminate in orchestral interludes as if unsure how to continue.
But the complex tempo changes, eccentric orchestrations and soaring
vocal harmonies are the work of a songwriter who purposely defied
the conventions he had already mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pet Sounds'' was part of the second set in a two-part concert
that concentrated on Wilson's 1960s songs. Until the finale, with
ebullient early Beach Boys songs like ``I Get Around'' and ``Fun,
Fun, Fun,'' many of the songs brought out Wilson's plaintive side.
In ``Until I Die'' and ``In My Room,'' the lyrics confessed to an
abiding loneliness while the music created a refuge of overarching
harmony. Once Wilson shared vocal harmonies with his brothers in
the Beach Boys; now he shares them with fans onstage and in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   His voice is not the pure instrument it was. It strains and
sometimes misses notes; it has been a long time since the 1960s.
Wilson, famous for stage fright in the past, was not entirely at
ease, but he cheerfully introduced most songs and sometimes pointed
to his heart or pointed a finger to highlight a favorite passage.
Songs like ``Caroline, No,'' ``Don't Talk'' and ``I Know There's an
Answer'' took on extra poignancy from the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is touring with musicians who are scholars of his music.
As on his 1999 tour, the core band is the Wondermints, who are
dedicated to recreating lapidary 1960s pop; they took along many of
the instruments Wilson used on ``Pet Sounds,'' including banjo,
bass harmonica, bicycle horn, alto flute and tannerin, the
instrument actually used on ``Good Vibrations'' and ``I Just Wasn't
Made for These Times'' because it is easier to control than the
theremin.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra cushioned the music with strings and filled in the
interludes and unlikely transitions that Wilson had devised for
brass and woodwinds. It also opened the concert with a symphonic
medley, arranged by Wilson's occasional collaborator, Van Dyke
Parks, that strung together well-known and obscure Beach Boys songs
as a kind of lost Hollywood epic. Sometimes it teased out inner
voices, and sometimes it unfurled the melodies like grand
silhouettes against a Southern California sunset.

IN CHALLENGE, IRAQI JET FLEW OVER SAUDI DESERT, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Iraqi fighter jet flew into Saudi Arabian
airspace last week in what officials here suspect was an attempt to
provoke a confrontation with the United States on the eve of the
U.N. summit meeting in New York, State Department and military
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The jet, passing through a ``no flight'' zone over southern
Iraq, darted over a thinly populated desert in Saudi Arabia on the
morning of Sept. 4 and quickly left, the officials said.
Nevertheless, the flight heightened what officials here described
as a sense that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is determined to
test U.S. resolve.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British jets that patrol the southern ``no flight''
zone, below the 32nd parallel, were not flying that day and were
unable to scramble quickly enough to challenge the Iraqi plane
before it left, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi jets have entered the southern zone more than 150 times
since the United States and Britain launched four nights of air and
missile strikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi jets have also veered into Iranian airspace, but
commanders at the Pentagon said it was the first time an Iraqi had
flown over Saudi Arabia in at least a decade, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the incident, the Iraqi air force
dispersed its aircraft in central Iraq, evidently to protect them
from a potential retaliatory attack, the officials said. Those
aircraft have since returned to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does lead people to believe he was trying to provoke a
confrontation,'' a senior administration official said, ``and was
taking steps to protect himself if that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not respond, fearing that new airstrikes
could play into Saddam's strategy of sowing division among the
United States and other members of the Security Council. But they
warned that U.S. forces remained prepared to counter any
threatening military moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously very careful not to overplay our hand,'' the
senior official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tensions over Iraq are running high. Baghdad has steadfastly
refused to cooperate with a new team of weapons inspectors or with
other U.N. humanitarian efforts. Iraq has also sharply criticized
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey for allowing the United States and
Britain to base aircraft in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have sought to counter Iraq's
diplomatic efforts to end the sanctions imposed at the outset of
the Persian Gulf War in 1990 by citing Iraqi intransigence and
threats as evidence of Saddam's hostile intentions.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright blamed Saddam for shortages of food and medicine, saying,
``He is the one that is victimizing his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright went on to make an oblique reference to the Iraqis
``violating the no-fly zone and the airspace of neighboring
countries.'' The officials confirmed Wednesday that she was
referring to the flight over Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials in Washington did not respond to requests for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks on Tuesday, Albright said the administration had
ruled out the use of force to press Saddam to accept new weapons
inspectors. But she reiterated the administration's warnings that
the United States was prepared to act if Iraq threatened its
neighbors, attacked the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq _ where
there is another ``no flight'' zone _ or rebuilt its weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had placed its forces in the region on a
higher state of alert even before the overflight.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who confirmed the flight declined to discuss the
incident in detail. They declined to identify the type of Iraqi
aircraft and the exact distance it flew inside Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said such a flight by a single Iraqi fighter posed
little military threat to Saudi Arabia or to U.S. forces stationed
at Prince Sultan Air Base, southeast of Riyadh, the capital. In the
past, Iraq has flown into the ``no flight'' zones in an effort to
lure U.S. jets into areas with surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this as an attempt to bait us,'' another senior
administration official said. ``We were very careful not to take
the bait.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the Iraqi
flight followed a pattern and appeared to be intended to challenge
not only the United States but also Saudi support for the ``no
flight'' zone over the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``To probe resolve is something he does again and again and
again _ and in fairly adventurous ways,'' he said of Saddam.

FRANCE WARNS IRAQ ON WEAPONS INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ France has warned Iraq not to expect any
weakening of the Security Council's determination to send U.N.
inspectors back into Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction
before sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, who has criticized
the sanctions, nonetheless said Wednesday that he told Iraq's
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, on Monday that it would be ``a
very serious mistake'' to think that an erosion of the council's
resolve would lead it to lift the sanctions, which were imposed
when Iraqi forces occupied Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I in fact met with Tariq Aziz the day before yesterday, and I
told him the only solution for Iraq was to comply with Resolution
1284 and to cooperate,'' Vedrine said during a breakfast interview
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which the council adopted Dec. 17, created a new
arms inspection plan for Iraq. The previous inspection system
collapsed in December 1998, when American and British warplanes
bombed Baghdad to punish President Saddam Hussein for failing to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive for Baghdad, the resolution lifted a ceiling on
the amount of oil that it could sell abroad to buy food and other
essentials, and it also relaxed controls on the import of some
other supplies. Otherwise, the economic sanctions were kept in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 15 Security Council members voted for the
resolution at the time. But France joined Russia, China and
Malaysia in abstaining, prompting the Iraqis to infer that support
for sanctions was waning.
</P>
<P>
   The split emboldened Iraq to reject the council's resolution.
U.N. officials have been concerned that Iraq keeps balking in hopes
of forcing a further dilution or even lifting of sanctions. Baghdad
has refused to allow arms inspectors back into the country, though
the new inspection commission's executive chairman, Hans Blix, says
team members are ready to begin inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz recently met several other diplomats besides Vedrine at the
United Nations to assess the Security Council's mood. But Ewen
Buchanan, Blix's spokesman, confirmed that ``Aziz made no effort to
come near Blix.''
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine, after meeting with Aziz, said he foresaw no short-term
change in Iraq's refusal to comply. ``I regret that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters Wednesday that France had helped broker the
1999 resolution and had abstained from the vote because the
resolution could have been improved. France, which maintains
commercial and diplomatic relations with Iraq, continues to abide
by the resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister Wednesday called the sanctions
``primitive,'' and ``a cruel measure'' in their impact on ordinary
Iraqis, and ``completely absurd'' economically.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Vedrine said, ``we take the security concerns of
Iraq's neighbors very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah,
urged in a speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday that
pressure be maintained on Iraq, which, he said, continued to reveal
``nonpeaceful intentions and policies of aggression'' toward its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' he said, ``it is regrettable that for 10 years now
the government of Iraq has failed to meet its obligations under
Security Council resolutions.''

   HUGHES WINS SATELLITE WORK
</P>
<P>
   New ICO, the satellite communications company soon to merge into
Craig O. McCaw's ambitious Teledesic satellite venture, announced
Wednesday that it had reached an agreement with Hughes Space &AMP;
Communications Co. on plans for Hughes to produce 14 satellites.
The agreement includes three new satellites and modifications to 11
spacecraft that Hughes had in production when ICO Global
Communications, New ICO's predecessor, filed for bankruptcy just
over a year ago. McCaw led a group that brought the company out of
bankruptcy for $1.2 billion and forged plans for a satellite system
capable of offering a range of data and Internet services in
addition to the voice traffic ICO Global had originally envisioned.
The network is now slated to begin operations in 2003. Hughes said
the satellite design is one of the most complex ever undertaken.

technology. The MongoMusic.com Web site allows consumers to sample
music and create their own ``stations'' of favorite tunes. Founded
in June 1999, the company was originally financed by Nokia and
Sony. Microsoft officials said they found MongoMusic attractive
because of its history of strong relationships with the recording
industry. With the acquisition of MongoMusic, Microsoft is
expanding its MSN network of Web sites, which already includes the
WindowsMedia.com music site. The value of the acquisition was not
disclosed, but industry sources estimated it at $65 million. &QL;

San Francisco. The presentation was in reply to the brief filed
last week by the Recording Industry Association of America, the
plaintiff in the case. Napster, based in Redwood City, Calif., is
seeking to overturn a lower court decision in July that threatens
to shut down the company by blocking major-label songs from being
traded on the Napster service. Napster's presentation contends that
its service does not diminish the value of the plaintiff's
copyrights, insisting rather that the RIAA is trying to maintain
control over music distribution. Oral arguments in the case are
scheduled for Oct. 2.

Officials said the deal will give fans access to daily NBA and WNBA
highlights as well as archived NBA highlights. In May, Intel, the
world's largest computer chip maker, and Excalibur Technologies, an
Internet company, announced that they would form a new company,
Convera Corp., to enable owners of valuable content produce and

the third quarter of this year. StarMedia, a New York-based company
that aims at Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking audiences around the
world, said the job cuts were expected to generate savings of $15
million to $20 million in 2001 and would enable it to record a

PIANIST TOYS WITH THE AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 WAYNE LEE GAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Van Cliburn has about 14 grand pianos _ nobody's made
an exact count _ in his Fort Worth mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Leng Tan has about 14 toy pianos _ once again, nobody's
counted exactly _ in her New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   You might say she's the Cliburn of the toy piano.
</P>
<P>
   A student of renowned piano teacher Adele Marcus at Juilliard,
Tan became interested in the toy piano in the early 1980s when she
came under the spell of the late great American avant-gardist John
Cage, who had written a Suite for Toy Piano in 1948. Since then,
she's become a leading and enthusiastic advocate of the miniature
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   She'll bring that enthusiasm to Dallas on Sept. 21 when she
presents her ``Ode to Schroeder'' program at McKinney Avenue
Contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty aggressive little instrument,'' she said in a
recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Tan points out two tremendous advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``From practicing the toy piano, because of the difficulty of
the action, my fingertip control became extremely refined,'' she
says. ``I can do four different shades of pianississimo on the real
piano.''
</P>
<P>
   And the instrument is not, as one might suspect, limited in
repertoire; she can play significant excerpts from 18th-century
works and works of Beethoven, she points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually closer in sound to Beethoven's piano than the
modern concert grand,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For her Dallas appearance, she'll perform on two toy pianos _ an
upright and a made-to-specification ``grand,'' _ presenting works
of Glass, Cage, the Beatles and Beethoven, including a synchronized
play-along with a performance of the opening section of Beethoven's
Piano Sonata Opus 2, No. 3 played with Charles Schulz's cartoon
character Schroeder from the animated Peanuts classic ``Play it
Again, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll perform, at various points in the concert, on separate
toy pianos, on both pianos together, on toy percussion and a toy
accordion. And she'll deliver plenty of what she calls ``sit-down
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as way-out as it sounds,'' she says of the toy piano
as a concert instrument. ``Your only limit is your imagination.''
</P>

 &HT;    Jones to run final relay rounds only
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ To aid Marion Jones' quest for five gold medals, U.S.
coaches plan to rest her in the early rounds of the relays and run
her in the finals only.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is entered in the 100 meters, the 200 and the long jump,
along with the 400-meter and 1,600-meter relays. The first rounds
and semifinals of the relays are Sept. 29, the same day as the
final in the long jump. The finals for the relays are Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're concerned about (her wearing down),'' women's
coach Karen Dennis said. ``You hope her legs are fine, and we'll
watch as she goes along. That's why she'll only run the final
rounds. Marion is a big, strong girl, and she has the talent and
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is staying in a private residence here to avoid the
distractions of the Olympic village. To further reduce the hoopla,
she is refusing to grant interviews before her competition begins
next Friday with the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene entered in just one
individual event each, the men's coaches don't have to protect a
superstar athlete in the relay rounds. Johnson is definitely
running the 1,600-meter relay and Greene the 400 relay, but coach
John Chaplin won't decide on the other members until after the
individual 100 and 400-meter races.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has been outspoken about desiring to run with HSI
teammates Jon Drummond, Curtis Johnson and Bernard Williams.
``Everyone's got some say, but I have final say,'' Chaplin said.
</P>
<P>
   HAMSTRING TWINGE FOR JOHNSON
</P>
<P>
   Allen Johnson, defending Olympic champ in the 110-meter hurdles,
pulled up with a twinge in his hamstring during a final tuneup over
the weekend. Johnson claims he was playing it safe, but he ran in
an informal meet here Thursday, and coaches want to see how he
recovers.
</P>
<P>
   SALUTE TO CAPTAINS
</P>
<P>
   Defending high jump gold medalist Charles Austin and four-time
Olympian Joetta Clark were picked as captains for the U.S. track
team. Austin set an Olympic record of 7 feet, 10 inches in 1996 in
Atlanta.

<P>
   WINIFRED, Mont. _ The federal government calls this stretch of
the Upper Missouri River ``a priceless remnant of primitive
America.''
</P>
<P>
   So why has the idea of permanent protection for this remote
quarter of the prairies, little changed from the days of Lewis and
Clark, inspired the kind of not-in-my-backyard animosity usually
attached to prisons and garbage dumps?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, expressed loud and clear by ranchers here, says a
lot about Montana _ and even more about the resistance to a plan
for conservation of public lands, in which President Clinton, in
his final months in office, is trying to rival President Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already set aside more land as national monuments in
the lower 48 states than any previous president. But as the
administration eyes fresh targets, including the rugged lands that
surround the Upper Missouri, it is running into stiff opposition
from people who regard monuments not as a legacy, but as an
imposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much land is enough?'' asked John Witt, a state
legislator, adding his voice to the anger expressed at a hastily
organized meeting at the Winifred school. ``America has 500 million
acres of public land already. It's a little like, `Are we a state,
or are we the District of Washington?'''
</P>
<P>
   The list of new or expanded monuments by Clinton stands at 11,
and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has signaled that the
designation process is not over.
</P>
<P>
   At issue here is a 149-mile stretch of the Missouri and rugged
lands that plunge steeply to the water, known as the Missouri
Breaks. The area is among eight proposed monuments that
administration officials say could be designated before Clinton
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect has won applause from environmental groups. But in
Western states like Montana, where many residents regard monument
status as a potential barrier to the land on which they depend,
feelings against the plans are running so high that administration
officials say that Clinton is likely to postpone most if not all
announcements until after Election Day, to avoid hurting the
chances of Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that Secretary Babbitt and
President Clinton want to lock up as many environmentally sensitive
areas as they can before they shut the lights off,'' an aide to a
Western Democratic lawmaker said. ``And what they're running up
against is that in the rural West, these folks are clinging to a
way of life that they would lose through these monument
designations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, where polls show the public to be split on the
issue, one glimpse of the debate can be seen in what might be
called a battle of slogans.
</P>
<P>
   With his 1996 book ``Undaunted Courage,'' the historian and
author Stephen Ambrose helped to draw attention to the Upper
Missouri, virtually the only stretch of the 2,700-mile-long river
that has remained undeveloped in the nearly 200 years since
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery
used the Missouri as their main water route.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the least inhabited, most precious part of the Lower
48,'' Ambrose has said in advocating national monument status.
``It's ours to preserve for our progeny. It would be sacrilegious
not to.''
</P>
<P>
   A very different view has been expressed by the Montana
Stockgrowers' Association, a group of cattlemen who say that
ranchers are perfectly capable of preserving the area themselves,
as they have since homesteaders first settled the land. The
organization calls its group Undaunted Stewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the river as a sidewalk that runs in front of your
house,'' said one member, Matt Knox, whose 28,000-acre ranch
northeast of Winifred would be in the monument.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Montana land proposed for monument status, 400,000
acres in the current draft, is already in public hands, controlled
by the Bureau of Land Management. A small part is privately held,
and while those owners would be permitted to remain, many fear that
the government's aim is to buy them out. And though Babbitt has
assured local residents that grazing and hunting would be allowed
to continue, many worry that they will find themselves enmeshed in
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, among the many Republicans who have
denounced what they call a land grab is the Republican
vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, a native of Wyoming who
has accused the administration of misusing its authority and acting
``willy-nilly all over the West'' in imposing new restrictions on
the use of public land.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt says that he has tried hard to seek consensus in
communities that would be affected by any plan. In many cases, he
said, the administration has agreed to compromises, often by
allowing hunting and grazing to continue even after a monument has
been established.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of saying the administration would defer to
local wishes, particularly in Montana, where the proposed monument
has met such strong opposition. And Babbitt insisted that the
reason for the administration's haste reflected less a quest for a
political legacy than a quest to save land that might one day be
overrun by development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The empty spaces are filling up all over the West,'' Babbitt
said, arguing that in Clinton's presidency, the need to protect
land had become ``much more urgent than it was, say, 50 years ago
when almost no one was on it.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Montana and other states that would be affected by
any presidential declaration are rival visions not only about the
federal government but also about who knows what is best for the
land.
</P>
<P>
   In southeast Oregon, plans for a possible Steens Mountain
monument have been tangled by a county law that requires no net
loss of private land. And in northwest Colorado, powerful
sentiments have been kindled by a proposed 280,000-acre Vermillion
National Monument, on grasslands long used for grazing.
</P>
<P>
   Similar controversies have arisen over other proposals,
including the possible expansion of Craters of the Moon National
Monument in Idaho, which, like the Vermillion proposal, is now
awaiting Clinton's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Steens Mountain and the Missouri Breaks, the other
areas under review by the Interior Department as national monuments
include the Carrizo Plains, in west-central California; the Santa
Rosa Mountains, near Palm Springs, Calif.; an expansion of the
Colorado National Monument, and, in a development that has not yet
been publicized, a possible offshore monument designed to protect
the coral reefs of St. John's in the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The authority to establish national monuments is spelled out in
the Antiquities Act of 1906, which authorizes the president to
designate such areas in order to protect ``objects of historic and
scientific interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used that mandate broadly, setting aside the 1.7
million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in
southwest Utah, for example, as part of a strategy intended to
sidestep opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress to any
steps that would add new restrictions to development on public
land. An act of Congress is required for the designation of a
national park or national forest, steps that could carry somewhat
more protection than monument status.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the founder of the national park system, Roosevelt, set aside
more public land as protected areas than anyone else. Since
January, Clinton has set aside 10 monuments in order to protect,
for example, areas that include a forest of giant redwoods in
California and the last undammed stretch of the Columbia River in
eastern Washington. A Republican-led attempt to stop the effort by
stripping the president of his monument-designation status failed
in the Senate on a 50 to 49 vote in July.
</P>
<P>
   A monument designation could not be undone by a new president,
though it could be overturned by an act of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the battles, the one raging over the Missouri Breaks may
be the most divisive. Even Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat,
has so far remained neutral, in apparent deference to local
sensitivities, while Sen. Conrad Burns and the state's sole
congressman, Rick Hill, both Republicans, have expressed adamant
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who live on the land, and who have their
culture on the land, usually make the best decisions for the
land,'' Burns said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists argue that the river and surrounding land needs
national monument status, in part to preserve habitat for species
like the big-horned sheep, antelope and elk. And with the Lewis and
Clark bicentennial approaching, beginning in 2003, they say it is
also important that new campgrounds and visitor centers be put in
place to help accommodate the expected visitors, with many floating
down the slow, shallow river in canoes, beneath stunning rock
formations and the dazzling White Cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity,
particularly not knowing what the next presidential administration
will be like,'' said Dave Dittloff, conservation director of the
Montana Wildlife Federation. As the stretch of the Missouri becomes
better known, ``recreational issues are going to get bad,''
Dittloff said, ``and development issues are going to get worse and
worse.''

BUSH TALKS UP SALMON RESTORATION, NATIONAL PARKS IMPROVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY and CHRIS McGANN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE _ Visiting a region he described as a ``battleground of
environmental war and environmental policy,'' GOP presidential
nominee George W. Bush Wednesday used a cattle farm as backdrop to
extol the joys of nature, praise salmon restoration projects and
pledge a $4.9 billion program to improve upkeep of national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to his ranch near Waco that is his pride and place of
privacy, Bush talked of nature as a source of ``serenity and
peace'' and quoted Theodore Roosevelt on ``the value of silent
places unworn by man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own your own land, every day is Earth Day,'' Bush said
against the back drop of trees, the Skykomish River and the Cadman
Sky River gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor went on to say: ``I love to fish. ... I want
our land to be as pristine as it can possibly be.'' He praised
community-based salmon restoration efforts and pledged to back the
Salmon Recovery Funding Board's $20 million request for local
programs in the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also repeated that he won't breach Snake River dams to
restore salmon runs, and that he is a defender of private property
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to treat Washington as a poltical battleground,
even though it rejected his father in the 1988 and 1992 elections
and gave only 37 percent of its vote to GOP presidential nominee
Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived beside the Skykomish River, just as a morning sun
began to burn away the fog, Bush was making his seventh Washington
visit in the past 14 months, and his third foray into Snohomish
County.
</P>
<P>
   His running mate, Dick Cheney is tentatively slated to campaign
in the state next Monday, and Bush will return in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has recently taken a beating in the national media for
verbal gaffes and the missteps of his campaign. Wednesday, he spoke
to about 100 invited guests and was not made available to answer
reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   But he made a positive impression on leaders of salmon recovery
projects who sat with him beside Haskell Slough and explained how
the restored channel provides a home to young salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had done his homework. What I heard today is what I believe
in, reaching out to private landowners in the cause of
conservation,'' said Darlene Madenwald, former chairwoman of the
Washington Environmental Council.
</P>
<P>
   John Sayre, executive director of Northwest Chinook Recovery,
added: ``We talked the same language. He was genuinely interested.
We talked about the recovery of Texas redfish, one of the great
fish recovery stories in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Puget Sound basin, where chinook salmon have been listed
as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, 53 percent of land
is privately owned. Streams flowing through private land constitute
the prime habitat for coho salmon, a major user of the Haskell
Slough habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., termed it ``a major step forward''
that Bush took the time to visit the slough and witness the success
of a project backed by landowners and paid for by state and federal
agencies and Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us care for things that we see _ I'm convinced that
over the next four years we will have very strong support from the
top, the White House,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal on national parks _ a five-year program to
eliminate a backlog on maintenance and repairs _ received a more
mixed reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington state, Bush talks about fixing national parks
while ignoring them in Texas,'' said Ken Kramer, director of the
Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer argued that there is a $186 million backlog of state park
maintenance needs in Texas parks, and that the state ranks 49th of
50 in per capita spending on its parks.
</P>
<P>
   Praise, with qualification, came from the National Parks and
Conservation Association, an 81-year-old national group dedicated
to protecting and enhancing the park system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing money needed to get rid of the maintenance backlog
is key to getting parks in peak condition,'' said Thomas Kiernan,
president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's only half the story,'' he said. ``The backlog results
from a $500 million to $1 billion shortfall in the Park Service's
annual operating budget. Governor Bush's proposal fixes the
backlog, but does not solve the underlying problem of an inadequate
annual budget for the Park Service to protect the plants, animals
and historic artifacts in its care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also outlined a stewardship philosophy in which local
communities, free of excessive regulation, work to protect the
environment. He said the federal government should support such
efforts with incentives, not mandates.
</P>
<P>
   The approach resonated with area landowners, many of them
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Reiner, who owns the riverfront farm and much of the
3.5-mile Haskell Slough habitat restoration project, said Bush's
ideas are on target.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner worked with neighbors, volunteers, environmental groups,
state and federal agencies to transform a sediment-choked back
channel of the Skykomish River into a robust rearing area for
steelhead, chinook and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said current environmental policy is built on the idea of
letting nature restore itself _ regardless of how that would effect
people.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Reiner said, is that the Endangered Species Act
gives too much power to mid-level bureaucrats who want to prohibit
almost any land use in environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach, he said, is to come up with cooperative
solutions, such as the Haskell Slough project, in which management
can improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built more diversity into this project in the last three
years than nature may do in 80 (years),'' Reiner said. ``There's
room for people and fish.''

   Australia's consciousness immersed in swimming
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ To pass through the main entrance of the
Olympic swimming venue, the Sydney International Aquatic Center, is
to pass through a large portion of Australia's sports history.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of 10 of Australia's greatest swimmers and divers
are described on plates of bronze in the sidewalk, sort of an
Aquatic Walk of Fame. Those of another 94 are portrayed in similar
fashion on the outer walls.
</P>
<P>
   From Australia's best-known Olympian of the past, Dawn Fraser,
to its current Wunderkind, Ian Thorpe, the names speak to the
success Australians have experienced in swimming competition. They
also speak to the host nation's expectations for the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As swimming unfolds over the first eight days of the Games,
Australians will immerse themselves in every race and live and die
with those involving the 44 men and women representing their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in swimming has always been high in Australia, but it
is perhaps at a new level now, with the Games in Sydney and the
Australian team loaded with potential gold-medal winners, some of
whom already have become national celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening ceremonies, perhaps the most anticipated
elements of the Olympics for Australians are the first and last
days of the swimming competition.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 will mark the Olympic debut of Thorpe, the 17-year-old who
has emerged in the last two years as the world's best
middle-distance swimmer. Day 8 will include the finals of the
1,500-meter freestyle, in which two Australians, two-time Olympic
champion Kieren Perkins and Grant Hackett, are likely to battle for
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of watching eight men swim a mile may not quicken the
pulse of the average American camped out in his easy chair, but it
means high drama to an Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grow up with water in our backgrounds because of our
beaches and estuaries,'' said John Devitt, who won four Olympic
medals swimming for Australia in 1956 and 1960 and now serves as
vice president of the Australian Olympic Committee. ``Most of our
population is one hour from a coastline. Because of that, just
about everybody learns to swim, usually by the age of 4 or 5. It's
part of the early (school) curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``American teams that come over here are very jealous of our
crowds because they're so knowledgeable, and the reason they're so
knowledgeable is everybody here swims at one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Devitt, there are approximately 100 Olympic-size
pools (50 meters) in Sydney and its suburbs. Included in that group
is the venerable North Sydney Olympic Pool, where nearly 90 world
records have been set in 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   As much as swimming is embedded in Australia's culture, it has
become an even greater part of the country's sports scene in recent
years, the surge due in large measure to Perkins, the king of the
1,500 meters; Susie O'Neill, the world-record holder and defending
Olympic champion in the 200 butterfly; and Thorpe, the teen
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pan Pacific swimming championships were held in Sydney
last year, the finals and semifinals were televised live by Channel
9, one of Australia's three national networks, and five of the
shows wound up among the 12 highest-rated prime-time programs for
the year. The finals and semifinals of the Australian Olympic
trials in May also were televised live by the network.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is a national icon, easily on a level with tennis player
Pat Rafter and golfer Greg Norman. Eight years ago in Barcelona,
Perkins became the fifth Australian to win the Olympic 1,500, and
he did it again four years later in Atlanta after barely reaching
the finals because of a rib-cage injury.
</P>
<P>
   Now 27 and competing in his last Olympics, he faces the biggest
challenge of his career _ overcoming the 21-year-old Hackett, who
won the 1,500 at the Australian trials and hasn't lost in the event
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For many Australians, the expected Perkins-Hackett showdown in
the finals of the 1,500 is the most anticipated event of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race that stops the nation,'' wrote Ian Hanson, the
Australian swim team's press officer, in his Olympic preview for a
magazine he edits, The Swimmer. ``No matter where you are, stop,
look and listen to what many people believe will be the
most-watched 15 minutes of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Devitt said the Australian public treats Perkins' races in much
the same way it treats the Melbourne Cup, a horse race that takes
place every year on the first Tuesday in November and is regarded
as an occasion of national significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you are, you stop and listen to the Melbourne
Cup,'' Devitt said. ``That's what happens when Perkins is
swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, 10 years younger than Perkins, represents Australia's
newest obsession. Known as the ``Thorpedo,'' he is the Australian
equivalent of the Tiger Woods phenomenon, having won the world
championship in the 400 freestyle two years ago at 15 before going
on to claim world records in both the 400 and 200.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the Olympics, he will swim the 400, his best
event, and be a part of Australia's 400 freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hanson, multiple gold medals from Thorpe would make
his impact on the Sydney Games ``what (U.S. track star) Michael
Johnson was to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian public is fixated on just about everything
relating to Thorpe, from his size-17 feet to his taste in movies
(Adam Sandler). A product of Sydney's suburbs, he has shown a
maturity beyond his years in dealing with the hype, a trait evident
at a packed pre-Olympic news conference orchestrated by the
Australian Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he had found to be the best and worst things stemming
from his success, Thorpe answered without hesitating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and worst are the same thing,'' he said. ``Walking
down the street, being recognized in that situation, that's
fantastic. But it also can be quite daunting. Maybe you're not
having your best day, and you want to get away from it all. That's
often very difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That Australia would field one of its strongest Olympic swim
teams with Sydney serving as host of the Games is not entirely an
accident. At the same time the International Olympic Committee
awarded the Games to Australia's largest city, the country's
telecommunications giant, Telstra, began pouring money into
Australian swimming, sponsoring the national program as well as
individual competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that everything is in place, the pressure is on the
Australians to have a showing similar to the one the 1956 team
achieved in Melbourne, where Australia won eight of the 12 gold
medals awarded in swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most humorous thing for those of us who were
there in '56 is it's taken 44 years for another Olympic team to be
compared to us,'' said Devitt, who that year earned a gold medal in
the 800 relay and a silver in the 100 freestyle. ``I can see the
connection _ the Games returning to Australia and another strong
(Australian) team. Unfortunately, it adds a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat also is on the Australian swimmers to win more medals
than the United States. The U.S. medal count in Atlanta was 26, 14
more than the Australian total. In terms of gold medals, the United
States had 13 to Australia's two. The United States has won the
most Olympic swimming medals of any country _ 400 _ with Australia
second at 123.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the rivalry last week was an exchange through the
media between Perkins and U.S. sprinter Gary Hall Jr. As part of a
column he writes on the Internet, Hall said the United States would
smash the Australians ``like guitars.'' Perkins responded by
saying, ``I don't take a lot of notice of drug cheats,'' a
reference to Hall's three-month suspension in 1998 for using
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the rivalry have led Don Talbot, head coach of
the Australian team, to complain that the competition has been
incorrectly framed as Australia vs. the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world tries to beat the States,'' he said.
``Obviously, you try to knock the Americans off their pedestal, but
to do that, we all need help. The German team is a great team. The
Dutch team is a great team. There are a lot of great teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to focus on a duel meet between the Americans and
Australians, I think you're out of your mind. The press that has
been created on those lines is by you people (the media), not us.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're doing is trying like hell for Australia. We're going
to give the Australian crowd, the Australian people, as much as we
can, just like the Americans did in Atlanta, and try to get the
best out of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For the millions of Australians hanging on every stroke, that
will hopefully be good enough.

SOFTWARE MANIPULATES TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO SPEED BUSES ON THEIR WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Brazil)   (Circuits)  
 By ERIC TAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the growing number of people on the roads in the Los Angeles
area clogs traffic, often to glacial speeds, a form of
transportation that is invisible to most members of the middle
class in that car-oriented megalopolis is helping people travel
faster: the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new technology plus common sense, 70,000 commuters a
day can now often outpace the drivers on nearby clogged freeways by
traveling on two routes served by red Metro Rapid buses, powered by
natural gas. Los Angeles County transportation officials have
managed to shave as much as 25 percent off the travel time of a
local bus trip by adopting technology that, among things, can keep
green lights on just a little longer as the bus approaches _ as
long as doing that does not cause another set of traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The regional authority decided to take action because a survey
showed that the biggest complaint of bus passengers was the time it
took them to get anywhere. In just a few years, average bus speeds
had declined 17 percent, to just 10 miles per hour from a torrid
12.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority learned through its
surveys that buses spent half their time standing still, either at
red lights or at bus stops, waiting for passengers to get on and
off. Officials had tried to speed things up a decade earlier by
equipping buses with special transmitters that would hold traffic
lights on green until buses passed through. That just backed up the
traffic on cross-streets, so the initiative was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, traffic officials heard about a similar effort in
Curitaba, Brazil, that was successful because the system was
smarter in several ways. For one thing, it held the lights for
buses only when that did not cause other traffic snarls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no guarantee that the system would work in Los
Angeles. Curitaba was built to handle public transportation, while
public transit in Los Angeles often appears to be an afterthought.
Even though 1 million people ride buses each day in the county, the
bus is the transportation mode of last resort for most Angelenos.
</P>
<P>
   The regional transit authority decided to adopt many of
Curitaba's strategies. ``Our goal was to decrease travel time over
our existing limited-stop express service by 25 percent,'' said Rex
Gephart, who manages the Metro Rapid project. ``If we couldn't do
that, we'd abandon the project.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, the transit authority began a system that gives
special Metro Rapid express buses priority at traffic signals. It
first had to embed 210 antenna loops in the pavement at various
spots along the route. As a bus passes over one of the loops, a $75
transmitter mounted on its front sends an identifying signal to an
equipment box that controls the traffic light at the next
intersection. The signal is also sent to a central control center
downtown, so the bus can be tracked in the computer system.
</P>
<P>
   But the $10 million project needed to find a way to ease the way
for buses to clear intersections without tying up traffic on
cross-streets. So the Los Angeles Department of Transportation
wrote software that lets a green light be extended _ held on green
longer or switched to green earlier _ for no more than 10 seconds.
If several buses approach an intersection as the light is about the
change, they can still get only 10 more seconds of green. Buses
arriving later than that have to wait. At important intersections,
the green light can be extended in only every other cycle.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent bus drivers from speeding up to make the system
extend green lights, there are no visual indicators in the buses to
tell drivers when some extra speed would accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   To shed additional seconds off travel time, the two bus routes
were simplified and stops were limited to no closer together than
every eight-tenths of a mile; that limit is two-tenths of a mile
for local service.
</P>
<P>
   The buses stop on the far corners of intersections, after
traffic lights. Local stops are still on the near corner, so the
stops are less crowded and clearly designated, making it easier to
board and unload passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only the authority's new NABI buses, built in Hungary, are used
for Metro Rapid routes. They are low to the ground and have fewer
steps, which makes boarding easier and faster.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority also watched how
people left the buses. As expected, just as many passengers exited
through the front doors as through the back doors, and that delayed
the passengers boarding through the front doors. Project officials
decided to paint large exit signs on the back doors, and they will
eventually have drivers ask passengers to leave through the rear.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of each express bus is tracked in the authority's
bus control center downtown, both on a computer screen (using the
transmitter signals) and through information from video cameras
placed at strategic intersections throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   As a bus passes over a pair of electronic loops embedded in the
street, its speed is calculated. Then its arrival time is
transmitted via a cell phone link to an electronic display at the
next bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Buses are dispatched every 3 to 10 minutes. And if a Metro Rapid
bus finishes its route quicker than scheduled, so be it. That just
makes for a more contented rider.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Metro Rapid buses from bunching up into packs, the
central dispatcher radios the driver to slow down or speed up
(without breaking the speed limit) to keep from getting too close
to another bus.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been successful so far. On the 16-mile Ventura
Boulevard route, from Warner Center to Universal City, the average
travel time has decreased by 25 percent, to 45 minutes from 1 hour.
On the 26-mile route from Santa Monica through Beverly Hills to
Montebello on the east side of the city, travel times have also
dropped by 25 percent, to 1{ hours from 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   While the data is still being analyzed, project officials say,
they believe that 30 percent to 40 percent of the improvement in
travel times can be credited to the signal-timing technology.
Arrival times for Metro Rapid buses are coordinated with the area's
new Red Line subway extension so that even during rush hour,
Gephart said, a trip across the San Fernando Valley into Union
Station can now be done in about one hour, often faster than a car
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Will the improvements brought about by this new technology be
enough to persuade the middle classes, and not just people without
cars, to use public transportation?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're hoping for,'' Gephart said. The authority
hopes to add 15 to 20 new express lines, he said, and transit
systems around the country are calling him to find out how they can
adapt the Los Angeles system to speed up their bus services.

   Jornada Handheld Gets a Makeover
</P>
<P>
   They're smaller than a laptop _ and a breadbox _ but bigger than
a Palm Pilot. Unlike their digital siblings, however, handheld PC's
never fulfilled predictions that they were destined to become
mass-market gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is enough interest in the in-between-size PC's that
Hewlett-Packard has revamped its Jornada handheld. Cherie Britt, a
spokeswoman for the company, said that handhelds were mainly used
by people who traveled _ but not very far _ while on the job.
``They might only be around the campus or at work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Typical customers include doctors who carry the devices while
making their rounds in large hospitals, Britt said.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld PC's also offer a feature missing from most personal
digital assistants: A keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That allows people who are on the road to create small
documents and not just access them,'' Britt said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. To squeeze everything into a package that
is roughly twice the size of a large PDA, the Jornada's keyboard is
only three-quarters the size of a laptop keyboard. The most
obvious, and perhaps least important, difference between the
Jornada 720 and early models is color. The new model is dark blue
instead of purple.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit's processor speed has been increased to 206 MHz
from 133 MHz. But unlike laptops with more powerful CPU's, the
revised Jornada has improved battery life. Hewlett-Packard says
that the 720's lithium-ion cell will run for nine hours on a single
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jornada also has a standard feature not commonly found
on PC's of any size: A built-in smart card reader. Among other
things, Britt said, the device will read the cards that many
employees need to open doors in their workplace and to prevent
unauthorized access to their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jornada is not all work and no play. Unlike earlier
models, the 720 includes a jack and a volume switch for stereo
headphones. Britt said she anticipated that the feature would
mostly be used for listening to downloaded music.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Offers a System Upgrade, But It's Not Free This Time
</P>
<P>
   When Palm Computing introduced a batch of new Palm handhelds in
February with a new operating system, Palm OS 3.5, it said the new
system would be posted on its Web site in about 30 days or so. As
in the past, owners of earlier Palm models would be able to
download it for free.
</P>
<P>
   March and several more months have come and gone, and no upgrade
has been made available.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade will be released sometime this fall, Palm now says,
but it will not be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically what you have seen in a Palm upgrade has been very
incremental,'' said John Cook, senior director for consumer product
marketing at the company. ``We think we have added a lot more
value.''
</P>
<P>
   OS 3.5 incorporates many features that have been available for
years as third-party add-ons: Making menus appear by tapping the
top of the screen and a new view in the calendar that shows both
appointments and ``to do'' items.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that Palm planned to charge less than $20 for the
upgrade. It will be available on the Web or on a CD that will also
have a new version of the Palm Desktop software for personal
computers. The release is timed to coincide with the availability
of Palm's Mobile Internet Kit, which will include OS 3.5 as well as
wireless Internet software for under $50.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that he had already heard grumbling from some Palm
users about the upgrading fee and that some future releases might
still be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it will make sense to charge for an upgrade,'' he
said. ``Sometimes we will just give it to you to keep you whole as
a customer.''
</P>
<P>
   A Camera That Reads Text Without Moving Its Lips
</P>
<P>
   Document scanners that can convert a page of text into an
electronic file made their debut several years ago, and they have
been saving businesses time, money and treatment bills for
repetitive-stress injuries since then. But while text scanners tend
to be big and bulky, Philips Electronics recently introduced a
small portable camera for the PC that can scan images and text on
the go, even with a laptop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Vesta Pro Scan package, which includes the Vesta Pro camera
and PageCam software developed by Xerox, can also handle
video-conferencing chores and can record digital motion pictures at
up to 30 frames per second with a maximum resolution of 640 by 480
pixels.
</P>
<P>
   The Vesta Pro camera has a built-in microphone and easy-focus
lens and will also take still photographs at a resolution of 800 by
600 pixels.
</P>
<P>
   The small camera, which resembles an egg with a lens on the
front, connects to the computer via the USB port. It comes with a
small metal tripod to steady it for scanning text and photos. Once
an item is scanned by the camera, it can be copied and pasted from
the PageCam software into another program.
</P>
<P>
   The Vesta Pro Scan package will work with computers running
Windows 98 that have 32 megabytes of RAM and a 200-MHz
Pentium-level processor. The package has a suggested price of
$129.99, and road warriors will be heartened to know that there's
one less thing to pack _ the camera draws its power from the USB
port so there's no need to carry an extra power cord.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Phone Radiation Levels Now Published on the Web
</P>
<P>
   Do-Mode, a search engine company in Los Angeles, has published a
list of specific absorption radiation, or SAR, levels for many cell
phone models. In 1996, the Federal Communications Commission
mandated a requirement limiting SAR levels on phones sold in the
United States to less than 1.6 watts per kilogram of human tissue.
According to the list (www.sardata.com/sardata.htm), which was
compiled from information on the commission's Web site, the cell
phone with the highest SAR level in digital mode is Ericsson's T28
World model (1.49 watts per kilogram); Motorola's StarTAC 7860 has
the lowest level (0.24 watts per kilogram).
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Anne Basile of the Cellular Communications Technology
Association pointed out that these numbers represent peak radiation
levels, while SAR levels fluctuate, depending on the user's
location and the phone's battery status. She also pointed out that
the 1.6 number ``has a substantial margin of safety built into
it.''

 &HT;    In support of Brandi
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA _ Brandi Chastain has few moments to
reflect on her improbable fame, or just to let her mind wander.
When she does, it usually is driving down the northern California
coast, cell phone in hand, as she was doing one day in late August.
And wearing a sports bra that serves as both support and fashion
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just how I am,'' she says while traveling to watch her
old Santa Clara University team play in San Luis Obispo. ``I wear
this everywhere. To me, it's very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chastain, being comfortable in her own skin is a literal
phrase. The indelible moment she provided after booting home the
winning penalty kick to beat China in last summer's Women's World
Cup finals drew international attention. Ripping off her white
jersey to reveal a black sports bra _ and the well-cut physique she
developed to rejuvenate her career _ became a liberating
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Chastain, a leftside defender, hasn't had what
could be considered a distinctive playing career. She lost her spot
on the team for two years in the mid-1990s, and her gaffe in the
World Cup quarterfinals against Germany resulted in an own goal
that could have sunk the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a year after her stunning World Cup ride _ which
began with a nude photo spread in Gear magazine before the
tournament _ Life Beyond the Sports Bra has intensified for
Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than I could ever have hoped for,'' she said. ``More
things are coming from this that don't have anything to do with
soccer. Now, people are calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she and Mia Hamm are the only members of the U.S.
women's team to have official replica jerseys on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the U.S. women meet rival Norway on the Melbourne
Cricket Ground in their Olympic opener, the team that was
noticeably absent from NBC's airwaves in 1996 has evolved into one
of the biggest American stories of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   And Chastain has become a lightning rod for a current firestorm
of debate about women athletes, their bodies and the touchy topic
of sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Women's sports activists and female sportswriters criticized
U.S. swimmer Jenny Thompson's pose for a recent Sports Illustrated
article. Thompson, in which she wore an American-flag bikini bottom
and red suede boots and cupped her hands over her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   But Chastain happily defends the photos, which she thinks just
displays a powerful body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what's wrong with attractive, beautiful
things,'' she said. ``I don't think about sex when I see a
beautifully toned athlete. I think of all the hard work they put
into getting that way. I can appreciate what that's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   She ought to find the relaxed cultural climate in Australia more
inviting. The Australian women's soccer team, which didn't win a
match in the World Cup, posed nude for a team calendar and caused a
ruckus earlier this year. But the Australian Olympic federation was
upset about the calendar distributors using the word ``Olympic''
without permission and not about the nakedness of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the World Cup, just as the Gear photo spread was
published, with a glistening, muscular Chastain posing with only a
strategically placed soccer ball, she paid a visit to the David
Letterman late-night talk show.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs were shown at length. ``Babe City'' was born,
and the pop-culture bandwagon rolled through the next month,
leading to her unforgettable brandishment at the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain also delights in having a different perspective on her
sport in other ways. She is probably the biggest soccer nut on the
team and a real student of the game. Her belated honeymoon with
Jerry Smith, the women's soccer coach at Santa Clara, was spent at
the 1998 World Cup. If a Major League Soccer game is anywhere close
to the team's training or touring schedule, she will hop in the car
and go watch.
</P>
<P>
   Her inspiration was George Best, once the dashing genius of
Manchester United's 1968 European champions who wound down his
playing career with her hometown San Jose Earthquakes of the North
American Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain almost ended her career after she was omitted from the
1995 World Cup team, but she has reclaimed it.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly lazy about training, Chastain was told by former
coach Tony DiCicco to get in better shape.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting that challenge, and making the transition from
striker to defender, she glorified in the triumph of Olympic gold
in 1996. She also gloried in the self-confidence she got from being
supremely fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran my (rear) off for this body,'' she responded famously to
the critics of her Gear photos, many of them the same people who
lambasted Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have issues,'' Chastain said more recently. ``If I can
feel more comfortable with myself, then I'll stand up a little
taller and be better on the field. I don't have to be ashamed of
anything.''

MAXIMIZING POWER BY `CAPPING' A PROCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HERCZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with microprocessors today, according to David
Albonesi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the
University of Rochester, is that they are too powerful. Most of the
programs they run tap only a fraction of a processor's capacity,
yet the unused portion exacts a price, as every notebook computer
owner who has raced against a fading battery knows. Powerful means
power-hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have one microprocessor design find its way into
everything from portable devices to high-end servers,'' Albonesi
said. ``But if you look at the characteristics of the application
software, ideally you'd like to design different microprocessor
hardware for each one, because they have different requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Albonesi is working toward changing today's
one-processor-fits-all paradigm without changing the processor. He
is developing a model he calls complexity-adaptive processing, or
CAP, that will allow a general purpose microprocessor to conserve
power by slowing or shutting down unneeded components within a few
nanoseconds of starting an application. The process is continuous:
the configuration is re-evaluated and adjusted millions of times a
second.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday in 1996, Albonesi stepped into his office, closed
the door, and vowed not to emerge until he had one really great new
idea. Where others might have starved in such an effort, Albonesi
appeared in time for dinner, CAP in hand.
</P>
<P>
   In only four years, Albonesi has demonstrated that one of his
techniques can reduce the power consumption of a microprocessor
(also called the central processing unit, or CPU) by up to 50
percent while increasing its performance. That has drawn interest
from IBM, whose research division is collaborating with Albonesi's
team in Rochester in a three-year study. The goal is to use CAP to
produce a prototype microprocessor that will make today's low-power
chips look insatiable by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthroughs that have made modern microprocessors so
powerful _ the number of transistors packed into a few square
millimeters of silicon and the antastic speeds at which they are
run _ are responsible for the present assault on batteries. If you
double the number of transistors, you also double the power the
processor draws.
</P>
<P>
   Since Intel released its first commercial microprocessor in
1974, the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip has
increased from 6,000 initially to nearly 10 million today. Another
factor is the CPUs clock speed, or frequency. Doubling the clock
speed also doubles the power consumption. Over the same period,
clock rates have gone from 2 MHz to 1,000 MHz. Now the CPU is the
biggest drain on a laptop's battery, outdrawing large, bright
screens and components like the hard disk and CD-ROM drives. In
some configurations, the CPU can use more watts than everything
else in the computer put together.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why Transmeta Corp., a new company in Santa
Clara, Calif., that announced a new line of power-saving
microprocessors in January, is attracting so much interest.
Transmeta says that its Crusoe chip consumes 1 or 2 watts in normal
operation, compared with the 6 to 16 watts of other mobile CPUs.
Notebook computers with Crusoe chips are expected this fall from
Sony, Hitachi and IBM. Although the Crusoe chip is not yet on the
market, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have responded with plans
for their own new low-power chips. Power management has become a
hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Albonesi does not plan to drastically redesign the C.P.U. By
increasing the circuitry on a standard CPU by a few percent, CAP
will be able to use software to control the processor. In a limited
way, that is what Transmeta, Intel and AMD are already doing. Each
has a program that monitors how busy the microprocessor is. If the
microprocessor can be slowed down without affecting system
performance, it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of common applications run very well at 300, 400, 500
MHz, and the user isn't going to notice a huge difference in
performance, although he is going to notice a huge difference in
battery life,'' said Martin Booth, a marketing manager at AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, chipmakers treat the microprocessor as an indivisible
whole, but Albonesi sees each of its many components as a candidate
to be slowed down or turned off.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the processor's own on-board memory, or cache,
stores for rapid retrieval the instructions that are used most
frequently when a program is running. But not all programs make use
of the whole cache, and the unused memory is a double burden,
wasting power and slowing the CPU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some programs would work better with a small, fast cache
because they fit into a small amount of memory,'' Albonesi said.
``For other programs, it would be better to have that cache be
bigger, even if it was slower, because it reduces the amount of
requests that have to be made to the main memory for data. What we
have is the ability to dynamically change the cache according to
the requirements of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how much cache memory can be shut down is a matter
of trial and error: You keep increasing the cache size while
measuring a program's performance. When increasing the cache
results in no further improvement, you have passed the optimum.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding how to spend the gains is another question. A smaller
cache will run faster, which could improve the performance of some
programs, but would be useless in others. In those cases, CAP would
elect to slow down the cache's clock, which would further reduce
the amount of power drawn. The Rochester team has not tested its
cache design on a real microprocessor, but using a computer
simulation they have found that by reducing power demands and
improving performance the efficiency of a microprocessor can be
doubled. That's just one part of a processor.
</P>
<P>
   What applies to the cache may also apply to other CPU components
like the floating-point processor (used for complex numerical
calculations), or the units that fetch instructions from memory and
issue them to the module that will execute them. Albonesi has many
ideas about where power can be saved, but the problem now is to
find those that will deliver the biggest returns for the least
overhead. By overhead, Albonesi means the power requirements of the
hardware and software that are used to monitor the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   There are tradeoffs, Albonesi said. ``Nothing comes completely
for free in computer design. The tricks are to find all of the
places where you can tolerate the overhead that you are adding.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Kronstadt, director of VLSI systems at the IBMs Watson
Research Center in Westchester County, N.Y., is clear about CAPs
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get higher performance _ not just in microprocessors
but other chips too _ they require more power,'' Dr. Eric Kronstadt
said. ``Power management is going to affect the entire spectrum,
the architecture, the implementation, the software, the circuits
that you design-everything. We will be using whatever techniques we
find that work.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji _ This South Pacific archipelago is best known for
its fine-grained white beaches and cloudless vistas of cobalt sea.
But a range of steep-sided mountains divides the main island of
Viti Levu, and nothing looks the same on the far side.
</P>
<P>
   The rains come two days out of three in the southeast, dumping
10 feet a year. Suva's hills have a rain-forest coat of green _
bamboo, palm, cocoa, eucalyptus and _ most temptingly and troubling
for Fiji _ more than 100,000 acres of high-grade mahogany, worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A coup here a few months ago toppled the government. For a
relatively bloodless political uprising in a small island nation of
about 830,000, the event attracted some attention. Many accounts
told of how ethnic tension involving indigenous Fijians, who are
ethnic Melanesians, had once again exploded into a public
confrontation with Indo-Fijians, who trace their roots to
indentured laborers whom the British brought here from India a
century ago, when both India and Fiji were crown colonies.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the cries for ethnic solidarity and native Fijian
supremacy was a struggle over land, money and mahogany, a
competition that involved American and British as well as local
business interests. Like diamonds in Sierra Leone and oil in
Nigeria, Fiji's mahogany helped prompt a struggle for political
power, inflicting damage to the nation's economy and political
system well in excess of the riches the commodity once promised.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's struggle began with two men, who each searched for a pot
of gold and wound up stirring a cauldron of ethnic discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall W. Pettit, a Seattle-area real-estate developer lured
to Fiji by its forests rather than its resorts, said he aspired to
transform the way that developing nations manage their forests _
and make a tidy profit. He also plunged into Fijian politics to
fight the former government's opposition to his plans, though there
is no evidence he backed the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit did, however, have ties to the Fijian who led the revolt,
an American-educated, bald-headed former government forest manager
named George Speight. The two men had once worked together to shake
up the local timber industry _ and were so close that Fiji police
are investigating whether Pettit paid bribes to Speight. Both men
deny the allegations, saying the payments were for legitimate
business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When Speight stormed the parliament building and overthrew the
elected government last May, he carried not only an AK-47 rifle but
his own blueprint for becoming Fiji's timber king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people used the mahogany issue to raise the emotions of
landowners and as an excuse to topple the government,'' said Anup
Kumar, who was ousted as minister of commerce in the coup. ``They
thought they could get rich from green gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettit, 57, is tall and silver-haired, with courtly manners and
a tendency to talk in 15-minute spurts, like a salesman wary of
letting a customer interrupt him. He has spent most of his career
financing real-estate projects in California, Texas and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   He says it was a missionary impulse, more than money, that
prompted him to search for timber investments abroad. He wanted to
provide poor nations with the capital and technology to make the
most of their forests, reducing their reliance on multinational
companies that do not have the poor countries' best interests in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big companies tend to take the resources of developing
countries without giving them any value,'' Pettit said in a
breakfast interview near his Seattle home. ``It's the last vestige
of colonialism, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   LANDOWNER GRIEVANCES AND MODERN INVESTMENT
</P>
<P>
   Pettit said he had explored doing business in Russia and Africa.
But when a group of Fijian landowners contacted him in 1996 through
a mutual friend, he found what he called the perfect laboratory: a
poor but seemingly stable nation with little foreign investment, a
place where an American businessman could make a big splash.
</P>
<P>
   But as he weighed in, Pettit found that his prospective partners
were drawing him deeply into a domestic struggle over land rights.
The landowners wanted to buy out government leases on their
ancestral lands, letting them harvest the timber and get rich
turning it into veneer and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the land in Fiji belongs to familial groups of
indigenous ethnic Melanesians, much as crown property in England
belongs to the queen. Though land is often leased long-term for
public and private uses, the holdings are a birthright of native
Fijians that sets them apart even from multi-generation
Indo-Fijians, who represent half the population and who dominate
Fiji's commercial sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s, the British colonial administration
leased land to plant trees, including pine, a fast-growing
softwood, and Honduran mahogany, a slow-growing hardwood. The
leases paid landowners only a nominal rent _ an average of about 4
cents an acre annually _ for what was then seen as an experiment.
Many, but not all, of the leases gave landowners rights to share
profits if the planting proved successful.
</P>
<P>
   When pine began maturing in the 1980s, the decade after the
British left, the independent Fiji government established its own
company, Fiji Pine, to harvest the trees. But the company mostly
shredded the logs into chips and exported them to Japan at low
prices, usually at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners, after realizing no profit from pine, scrambled to
make sure they made money on mahogany, which is just now ready to
start cutting. Fiji has 125,000 acres of high-grade hardwood,
probably the world's largest stock of the species. And, unlike
Brazil and other countries with a lot of indigenous mahogany, Fiji
has no environmental limits on harvesting from tree farms.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit agreed to help, by proposing to sell tens of millions of
dollars in bonds to finance the development of a forest-products
industry, then repay the bonds from the proceeds of selling timber
products. If carried off, it would have been Fiji's first bond sale
of any kind. It would also earn Pettit millions in fees before a
single tree was felled, regardless of whether the project
eventually made a profit.
</P>
<P>
   There were obstacles from the start. One was cost. Pettit
recruited partners who lived full time in Fiji negotiating details.
The phone calls back to Pettit, billed at about $10 a minute, were
adding up to thousands of dollars a month, which Pettit said he
paid from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit also met resistance from Fiji Pine, which had no interest
in seeing landowners buy back their property and set up a competing
business. The setback might have prompted some people to withdraw _
Pettit said he considered ``just getting out.'' But instead he and
his partners launched a private investigation into Fiji Pine's
operations, compiling a report that claimed to show how powerful
officials had used dubious accounting at the company to profit at
landowners' expense.
</P>
<P>
   And Pettit rallied landowners to do something about it. ``I told
them, `You people have to get up and take on your own system or it
will never get fixed,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A LOCAL PARTNER
</P>
<P>
   Pettit, an American outsider, soon recruited an ally in his
fight. Through his local partners, he met George Speight, then the
managing director of Fiji Heath, an insurance brokerage. The two
discussed insurance _ any bond deal on the trees would require an
insurance package _ but also timber politics.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, in his early 40s and trained in business at Andrews
University in Michigan, was a protege of powerful native Fijian
political figures in the then-ruling party. Burly, boxer-chinned
and full of loud charm, Speight lived in a small apartment above
JJ's, a bar and nightclub that he partly owned and had turned into
a gossipy watering hole for local businessmen and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anyone else Pettit met in Suva, Speight understood
financial markets. And unlike the Americans, Speight could
communicate those concepts in Fijian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a godsend,'' Pettit wrote in a memo at the time. He
committed to a broad arrangement with Speight, agreeing to pay his
company a monthly fee for a variety of services, including
insurance advice, office space and help in communicating with
government officials and landowners.
</P>
<P>
   When Pettit visited Fiji, Speight became his key contact and his
liaison with landowners. Pettit said that he and Speight developed
a shared vision for a unified timber industry, stripped of
turf-conscious bureaucrats who did not understand American finance.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Speight was hooked on timber. He was boasting to
friends that government patrons had secured him the leadership post
at Fiji Hardwood, a new, government-owned entity set up to exploit
the maturing mahogany plantations. By late 1998, the government
also appointed Speight chairman of Fiji Pine, the first step toward
fulfilling his ambition to unite the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1999, the deal of Pettit's career seemed within grasp.
Speight had shaken up Fiji Pine, clearing out many bureaucrats
opposed to Pettit's plan. Speight also selected Pettit's company,
Timber Resources Management, as one of two finalists seeking to
harvest the mahogany groves.
</P>
<P>
   If both deals materialized, the underwriting commissions,
management fees and long-term profit sharing to Pettit's team would
total, by some estimates, about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, as both deals hung in the balance, Speight
submitted an invoice to Pettit on his own letterhead that claimed
he was owed $26,000 for rent and consulting services. He specified
a personal Australian bank account for payment.
</P>
<P>
   Speight had sought compensation before, but Pettit, while
acknowledging he owed some past due bills, said he held off paying.
He disputed Speight's estimates and questioned why Speight asked
for the money to be paid to his own bank account instead of to
Heath. Pettit also acknowledged that Speight's demand came at a
sensitive time _ after Speight had already assumed powerful
government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those qualms, Pettit said he paid Speight $10,000
himself and arranged for one of his partners in Fiji to pay another
$5,000. Those payments, shy of what Speight had demanded, are
currently under investigation by the Fiji police.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the payments might have swayed Speight
to award the timber contracts to Pettit. Shortly after the issue
arose, the party that backed Speight lost parliamentary elections
to a coalition headed by Mahendra Chaudhry. And within a short
time, Speight lost his government posts.
</P>
<P>
   SUGAR ALSO A FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's new government promised a quick decision on timber
sales. Even without Speight's help, Pettit felt he had the superior
bid. His main challenger was Commonwealth Development Corp., a
British concern that had a 40-year track record in Fiji. But Pettit
had a much more ambitious proposal that valued the mahogany crop at
$210 million versus about $65 million for the British company.
</P>
<P>
   What Pettit apparently didn't know at the time was that
Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian prime minister in 13 years,
needed the backing of Fiji's former colonial patron in negotiations
with the European Union over export supports for sugar. Sugar is
Fiji's leading industry and a business dominated by ethnic Indians;
Britain could help with sugar subsidies, but the British wanted
Commonwealth Development to get the timber concession. Moreover,
the new Fijian government _ unlike Speight _ seemed to have an
instinctual distrust of foreign bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, Chaudhry decided the matter quickly. He told the
British company that it was the ``preferred bidder,'' subject to
final talks on terms.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit, having already invested about $2 million in Fiji, sensed
disaster. He recruited the U.S. Embassy to intervene on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated diplomatic requests, Chaudhry agreed to
reconsider the American plan. He also agreed to send a group of top
government officials to visit Fahnestock &AMP; Co., the Wall Street
investment bank that Pettit had signed up to underwrite the bond.
The State Department paid for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention appeared to work. Two of Chaudhry's cabinet
members overseeing the mahogany bid wrote a glowing report after
the New York visit that signaled strong support for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But by late 1999, the action in Fiji had started to shift
outside of Suva, to villages scattered among the mahogany
plantations. There, Chaudhry's initial support for the smaller
British bid had inflamed landowners already angry about not being
consulted on sensitive land-use issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit said he hoped that the landowner unrest would help him.
After all, he had been lured to Fiji by disgruntled landowners
representing 250 village chiefs, many with both pine and mahogany
on their land. He cultivated that support, drawing up tables
showing how landowners could pocket far more from his plan than the
British alternative.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Speight was fanning landowner discontent, for
his own purposes. Stripped of his positions in Suva, he had
returned to his family farm but he had not abandoned his plan to
unite _ and run _ the timber industry. He criss-crossed the main
island, Viti Levu, mobilizing landowners to form their own company,
with him as its head. Their demand: that full control of the
plantations be returned to ancestral chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's plan found a receptive audience. ``My response was,
`Get the government out of this. This is my land,''' said Ratu Nd
Tawakelevu, 69, the chief of Naimasimasi Village and a mahogany
landowner. Tawakelevu, whose modest home is built on mahogany
stilts, said the chiefs had named Speight executive of a new land
trust.
</P>
<P>
   THE COUP
</P>
<P>
   Events came to a head last spring. Chaudhry, who had included
projected revenues from a timber deal in the government's budget
for the year, pushed for a decision on a foreign partner.
</P>
<P>
   Going into a decisive cabinet meeting in March, Pettit believed
he had won the concession. But Chaudhry surprised some members of
his own administration when he swung firmly behind the British
company and all but shut down debate on the subject, said
participants in the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a dizzying succession of charges and
counter-charges that made mahogany front-page news in Fiji for
weeks, shaking Chaudhry's young government.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the cabinet decision, the U.S. ambassador, Osmand
Siddique, went public with a scathing broadside, complaining in a
speech about a ``government reversal'' that he called
``non-transparent,'' and warned that unless the decision was
revoked, American investors would flee Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   A local consultant who had earlier worked for Pettit also
stirred things up, accusing the Chaudhry government of selling out
landowner interests to curry favor with the British and protect
sugar cane farmers.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Fiji TV in April reported on Pettit's
payments to Speight. Though both men denied the money was a bribe,
the report gave Chaudhry, who sensed a growing political threat
from landowners, ammunition to support his mahogany decision. He
accused the Seattle businessman of being a carpetbagger who had a
scheme to extract grand up-front profits from Fiji's timber but no
money of his own to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not be able to develop the mahogany industry on hot
air,'' he scolded.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruckus in the capital seemed to solidify landowner
opposition to Chaudhry. Some 10,000 indigenous Fijians marched
through Suva in late March, calling on the government to cease
making decisions on two key land issues _ the mahogany and renewal
of leases on land used for growing sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's landowner coalition was encouraging the protesters, in
language that became overtly racist. They asserted that ethnic
Indians could not be trusted to reach crucial decisions on native
land matters.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, landowners again marched on Suva, this time 20,000
strong. While the march degenerated into a riot that destroyed some
ethnic Indian-run businesses, Speight, in a four-wheel-drive jeep,
stormed the parliament building with seven paramilitary troops and
took Chaudhry and his cabinet hostage. The rebels held them there
for almost two months.
</P>
<P>
   The coup was haphazard, with disparate supporters and a
constantly changing list of demands. Fijians are still speculating
on the identity of its mastermind, often dismissing Speight as a
front man for powerful political interests.
</P>
<P>
   But it does seem likely that Speight intended to emerge from the
coup as the mahogany king. While he kept the Chaudhry
administration locked up, he ordered supporters to fan out around
Fiji's island gathering signatures of villages chiefs on a ``deed
of sovereignty,'' according to people told to do that work.
</P>
<P>
   The deed would have abrogated government leases and vested
control over Fiji's natural resources in a Speight-led entity. Had
the army not turned decisively against Speight in late July _ its
officers eventually arrested him despite having earlier granted him
amnesty _ his plan might have come to fruition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is now in an island prison off Suva, surrounded by
shark-infested waters and awaiting trial. Pettit, who has given up
all hope of reaching a timber deal in Fiji, has filed a half-dozen
lawsuits in local courts against the government to recover some of
the money he lost. He is also waiting for Fiji police to decide
whether to take action on his payment to Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The coup left just one physical monument in Suva. On the third
night of the hostage-taking, Speight supporters raced down
Gladstone Road in their four-wheel-drives and threw petrol bombs
into the windows of Fiji Hardwood's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Whether intended to cover a theft of documents or simply as a
symbolic act of terror, the fire left the twisted tin roof of the
colonial-era building resting precariously on a few charred
timbers.

JANUS CAPITAL CLOSES ITS FLAGSHIP FUND TO NEW INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The money keeps coming, but the number of Janus funds
keeps shrinking. Wednesday, Janus Capital closed its flagship Janus
Fund to new investors, its fifth fund closing this year.
</P>
<P>
   The assets of Janus have nearly tripled since the beginning of
last year, and to effectively manage its rapidly expanding assets,
the company has now closed half of its 16 equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we topped the $50 billion level, I started worrying we'd
have a flood of new investors coming in that would dilute the
effect of our great ideas for current shareholders,'' said Blaine
Rollins, who took over management of the $48.6 billion Janus Fund
in January. Since the beginning of last year, the fund has nearly
doubled in size and has become the nation's fourth-largest mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Such girth is generally thought to make the task of running a
fund more difficult. Investments in small and midsize companies
have less impact on the fund's performance, a manager's moves are
closely scrutinized and investments in each stock grow so large
they can be difficult to shift quietly without moving the market
price.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several of the nation's biggest mutual funds,
including the $109.8 billion Fidelity Magellan, are closed, except
to existing investors and regular retirement plan contributions.
But Janus, the fifth-largest fund company, has growing pains
firmwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managing their growth is a huge issue,'' said Russ Kinnel, an
analyst at the fund-tracking firm, Morningstar. ``They've grown so
fast that it's starting to strain their resources. One of the
issues is that because they have so many funds closed, it channels
the new money into the remaining funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the last year has been a tumultuous one for Janus.
First, there was the long-running feud between executives of Janus
and executives of its parent, Kansas City Southern Industries.
Earlier this year, Janus was packaged in a spinoff, called Stilwell
Financial, with several of Kansas City Southern's financial
holdings. Janus officials, including Thomas Bailey, the company's
founder, had publicly objected to the deal, preferring to be spun
off on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, James Craig, Janus' highly regarded chief
investment officer and the longtime manager of the Janus Fund,
retired to manage a charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the market. Most of the Janus equity funds
have similar investing styles and make aggressive bets on
technology stocks _ the firm's top holding is Nokia. Last year,
those bets led Janus to chart-topping returns, and the Janus Fund
gained 47 percent, more than double the gain of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, has not been nearly as kind to technology
investors. The Janus Fund has held up well, gaining 5.8 percent,
better than the 1 percent return of the S&AMP;P 500. But the firm's
popular Janus Twenty fund has struggled. It has lost 5.9 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Janus continues to be the best-selling mutual fund
firm in the industry. The $38.8 billion in new money that came in
the first eight months of this year is already $2 billion more than
flowed in during all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became concerned what the tidal wave of inflows would be
next year,'' Rollins said. ``If the fund is going to $100 billion,
I want to do that on the performance side.''
</P>
<P>
   To help absorb some of the company's new assets, Janus said it
would introduce Janus Fund 2, which will be managed by one of
Rollins' assistants. Janus Fund will remain open to existing
investors and retirement plan contributors.

ADVERTISING: NEW-CAR COMMERCIALS, PERENNIAL EARLY SIGN OF AUTUMN 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Autumn is nigh, and as lazy days at the beach soon give way to
busy afternoons raking leaves, the air positively quivers with the
promise of blazing jack-o'-lanterns, roasting turkeys and billions
of dollars worth of advertisements peddling cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   (What, you were expecting a paean to the changing seasons?
Perhaps next week, on the editorial page.)
</P>
<P>
   For the 2001 model year, which formally begins Oct. 1,
automakers will eagerly try to gain attention in an American market
more cluttered than ever, their efforts complicated by
uncertainties ranging from gasoline prices to interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly difficult'' to stand out, said Adrian Barrow,
account planning director at Team One Advertising in El Segundo,
Calif., a unit of Publicis Groupe SA that will introduce Thursday
night a campaign for the 2001 models of the Lexus LS 430 imported
luxury sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see another silver car driving down a twisty road,'' he
added, laughing, `I'm going to gag.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep consumers from doing just that, agencies like Team One
are scrambling to find compelling ways to sell vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good advertising is all about nuances,'' said Mark-Hans
Richer, director of advertising and sales promotion for the GMC
line of trucks and sport utility vehicles made by General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``GMC is a strong brand for some people,'' he added. ``We needed
it to be stronger for more people.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a $30 million campaign scheduled to begin on Sept. 22 by
the New York office of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide, a
description of GMC products as ``professional grade'' _ appearing
in some ads since 1998 _ is being broadened to include all models,
from the Sierra and Yukon to the Envoy. ``We are professional
grade'' is the theme of the campaign, which features GMC engineers
involved in the creation and production of the '01 models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can appreciate a well-engineered vehicle, whether
you're pulling a horse trailer or taking landscaping home from Home
Depot,'' said Susan Cantor, executive vice president and managing
director at Lowe Lintas, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic
Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``In research, we discovered all consumers shared one mind-set:
`I'm smart, I'm in the know. And I want to do business with a
company equally in the know,''' she added. ``So we're going to give
them the salient product points they need to buy a truck or SUV.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrasted to that practical, detailed approach is the more
ethereal tack taken by the estimated $25 million campaign by Team
One for the LS 430, formerly known as the LS 400. Its ads carry the
theme ``Imagine how you'll feel driving,'' which is dramatized with
exuberant images ranging from a Roman piazza filled with dancing
couples to a Tuscan countryside populated by singers warbling along
with the Dinah Shore pop tune ``Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a romantic exaggeration, so to speak, an illustration of
the emotional experience of driving the car, the third generation
of our flagship model,'' said Greg Kitzens, corporate marketing
manager for the Lexus division of Toyota Motor Sales USA in
Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been known more for the rational features of our
cars,'' he added. ``As we're introducing more stylish vehicles with
more luxury and more performance, we're seeking a little more
passion, a little more emotion, for our brand.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore that goal, the LS 430 campaign also begins a
revised theme for the Lexus division. ``The passionate pursuit of
perfection'' will replace ``The relentless pursuit of perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dinah Shore's fame for years of singing the ``See the
U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet'' jingle, Kitzens said with a chuckle,
``We hope `Shoo Fly Pie' will be as catchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Catchy also describes a campaign with a budget of more than $20
million that is to begin Friday for the redesigned C-Class line of
cars sold by the Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler. The
campaign, focused on catching drivers in their 30s and 40s rather
than the more typical C-Class buyers in their 50s and 60s, carries
this theme: ``The new C. Live. A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The television, print, Internet and promotional campaign
continues the more playful tone that has typified Mercedes-Benz
advertising since 1995. In one TV spot, stylishly dressed people
produce cartoon-style exaggerated responses when a C-Class car
passes. Their eyes bulge out of their heads, steam pours from their
ears and they float above the pavement in vignettes that seem to
have been a result of the unlikely collaboration of Richard Avedon
and Tex Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reach and connect with'' younger consumers who ``we
acknowledge live life a little differently,'' said Alex Gellert,
partner at the Mercedes' agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York,
part of Omnicom Group. That is reflected in the line at the end of
many of the ads for the C-Class, the lowest-priced Mercedes sold in
this country: ``And by all means, whatever you do, drive a cool
car.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you're  &UR; really &LR;  cool, would you  &UR; say &LR;  you're cool?
</P>

TO QUANN, GOLD IS A GIVEN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the Seattle-area athletes competing at the Sydney
Olympics this month, Megan Quann has the best chance of bringing
home a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Chance? To Quann, it's a given. Start planning that victory
parade and building that new pool in Puyallup, Wash., then unfurl
those banners for the next meet at the Megan Quann Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The brash 16-year-old leaves your head swimming with
possibilities. In Quann's world, they're probabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The junior at Puyallup High School was amazing enough in the
pool last month in Indianapolis, breaking her own American record
in the preliminaries before winning the 100-meter breastroke finals
and earning a berth on the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Quann made bigger ripples once she dried off and began to talk.
She may well supplant Greg Norman as the next Great White Shark, a
fierce competitor with a commanding presence and predatory nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win the gold,'' is what Quann said before she
went to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving, Quann swam a 1:07.12 in the preliminaries,
fastest ever by an American, and proclaimed: ``I'm very happy with
my swim, but I'm not satisfied. Because the world record is such a
low time (1:06.52), people think it's untouchable. I don't feel
that way. I have a goal to break that record, and I believe I can
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 100 breaststroke final, Quann outdid herself
by offering up another swaggering monologue.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that she did not break the world record as predicted,
Quann said: ``I came up a little bit short on that, but leading up
to the Olympics, I'll do that 1:05.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that South Africa's Penny Heyns owns the world-record
mark of 1:06.52, Quann said: ``She's going down. She's 26 or 27,
I'm 16. She's got a lot ahead of her. I'm going to be there, race
my heart out and win that gold.''
</P>
<P>
   In swimming, conquerors usually emerge from the pool, speak
graciously about their opponents and tell warm-and-fuzzy stories
about how their dreams of becoming an Olympian are reality.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes Quann, dissing a South African, talking smack,
making predictions and providing bulletin-board material for a
sport that usually just posts times there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my goals are,'' Quann said from Brisbane,
Australia, where the U.S. swim team is training. ``I can accomplish
what I set my mind to. Some people say that's cocky; I'm just
saying I know what I can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are afraid to say it, because they're going to get
bad publicity or they're afraid to fail. I just figure if I don't
do it this time, I'll do it next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents used to try to rein her in until Quann proved her
point, reaching what her father, Tom, thought was an unrealistic
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her, `Don't you think you should shoot for something
more reasonable?' I looked at her face, and she was annoyed at me.
Then she went out and did it. Ever since then, I've kept my mouth
shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Quann is already enjoying her Australian experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loving it here,'' she said. ``Everybody is super-nice, the
weather is beautiful, we're right on the beach and I'm swimming
fast in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   When Quann dives into the pool at the Sydney International
Aquatic Center, it will be in front of 18,000 fans, all seated on
one side of the facility. ``You look up and can't even see the top
row,'' Quann said.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers are as well-known in Australia as NBA stars are in the
United States. When Quann walks down the streets of Brisbane,
people know who she is.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of these Games, she might be known around the globe.
NBC spent three days with her a couple of months ago at her home,
preparing a Quann feature.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll see is a bedroom filled with good-luck banners,
medals and posters of various swimmers, including a former American
sweetheart, Janet Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really very little wall space (left),'' said Tom
Quann.
</P>
<P>
   She might have to find room for another medal, maybe more. Asked
if she planned to win gold, Quann said: ``Definitely ... two of
'em.'' Quann also hopes to swim in the 400-medley relay in the
breaststroke leg of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence shows that Quann just may back up her beliefs. In what
might be a gamble for others, Quann tapered with the Olympics in
mind, not the U.S. Olympic swimming trials. That's risky: if you
don't finish in the top two at the trials, you don't get a sniff of
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   If you taper for the trials and qualify for the Games, then you
have to load up on the laps again, and probably won't be in prime
shape for the gold-medal race.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even though Heyns holds the world record, Quann has the
fastest time this year and beat Heyns in the 100 breaststroke last
December in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't gone under 1:08 since the Pan Pacific
(Championships) last year,'' Quann said.
</P>
<P>
   So get out the confetti and ticker tape: Quann will be coming
home Oct. 2, perhaps as a conquering hero.

THE FUTURE IS NOW: YOUTH WILL BE SERVED IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Lewis won't be there. Jackie Joyner-Kersee won't be there.
Matt Ghaffari won't be there, either.
</P>
<P>
   But if many of the familiar faces from Olympics past are absent
in Sydney, there are plenty of younger athletes ready to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   Make that very young.
</P>
<P>
   Puyallup (Wash.) high school swimmer Megan Quann is 16 and
doesn't have a driver's license. American backstroker Aaron Peirsol
is 17. Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe is 17. American weightlifter
Cheryl Haworth is 17. Chinese diver Sang Xue is 16.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, do you feel old yet?
</P>
<P>
   Gymnast brothers Paul and Morgan Hamm are 17. Gymnast Elise Ray
is 18. Australian women's basketball forward/center Lauren Jackson
is 19.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Juan Antonio Samaranch, Harry Potter should preside
over the Games. 'N Sync should sing the national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   They are young enough to be the children of some of the
Olympians, young enough to make Marion Jones seem like a cast
member of the ``Golden Girls.'' But they didn't qualify for the
Olympics by lacking confidence or approaching their sports timidly.
</P>
<P>
   Quann won the 100-meter breaststroke at the U.S. Olympic trials
and is a favorite to win a medal in Sydney, while her classmates
ponder the Pythagorean Theorem on the other side of the world. In
fact, she was disappointed when she won the event, because she
didn't also break the world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually see the 15- and 16-year-olds all bubbly and happy
to be there,'' American gold medalist Rowdy Gaines said. ``Well,
she's not happy just to be there. She wants to win and she wants
the world record.''
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying at the U.S. Trials, Quann predicted that she
will smash the world record and beat reigning world champ Penny
Heyns of South Africa, saying with the confidence and perspective
of youth, ``She's 26 or 27. I'm 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Quann probably won't be the teen with the most medals draped
around her neck at the pool, though.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Thorpedo,'' Thorpe is a sports icon in Australia,
where swimming is virtually the country's national pastime. His
size 17 feet prompted at least one scientist to speculate that they
aid him by working as flippers, but that diminishes his amazing
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe won his first world championship at age 14, set six world
records in an 18-month span and would be a major disappointment if
he didn't win at least two gold medals in Sydney, where he will be
swimming in front of a very partisan home crowd of 15,000 howling
Australians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a heavy burden for him to bear, especially for a
17-year-old,'' Gaines said. ``It could be a crash-and-burn
situation for him, like Mark Spitz in 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol, meanwhile, is closing ground (or water) quickly on
world champion Lenny Krayzelburg, an old man at age 24 in the 200
back.
</P>
<P>
   There are usually young swimmers and gymnasts competing at the
Olympics _ remember Janet Evans in 1988? Nadia Comaneci in 1976? _
but Haworth is a much more interesting case.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where the best weight lifters generally reach their
peak around age 30, she is a serious gold-medal candidate before
being old enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Savannah, Ga., native can lift nearly 300 pounds above her
head (the equivalent of more than two Megan Quanns), leg-press
almost 500 pounds and has a 26-inch vertical leap. She can outlift
any boy in her age group. She lifts 15-30 tons during her two-hour
workouts, more than an offensive lineman might lift in a normal
workout, the equivalent of five African elephants.
</P>
<P>
   She is 5-feet-10 and weighs 306 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   And she's a senior in high school.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, opponents will be dealing with her for a very
long time. As they will with the other teens, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that no matter what happens to me,'' Haworth told
reporters, ``I think I'm going to keep going until I absolutely
can't do it anymore.''

 &HT;    Georgia's Webster always out front
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sydney _ Not long ago, Antoine Webster was running out front
during his baseball workouts. Next thing he knew, he was on a ``747
double-decker '' headed to the Olympics. Not bad for a boy of 13.
</P>
<P>
   This kid from Lithonia, Ga., is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   One of 50 youngsters from nine countries who came here this week
for a track and field competition put on by Adidas, Webster has
been living the life. When he gets back to his ninth-grade class at
Stephenson High School on Monday, he won't be wearing any gold
medals. But give him a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's been:
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Pacific. ``I got up on the board about four times,
but it was extremely cold, big-time. We wore wet suits, but it
didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking out Australian wildlife at the Sydney Aquarium. ``We
saw the sharks, the penguins, the crocodiles, the seals. I'd never
seen seals or penguins in person before. Or sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the flavor of kangaroo: ``If I find a place, I might
try it. It's all about new experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Webster makes the 2004 Olympic team, he's already
a hero. He won the 200-meter in the friendly Adidas
competitionWednesday, and placed second in his group in the
800-meter.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches noticed that he was swift when he was 7 or 8. During
baseball warm-ups, ``I used to be in the front a lot. So I went out
for track, and I've been good ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident in all the games we have done that Antoine is an
excellent athlete,'' said Jennifer Thomas, a promotions specialist
with Adidas America. ``He's a fabulous kid.
</P>
<P>
   A straight-A student who won an essay contest that got him into
the preliminary sports competition in Sacramento, Calif., earlier
this year, Webster is undoubtedly the apple of the eye of his mom,
Felecia Williams, a U.S. Postal Service supervisor in Atlanta. ``I
have three choices for a profession, either be an architect, an
engineer or a doctor,'' he says. ``I don't know. I haven't narrowed
down the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   So many choices. The other night, they fed him a fancy dish of
pasta and salmon. It was so-so. ``Now if they had put a plate of
catfish in front of me, I would have eaten that.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a life-long Georgia boy.

campaign day

   LEWISTON, Maine _ Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore
grabbed four hours' sleep and downed a blueberry scone Wednesday
before picking up his already brutal campaign pace, teaching a high
school history class in Maine, taking a ferry boat ride in
Massachusetts and rallying supporters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president emerged from the home of Lewiston High School
teachers Donald and Susan Jalbert shortly after 7 a.m. and posed
for a photo with the family after spending the night on their
fold-out couch.
</P>
<P>
   On his way down the driveway, he turned back to whisper
something to 12-year-old Marissa Jalbert, who was still in her bare
feet, getting ready for school. She ran inside the house and
returned to hand Gore a diet soda as he boarded a van with the
Jalberts and their 16-year-old son, Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jalbert said that Gore, who arrived late Tuesday after
attending a fund-raiser in New Jersey, had stayed up talking with
the family until after 2 a.m. Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   At Lewiston High, the vice president gave history students a
lesson on the Electoral College and presidential term limits, ate
lunch in the school cafeteria, and promised to help parents pay for
their children's college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of you who wants to go to college, ought to be able
to go to college, regardless of your family's income,'' Gore told
the students. ``And I say that not just because it's good for you,
but because it's good for our country.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent the week touting his 10-year, $170 billion
education plan, calling for universal preschool, increased teacher
salaries and standards, smaller class sizes and funding to fix
decaying schools and to connect more schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he turned his attention to college education,
pledging to increase enrollment by making tuition tax-deductible,
increasing federal education grants and creating tax-free savings
plans to pay for lifelong education and job-training to keep up
with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan includes a tax deduction for up to $10,000 a year
spent on tuition and fees for college, graduate school or
job-training. It also would create a 401(j) account, modeled after
the 401(k), to allow workers to get employer matching funds to save
tax-free for their children's college or their own continuing
education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposes creating a National College Tuition Savings
plan, which would link existing state programs that allow parents
to pre-pay their children's college tuition at today's rates. He
would expand the federal Pell grant program to help more low-income
students and would reduce interest rates for student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many kids are graduating from college with the equivalent
of a home mortgage, and they don't have a home,'' Gore told a group
of parents, teachers and students gathered in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then they (ITAL) come (UNITAL) home,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with that debt, many young people are forced to launch
immediately into high-paying careers without having time to explore
other options, such as considering lower-paying teaching jobs or
taking time out to volunteer before beginning their working life.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore flew to Boston for a rally, where he was confronted
with protesters denouncing, among other things, the Gore family's
ties with Occidental Petroleum and the company's plans to drill
near lands claimed by the U'Wa, (CQ) an indigenous people in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators interrupted Gore's speech with chants, and a
group of the vice president's supporters briefly scuffled with the
protesters until police separated the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hear it for the First Amendment,'' Gore said before
continuing his address. ``Let's hear it for free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gore in Boston were his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., and Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, Gore was to attend a Democratic National
Committee fund-raiser featuring singer James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he has scheduled a visit to a junior high school in
Manchester, N.H., before joining daughters Karenna Gore-Schiff and
Sarah Gore in New York for a youth event.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he is to appear on the ``David Letterman Show'' and
attend another DNC fund-raising concert, this one at Radio City
Music Hall and featuring Jimmy Buffett, Bette Midler and Paul
Simon, among many other performers who are helping him bring in
more than $7 million total for the Democratic Party this week.

COMMERCIALISM IN SCHOOLS IS EXAMINED IN A NEW REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Wis., Ala., Va.)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From exclusive soft-drink contracts to computers displaying
continuous advertising, corporate marketing in public schools is
rising sharply. But few states have laws in place to address the
phenomenon, and most decisions on commercial arrangements in
schools are made piecemeal by local officials, according to a
report from the General Accounting Office scheduled to be released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-school marketing has become a growing industry,'' the
report stated. ``Some marketing professionals are increasingly
targeting children in schools, companies are becoming known for
their success in negotiating contracts between school districts and
beverage companies, and both educators and corporate managers are
attending conferences to learn how to increase revenue from
in-school marketing for their schools and companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been no comprehensive effort to measure the
number of commercial contracts with schools. But school board
officials, consultants and nonprofit organizations that follow
education issues say it is clear that such contracts are far more
common now than they were even two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of the nation's middle schools and high schools
now show Channel One, a broadcast of news features and commercials,
in their classrooms, and about 200 school districts have signed
exclusive contracts with soft-drink companies to sell their
beverages in schools. And in at least one case, students using
computers in classrooms were offered incentives to enter personal
data _ names, addresses, information on personal habits _ which
would then be sold to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that the nation's 47.2 million students are an
increasingly lucrative target market for consumer product
companies, school districts are often willing to join with
corporations. They see the money as one way to supplement tight
budgets without having to raise taxes. But at the same time, few
school officials are an even match for experienced corporate
marketers. ``They're trained in the three R's, and the R's don't
include retail,'' one North Carolina school official noted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, many school districts have signed
contracts with soft-drink giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsico, in
which vending machines in hallways function as glowing billboards
for their brands. A math textbook published in 1995 by McGraw-Hill
and approved for use in about 15 states names many consumer
products, including Gatorade, Sega and Sony video games and Nike
sneakers, in its problems. McGraw-Hill said it received no
compensation for the use of the corporate names.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Zap Me, which is based in California, offer
schools free computers with screens that include continuously
flashing ads. Zap Me also collects personal information that
students provide and makes it available to advertisers, said Daniel
Weiss, an aide to Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report cites textbook covers distributed by Clairol,
Ralph Lauren, Reebok and Philip Morris with their company names and
logos fully displayed. In New York City, the Board of Education is
considering a plan that would provide computers for all of its
students, starting in the fourth grade. The computers might carry
ads and possibly encourage shopping on a particular Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Soft Drink Association said local
bottlers signed contracts with the schools in part to support the
schools and in part to promote their products. ``The brand loyalty
that is gained by having these products available to kids when they
get thirsty during the day is valuable to these companies,'' said
Sean McBride, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   All the activity has aroused concern in communities from
Montclair, N.J., to Madison, Wis., to Birmingham, Ala., where
companies have made deals with schools that let them promote their
products to students. The demand for product placement in schools
has even created a separate consulting niche.
</P>
<P>
   School districts are expected to make decisions about commercial
agreements using their own discretion, said Renee Williams
Hockaday, a spokeswoman for the National School Boards Association
in Alexandria, Va. ``It is obviously a growing issue,'' she said,
adding that the agreements ``could be something positive, as long
as the students don't turn into walking advertisements for these
companies with no benefit to their learning environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared over the last year, is the first government
study to address commercialism in schools. It stops short of
pinpointing the effects of in-school advertising, noting that
``because advertising is ubiquitous in America, it is difficult _
if not impossible _ to distinguish between the effects of
advertising to which students are exposed inside and outside of
school.'' The GAO will study the issue again in the next year or so
and quantify the spread of commercial activity in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which includes color photographs of ads atop school
bus stops, over computer carrels and on soda vending machines, was
ordered by Miller, and Sen. Christopher Dodd, a D-Conn. In an
interview, Miller said he was prompted by concern over data being
collected about students through computers given to their schools
by Zap Me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of attention is being paid to whether parents agree
with this or want their children to participate or not
participate,'' he said. ``Sometimes parents have a different
opinion from that of the superintendent or the school board.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he planned to send letters to parent-teacher groups
around the country to urge them to read the report. There is still
time, he said, for lawmakers and others to resolve the issues.
``This hasn't gotten totally out of hand yet,'' he said. ``Most
schools are still doing a pretty good job.'' He added, however,
that he was shocked that many schools said they were unaware that
the ``free'' computers they received from companies could be used
to collect, and sell, marketing data from their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of information being solicited
and used to market back to kids without administrative consent or
parental consent,'' he said. ``If you had an 8-year-old or a
10-year-old, would you allow someone to come into your house to do
a survey on your child without your consent?''
</P>
<P>
   The report is being hailed by some as proof that commercial
activity in schools is a growing threat. ``This is the first
official government confirmation that commercialism in schools is a
problematic issue,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw, director of the Center
for Commercial-Free Public Education in Oakland, Calif., which has
waged many grass-roots battles against soft-drink contracts and
Channel One. ``Public schools are publicly funded and are supposed
to be the one place where kids don't get advertised to. It's
completely inappropriate to turn that venue into a place where
companies get to promote brand-name products.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelshaw said he had seen something of a backlash against
commercialism in schools recently. Last year, the 15-million-member
Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution against Channel
One, because it advertises to schoolchildren. In Madison, Wis., one
of the first school districts to sign an exclusive soft-drink
contract with Coca-Cola, the school board recently voted not to
renew the arrangement. San Francisco has one of the toughest
anti-commercialism policies in the country, which was invoked
earlier this year to turn down an exclusive contract with Pepsi,
Hagelshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime critic of commercial activity in schools
predicted that the report would encourage state legislatures to
act. ``This is going to raise the visibility of this issue
enormously,'' said Alex Molnar, a professor of education at the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who directs the university's
three-year-old Center for the Analysis of Commercialism in
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Dodd have sponsored a bill, now part of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that is pending before the
House and would require parental consent for market-research
activities in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not pretend this is child's play,'' Miller said. ``This
is not some benevolent effort to give away computers. This is a
cold, calculating effort to make customers out of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar says students could be harmed by the promotion of
products through schools. ``One could argue that a person comes to
the marketplace skeptical, as a consumer,'' he said, ``but in a
school, everything that's going on is supposed to be good for you.
When you take that venue and you exploit it for a particular
special interest, you do a lot of damage to children.'' For
example, he added, soft drinks, candy, snack food and fast food are
all advertised in schools in many places, lending them a
credibility they may not deserve nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, this is the kind of thing that promotes cynicism
in children,'' he said.

GORE GETS THE HARBOR TOUR ON ARRIVAL IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a morning spent preaching his education policies
in Maine, Al Gore paid a visit Wednesday to the choir: heavily
Democratic Boston, for a rally at Long Wharf and a million-dollar
fund-raiser at the Park Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his running mate, Connecticut Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, and two Kennedys _
Senator Edward Kennedy and his nephew, former Representative Joseph
Kennedy _ Gore arrived in novel fashion, with a blustery ferry ride
across a gleaming Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene reminiscent of Camelot, Senator Kennedy pointed out
landmarks to Gore and Lieberman, dressed casually, the wind
whipping their hair.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set over the harbor, lighting up the many sailboats
behind him, Gore told an appreciative crowd of about two thousand
of his great fondness for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this city,'' Gore said. ``I proposed to my wife Tipper
in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Gore's and Lieberman's rallying cries found cheers, all
the punchlines laughter. At one point, Menino, as if conceding the
redundancy of the rally, urged those in the crowd to spread the
word on to people in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got this crowd well prepared, Teddy,'' Lieberman joked
at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite well prepared enough, however. When Gore rose to
speak, discordant notes arose in this unlikeliest of places, as a
small but loud group of protesters raised signs and chanted, ``Al
Gore's a corporate puppet!'' and ``Fair trade, not free trade!''
and ``No blood for oil!''
</P>
<P>
   One Gore supporter moved close to the group and began shaking a
Gore sign, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more signs,'' he said, forlornly.
</P>
<P>
   More came, as a group of black T-shirted Carpenters' Union
members rushed over to block the protesters. A scuffle ensued, and
police, who descended on the area, removed the unionists, leaving
the protesters to their chants.
</P>
<P>
   They were so loud that Gore eventually had to recognize them.
``Let's hear it for the First Amendment,'' he yelled, to deafening
cheers. ``Let's hear it for freedom of speech!''
</P>
<P>
   From then on, he pulled out all the stops to whip the crowd into
cheers loud enough to take back the rally.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the I-may-be-boring-but-I-can-do-a-great-job mantra
begun with his speech at the Democratic National Convention, in a
form especially tailored to his audience: ``I will not always be
the most exciting politician, like Tom Menino,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More deafening cheers.
</P>
<P>
   From the rally, at which he hit many populist notes, Gore went
on to the Western-themed fund-raiser at the Park Plaza, where
singer James Taylor was to entertain the crowd. A thousand guests
each paid $1,000 to attend the event, which raised $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was typical of Gore's campaign style, mixing detailed
discussion of the issues with boisterous rallies and glittering
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after yet another day devoted to his education message,
Gore plans to appear on the ``David Letterman Show'' in New York
and attend yet another money marathon, picking up $5 million at a
Radio City Music Hall gala hosted by Michael Douglas, and attended
by actors Julia Roberts and Ben Affleck, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   But between the celebrity-filled events, Gore relentlessly
focuses on the issue he is convinced will help him win the
election: education.
</P>
<P>
   He spent Tuesday night at the home of a Maine teacher, as he
often does on what he calls ``school days.'' Wednesday, he headed
to Lewiston High School. Addressing the US history class of teacher
Joan M. Macri, Gore got a lesson himself. The blackboard featured
pictures of past presidents including George Bush, the father of
his Republican opponent, as well as a fact sheet about the
difficulty of vice presidents ascending to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ended his visit to Lewiston High at one of his favorite
venues, a packed-to-the-rafters gymnasium, filled with cheering
students, cheerleaders, and marching bands. ``You're our Maine
man,'' a poster said. While Maine has only four electoral votes,
the state is considered a tossup that could make a difference on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day at a news conference on the State House
steps, Governor Paul Cellucci gave Gore failing grades on his
education record and proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The governor stood in front of a placard labeled ``Al Gore's
Education Report Card.'' He gave the vice-president a ``D-'' on
``cutting red tape'' and three ``F's'' for ``closing the
achievement gap,'' ``insisting on accountabilty and standards'' and
``expanding parental choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said US students have dropped further behind their
international competitors during the Clinton-Gore adnministration.
He hailed Bush for supporting Texas reforms, such as a high-stakes
standardized test and a school rating system, that may have boosted
that state's scores on national tests. Bush didn't initiate those
reforms, but he has been credited with keeping them in place.

APPLE BREAKS THE MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(Editors: In a sidebar, CIR-APPLE-BETA, Times staffers install the
software --in about 25 minutes -- and describe a visually stunning
interface, a system that can be immediately used in English, French
or German and other changes, including the absence of the
chooser.) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Apple Computer introduced a fundamentally new
operating system was in 1984, when System 1.0 shipped with the
original Macintosh computer. Ronald Reagan was president, Steve
Jobs was the chairman of Apple, and the consumer embrace of Windows
was still several years away. (In those days many computers ran on
the DOS platform, which involved a lot of typed commands instead of
pointing and clicking.)
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been upgrades and false starts, and Jobs
has gone and returned. Wednesday, after years of waiting by the
Macintosh faithful, Apple Computer released to the public a beta
version of its Mac OS X (10) operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   The system is new not only in its new interface, called Aqua,
but also at its core, which is based on the stable Unix operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the single most anticipated release from Apple ever,''
proclaimed the Mac Observer, a Web site devoted to Macintosh news,
late last week before the beta became available. ``The eyes of the
Mac world, the PC world, Wall Street and a few other places will be
focused on Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   While the stakes are high for Apple, the new operating system
could have an impact on the rest of the computer world as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If MacOS X is accepted,'' said Andreas Pfeiffer, editor of the
industry newsletter The Pfeiffer Report on Emerging Trends and
Technologies, ``it will also help re-establish Apple as an
innovator in the operating-systems space, where the company has
kept a relatively low profile lately, and alongside with the
continuing growth of Linux, it will contribute to the erosion of
the Windows domination of the overall computing market.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who would like to pay for the opportunity to try out the
new operating system and help find those last few bugs can order a
CD and a manual from Apple's Web site (store.apple.com) for $29.95
plus tax. The price, which Jobs announced Wednesday in his keynote
speech at the Apple Expo in Paris, may come as a surprise to those
hoping to download the code free from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience, however, did not seem to take offense,''
Pfeiffer said in an e-mail message from Paris, ``and when one
thinks things over, it probably makes a lot of sense, since only
motivated users will actually pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac addicts should know that they are using the software at
their own risk. A beta test is usually considered to be the last
stage of examination and evaluation for software code before it is
released to customers in its final form. Bugs and glitches may lurk
within the code, and many users who rely on a functioning Mac won't
touch a beta release with a 10-foot mouse. But software
thrill-seekers will often jump at the chance to see a product
early, find problems with it and report them to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a company has released a test version of the
software to the public isn't news in itself. Microsoft released a
beta versions of Windows 98 to impatient consumers for $30. America
Online has even asked for volunteers to test its upgrades free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Releasing Mac OS X as a public beta first is vital,'' Pfeiffer
said. ``The whole software industry seems to have switched to that
model for final stages of testing, and it contributes significantly
to ironing out bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Apple has offered a public beta release
of any operating system, according to Philip Schiller, the vice
president of worldwide marketing at Apple Computer. He said there
were various ways for customers to file bug reports and comments on
the beta, including a link right on the desktop of Mac OS X that
would take users to the appropriate place on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company would ask the beta's users for surveys
and comments. The beta-testing period is expected to last into
early next year, and the beta software itself would expire in May
2001. Pricing for the final version is not yet set.
</P>
<P>
   What is news is that the operating system has appeared. Back in
1994 Apple announced a new state-of-the-art operating system in the
works code-named Copland. It was going to be the silver bullet that
saved Apple from its internal woes and from losing any more ground
to Microsoft in the platform wars that were heightened by the
introduction of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Copland never made it to the marketplace. Technical problems and
the company's turbulence in the mid-1990s didn't help matters, and
while bits of the Copland system were incorporated into later
system upgrades, including Mac OS 7.6 and 8.0, a truly new system
has not appeared until now.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's System 1.0 consisted of six files that took up 216
kilobytes of space. In comparison, the Mac OS X beta has system
requirements that seem hefty enough to launch a space shuttle.
Apple advises users to have a computer that can spare 1.5 gigabytes
of hard-drive space and will need 128 megabytes of RAM to operate
the beta system, although the final release is expected to require
only 64 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Beta testers will also need to possess a Power Macintosh
computer with at least a G3 chip and Mac OS 9. Apple states that
any G3 machine (including all iMac and iBook models) except the
original G3 PowerBook can run the Mac OS X beta software.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the Mac OS X beta showed Aqua to be visually
stunning, with updated, more detailed graphics, and easy to
navigate. At least on a G4 Power Cube system provided by Apple, it
refused to crash.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down the list for all the things that customers want
in an operating system, we feel we have addressed it all,''
Schiller said. ``Stability is No. 1. OS X is designed to meet all
customer needs, from the consumer to the educator to the desktop
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing programs that run on Mac OS 9 should work on X, and
Apple states that more than 200 different developers, including
Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, have
agreed to create versions of their software for the new system.
</P>
<P>
   That reliable Unix kernel underneath all the Aqua has already
attracted the attention of software developers who might create new
applications for Macintosh. (Unix is a supremely stable,
industrial-strength operating system favored by computer
professionals for everything from scientific and academic
applications to running Web sites.) Schiller said that 5,000
developers had been given copies of the OS X code for use in
creating new programs.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures supplied by Roger Kay of the International
Data Corp., Apple Computer currently holds a 3.4 percent share of
the computer market worldwide. How much interest the beta project
generates outside the Mac community remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that Mac OS X is just another new product for
Apple and won't have the `make or break' impact that everyone
ascribed to Copland,'' said Owen W. Linzmayer, author of ``Apple
Confidential,'' a history of the company, in an e-mail message. ``I
think Mac OS X will be greeted with a warm welcome from the
Macintosh faithful, but is likely to be ignored by the mass market
no matter how much better than Windows it happens to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said: ``If Mac OS X succeeds, it will once again put
the Macintosh in a class of its own. Not only will the operating
system look significantly different _ and in a consumer market,
looks do count, as Apple has proven with the iMac _ it will also be
the first consumer OS based on a solid Unix foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overhaul, one thing that hasn't changed with all
this change is that when the beta OS X boots up, the little Mac
face that has been part of all Mac systems before still smiles at
the user. If the beta testing is a success and the final release of
Mac OS X delivers on its promises, that little Mac may be grinning
even more widely in years to come.

H&AMP;R BLOCK ANNUAL MEETING PAYS TRIBUTE TO RETIRING CO-FOUNDER HENRY
BLOCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Shareholders and employees of H&AMP;R Block Inc.
gave retiring company co-founder and Chairman Henry Bloch a
standing ovation Wednesday at the company's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch's departure, which was announced earlier this year, marks
the first time since just after World War II that the Kansas
City-based enterprise or a predecessor company, United Business
Co., has been without a member of the Bloch family at its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a company is a lot like raising a child,'' Bloch told
shareholders, employees and other guests at the meeting at the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to instill values, purpose and character. You work
hard. You take some risks. You worry a lot. Along the way, you try
to provide direction, guidance and set an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the child grows up and comes into its own and, if you are
lucky, surprises you by accomplishing great things _ things you
never imagined possible. That has been so true of my life with this
company.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-minute video tribute _ narrated by veteran newsman
Walter Cronkite _ that outlined Block's growth from a second-story
walk-up office near 31st and Main streets to an international
enterprise serving more than 19 million clients worldwide, Bloch
reflected on his career. He spoke of the enterprise's significant
milestones _ franchising the operation in the late 1950s; becoming
publicly traded and expanding across the United States and into
Canada and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s; and its forays into
electronic filing in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shared smooth highways, navigated a few bumpy roads,
even taken a few wrong turns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked family members and key executives whose help and
guidance made those milestones possible and the entire group of
thousands of longtime tax preparers and other associates who, by
earning the trust and loyalty of millions of customers over the
decades, have become what he called the heart and soul of H&AMP;R
Block.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping those bonds will be vital to the company's future as it
continues to expand into new and more complex financial services
enterprises, Bloch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we adhere to high standards, I believe our
customers will continue to appreciate us and our company will
continue to thrive,'' Bloch said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank L. Salizzoni, who succeeds Bloch as company chairman, and
Mark Ernst, the company's president and chief operating officer,
pledged to maintain those high standards as an important part of a
strategy to recover from setbacks in the last 12 months on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Investors dismayed by Block's acquisition last year of Olde
Financial Corp., the nation's fourth-largest discount brokerage
operation, and by lower than expected earnings in the year ended
April 30 have sold shares so heavily that the total value of
Block's shares on the market has dropped more than 40 percent in
less than 12 months, Salizzoni said.
</P>
<P>
   To recover, ``we're developing plans that build on the strengths
of our business and also address the difficulties of this past
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders peppered company executives with questions about
recent litigation, higher pricing for company services and changes
in the management structure at some tax service offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the concern about pricing,'' Ernst said. He said the
company was reviewing its prices and practices to make sure
customers were getting full value for services offered.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst told shareholders that the esteem and trust that Block had
developed with tax clients over the years would be an important
element of future plans.

 &HT;    Americans welcomed to Village
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sydney _ The U.S. Olympic team received its official welcome and
the American flag was raised today in the Olympic Village. The flag
waved against the backdrop of a massive Cuban flag draped over
three stories of a four-story residential building.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 athletes, coaches and USOC officials attended the
welcoming ceremony, which was one of 32 staged today. Another 45
will be staged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, it brought tears to my eyes,'' taekwondo player
Barbara Kunkel said. ``The kids singing the `G'day Song' _ we're
trying to find out if we can get it on CD _ and just hearing the
national anthem again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabine Sugarman of Atlanta, a protocol manager in the village,
was chosen by her staff to carry the placard for the U.S. team in
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very inspiring to be with the athletes,'' said Sugarman,
who was protocol manager of the Olympic family hotel in Atlanta.
``You get a very good feeling about humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Children wearing body paint and the traditional costume
performed a program of Aboriginal dance. Some 50 students from an
elementary school sang ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' with an Aussie
twang, along with the specially composed ``G'day Song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a wonderful village here,'' said Sandra Baldwin, the
U.S. chef de mission, or team leader, who received a ceremonial
``message stick.'' ``We've got a very focused team and they're just
a great bunch of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly hopes so. If there's trouble, as in Nagano where
U.S. hockey players trashed some of the rooms, Baldwin will have to
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   GYMNASTICS
</P>
<P>
   Close call for McCain
</P>
<P>
   U.S. gymnast Stephen McCain did not mind that the name card at
his seat read ``Stephanie'' at a news conference Wednesday. He was
just glad to be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   McCain suffered a serious ankle sprain 11 days ago at a training
camp and did not know until Wednesday if he would be healthy enough
to compete in the Olympics. Coach Peter Kormann tested McCain at
podium training Wednesday. ``He responded with brilliance,''
Kormann said. ``He gets the badge of courage for today.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain hurt himself during a training camp in San Diego on a
floor-exercise dismount. ``Needless to say, I did it very bad and
landed on my face and crunched both my ankles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The right ankle was worse than the left, and the next morning
McCain was on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up and started crying because I couldn't even stand on
my feet,'' McCain said. ``To make the team, and then all of a
sudden, it was like it was gone _ it was hard to cope with at
first.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain probably will be the third all-arounder, with Blaine
Wilson and Paul Hamm, because three-time Olympian John
Roethlisberger has sore legs and a strained calf muscle and cannot
do floor exercise or vault.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHTLIFTING
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the bride
</P>
<P>
   U.S. weightlifting team reserve Suzanne Leathers won't march in
the Opening Ceremonies. Instead, she'll walk down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Leathers, a Rhode Island native who has been training in
Savannah, and Don McCauley will wed today at the Bankstown Sports
Club in suburban Sydney. U.S. coach Michael Cohen of Savannah will
give Leathers away, with teammates Cheryl Haworth, Cara Heads-Lane
and Robin Goad in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The bride and groom even invited the international media and
vowed to be available for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Some bus drivers walk out
</P>
<P>
   Transport problems at the Games intensified when dozens of
drivers quit the Olympic bus service, saying they were angry about
working conditions and poor organization of timetables. Fifty
drivers reportedly failed to come to work Wednesday.... The
International Olympic Committee ended its three-day session by
choosing 14 new members, including U.S. Olympic committee president
Bill Hybl and former Kenyan distance running great Kip Keino.
Thomas Bach, a former German Olympic fencing champion, was elected
as one of the IOC's four vice presidents, defeating Japan's Chiharu
Igaya. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was one of
five ``honor members'' chosen.... U.S. baseball team pitcher Jon
Rauch, who had a combined 16-4 record and a 2.66 ERA at two
minor-league levels, was selected minor league player of year by
Baseball America.... Bulgarian triple and long jumper Iva
Prandzheva and Kazakstan swimmer Yevgeniya Yermakova were barred
from the Games after positive drug tests.

UP AND RUNNING IN 25 MINUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CIR-APPLE) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER WITH DON DONOFRIO

<P>
   The Mac OS X beta software comes neatly packaged from Apple
inside a clean white folder with a big blue X on the front. Even
though Apple says X should be pronounced ``ten,'' the enigmatic
appeal of the letter X seems vaguely more appropriate. X, after
all, is the unknown _ and the unknown is both the joy and the curse
of betaware.
</P>
<P>
   Following documentation included with the Mac OS X CD-ROM, we
installed a copy of the Mac OS X beta onto a separate 9-gigabyte
disk partition (akin to giving the OS a hard drive all its own) of
a 400-megahertz iMac running Mac OS 9.0.4 with 128 megabytes of
RAM. We were up and running in about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have a lot of time to jump into OS X and pound on it,
so what follows is mostly what we observed, not the results of a
true test. The system generally behaved quite well, although it
would get sluggish on occasion
</P>
<P>
   The Aqua interface is visually stunning, but it took a few
minutes to adjust to some of the new features. The old standby
Apple Menu is gone, as is the Chooser. Applications can be launched
from the Dock, the animated palette at the bottom of the screen,
from the applications' icon or desktop aliases. The desktop and the
Finder have been separated, and the Finder now reveals your
computer's contents in a window that resembles a Web browser's,
with shortcut and Back buttons and three different views.
</P>
<P>
   Open windows seem to hover in the foreground of the screen,
casting shadows on the desktop and other windows underneath them.
Animated Save dialog boxes glide down from document title bars, and
buttons slowly pulsate until clicked. Each title bar contains a
Minimize button that sends the windows swirling into the Dock when
clicked. The System Preferences icon in the Dock allows users to
change system settings, much like the Control Panels in the Apple
menu used to do. There are even options for running the system in
English, French or German right out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   We were able to switch back and forth between Mac OS 9 and the
OS X beta systems, and even work in old software programs and print
documents in what Apple calls the Classic environment, which
basically flips you back into OS 9 for using older software
programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the user interface is elegant and intuitive, it is merely
eye candy if all it does is look pretty. The core of the system is
called Darwin, which is based on the Berkeley Software Distribution
variant of Unix. It contains all the hallmarks of a modern
operating system, like pre-emptive multitasking and protected
memory. Pre-emptive multitasking basically means that the system
will work faster and more efficiently. Protected memory (which can
be seen in action with the included Process Manager application)
which protects against the whole system crashing when a single
program does. Unfortunately, the Classic environment is not
protected this way. The booklet included with the beta CD was
clearly written and provided comparisions between Mac OS 9 and Mac
OS X that helped make sense of the changes in OS X more quickly.
The beta is not a complete system, as support for many
network-related functions and external hardware devices aren't
included yet.
</P>
<P>
   Beta hopefuls will need to have a machine running Mac OS 9 with
least a G3 processor, 128 megabytes of RAM, 1.5 gigbytes if hard
disk space and an internal video card. The original G3 PowerBook
and computers upgraded with G3 cards are not supported. Full system
requirements and support information are available on Apple's Web
site at www.apple.com/support/macosx.
</P>
<P>
   As with all beta software, however, the user should be aware
that it is still a work-in-progress and putting it on any Mac that
is critical to daily work or functions is not advised. If you have
the resources to try the Mac OS X beta, there is a lot of
intriguing new territory _ and probably some bugs _ to explore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So is the Mac OS X beta for you?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on how you plan to use it. The beta comes complete
with a useable email client and a blazingly fast version of
Microsoft Internet Explorer written for OS X. There is a growing
list of other applications written for it, which will become
available as the beta becomes more widely used. Using Mac OS X is a
real treat.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning interface is intuitive and is new while still
feeling mac-like. However, if you will need to rely heavily on
applications that require the Classic environment, it would be best
to wait for a more mature version of Mac OS X.

MAKING A TRAGEDY WITH A HAPPY ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)  
 By ANN POWERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bjork Gudmundsdottir hopes that people realize that ``Dancer in
the Dark'' is not a tragedy. Despite this Icelandic singer's
blood-and-guts-spilling performance in the role of Selma, which won
this year's best-actress award at Cannes, Bjork says the film's
final vision is of one of her favorite spiritual states: joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought that this was a film with a happy ending,''
Bjork said in an interview recently. ``For sure. That's one aspect
of what the film is trying to say: when the need for something
brilliant is so great, you can create it with the human spirit
alone. And it isn't artificial. It's real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancer in the Dark,'' chosen to open the New York Film
Festival on Sept. 22, is positively Greek in its fatalism. The
route it takes to its transcendental outcome costs Selma as much as
the most devastated queen of a Douglas Sirk melodrama ever endured.
Selma is a Czech immigrant factory worker in the Pacific Northwest,
a good woman who is losing her sight and who resorts to desperate
measures to save her son from the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   But magic bursts through the surface of this unhappy tale, in
the grand song-and-dance numbers Selma stages in her mind.
Reminiscent of Bertolt Brecht's theater of alienation and Dennis
Potter's post-modern musicals, ``Dancer in the Dark'' is a musical
about the battle music wages for the soul's transformation amid the
din of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was, in a way, the duality of the film,'' Bjork said.
``Reality versus fantasy, film versus music, male versus female, it
could go on forever. And only at one point do these elements
unite.'' She was speaking of the film's devastating end.
</P>
<P>
   Selma triumphs, on her own terms, by finding the strength to be
euphoric. The quest for that feeling is one Bjork knows well. In
her three solo albums, mixing the folk styles of her native country
with symphonic structures and ultra-modern electronic music, Bjork
has found sonic expression for the clash between rules and
emotions, between the body's limits and the mind's wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges she sets herself have made her one controversial
diva, the pop equivalent to ``Dancer in the Dark's'' revered and
scorned director, Lars von Trier. The union of these two insurgents
has provoked intense reaction. Booed at the Cannes International
Film Festival this spring, the film went on to win the festival's
top prize. Its Website (www.dancerinthedarkmovie.com), sponsored by
the Fine Line film company, opens with the phrases ``Love It'' and
``Hate It,'' along with blurbs from critics reflecting both
responses. Entertainment Weekly called it ``a triumph of form,
content and artistic integrity.'' Variety condemned it as
``artistically bankrupt on every level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjork is accustomed to slaps and kisses like this. What bothers
her is the gossip circulating about the struggles _ the tantrums,
the flights from the set, the rending of garments! _ between
herself and von Trier during filming. That is why she is fielding
questions, something she hates to do. But here she is, wearing a a
slightly stained Chinese pink silk dress in a penthouse suite at
the Soho Grand hotel, explaining herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put three years of my life into this, and people are just
kind of walking in there with dirty shoes,'' Bjork said of the way
the work is being obscured by tales of bad behavior. ``But I'm a
defender of the need for a haven in which to create. I'm sorry,
Lars could sit here next to me and we could say it was tough, but
we were just doing what the roles demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Confrontation was exactly what von Trier wanted, Bjork said.
``He already was an ambassador for his own universe,'' she
explained. ``Law and order, Dogma'' _ the back-to-basics filmmaking
collective he founded in 1995 _ ``the policeman. He needed someone
to represent the other half. When we started to work on this
project, 50 percent of everything was sitting there waiting for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   At times Bjork did not want to be von Trier's female alter ego
on the set. Originally she agreed only to compose the film's music,
but she grew attached to Selma's story and was persuaded by the
director to take on the role. Their collaboration was explosive,
but she ultimately kept her commitment to do what she had been
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Iceland working on the film score, Lars sent me
a pink silk cushion, like really big, embroidered in Icelandic,''
she recalled. ``It said, `I promise to always say how I feel about
everything, because otherwise Lars will manipulate me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to the film's emotional fever pitch demanded
discipline. Untrained as an actress, and with only one small film
role to her credit (as a good witch in the 1987 film ``The Juniper
Tree''), Bjork took a more instinctive approach to interpreting
Selma. She immersed herself in the part, to the point where it
sometimes worried her friends. Her fellow cast members offered
support, especially Catherine Deneuve, whose encouragement mirrored
her film role as Cathy, Selma's co-worker and strong best friend.
For all involved, Bjork's process was painful to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was naive and not able to undress herself from the part at
the end of the day,'' said Vincent Paterson, the film's dance
director and choreographer, who also plays Samuel, Selma's director
in an endearingly amateurish community production of ``The Sound of
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The slapping Gene scene'' _ in which Selma punishes her son _
``took her two days,'' Paterson continued. ``At one point she asked
if could have a stand-in do it. And the killing scene was
overwhelmingly cathartic and disastrous. We had to party hard
during that time to just get drunk and have her free herself from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the trauma Bjork went through enacting Selma's murder of
Bill, the treacherous friend played by David Morse, offered an
artistic breakthrough. She reacted completely differently from what
von Trier expected, emanating compassion instead of rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to go really angry, run upstairs and kill
him,'' said Bjork of the scene where Selma attacks Bill for
stealing her paltry life savings. ``For me that was just not Selma
at all. The first thing that came into my mind is: poor guy, is he
that desperate, has he gone that far down the line?''
</P>
<P>
   von Trier well knew that Bjork was capable of summoning motherly
fury, because of a much-reported 1996 fracas in which she struck a
journalist trying to interview her son Sindri, now 14, in a Bangkok
airport.. But the director got lucky when Bjork exhibited the
pathos that makes the scene brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of the lioness defending the lion cub,'' she said
of the Bangkok incident. ``And of course losing complete control
and crossing all lines. But Lars talked quite a lot about that. I
think that's one of the reasons he offered me the job. Because
you're seeing a person who would never ever hit anyone in their
life, so it takes so much to make them violent. So when they do,
everything just explodes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The brutality that runs throughout ``Dancer in the Dark'' is
intensified by the exuberant musical numbers that burst forth every
time the plot is about to take a downturn. They operate the way
ecstasy works throughout Bjork's music, as an urgent antidote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the worse things get, the need to be happy is so big
that the songs become happier,'' she said. ``The times when I
wasn't so happy, I would have the fiercest highs. And then when I
am overall satisfied, the peaks are not so sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical numbers in ``Dancer in the Dark'' free Selma, but
not necessarily the viewer. Several factors establish a paradoxical
mix of precision and rawness. One hundred cameras, offering myriad
cuts and angles, created a live feeling. Paterson also clung to the
real world in his choreography, encouraging his dancers to move
spontaneously, as if they were regular people thrust onto the stage
of Selma's visions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attacked it all from Selma's perspective,'' said Paterson,
whose portfolio includes Madonna's ``Blond Ambition'' tour and the
videos for Michael Jackson's ``Bad'' and ``Smooth Criminal.'' ``If
a lay person were to choreograph this, what would they do? I didn't
tell everyone to turn to the left or the right at the same time, so
you got the sense that everything is choreographed, but pedestrian,
in a sense. I felt it was essential that Selma find a haven in
these sequences, but also that it was still her real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between Selma's musical flights and her life is also
embedded in the songs themselves. Each begins with rhythms taken
from the environment _ the whirr of the machines at the factory
where Selma works, the scratching of a sketch artist's pencil in
the courtroom, the clang of the train passing by when Selma's
lovestruck suitor, Jeff (Peter Stormare), realizes she is going
blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have 110 tracks in every song, the orchestra being big
and then all the little noises,'' Bjork said. ``We'd make a
drumbeat out of 20 different noises.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a challenge for Bjork to write with each scene's
environment in mind, rather than simply tuning in to her internal
soundscape. She also found it humbling to compose for other voices.
This focus beyond her own ego became complete when she took on the
role of Selma. That self-negation is what she sought from the
project: she immersed herself in Selma the way Selma surrenders to
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just done three albums that were about me,'' she said.
``At that point in my life, I was willing to give myself up to
something. Being selfish would have felt wrong.''

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji _ This South Pacific archipelago is best known for
its fine-grained white beaches and cloudless vistas of cobalt sea.
It also has more than 100,000 acres of high-grade mahogany, worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A coup here a few months ago toppled the government. For a
relatively bloodless political uprising in a small island nation of
about 830,000, the event attracted some attention. Many accounts
told of how ethnic tension involving indigenous Fijians, who are
ethnic Melanesians, had once again exploded into a public
confrontation with Indo-Fijians, who trace their roots to
indentured laborers whom the British brought here from India a
century ago, when both India and Fiji were crown colonies.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the cries for ethnic solidarity and native Fijian
supremacy was a struggle over land, money and mahogany _ a
competition that involved American and British as well as local
business interests. Like diamonds in Sierra Leone and oil in
Nigeria, Fiji's mahogany helped prompt a struggle for political
power, inflicting damage to the nation's economy and political
system well in excess of the riches the commodity once promised.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's struggle began with two men, who each searched for a pot
of gold and wound up stirring a cauldron of ethnic discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall W. Pettit, a Seattle-area real-estate developer lured
to Fiji by its forests rather than its resorts, said he aspired to
transform the way that developing nations manage their forests _
and make a tidy profit. He also plunged into Fijian politics to
fight the former government's opposition to his plans, though there
is no evidence he backed the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit did, however, have ties to the Fijian who led the revolt,
an American-educated former government forest manager named George
Speight. The two men had once worked together to shake up the local
timber industry _ and were so close that Fiji police are
investigating whether Pettit paid bribes to Speight. Both men deny
the allegations, saying the payments were for legitimate business
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When Speight stormed the parliament building and overthrew the
elected government last May, he carried not only an AK-47 rifle but
his own blueprint for becoming Fiji's timber king.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit, 57, has spent most of his career financing real-estate
projects in California, Texas and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of Fijian landowners contacted Pettit in 1996, he
found what he called the perfect laboratory: a poor but seemingly
stable nation with little foreign investment, a place where an
American businessman could make a big splash.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettit later found that his prospective partners were
drawing him deeply into a domestic struggle over land rights. The
landowners wanted to buy out government leases on their ancestral
lands, letting them harvest the timber and get rich turning it into
veneer and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the land in Fiji belongs to familial groups of
indigenous ethnic Melanesians. Though land is often leased
long-term for public and private uses, the holdings are a
birthright of ethnic Fijians that sets them apart even from
Indo-Fijians, who represent half the population and who dominate
Fiji's commercial sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s, the British colonial administration
leased land to plant trees, including pine, a fast-growing
softwood, and Honduran mahogany, a slow-growing hardwood. The
leases paid landowners only a nominal rent _ an average of about 4
cents per acre annually _ for what was then seen as an experiment.
Many, but not all, of the leases gave landowners rights to share
profits if the planting proved successful.
</P>
<P>
   When pine began maturing in the 1980s, the decade after the
British left, Fiji's government established its own company, Fiji
Pine, to harvest the trees. But the company mostly shredded the
logs into chips and exported them at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners, after realizing no profit from pine, scrambled to
make sure they made money on mahogany, which is just now ready to
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit agreed to help, by proposing to sell tens of millions of
dollars in bonds to finance the development of a forest-products
industry, then repay the bonds from the proceeds of selling timber
products. Pettit met resistance from Fiji Pine, which had no
interest in seeing landowners buy back their property and set up a
competing business. Pettit and his partners launched a private
investigation into Fiji Pine's operations, compiling a report that
claimed to show how powerful officials had used dubious accounting
at the company to profit at landowners' expense.
</P>
<P>
   And Pettit rallied landowners to do something about it. ``I told
them, `You people have to get up and take on your own system or it
will never get fixed,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit, an American outsider, soon recruited an ally _ George
Speight, then the head of an insurance brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, in his early 40s and trained in business at Andrews
University in Michigan, was a protege of powerful native Fijian
political figures in the then-ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anyone else Pettit met in Suva, Speight understood
financial markets. And unlike the Americans, Speight could
communicate those concepts in Fijian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a godsend,'' Pettit wrote in a memo at the time. He
committed to a broad arrangement with Speight, agreeing to pay his
company a monthly fee for a variety of services, including
insurance advice, office space and help in communicating with
government officials and landowners.
</P>
<P>
   When Pettit visited Fiji, Speight became his key contact and his
liaison with landowners. Pettit said he and Speight developed a
shared vision for a unified timber industry, stripped of
turf-conscious bureaucrats who did not understand American finance.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1998, the government also appointed Speight chairman of
Fiji Pine, the first step toward fulfilling his ambition to unite
the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1999, the deal of Pettit's career seemed within grasp.
Speight had shaken up Fiji Pine, clearing out many bureaucrats
opposed to Pettit's plan. Speight also selected Pettit's company,
Timber Resources Management, as one of two finalists seeking to
harvest the mahogany groves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If both deals materialized, the underwriting commissions,
management fees and long-term profit sharing to Pettit's team would
total, by some estimates, about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, as both deals hung in the balance, Speight
submitted an invoice to Pettit on his own letterhead that claimed
he was owed $26,000 for rent and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettit disputed Speight's estimates and questioned why
Speight asked for the money to be paid to his own bank account
instead of his firm. Pettit also acknowledged that Speight's demand
came at a sensitive time _ after Speight had already assumed
powerful government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those qualms, Pettit said he paid Speight $10,000
himself and arranged for one of his partners in Fiji to pay another
$5,000. Those payments, shy of what Speight had demanded, are
currently under investigation by the Fiji police.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the payments might have swayed Speight
to award the timber contracts to Pettit. Shortly after the issue
arose, the party that backed Speight lost parliamentary elections
to a coalition headed by Mahendra Chaudhry. Speight soon lost his
government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's government promised a quick decision on timber sales.
Even without Speight's help, Pettit felt he had the superior bid.
His main challenger was Commonwealth Development Corp., a British
concern that had a 40-year track record in Fiji. But Pettit had a
much more ambitious proposal that valued the mahogany crop at $210
million versus about $65 million for the British company.
</P>
<P>
   What Pettit apparently didn't know at the time was that
Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian prime minister in 13 years,
needed the backing of Fiji's former colonial patron in negotiations
with the European Union over export supports for sugar, Fiji's
leading industry and a business dominated by ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry told the British company that it was the ``preferred
bidder,'' subject to final talks on terms. Pettit, having already
invested about $2 million in Fiji, sensed disaster. He recruited
the U.S. Embassy to intervene on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated diplomatic requests, Chaudhry agreed to
reconsider the American plan. But by late 1999, the action in Fiji
had started to shift outside of Suva _ to villages scattered among
the mahogany plantations. There, Chaudhry's initial support for the
smaller British bid had inflamed landowners already angry about not
being consulted on sensitive land-use issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit said he hoped that the landowner unrest would help him.
After all, he had been lured to Fiji by disgruntled landowners
representing 250 village chiefs, many with both pine and mahogany
on their land. He cultivated that support, drawing up tables
showing how landowners could pocket far more from his plan than the
British alternative.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Speight was fanning landowner discontent. He
mobilized landowners to form their own company, with him as its
head. Their demand: that full control of the plantations be
returned to ancestral chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Chaudry abruptly endorsed the British company's bid.
That set off a series of charges and counter-charges that made
mahogany front-page news in Fiji for weeks, shaking Chaudhry's
government.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Fiji TV reported on Pettit's payments to Speight.
Though both men denied the money was a bribe, the report gave
Chaudhry, who sensed a political threat from landowners, ammunition
to support his mahogany decision. He accused the Seattle
businessman of being a carpetbagger who had a scheme to extract
up-front profits from Fiji's timber but no money of his own to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruckus in the capital seemed to solidify landowner
opposition to Chaudhry. Some 10,000 indigenous Fijians marched
through Suva in late March, calling on the government to cease
making decisions on two key land issues _ the mahogany and renewal
of leases on land used for growing sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's landowner coalition was encouraging the protesters, in
language that became overtly racist. They asserted that ethnic
Indians could not be trusted to reach crucial decisions on native
land matters.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, landowners again marched on Suva, this time 20,000
strong. While the march degenerated into a riot that destroyed some
ethnic Indian-run businesses, Speight stormed the parliament
building with seven paramilitary troops and took Chaudhry and his
cabinet hostage. The rebels held them there for almost two months.
</P>
<P>
   The coup was haphazard, with disparate supporters and a
constantly changing list of demands. Fijians are still speculating
on the identity of its mastermind, often dismissing Speight as a
front man for powerful political interests. But it seems likely
that Speight intended to emerge from the coup as the mahogany king.
While he kept the Chaudhry administration locked up, he ordered
supporters to fan out around Fiji's island gathering signatures of
villages chiefs on a ``deed of sovereignty,'' according to people
told to do that work.
</P>
<P>
   The deed would have abrogated government leases and vested
control over Fiji's natural resources in a Speight-led entity. Had
the army not turned against Speight in late July _ its officers
eventually arrested him _ his plan might have come to fruition,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is now in prison awaiting trial. Pettit, who has given
up all hope of reaching a timber deal in Fiji, has filed a
half-dozen lawsuits in local courts against the government to
recover some of the money he lost. He is also waiting for Fiji
police to decide whether to take action on his payment to Speight.

WELCOME TO THE UNITED NATIONS, TUVALU!
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed so surprisingly modern for the tiny South Pacific
nation of Tuvalu to join the United Nations last week, hoisting
above New York City streets its light-blue flag that fluttered in
the breeze as an emblem of entry into the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu, however, a group of nine coral atolls halfway between
Australia and Hawaii, unwittingly joined the world community some
time ago. Its entry may spell great fortune as islanders become
Internet entrepreneurs. And it may mean great tragedy: Scientists
predict that the low-lying islands will disappear under the waves
if global warming continues to raise sea levels. Tuvalu could
become the next Atlantis. Just as easily, it could find a way to
thrive in a technologically sophisticated world.
</P>
<P>
   Will the people of Tuvalu be survivors? Intrigued? We were, too.
Here's our guide to Tuvalu, a tiny nation feeling the stresses of
the modern world:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Geography 101 stats:
</P>
<P>
   Population: 10,000, about the same number of people as Saginaw,
Texas, or the Dallas enclave of Highland Park
</P>
<P>
   Size of islands: 10 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy: 68 years, at least 10 years less than life
expectancy in the United States
</P>
<P>
   Chief export: Dried coconut meat, used in making coconut oil
</P>
<P>
   Imports: Food, fuel and manufactured goods
</P>
<P>
   Nationhood: Tuvalu gained independence from Britain in 1978
</P>
<P>
   Amenities: One unpaved road, few computers, no newspapers, few
televisions, and airline service is so poor that only about 1,000
tourists venture to its shores each year
</P>
<P>
   What it's known for: American World War II veterans may remember
Tuvalu by its former name of Ellice Islands, and recall it as home
to three now-abandoned war-era American airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Income: Licenses sold to American, Korean and Taiwanese tuna
fishing boats, and revenue from a trust fund set up by the
governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Other
revenue comes from the sale of colorful postage stamps to
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   GNP: $10 million in U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
   Average annual income: Higher managerial, $9,983 in U.S.
dollars; clerical, $4,308
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The islands stand to make a fortune from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The nation of Tuvalu in April sold its Internet domain, .tv, for
$50 million to DotTV, a business started by Idealab of Pasadena,
Calif., to sell the .tv domain spaces to folks who will probably
pay large sums for the descriptive Web site address.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United Kingdom received .uk as a domain name, and
Austraila received .au, Tuvalu was assigned the .tv location long
before anyone knew how lucrative that address suffix would prove to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very, very poor, but now we are getting some
money from the marketing of assets like .tv,'' Tuvalu Parliament
member Koloa Talake told the Los Angeles Times in April.
</P>
<P>
   Talake, who says he has never even seen a Web site, now holds a
seat on DotTV's board.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet millions are to be paid to Tuvalu in increments of
$1 million a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The island once made lots of money from phone sex operations.
</P>
<P>
   The DotTV deal isn't the first time islanders have tried to cash
in on technology. In 1996, new telephone service to the islands
created excess international service capacity, which islanders
sold. Unfortunately, the buyers of Tuvalu's international access
code, 688, were telephone sex operators in Japan, the United States
and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, the arrangement earned Tuvalu ($68,550 in U.S.
dollars), and 10 percent of the country's budget is now covered by
income from telephone sex,'' writes David Stanley, author of ``The
South Pacific Handbook'' (Avalon Travel Publishing, 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   The contracts with the operators were later canceled by
officials in the Christian nation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   You can see Tuvalu on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu isn't entirely removed from the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Tuvalu-Canadian'' family on the islands runs a Web site
called Tuvalu online. Its address is
http://members.xoom.com//tuvaluonline.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu's window to the world
</P>
<P>
   A few of the islands have solar-powered satellite
telecommunications receivers, allowing the handful of TV owners to
pick up MTV, CNN, the Disney Channel and other cable stations,
according to Stanley. ``South Pacific Handbook'' (Avalon Travel
Publishing, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The island is disappearing (perhaps making this the perfect
setting for a future ``Survivor'' series?).
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the islands are noticing that the Pacific Ocean
keeps creeping deeper onto their properties.
</P>
<P>
   Enele Sopoaga, Tuvalu's ambassador to Fiji, told reporters last
year that sea levels are forecast to rise between more than a foot
to more than 3 feet within 100 years, due to climatic shifts toward
warmer temperatures, which is melting the polar ice caps. The
climate change is attributed partly to emissions from fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu sits, on average, 3 feet above sea level, and seawater
already laps at some doors during particularly high tides.
</P>
<P>
   The plight has attracted the attention of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who said in a special session of the General Assembly
last year that there is ``trouble in paradise'' because of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Tuvalu government pleaded for foreign assurance
of assistance. In June, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff
promised that New Zealand, Australia and other Pacific nations will
welcome anyone from Tuvalu displaced by rising water.
</P>
<P>
   Sopoaga, in an account carried by the San Jose Mercury News last
year, said: ``Our people are a religious people. This is the main
topic of our church services and prayers. We believe God will
somehow show his hand of protection to the small island states and
Tuvalu.'' He is said to have fallen silent as tears sprang to his
eyes. ``I really don't know where we will be in 50 years' time,
whether there will still be a place called Tuvalu.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Lieberman, Lynne Cheney accuse entertainment companies of
contributing to youth violence
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By STEVE LASH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman found
common ground with Lynne Cheney, the wife of his Republican
opponent, as they accused entertainment companies Wednesday of
contributing to youth violence by marketing their violent and
sexually oriented material to children.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing separately before a Senate committee, Lieberman and
Cheney urged makers of movies, musical recordings and video games
to act responsibly and not advertise adult-themed entertainment to
youngsters. While both said the entertainment industry should
restrain itself, Lieberman _ Vice President Al Gore's running mate
_ added that federal regulators should step in if self-restraint
fails.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, whose husband, Richard, is running with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, made an overt reference to the presidential
campaign, saying she hopes Lieberman makes that strong case to
entertainment executives at a Democratic Party fund-raiser in New
York City tonight. (THURSDAY)
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lieberman, a U.S. senator from Connecticut, said
the candidate has no qualms about telling Hollywood moguls what he
thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not shy about sharing his concerns about the negative
impact the entertainment industry has on children,'' said spokesman
Dan Gerstein. ``He is not afraid to tell his friends when they're
doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurring the Senate Commerce Committee's examination of the
entertainment industry was the release of a Federal Trade
Commission study Monday that found widespread and aggressive
marketing of adult fare to children. For example, the commission
found advertising of adult-oriented entertainment during television
shows popular with children, including ``Xena: Warrior Princess''
and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The pervasive advertising to youngsters belies the industry's
efforts to help parents monitor what their children see and hear by
rating the age-appropriateness of its products, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Senate panel, industry representatives
said they do not market violent and sexual material to children.
They also cautioned the Commerce Committee against regulating their
advertising, saying such governmental intervention would encroach
on their right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Goldberg, president and chief executive officer of Artemis
Records, expressed strong concern that federal oversight of
advertising would lead to governmental censorship of the arts.
Gibing the Texas governor, Goldberg said he was concerned for
groups like the heavy metal band Kittie, whose song lyrics contain
profanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are many Americans who are offended by curse
words and don't want children exposed to them,'' Goldberg said.
``However, those people have no moral or legal right to impose such
a standard on my family or the millions of other Americans who,
like George Bush, are comfortable with cursing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, during a campaign rally in Illinois this month, referred
to New York Times reporter Adam Clymer as a ``major league
a------,'' a remark that was picked up by an open microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Moore, president of video-game maker Sega of America Inc.,
expressed anger at politicians who blame entertainment companies
for youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any responsible parent knows that there are a multitude of
factors involved in childhood development,'' said Moore, the father
of three. ``The more time our government spends scapegoating one of
the thousands of impressions made everyday on children, the less
time is spent on real, sustainable solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president and chief executive officer of the
Motion Picture Association of America, said the movie industry has
for nearly 32 years alerted parents to any adult content. These
familiar ratings include ``R,'' for adult-oriented movies that
require children under age 17 to be accompanied by a parent, and
``NC-17,'' movies that are closed to children under 17 because of
explicit sex scenes or excessive violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviews of just about every movie released appear in
publications and on television,'' Valenti said. ``There is no
scarcity of ratings advice for parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the committee's chairman, expressed
anger that movie company executives sent their chief lobbyist,
Valenti, rather than appear at the hearing themselves. Saying
``their hubris is stunning,'' McCain pledged to invite the
executives again to a similar hearing on advertising that will
occur later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Wednesday hearing, ostensibly an examination of advertising
practices, became a forum for a the tight presidential race because
of the appearances of Lieberman and Lynne Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimony followed campaign statements from Gore and Bush
in which both candidates blamed sex and violence in movies, records
and video games for destroying the nation's moral fabric,
especially for America's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on the campaign theme, Lieberman, a long-time critic
of the industry, urged entertainment companies to ensure that that
their adult-oriented entertainment is not marketed to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are asking for today is not censorship, but simply
better citizenship,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies contribute so much to our economy, to our
culture, to the American experience,'' he added. ``But they are
also contributing to a serious national problem and we need their
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the self-restraint approach fails, Lieberman said the
Federal Trade Commission should cite the industry for falsely and
deceptively advertising adult entertainment to children. The
government, however, should not sanction the companies for their
movies, records and video games because these productions enjoy
constitutional protection, he added.

FARGAS USES INJURY INJURY AS MOTIVATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ For Justin Fargas, complete closure occurred just
a few seconds into Michigan's first game against Bowling Green
three weeks ago. In one play, 22 months of frustration ended.
</P>
<P>
   Pain free, slightly apprehensive and energetic to his limit,
Fargas, the former Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks star and the greatest
running back ever produced by the San Fernando Valley, fielded the
opening kickoff, darted 11 yards and then got smashed to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   After missing nearly half his freshman year and all of 1999 with
a devastating broken leg _ enduring three surgeries, facing the
frightening possibility of losing his right foot and an arduous
rehabilitation process _ it never felt better to get hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that they would kick it to me,'' Fargas said.
``The return didn't set up just right. But I was glad to get the
ball in my hands and get that first contact out of the way. I knew
then I was back.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Fargas comes full circle _ he returns home to Southern
California to play UCLA, a school he seriously considered signing
with out of high school _ to play in front of family and friends
for the first time since leaving for Michigan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's nothing he wants more than to show everyone the
flashy running style and breathtaking speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game I've been looking forward to ever since I
committed to play here,'' Fargas said. ``A chance to go home and
play in front of family and friends is a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan coach Lloyd Carr agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that this game was a
motivating factor for him in coming back,'' Carr said. ``And he's
done a great job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fargas' first trip home with Michigan wasn't supposed to happen
this way. Instead of facing the uncertainty coming off a serious
injury, he was expected to be firmly established as one of the top
juniors in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe this would be the week Fargas launched a
Heisman Trophy campaign _ here at home, at the Rose Bowl against
the Bruins in front of loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, he's a redshirt sophomore playing behind senior
Anthony Thomas, trying to carve out a niche while proving to
himself and others that he's the same player as before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Fargas finished with 70 yards on eight carries in the opener
against Bowling Green _ although he fumbled on his first carry _
then was limited to just seven yards on six carries last week
against Rice. Playing time has been spotty thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Fargas, who rushed for 6,334 yards and 82 touchdowns in three
years at Notre Dame, hoped to be more established for his only
regular-season trip home. While he had only 277 yards his freshman
season at Michigan, 120 of them came against Northwestern _ the
week before he got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for different reasons, this return might be sweeter than the
one he envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true,'' Fargas said. ``I've come a long way
to get to this point. It felt good to be out there playing football
again. I missed something that I loved for a long time and I'm glad
to have it back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so are his biggest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that he's coming back home to show what he
can do,'' Notre Dame coach Kevin Rooney said. ``It's the fact that
he's back playing football again and that he overcame some serious
hardships to get back. That's reason enough for all of us to be
happy. It's been a long haul for Justin.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some question whether he'd get here. Fargas literally
shattered his leg two years ago, suffering multiple fractures
against Wisconsin. It was such a gruesome injury, Michigan trainer
Paul Schmidt said it looked like something you might see in a car
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fargas had two titanium rods and 12 screws implanted in his leg
during surgery, only to learn four months later the leg was not
healing properly. He required another surgery in which his leg was
rebroken and two metal plates were inserted, forcing him to
redshirt in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation was difficult and strenuous, but Fargas
focused on making it all the way back so he could play and be
effective by the time Michigan traveled to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt if there was anyone who could come back from something
like this, it was Justin,'' Rooney said. ``Because of his great
willpower, determination and toughness. Doctors said this was as
bad a break as they'd seen, or maybe ever seen. So to come back as
he has really says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it looks like Fargas is close to where he was, showing
the same explosive burst and cutting ability as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a lot of great cuts,'' Carr said. ``I can't tell a
difference in his speed and he's a much better pass receiver. He's
a very important part of our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fargas, who had a third surgery to fix tendons in his right big
toe, recalls the devastating possibility of losing his right foot
in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that _ the excruciating pain,'' Fargas said.
``A lot of things run through your mind when you know your leg's
broken. Taking away a leg is like taking away Superman's cape. I
can't run without my leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know I've come from almost losing my leg to being able to
play now, that just makes me want to play even harder. I didn't
know what it was like to break a leg _ I'd never broken anything. I
thought it was a routine thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out it was more like falling off a building or being
in a major car accident. To hear that I could have even lost my
foot, I think about it, and I think about how lucky I am just to be
running, much less to be playing football for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Fargas' performance against Bowling Green showed he's back. Now
the focus is on getting better. He has three years to become the
running back everyone predicted coming out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still looks fast and he's stronger and more determined,''
said Antonio Fargas, Justin's dad. ``I'm really encouraged. I think
we can relax now.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who convinced Fargas to leave the West Coast for Ann
Arbor, now watches from the sidelines with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him run out on that first kickoff return, those
were great feelings to see that kid get an opportunity to play
again,'' Carr said. ``I thought he did an excellent job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Wall Street, Chase Manhattan Corp. has long been
considered an investment banking also-ran. No matter how much stock
trading or underwriting Chase did, its competitors continued to
disparage it as a declasse commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its proposed purchase of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Chase
hopes that it will finally break into the club of financial firms
with enduring global clout. But whether Chase, the product of a
series of mergers of consumer banks, will join that elite club
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Wednesday that it plans to acquire J.P. Morgan for
$30.9 billion in stock, Chase executives argued that the
combination of Chase's broad base of customers with Morgan's
exclusive clientele and financial expertise would prevent the two
banks from being left behind in the race to determine which firms
will dominate corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be less than a handful of endgame winners,'' said
William B. Harrison Jr., chairman and chief executive of Chase.
``We will be an endgame winner.''
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, the combined J.P. Morgan Chase &AMP; Co. clearly
would have the size to claim a spot among the world's financial
titans. It would have about $660 billion in assets, more than
90,000 employees around the world and a stock market value of about
$95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But it still will be smaller than two other American financial
conglomerates, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., and
it still will have to prove that it can compete with them and
several other firms for the most lucrative roles of underwriting
stocks and advising on mergers and acquisitions. If anything, the
proposed deal will intensify the pressure on some of the biggest
investment banks, like Goldman Sachs Group and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
to get even bigger soon.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those firms has spent many millions of dollars building
itself from a specialized domestic firm into an international
company with a diverse set of financial products and services to
offer corporations and, in some cases, individual investors. By
pushing its way into that set, Chase would be moving even farther
away from consumer banking. While it retains a network of more than
500 bank branches in the New York area and in Texas, Chase would
derive only about 27 percent of its revenue and 19 percent of its
pretax earnings from consumer services, including credit cards and
home and auto loans.
</P>
<P>
   Though Harrison said Chase had no plans to divest any major
lines of business, he displayed no sentimental attachment to the
consumer bank operations. ``Today, we're happy with all of our
consumer businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Chase would consider exiting any business that
failed to meet management's expectations. Some analysts believe
that one of Chase's first moves will be to stop making car loans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shares of Chase fell $1.31, to $51.19, on Wednesday, after the
companies confirmed reports of the deal. Analysts said that
investors were concerned about how much the acquisition would
dilute Chase's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., said
Chase is expected to report earnings about 5 percent lower than
what had been expected before the deal was announced. On top of
that, he said, investors have some doubts about whether and when
Chase can achieve the revenue gains it is promising from the
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is offering to issue 3.7 new shares of stock for each
share of Morgan stock. Based on the $52.50 closing price for Chase
shares on Tuesday Morgan's 159 million shares would be worth $30.9
billion. But Chase said it would be acquiring 186 million shares of
Morgan stock, counting all of the options and restricted shares
Morgan employees own. That discrepancy and the changing price of
Chase's stock led to disparities in estimates of the value of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the impact of the deal on Chase's earnings, Marc J.
Shapiro, a Chase vice chairman, said the banks expect to reduce
their combined expenses by about $1.5 billion annually. About
one-third of those cost reductions are likely to come from
eliminating jobs, Harrison said, though he declined to say how many
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimated that the number of jobs would be reduced by
several hundred to a few thousand, a small percentage of total
employment at the banks. The real challenge facing the new
management team will not be in eliminating jobs but in retaining
enough of Morgan's investment bankers to justify the high price
that Chase is paying.
</P>
<P>
   Chase executives may see themselves as equals to their
counterparts at Wall Street's biggest firms, but investment bankers
still see a gulf between themselves and most Chase employees. With
most investment banks competing fiercely for young financiers,
especially those with an understanding of technology, Morgan
employees may choose to defect to another bona-fide member of what
is known on Wall Street as the top tier. Debates rage about who
belongs in that small group of leading investment banks, but it
undisputably includes Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch
and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is that they have to smoothly blend the cultures and
keep the key people,'' said Mandle of Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   One Chase executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said he hoped that acquiring Morgan would help Chase stem the
number of talented employees leaving for Goldman, Sachs and other
investment banks. He also said that Chase might fill holes by
hiring people from Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, an investment bank
that is being acquired by Credit Suisse Group.
</P>
<P>
   Chase executives said they had set aside a pool of stock to be
used to retain the Morgan employees they most want to keep, but
they repeatedly declined to say how big the pool was or how many
people might share in it. They did not disclose the financial
packages offered to any of Morgan's senior executives. Instead,
they emphasized that they had attempted to head off typical
pre-merger friction by quickly deciding who would fill the 40 or 50
jobs they considered most important.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The list of top managers chosen includes several executives from
J.P. Morgan. Douglas Warner, Morgan's chairman and chief executive,
would be chairman of the merged company, and two investment bankers
from Morgan, Clayton Rose and Walter Gubert, will have senior
management positions in the investment banking operation, to be
known as J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts and observers have depicted Warner as the
unfortunate chairman who was left with no choice but to sell
Morgan, one of the best known names in finance, ending its 150-year
run as an independent bank. But in an interview, Warner waved off
that view with a stern ``no way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Morgan could have continued to go its own way quite
profitably and he did not feel pressured to merge. ``There was no
event'' that pushed Morgan into negotiations, until Harrison called
three weeks ago and ``offered us a powerfully better option,''
Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end'' of J.P. Morgan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be the end of Morgan's tenure as a company focused
almost solely on managing the finances of blue-chip corporations
and some of the wealthiest individuals in America and Europe.
Likewise for Chase, the deal would spell the end of any impression
that it has its competitive sights set on anybody other than the
biggest investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may well create even tougher competition for the
top-tier investment banks, but it will have little or no effect on
other commercial banks, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the demise of what was once known as the money
center bank _ the biggest banks in the biggest cities that took
deposits from individuals and lent them to big companies. Most of
those banks have combined into sprawling regional banking
companies, like BankOne, First Union and Wells Fargo, that find
more fertile opportunities serving consumers and small businesses
than trying to finance a multinational company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fortune 1000 doesn't borrow from banks any more, and
that's why money center banking isn't around,'' said Lori B.
Appelbaum, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bigger regional banks have bought brokerage firms,
but generally these have been smaller firms that serve their
existing clients rather than those that aim to butt heads with
Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening here is you have to make a choice,'' said
Susan Roth, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Are you
going to be a niche player or are you going to be full service and
global because there is nothing in between. No one can be half
global.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only three banks in the United States left that
combine local and global businesses _ Chase, Citigroup and perhaps
Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that at Chase, the consumer and small business
lines will continue to be a smaller and smaller portion of the
company. While there is no compelling reason why the two aspects of
Chase need to be together, there is no pressure to split them
apart, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chase's mass market business is growing slower than the rest
of the company but it has nice returns on equity,'' Roth said.
``There is no reason for them to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Citigroup, perhaps one of the few things that its main
components _ Travelers Group and Citicorp _ had in common was that
they were committed to building both consumer and corporate
business, and that continues in the combined institution. That
said, much of Citigroup's biggest wholesale opportunities are with
midsize companies in the 100 countries in which it does business
rather than with the world leaders that the new J.P. Morgan Chase
is going after.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is one bank that has a choice yet to make about
whether it will compete in the big leagues of investment banking.
It has longstanding lending relationships with big companies and a
growing regional brokerage business. But it has been consumed by
the slow and difficult work of stitching together the myriad banks
it has acquired from Miami to Seattle. And its stock price has
lagged as investors grew impatient, making any acquisitions now
very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This puts the company in a difficult situation, analysts said,
that may lead the bank to forgo investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Appelbaum said. ``The lesson of J.P. Morgan
is it doesn't pay to build it yourself.''

MARKET PLACE: A DEAL THAT DILUTES EARNINGS BUT MAY GENERATE NEW
ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHASE-MORGAN) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The immediate verdict by investors on the decision by
Chase Manhattan to take over J.P. Morgan was a resounding hiss;
Chase's share price fell 11 percent the last two days, after rumors
of the deal began to spread.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for such a reaction: Chase is paying a
hefty premium over market value, and financial services mergers
often run into problems of integration that result in some of the
most valuable people leaving. Plans to cut costs sometimes
backfire, as it turns out that the people being let go really were
valuable to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's stock has been a good performer in recent years, but it
is now trading around 12 times its trailing earnings. Morgan, whose
stock had done less well until recently, is trading at 16 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a stock swap, with each Morgan share exchanged for
3.7 Chase shares, it is simple arithmetic that the merger will
substantially dilute Chase's earnings _ unless there is synergy
that raises revenue while allowing costs to be reduced. That is
precisely what William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive of
Chase, who is to keep that role in the merged company, expects to
happen. ``This is a global financial powerhouse,'' he told stock
analysts Wednesday. ``This is a situation, I am convinced, where
one plus one will substantially exceed two.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was expressing the current wisdom of many in the
financial services industry when he said that there would be ``less
than a handful of winners in the wholesale investment banking
race.'' If that is true, then both Chase and Morgan had to do
something, for separately their efforts to burst into the top tier
of investment banking had met with limited success at best.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders think Chase can do it. ``The group of five
becomes a group of six,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger
Insight, an institutional research firm. By his count, the top five
in worldwide finance are now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman,
Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Credit Suisse. He sees Deutsche
Bank and UBS on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that size and scope matter, that companies want
financial advisers with operations in all regions of the world, and
capabilities in everything from corporate lending to mergers and
stock underwriting. Chase and Morgan have individually had
middling-to-poor success in breaking into some of these markets.
(One joke that made the rounds Wednesday was that the deal would
certainly raise each bank's standing in mergers-and-acquisition
tables, at least for one quarter. That is because Chase listed
Chase as its financial adviser, and Morgan listed Morgan.)
</P>
<P>
   Harrison set forth a plan by which Morgan's investment banking
operations would benefit from access to Chase's individual and
corporate customers. ``No firm will have a broader, deeper client
relationship than this firm will have and that is very
leverageable,'' he said. Morgan's chief, Douglas A. Warner III, was
similarly enthusiastic, saying the combined operation would ``take
our platform and drive it through Chase's much larger client
base.''
</P>
<P>
   On the retail side, there is precedence. Such synergies appear
to be working at Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, Travelers
Insurance and Salomon Smith Barney. That combination was received
with initial enthusiasm on Wall Street, followed by a lot of doubt
_ not to mention by a bit of panic after the Russian default in
1998, and Citigroup's stock price suffered. But the stock has
sharply rebounded amid indications that the merger is working.
</P>
<P>
   On the institutional side, the plan to sell more services to
corporate customers depends heavily on two things: convincing them
that the new Morgan Chase is a top-notch competitor and taking the
business away from some highly regarded rivals who will be doing
their best to keep it. Citigroup seems to have done that; it
remains to be seen whether or not the new Chase can.
</P>
<P>
   Chase pledged to maintain its current annual dividend of $1.28 a
share, a yield of 2.5 percent at current stock prices. Morgan
shareholders will see their annual payout rise by nearly one-fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial world these days, a low dividend is perversely
a sign of investor confidence, indicating that share buyers expect
growth to produce bountiful rewards without hefty dividend
payments. Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch all
have dividend yields of 1 percent or less. That the new Chase
Morgan will pay more in dividends than the companies did
independently may indicate that management is not confident
investors will believe the merged company is leaping into the top
rank.

CLINTON DELAYS NEW IMPORT DUTIES FOR EUROPEAN GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also U.S.-CHINA-TRADE) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has delayed new punitive duties
on European luxury goods, including Scottish cashmere, British
shortbread and Italian pecorino cheese, because Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain has shifted his position on two festering trade
issues to help the United States, administration officials said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided to put off publication of a new sanctions list
late last week after Blair made an impassioned appeal to Clinton,
arguing that the 100 percent duties _ especially those planned on
$50 million of cashmere that comes from the United Kingdom _ would
do more harm than good to an already strained United States-Europe
trade relationship, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve also gives U.S. trade negotiators some leverage to
avoid a head-on collision with Europe in a separate and potentially
far more costly trade dispute over tax breaks Washington gives
major American exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the United States and Europe over how to avoid
massive retaliation against American products in the export tax
case will resume in Washington this week, with one administration
official saying he was ``cautiously hopeful'' that a pending Oct. 1
deadline could be extended while a compromise is worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of these issues shows how delicate United
States-Europe trade relations have become. Each side has won
headline-grabbing victories against the other at the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization. But both sides must grapple with
influential domestic constituencies and broad diplomatic concerns
as they ponder whether and how to impose retaliatory sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is obligated by law to shuffle the list of
$300 million worth of European luxury goods sanctioned after the
United States won a trade organization case against Europe's
restrictions on beef and banana imports.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated the rotation to make the sanctions more
painful and less predictable, ideally forcing Europe to open its
market to foreign beef and bananas instead of refusing to adhere to
the trade body's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury-goods sanctions have been placed in ``strategic
limbo,'' one senior administration official said. The official said
the decision was made after Blair's personal appeal to Clinton on
the sidelines of a United Nations summit last week; the two men are
considered close allies and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the official added that it also became clear that Britain
had pushed a moderate line within the European Union on resolving
the banana and tax break disputes, including in a European Union
ministers meeting last Friday. The U.S. official described that
support as ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one administration official said that he believes the
threat of including key British exports on the sanctions list has
proven more powerful than actually pulling the trigger; as word of
the new list leaked out in recent weeks, Britain became
demonstrably more cooperative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not likely to put off new sanctions indefinitely.
Barring an unanticipated breakthrough in pressing trade disputes, a
new list will be published shortly, officials said. But they added
that they are not mandated to include cashmere, which has proven
especially worrisome to Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is considered essential to resolving the longstanding
banana dispute because the European Union, which set trade policy
for its member states, effectively inherited the British system of
preference for goods produced in its former colonies around the
world. Once considered the most vociferous proponent of maintaining
that preference system, Britain is now seen by some administration
officials as their strongest advocate for opening Europe's market
to freer trade in bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has also argued that he has been pushing a more flexible
European line on the tax break issue, the official said. And the
tax breaks are, by a factor of 20, more important to American
companies than beef and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   American companies, including Boeing and General Motors, avoid
an estimated $4 billion each year in taxes by sheltering some
foreign sales in offshore shell companies. Earlier this year, the
World Trade Organization ruled that provision in the American tax
code violates international trade agreements, and Europe has the
right to impose potentially sweeping sanctions on American goods as
soon as October.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is trying to buy time from Europe to pass
legislation that would overhaul the tax code, potentially bringing
it into compliance with the trade organization's rules.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly
approved the administration's plan by a vote of 315-109. The Senate
is expected to take up the measure shortly. The bill would replace
the so-called Foreign Sales Corporation program with a new tax plan
that would exempt certain kinds of foreign-earned profits from U.S.
taxes. The new rules do not require that those sales be channeled
through offshore tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that the revamped tax break meets the trade
organization's requirements because it becomes a part of the
general tax code rather than an targeted export subsidy, which is
forbidden under trade rules. But the new law would actually
increase tax breaks on foreign sales by American corporations to an
estimated $6 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   European Union officials have flatly rejected the new scheme as
nothing more than a broader application of the same subsidy,
insisting that they will press ahead with their challenge and
implement what could amount of many billions of dollars in
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials hope a compromise is still possible.
They are pressing European counterparts this week to agree to
suspend any sanctions for weeks or months after the Oct. 1 deadline
_ at least until the trade organization has a chance to review the
new U.S. tax rules.

</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no intention of swapping
sanctions on beef and bananas for European good will on the tax
issue. But at the same time, they said, the overlap in the two
disputes makes it impossible to ignore that the quick application
of sanctions on luxury goods could prompt a damaging escalation of
the dispute over taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic politics of the sanctions nexus are also tricky.
Carl H. Lindner, chief executive of Chiquita Brands International,
a major banana producer, has pushed incessantly to punish British
goods, administration officials said. Lindner is a major donor to
both political parties. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has also
argued strongly that the sanctions list should be published
immediately, and that it should have teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are three months late with the list,'' said John S.
Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman. ``We need to hit this now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, administration officials said that the chief
executives of numerous multinationals had made clear that they
consider the tax break question a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, the administration is likely to slap heavy
duties on a new list of luxury goods. A tentative list includes a
variety of popular European imports.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those under consideration are: mineral water, canned
fruits, paprika and sweet biscuits, as well as cashmere, the
headline item. They would replace some goods on which duties have
been levied since April, 1999, including: bath salts, lithographs,
batteries and chicory.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions on several items, including plastic handbags, such as
those made by Louis Vuitton, are expected to carry over to the new
list from the old one.

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. with RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore attended a Houston dinner in
November 1995 to promote a budding relationship between the
Democratic Party and a handful of powerful Texas trial lawyers. The
relationship blossomed, producing $4 million in donations from the
lawyers' firms since 1996. But it also produced some heavy-handed
fund-raising that has recently drawn the scrutiny of federal
campaign finance investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the dinner, the lawyers were deeply troubled by a
bill passed by the Republican-led Congress that would have
drastically overhauled the nation's litigation system by
restricting the amount of money that people injured by faulty
products could win in lawsuits. Two days after the dinner,
Democratic officials asked Gore to call several lawyers who
attended the dinner to ask each of them to give $100,000 to the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked to call Walter Umphrey, a prominent plaintiff's
lawyer in Beaumont, Texas, but his aides say he did not make the
call. Two weeks later, Donald L. Fowler, then chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, was asked to call Umphrey to press
him for a $100,000 check. On a briefing memorandum for the Fowler
call, a Democratic Party official wrote these words for Fowler to
tell Umphrey as the reason for the phone call, ``Sorry you missed
the vice president,'' and then, ``I know'' you ``will give $100K
when the president vetoes tort reform, but we really need it now.
Please send ASAP if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, the memos, known as call sheets, were careful to
avoid any mention of executive branch actions or donors'
legislative wishes. Soliciting contributions and explicitly linking
campaign donations to official actions is improper and, in some
cases, illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Fowler said that he never would have used the
language on the call sheet and that he could not recall speaking
with Umphrey about campaign contributions. But he did acknowledge
that at least one conversation with the lawyer was ``possible,
maybe even probable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler criticized the call sheet's message, which was written by
a young party aide named Erica Payne. ``I don't know why that
language was on the call sheet,'' said Fowler, who is now chairman
of Fowler Communications in South Carolina. ``I'm sure I never said
anything like that to him or anybody else. It's unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The call sheet's unusual mention of a presidential veto as part
of a solicitation of a $100,000 donation has attracted the
attention of Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force, who has opened a
preliminary investigation into the matter, several law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for Gore, said Wednesday, ``The
Republicans and others have had this for more than 1,000 days and
no one found it interesting until 1,000 hours before the election.
That's curious, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was well known in late 1995 that the president would
probably veto the tort reform bill, its passage by the
Republican-controlled Congress greatly concerned trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, 1996, President Clinton vetoed the bill, which would
have set strict limits in both state and federal courts on punitive
damages, the money juries may give beyond awards to compensate
victims for their losses. Supporters of the measure, including
Democrats who lobbied for almost a decade for legislation to limit
liability damages, argued that it would put a cap on
multimillion-dollar jury awards that they said added to consumer
costs. But the opponents said large jury awards were needed to
prevent companies from selling unsafe products.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republican leaders _ and even a few Democratic
senators _ angrily criticized the president, saying the veto was
intended to placate donors to the Democrats. Rep. John A. Boehner,
R-Ohio, said Clinton was handing a gift to the generous trial
lawyers who were supporting his re-election bid. Donations from
those lawyers, he said at the time, ``can buy you a Bill Clinton
veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who also criticized the veto was Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., who had pushed hard for the legislation. In an
interview that year with The Wall Street Journal, Lieberman, now
Gore's running mate, described the trial lawyers as ``a small group
of people who are deeply invested in the status quo, who have
worked the system very effectively and have had a disproportionate
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the president's veto, Umphrey's law firm
contributed a total of $40,000 to the Democratic National
Committee. And in the four years since then, Umphrey and his firm,
Provost &AMP; Umphrey, have given more than $700,000 to the Democratic
Party, Federal Election Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gore has continued to woo the Texas trial lawyers, a
strategy that has paid enormous dividends to the Democrats. In the
years before the president's 1996 veto, five prominent Texas
lawyers _ Umphrey, John Eddie Williams Jr. (the host of the Houston
dinner attended by Gore on Nov. 28, 1995), John O'Quinn, Wayne
Reaud and Harold Nix _ and their law firms had given $747,700 to
the Democrats. Since the veto, the five men and their firms have
given a total of nearly $4 million to the Democrats, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group in
Washington that monitors campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, according to the center, the five lawyers have
given no money to the Republican Party, whose nominee for
president, George W. Bush, has pushed aggressively as governor of
Texas to limit jury awards and has pledged as a presidential
candidate to ``curb frivolous lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey did not return calls to his Beaumont office. Calls to
the other four were also not returned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Michael E. Tigar, an attorney who represents all five
lawyers, denied that his clients' subsequent contributions were
linked in any way to the president's veto. ``Tying campaign
contributions to legislative or executive action has never been
illegal in the United States unless there is proof that the public
official extorts the money by threatening to give or withhold
action based on the contributions,'' Tigar said.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar added that Umphrey and the other Texas lawyers he
represents, ``have repeatedly been asked in many forums whether
they have ever given money to a candidate or officials as a
quid-pro-quo for official action, and they have repeatedly said
under oath that they have never done so.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of the Democratic call sheet, Erica Payne, declined
to comment. Her lawyer, Thomas Dwyer, said that Payne knew Umphrey
was ``a major giver'' and that he would likely contribute after the
president vetoed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time this memo was written,'' Dwyer said, ``she was
aware, from the grapevine, that the president was most likely going
to veto this bill. At no time did she get inside information from
the White House or anyone about this piece of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election
Commission, called the call sheet's language ``extraordinarily
ill-advised,'' saying prosecutors would likely be investigating
whether the solicitation violated either a bribery statute or a law
prohibiting ``illegal gratuities,'' a ``gift'' given after an
elected official takes a public action.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey's contributions represent a vivid example of the
generosity bestowed on the Democratic Party by the five Texas
plaintiffs lawyers, most of whom have become fabulously wealthy
from the $3.3 billion in fees they were awarded for their work on a
lawsuit against the tobacco industry. The lawyers helped engineer a
$17.3 billion settlement in 1998 from the tobacco industry for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the tobacco case was settled, they had a lot more money
to give, so they've been very, very generous,'' said a Texas
Democratic official who knows the lawyers. ``It's kind of like
winning the lottery. All of a sudden you have a lot more money to
spend. They're doing the same thing they've always done, but
they're doing it on a much bigger scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and law firms have already contributed nearly $5 million
to Gore's presidential campaign _ nearly 10 percent of all the
money the Gore-Lieberman campaign has raised, according to an
analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore obviously is not counting on Texas this November, but it
has still served as an important fund-raising stop, in large part
because of trial lawyers. In March, for example, the vice president
flew to Houston to attend two fund-raisers that, combined, raised
nearly $600,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   One of these fund-raisers reunited the vice president with
Williams, whose law partner, Denman Heard, hosted 125 people, who
contributed $150,000 to the Democrats, at his home. Later, a dinner
was held at the Houston home of H. Lee Godfrey, a partner in Susman
Godfrey, one of the state's top litigation firms. Forty people
attended the dinner, which raised $400,000 for the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At Heard's home, the guests listened as Ed Rendell, the
Democratic National Committee's general chairman, delivered a
rousing defense of plaintiff lawyers, saying that much of the
nation's gains in consumer safety were due to their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also attended several fund-raisers in recent months
at the homes of trial lawyers. In January, he attended a
$5,000-a-plate dinner at Williams' home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Williams also was the host of a fund-raiser for Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign committee.

POLITICAL HOT POTATO RECEIVED AND LET GO BY GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A close adviser to Vice President Al Gore said he
had received an anonymously mailed package on Wednesday that
involved material designed to prepare Gov. George W. Bush for his
debates with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser, former Rep. Tom Downey of New York, said he
examined the materials briefly before giving them to his lawyer,
who turned them over to the FBI on Wednesday afternoon. Downey, who
has been helping Gore prepare for the Bush debates and was standing
in for Bush in mock debates, also said he would recuse himself from
any further debate preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns are to meet on Thursday to negotiate
the debate schedule. If the candidates adhere to a plan set up by a
bipartisan commission,the first debate will be on Oct. 3 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said they did not know if the materials sent
to Downey had been stolen from the Bush campaign or were meant to
trap the Gore adviser in some sort of dirty trick. Downey's lawyer,
Marc Miller, said the material _ a videotape and a sheaf of papers
_ arrived in an envelope postmarked Austin, Texas, where the Bush
campaign has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was eager to dissociate itself quickly from
the incident. After Miller called the FBI, campaign officials
alerted The Associated Press that the packet had arrived and
provided a detailed time line of Downey's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore, said of Downey: ``He's being
very careful and very prudent. He's handled this exactly right. No
one can raise any questions about how it's being handled. What to
make of it, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ``We
don't know what the Gore campaign claims to have in their
possession, but we take it very seriously. We have asked our
attorneys to review it to try to determine what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Gore campaign was eager to get the story out in a
hurry was a fear that Gore's current political momentum might
suffer from a perception of any improperly gained advantage. Ronald
Reagan's presidential campaign was criticized in 1980 after it
obtained secret briefing papers on the debate strategy of President
Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers, made public in 1983, revealed that Carter planned
to expose Reagan's ``flip-flops'' on various issues when the two
debated on Oct. 28, 1980. Reagan aides said that the information
was mostly conventional wisdom, and Reagan himself said that the
material had simply saved his team the trouble of ``having to go
out and dig up'' widely known information. But Carter aides said
that it had given Reagan a significant advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when the package arrived at Downey's office, he
happened to be preparing debate materials for Gore. ``It looked
like our debate material,'' Downey said.
</P>
<P>
   Downey said he watched 60 to 90 seconds of the video, and saw
Bush and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who is playing Gore in
the mock debates, and another person he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it, and I said, `I shouldn't have this and
shouldn't be looking at this,''' he said. ``I knew that it was
serious stuff. I know what ours looks like.''

NUCLEAR SCIENTIST SET FREE AS JUDGE ATTACKS U.S. CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Changes and additions throughout.) 
(EDS: The text will be available from The New York Times on the
Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ The former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee
pleaded guilty Wednesday to a single charge of mishandling nuclear
secrets and left court a free man with an apology from a federal
judge, who angrily accused administration officials of abusing
their power and misleading him into thinking that Lee posed a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, was embraced in the courtroom by an emotional throng of
family members and supporters. But before that scene, U.S. District
Judge James A. Parker stunned a suddenly hushed courtroom as he
singled out Attorney General Janet Reno, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson and senior officials in the Clinton White House for what
he called a questionable indictment, for misleading him on Lee's
supposedly deceptive behavior and then for ignoring his urgings
that the government ease the ``demeaning and terribly punitive''
conditions under which Lee was being held.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of enormous weight, since it is exceptional for
a federal judge to give such an excoriating tongue-lashing to such
high-level federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a Reagan appointee who is known for his measured manner
and unusual patience, said he felt so deeply troubled by the
government's consistent pattern of abusive actions that he
expressed to Lee, a man who minutes before had admitted to a
felony, his dismay that the U.S. government had unleashed the full
force of its powers in such an arrogant manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely apologize to you Dr. Lee for the unfair''
treatment you suffered, Parker said, adding with ``great sadness''
that he believed he had made the wrong decision in denying Lee bail
in December because the government had misled him.
</P>
<P>
   He chastised the ``top decision makers'' of the executive branch
``who have caused me embarrassment by the way this case was
handled,'' he said. ``They have not embarrassed me alone. They have
embarrassed our entire nation and each of its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I must say, I don't see why the executive branch of
the government has done these things.'' The hearing left many of
Lee's supporters, and even some journalists, in tears, but Lee was
unabashed in his glee.
</P>
<P>
   After a tearful, private reunion with his family in a conference
room, where he and his family members sobbed, exchanged high-fives
and shared their first unsupervised moments of warmth since Lee was
indicted and then arrested on Dec. 10., he stood in a broiling
desert sun in front of the courthouse and thanked his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next few days I'm going fishing,'' said Lee, a slight,
soft-spoken man. He would not address the judge's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Lee, his son, expressed mixed emotions over seeing his
father finally walk free. ``It was thrilling, but at the same time
I became very sad thinking about the last year, with my Dad
shackled.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea deal, Lee agreed to tell prosecutors why he
downloaded the trove of nuclear secrets, exactly what he did with
the information and whether anyone else had seen it. He also
conceded that the government was justified in investigating his
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors insisted afterward that this cooperation was
what they had sought all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is the winner today,'' said George Stamboulidis, the
lead prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the reasons for Lee's terms of confinement,
Stamboulidis said, ``When you steal our nuclear secrets we're not
going to let you communicate with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was never charged with espionage, but he had been
investigated for at least five years on suspicion that he leaked
secrets of a sophisticated nuclear warhead, the W-88, to China. He
was fired from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory on
those suspicions and security violations in March 1999, and his
name _ as well as the government's accusations _ were leaked to
news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The government soon abandoned the concerns about spying because
of a lack of evidence, but agents later searched Lee's home and
found evidence that he had improperly downloaded a library of
nuclear weapons secrets to an unsecure computer and then to 10
computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those tapes were missing, and Lee said through his
lawyers that they had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Those missing tapes became the focus of the 59-count indictment
accusing him of mishandling classified information to benefit a
foreign power and the government's claims that Lee had to be
jailed, held in solitary confinement, shackled for his brief
moments of exercise time and given only one hour a week with his
family, all with an agent immediately beside him.
</P>
<P>
   Parker criticized the government for rejecting Lee's efforts to
reach an agreement in December, and he cited a letter from one of
the defense lawyers seeking to head off an indictment by offering a
similar level of cooperation that Lee agreed to on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Mark Holscher, wrote in a letter Dec. 10, ``I write
to accept Mr. Kelly's request that we provide him with additional
credible and verifiable information which will prove that Dr. Lee
is innocent,'' including an agreement for Lee to take a government
lie detector test on his assertions that he destroyed the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   That letter could have been the basis of an agreement, the judge
suggested, which would have made the bitterly contested and highly
divisive prosecution unnecessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Asian-American and civil rights groups took up Lee's
cause, insisting that Lee, a naturalized citizen born in Taiwan,
had been unfairly singled out for prosecution because of his
Chinese ancestry. These concerns were buttressed by the claims of
some intelligence officials that, since Chinese spies target
Asian-Americans in their recruitment efforts, it was appropriate to
place Asian-Americans under special scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Parker expressed dismay Wednesday that the defense efforts to
determine why the government had singled out Lee, and whether it
used racial profiling, would be dropped along with the case.
Previously, the judge had ordered the federal government to hand
over by Friday thousands of pages of classified documents about the
way it investigated Lee and others suspected of mishandling
secrets, so he could determine the validity of defense claims that
Lee was a victim of selective prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Bay, the U.S. attorney here and himself a Chinese-
American, rejected the judge's criticisms, saying he was
``particularly proud of the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not about race,'' he added. ``It is about the
actions of a man who downloaded a huge amount of national security
data.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as several people noted, Parker had never once mentioned
race in his withering remarks Wednesday, just the government's
tactics and misleading actions.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis attempted to refute the judge's remarks by
suggesting that he simply did not understand the national security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not responsible for our national security,'' said
Stamboulidis. ``It is not his charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Already stung by criticism that followed news reports on Monday
that prosecutors were dropping virtually their entire case against
Lee, Justice Department officials were further embarrassed
Wednesday by the judge's unusually harsh remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh were
unapologetic about the actions of prosecutors and agents.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said in a statement that the guilty plea would allow the
government to determine, by interviewing Lee, what happened to
several missing computer tapes onto which he downloaded classified
information that was the subject of the indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors saw the plea agreement, Reno said, as ``the best
chance'' to find out where the tapes were, where they had been and
who else had had access to them. ``Had the case proceeded to trial
and we prevailed, Dr. Lee would have faced many years in prison.
But we might never have learned what happened to the tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of equal importance,'' Reno said, ``the trial court's recent
ruling regarding classified evidence suggested that a trial of Dr.
Lee might have required the government to divulge nuclear secrets
at trial. The plea agreement avoids that harm to our national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts at Los Alamos have disputed the
sensitivity of records that Lee copied from the secret data banks
of Los Alamos, Freeh said in his statement that much of the
information was highly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some of the information was not classified,'' Freeh's
statement said, ``the government was prepared to prove that much of
it was highly classified nuclear weapons information.''
</P>
<P>
   Other senior law enforcement officials said they were not
surprised at the judge's denunciation of their efforts to keep Lee
jailed, acknowledging that prosecutors had failed to demonstrate
why he should be treated so harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials had said privately that they hoped the
imprisonment of Lee would pressure him into pleading guilty and
possibly admitting more serious crimes which, they said, was not a
valid justification for confining him.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official acknowledged that the
government had seriously mishandled the case and expressed disgust
over the treatment of Lee. ``We ought to be ashamed of ourselves,''
the official said. ``In theory, we're supposed to be running this
government.''

 &HT;    Lottery winner looks beyond criminal past
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Collecting his share of a $64.8 million lottery
prize Wednesday, John Osorio of Richardson scoffed at suggestions
he was getting cosmic ``payback'' for being one of the few people
who landed in prison for the 1972 Sharpstown scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was ``ironic'' the word he was looking for to capture his
sentiments, now that his share of the lump sum cash payout of $34.1
million was deposited in his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Was it was ``fate'' or ``karma''? reporters asked Osorio and his
close friend, co-winner Lois Loden, who purchased the winning
ticket for the Sept. 9 drawing using his money and her favorite
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel redeemed. How's that? I feel great,'' Osorio, 78, said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Osorio was a key figure in the biggest
political scandal Texas has ever seen. Convicted and imprisoned on
embezzlement and conspiracy charges, he also weathered allegations
of selling unregistered stock and offering false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters to ponder how someone who was so reviled as
a swindler could be collecting on the largest single
jackpot-winning ticket ever sold in Texas, Osorio claimed he was
simply the beneficiary of dumb luck _ not even his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck. Her luck. Oh, she's lucky,'' Osorio said of Loden. After
all, just two years ago, she collected $1,895 for hitting five of
the six numbers required to grab the game's top prize.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for her sudden impulse to pick some numbers
rather than let a computer select all of them for her, the couple
might not have been at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters to
reap their shared bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought two sets of five `Quick Picks' and then I just made
the remark to John that if we're ever really going to win, we're
going to have to pick the winning number. So I took the time to
fill out the sheet with five selections and the one right in the
center is the one that won,'' Loden said. She described her chosen
numbers as ``just random'' dates for loved ones' birthdays and
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Added Osorio: ``This is a $1 ticket that won this money. It
doesn't relate to my background or anything else. Anybody can do
that (buy a ticket). I just accept it for what it is, and I'm here
to celebrate the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Osorio was terse and uneasy fielding questions about his past,
and he offered few details about his future. A practicing lawyer in
good standing, according to the State Bar of Texas, Osorio said he
must fulfill pending work commitments before turning his attention
to a life of leisure and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a few projects I've got to continue. Then I'm going
to step out. I might step off this world,'' he said, adding that
he's already led a full life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just about done everything I could do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his involvement in the Sharpstown scandal that rocked
state government and ruined several political careers, Osorio said,
``I don't want to rehash history. If it's done, it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Osorio, a gubernatorial appointee who headed the state insurance
regulatory agency from 1955 to 1957, was convicted in 1973 of three
counts of conspiracy and embezzlement resulting from the Sharpstown
investigation that also led to the bribery conviction of then-House
Speaker Gus Mutscher.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio was convicted of using $641,250 from a pension fund he
was managing as loan collateral. He was sentenced to three years in
prison and fined $6,000. After serving 14 months in federal prison,
Osorio was released Aug. 19, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   While imprisoned, Osorio was acquitted on additional fraud and
conspiracy counts, and in 1977 he was acquitted after being
indicted in New York in a $6 million counterfeit U.S. Treasury note
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio's resurfacing in the news sent his phone ringing off the
wall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've received 300 phone calls. Some are from back then
(Sharpstown). No, Ben (Barnes) has not called,'' Osorio said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Osorio claimed Barnes, then lieutenant governor, wanted
cash for a role in passage of legislation favorable to some
bankers. Though no charges resulted and Barnes vehemently denied
the account, his rising political star faltered after Osorio made
his claims.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio said he did his time, paid his fine and has therefore
repaid his debt to society and the individuals he may have harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 30 years ago,'' Osorio said, adding, ``Nothing's
hanging over my head right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Osorio said he and Loden, a typist, met through mutual friends
about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a partnership-type arrangement. Now it's a financial
partnership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if theirs was a romantic relationship, he said, ``Not yet,
but it's getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known a better person in my life,'' she cooed.

 CHASE CEO IS UNASSUMING PLAYER WHO EXERTS QUIET CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHASE-MORGAN) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For one of the nation's top bank executives, William
B. Harrison Jr. is surprisingly accustomed to the background.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of North Carolina in the 1960's, he warmed the
bench on a basketball team that included a future member of the
Hall of Fame. At Chemical Bank, which he joined soon after
graduation, he rose through the ranks in the shadow of Walter
Shipley, his mentor. Even last year, when Harrison became the chief
executive of Chase Manhattan, with which Chemical had earlier
merged, many employees still had little sense of who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, as the chief executive of the corporate behemoth
that will result from the combination of Chase Manhattan and J.P.
Morgan, Harrison finds himself squarely in the spotlight. The lanky
North Carolina native may lack the forceful personality of other
bank executives, like Sanford I. Weill at Citigroup or David H.
Komansky at Merrill Lynch, but his task will be one of the most
watched on Wall Street: to successfully meld two different
companies into the world's third-largest financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, founded in 1861 by its namesake, is among the
leading managers of money for blue-chip companies and wealthy
individuals. Chase has a larger, middle-market business, with a
commercial unit that includes more than 500 branches and a
corporate division focused on smaller or higher-risk concerns.
Harrison and his fellow executives hope the new company can combine
J.P. Morgan's expertise at developing new products with Chase's
large customer base to become one of the nation's top investment
banks, which neither has been on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison may not be the most charismatic leader, friends and
associates said, but few other executives have his experience in
overseeing complicated mergers. Over the last decade, he has played
a key role in the two important deals.
</P>
<P>
   First, Chemical merged with Manufacturers Hanover, another New
York bank, in 1991, the same year Harrison became vice chairman.
Five years later, it bought Chase Manhattan and took the name of
the older company in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Shipley and Harrison were careful not to pull a
power play by ousting all the top executives at the banks they were
acquiring. Instead, the two tried to identify the most talented
managers and then sought to keep them, analysts said, and Harrison
has also been comfortable dipping into competitors' executive ranks
to fill key posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they've done mergers, they've done them in a very
collegial way,'' said Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, who had predicted the Chase-Morgan merger.
</P>
<P>
   James McCormick, the president of First Manhattan Consulting
Group, who has worked on and off with Harrison the last 15 years,
said his experience handling bank mergers is ``unparalleled,''
particularly as it relates to not upsetting the large corporate
clients of either bank.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say Harrison is a good listener who is also
comfortable crunching numbers on his own or making an unpopular
decision. ``I don't think he's a consensus manager by any stretch
of the imagination,'' said John F. McGillicuddy, the former head of
Manufacturers Hanover who sits on Chase's international advisory
board. ``He listens to people and then makes his own decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with American Banker, Harrison said, ``I'm
not the type of person who goes home and agonizes over a decision
I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   His banking roots run deep. He was born in 1943 in Rocky Mount,
N.C., where his grandfather ran a bank at the middle of the
century. As a teen-ager, Harrison worked at the bank in the summer.
His father was a full-time employee and also served as the mayor of
Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the younger Harrison moved 100 miles west to Chapel
Hill to attend the University of North Carolina and play basketball
there, as his father had in the 1930s. The son was far from a star,
however. In his only year on the varsity, the 6-foot-4 forward
played in just two games and took two shots, making one. (The star
of the team was Billy Cunningham, now in the Hall of Fame.)
</P>
<P>
   Even though Harrison quit after that season, he has said he
learned a good deal about management from his coach, Dean Smith,
who was then in the third year of a tenure that would last 35 more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison joined Chemical soon after graduating with a degree in
economics, and has never left. He oversaw its European business in
the early 1980s and then returned to New York to lead Chemical's
corporate banking division.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chief executive last year, Harrison has spent
much of his time trying to change Chase's status as a technology
laggard, with a struggling online banking business and little
ability to underwrite initial public offerings. He took the bank's
senior executives on a trip to the West Coast to meet with Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Scott McNealy, the head of
Sun Microsystems. Harrison also led Chase's purchase of Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, a San Francisco boutique known for helping small technology
companies go public.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, however, he has developed little of a public
persona and, if Wednesday's announcement of the deal was any
indication, Harrison may be happy to let that continue. As is his
custom, he deferred to other Chase executives on a variety of
questions. He even allowed Douglas A. Warner III _ the head of J.P.
Morgan, the company Harrison is taking over _ to speak first and,
in an interview later, to interrupt him on more than once
occasion. &QL;

 &HT;    How Sydney 2000 compares with Atlanta 1996
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sydney _ Divide and conquer appears to be one of the central
tenets of Olympic organizers here.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are taking advantage of this beautiful, sprawling
city, which draws its energy from its seemingly inexhaustible
supply of zigzagging beaches and the inherent kindness and charm of
its laid-back residents.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan of separating most of the athletic events from the
entertainment area is the exact opposite of the one used four years
ago by Atlanta organizers, who squeezed visitors and events onto
the already crowded downtown landscape.
</P>
<P>
   That essential difference, designed to take advantage of the
natural ebb and flow of this harbor town, will be paramount when
Sydney takes center stage Friday, hoping to avoid Atlanta's
well-publicized excesses and glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney and Atlanta also have similarities, including
transportation problems that need to get fixed for these spread-out
Games to function properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation is the single biggest challenge we face, and
it's important we straighten it out,'' said Brett Gale, a spokesman
for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the differences in the two undertakings:
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta's unchecked commercialism, with billboards,
sidewalk stands and kiosks giving the city the air of a sprawling
Southern carnival, the International Olympic Committee mandated
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC was very strong on us not having the commercialism
Atlanta had,'' Gale said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a clean and expansive Olympic Park relatively free
of flashy logos and intrusive commercial displays. At 1,900 acres,
it is about three times the size of Centennial Park, the Georgia
Dome, Philips Arena and CNN Center combined. The park has room to
breathe, and sponsor pavillions have been placed on the far
southern corner.
</P>
<P>
   The site, about 45 minutes from the central business district,
used to be the home of an enormous meat-packing plant and
slaughterhouse and a dumping ground for industrial waste. The
environmental group Greenpeace worked with Olympic builders to
clean up the site and make it eco-friendly and solar-powered. The
result is intensive recycling, no plastic soda cups and disposable
cutlery made from wood and solid cornstarch.
</P>
<P>
   The village housing the athletes is across a creek from the
venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land was a site basically going to the dogs,'' Gale said.
``It made a perfect location'' for the massive project.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorship banners are evident, to be sure, but no billboards
clog the entrance to the city from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's more controlled (commercially),'' said Elsie
Hasting, an Olympic media manager who held a similar position
during the Atlanta Games. ``It's been quite interesting to see the
marketing gurus be as creative as possible within the guidelines
set by the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   An example: ``Look at the Goodyear blimp,'' she said. ``It says
`G'day' in blue and gold, and yet everybody recognizes the shape
and what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   However, seven McDonald's outlets are in the park and two are in
the athlete's village.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating the sports on one end of the city, organizers
were able to put most of the entertainment in the harbor area,
where officials expect to draw more than 1 million visitors. In
contrast, about 500,000 people are expected to attend the events in
Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Olympic Arts Festival has preceded the big noise of
the Games. The festival opened Aug. 18, and virtually every event
after Friday will be in the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to separate (athletics and entertainment)
reflects the geography of the city and removes a huge crush of
people,'' Gale said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the entertainment events will be split among six different
areas around the central business district and harbor. The spots
will offer different types of music, from family-oriented themes
and symphony to rock `n' roll and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, much of the entertainment was in Centennial Park,
where some of the Games' sponsors built huge pavilions. And
Coca-Cola built its Olympic City amusement area adjacent to the
park.
</P>
<P>
   While the soft-drink giant is a visible sponsor in Sydney's
harbor area, company spokesman Scott Jacobson said, ``We don't have
something on the scale of Coca-Cola Olympic City.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based United Parcel Service is represented in all six
entertainment areas here, but UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said,
``They're not huge pavilions that some sponsors had in Centennial
Olympic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key difference is created by Mother Nature. For the most
part, Atlanta's heat and humidity during the '96 Games turned out
to be milder than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Sydney this time of year can be cool and windy. Some
organizers are concerned that the weather might increase the threat
of pulled muscles in track and field, especially for sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry about a major negative from all of the water
surrounding the city. Sharks are in the harbor area where the
swimming leg of the new triathlon event takes place. Georgia's Lake
Lanier had no such worries.
</P>
<P>
   In both Games, local residents complained that the high and
mighty got much better access to good tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities are using the Games to pole vault themselves onto
the world stage. Atlanta wanted to take what it believed was its
rightful place among international cities. Sydney wants to promote
itself to the billions who will be watching and hope that viewers
will conclude that a trip Down Under is worth it, despite the long
travel time and jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest glitch so far has been transportation. As in
Atlanta, volunteer drivers are getting lost, and hundreds of
additional drivers are needed. That number could increase if some
of the drivers quit in frustration because of the disorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The main headline in Wednesday's Sydney Morning Herald blared:
``Organisers own up to bungling on buses.''
</P>
<P>
   The bungling label is one pinned on Atlanta organizers
repeatedly because of transportation and computer glitches. And
it's one Sydney wants desperately to avoid.

   U.S. Delays Punitive Duties on European Luxury Goods
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has delayed punitive duties on European luxury
goods, including Scottish cashmere, British shortbread and Italian
pecorino cheese, because Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has
shown ``unprecedented'' support for the American position on two
trade disputes, administration officials said. The reprieve gives
United States trade negotiators some leverage to avoid a head-on
collision with Europe in a potentially far more costly trade
dispute over tax breaks Washington gives American exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate cleared the last major hurdle to passing a trade bill
with China, and handing President Clinton one of his top remaining
foreign policy goals.

TOLEDO WANTED FOSTER AND FARGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The California high school football recruiting
class of 1998 was one of the best in the decade. It included such
names as Carson Palmer, Jason Thomas, Robert Thomas, Ken Kocher and
Jashon Sykes. But right at the top of the list were two running
backs _ DeShaun Foster and Justin Fargas.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks' Fargas, by winning the state
100-meter championship as a junior, began his senior season as the
state's premier prospect. But Foster's phenomenal senior season at
Tustin _ he rushed for 3,398 yards and a state-record 59 touchdowns
_ brought him the same attention.
</P>
<P>
   As signing day approached, UCLA was a finalist for both players.
</P>
<P>
   But the day before, Fargas announced he would attend Michigan
instead of UCLA or USC. Foster, in a press conference the next day,
chose UCLA over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted both of them,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``They
were both outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said during the recruiting process, neither Fargas nor
Foster asked him about the other one _ a sign, he said, of
confidence in both players that they would be the marquee
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would have done had he gotten both, Toledo smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out,'' he said, hinting at his allegiance to Foster.
``Fargas would have really helped us at cornerback.''

 &HT;    Falcons' offensive fortunes on the line
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While walking off the field Sunday in Mile High
Stadium, Bob Hallen muttered, among other things, ``It's
embarassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' left guard could have been talking about the play
of the entire team after a 42-14 loss. Or he could have been
talking about the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head coach wants, and rightfully so, to get the five best
guys on the field, and we'll keep working toward that,'' offensive
line coach Art Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is over, but tryouts continue. At least seven
offensive linemen will play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave up six sacks to the Broncos, and quarterback
Chris Chandler spent a lot of time on the ground. While all weren't
the fault of the line, that's where the problems start.
</P>
<P>
   Hallen will start, and Chris Banks, claimed off waivers two
weeks ago, will get at least 15 plays at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Claridge and Ephraim Salaam will split time again at
right tackle, and Claridge probably will get a few snaps at right
guard in place of starter Anthony Redmon.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Atlanta didn't get a first down on its first seven
possessions. ``When you get that many three-and-outs, you didn't do
a good job,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Our performance offensively
was so poor. It always starts up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge said, ``We've got to communicate better. We need to
talk more so everybody knows what the (defensive) front is, how we
need to block it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons went 14-2 in 1998, the starters were the same
for all 16 games _ Bob Whitfield, Calvin Collins, Robbie Tobeck,
Gene Williams and Salaam, from left to right.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only Whitfield, the left tackle, and Salaam started
all 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity, chemistry, cohesion _ whatever you want to call it _
began crumbling in the first game. The 1998 lineup had started
every preseason game, but before the regular season started,
coaches moved Hallen, the team's second-round draft choice a year
earlier, in front of Collins, a sixth-round choice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hallen lost his job to Greg Bishop and got it back because of an
injury, but then other injuries ransacked the interior line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tobeck is on injured reserve in Seattle, Williams is
playing the bass guitar somewhere under the nickname ``Big Daddy
Chocolate,'' Collins is at center, where he played in 1997, and
Salaam is rebounding from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a better overall group,'' Shell said. ``We're
not as experienced, but we have more talent, more athletic ability.
But we have to get a little more adept at picking up the game,
especially stunts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallen said, ``In the running game, we need to stay on our
blocks longer. As far as pass-blocking, you just have to get it
done. If Chris (Chandler) needs 10 seconds to throw the ball, we
need to block for 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the line is learning as it plays. ``Anthony is new to
the system, . . . and things are being taught to him differently
than before,'' Shell said. ``Everything is being thrown at Travis
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvin is back to center,'' he said, ``but the only constant
is Whitfield, and it's reflected in his play. He's a hell of a
player, . . . but the rest of them got to get it going.''

BUSH TAX CUT LOSES APPEAL FOR REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many congressional Republicans have decided that
the big across-the-board tax reduction advocated by their party's
presidential nominee does not play well in their races for
re-election and have instead adopted a strategy that emphasizes
debt reduction and bite-size tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While many of them refuse to criticize the $1.3 trillion tax cut
plan proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Republican
candidates and incumbents on the campaign trail and in Congress
have distanced themselves from his 10-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is running for the House seat
being vacated by Rep. John Kasich, said that voters were ``not
especially'' intrigued by Bush's tax plan. ``What I am hearing more
about this year are specific things, and the two specific things
I'm hearing a lot about are the death tax and the marriage tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican lawmakers say that Bush is repeating the mistake
they made in 1999 when they pushed a tax-cut plan that totaled $800
billion over 10 years. After President Clinton refused to sign the
bill, Republicans found so little public support for the proposal
that they did not even try to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans broke their tax cut proposals into
smaller chunks, including one that would eliminate the so-called
marriage penalty and another that would have abolished federal
estate taxes. Though Clinton has also vetoed these proposals,
Republicans say they are not shy about making them campaign issues
in their attempt to hold on to their control of the House and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just an individual emphasis,'' said Melissa Hart,
a Pennsylvania Republican campaigning for the currently held by
Rep. Ron Klink, a Democrat who is retiring. ``It's easier to get
your arms around, especially the marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates for the House and Senate are running
television advertisements that mostly focus on specific tax cuts,
like ending the marriage penalty. Among those candidates who are
taking a more cautious approach is Rep. Rick Lazio, who is in a
tight race with Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate seat from New
York and who has proposed a more modest tax-reduction plan that
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bush has made his large tax cut the centerpiece of
his campaign, a move that baffles some congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trapped,'' said an aide to a Republican House leader
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He's where we were in 1999.
He's talking about a big tax plan this year. Voters just want to
know what's in the tax plan, the components, not a big number.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican strategists say that talking about a huge
lump-sum tax cut gives Democrats the opportunity to attack it as a
sop to the affluent. The Bush campaign has in recent days tried to
counter such attacks by showcasing families at campaign rallies and
detailing how the tax cut plan would aid them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not aware of what the Bush package calls for,''
said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``If they are just
looking at the overall package and hear Gore talk about tax cuts
for the wealthy, they tend to win. If we break down the tax
package, we tend to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some Republicans embrace Bush's tax cut plan. ``I
think highly of his tax package,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
``We have to do a better job of selling the tax cut. They have to
talk about the elements of it. If not, it never works. We learned
that battle last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans say a major reason for any differences in
emphasis is the differences in the offices that Bush and
congressional candidates are seeking. While presidential candidates
tend to campaign on grand themes, those running for the House and
Senate tend to push more measured proposals and more measured
goals. ``The difference is running for the Senate, rather than
running for president,'' said Stuart Roy, spokesman for the
National Republican Senatorial Committee. ``It's more salient for
our candidates to talk about specific programs, and it's more
believable. It's not believable that one single senator would be
able to pass an expanded tax bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, disputes the notion that
there is any significant difference in emphasis between what the
Republican presidential candidate is pushing on the stump and what
Republican candidates for Congress are emphasizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the smaller targeted tax cuts make up our tax cut _
marriage penalty relief, death tax repeal, abolition of the
earnings limit,'' Fleischer said. ``Those were all put forth in
Congress this year, and, of course, Congress has the burden of
dealing with the president who would rather spend more money than
deliver tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to push smaller tax cuts rather than rallying around
Bush's tax reduction plan has not necessarily made things easier
for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied by Clinton's vetoes of their estate tax and marriage
penalty bills, congressional Republicans on Tuesday unveiled a
proposal to apply what they said was 90 percent of next year's
budget surplus to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans spoke of their proposal as committing 90
percent of next year's expected $268 billion surplus _ or about
$240 billion _ to paying down the national debt, a closer look at
the plan reveals the major new commitment to debt reduction is more
modest.
</P>
<P>
   Since $198 billion of the expected surplus will be in the Social
Security and Medicare trust funds _ two accounts that Congress has
vowed not to use for spending programs or tax cuts _ that money
would be applied to the national debt anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Republicans' plan only commits $42 billion in new funds
_ or about 16 percent _ of the surplus for debt reduction. The idea
is aimed at giving Republicans a politically palatable opening
position in the end-of-the-year budget negotiations with the White
House, but the effect is to push them even further away from Bush,
who seldom mentions debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gleefully pointed out the differences between the
Republicans' new stress on reducing the national debt and Bush's
emphasis on slashing tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he get the message that tax cuts are out?'' chortled Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``They should make some ads and send a
subliminal message to George Bush that tax cuts are not popular.
Big time, as we say.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the day Wednesday, Democratic leaders and
administration officials poured scorn over the Republicans' latest
proposal to use some of the surplus to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people aren't buying these huge tax cuts and
Republicans are scrambling to get away from them,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle.

FREEING MEN FROM THE FEAR OF TOUCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
 By GIA KOURLAS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Charles Wright sees it, one of the greatest
disparities between men and women has to do with touch. ``Women
have the freedom to touch in public, and men don't,'' Wright, the
artistic director of the downtown school Dance Space Center, says.
``Words like brotherhood are a little corny, but men do need a
forum to be able express whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   His solution, In the Company of Men, is a series devoted to the
theme of men. Now in its fifth season, the program, organized by
Wright and presented at the Pace Downtown Theater Sept. 21 through
Sept. 24, is a celebration of the dynamic of men dancing together,
in both joyous and virtuosic terms.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic provided the impetus for Wright, who started
In the Company of Men in 1994 as a way to honor male dancers, both
living and dead. ``But if you took AIDS out of the picture, young
boys are still not entering the dance force,'' Wright says. ``I
always thought that the feminist movement would have a trickle-down
effect; that it would suddenly be acceptable for men to be nurses,
women to be doctors and boys to be dancers. But it hasn't happened.
So part of the genesis of In the Company of Men is to do my part
and say, `This is a great profession.'''
</P>
<P>
   With Jerome Foundation support, the series has transformed
itself from a pickup group presenting existing pieces into a
diverse, powerful forum for new work. This season, premieres are
offered by eight choreographers. While Nathan Trice delves into
mythology in ``Prophet and Betrayer,'' Andrew Asnes and John Selya
_ former members of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and Ballet
Theater, respectively _ present a hilarious number set to music by
Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Synch or Swim,'' Asnes and Selya tap effortlessly in an
elegant soft-shoe routine and soar through the air in astonishing
leaps and turns _ not wearing soft ballet slippers or jazz shoes
but flippers. ``Dancing is hard enough,'' says Selya, who also
performs with Twyla Tharp's new group. ``You know those people who
run with ankle weights? When they take them off, they're winged
gods. Well, if I can do an entrechat-huit in flippers, after I shed
them?'' _ he raises an eyebrow dramatically _ ``Nijinsky!''
</P>
<P>
   There is an ecological message running throughout this riotous
yet challenging piece. At the start, Selya sits on the side of a
boat. He drinks a can of soda, crushes it and throws it into an
imaginary ocean. Then the two dancers, in unison, explode in jumps
and faux-swimming antics on the floor _ in one, they glide across
the stage on their stomachs like acrobatic worms _ as sickly fish
and garbage float by, pulled by strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're funny by nature, but this is a serious eco-statement,''
Selya, an avid surfer, explains. ``So we put that message out
against our little dance, and it's a nice juxtaposition.''
</P>
<P>
   For Asnes, who retired from Taylor's company in August and
danced briefly with Tharp, it is also an opportunity to have some
fun. ``I didn't want to worry about making anything
extraordinary,'' he says. ``The pressure when you leave a company
like Paul's and choreograph is that everybody's looking to see what
you can do. We just wanted to make something that we'd enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Jensen, an emerging choreographer based in Minneapolis,
takes a more sober approach in ``Herakles and Ganymede,'' a duet
inspired by Greek sculptures that depict men engaged in battle or
desire. ``I wanted to see if I could diffuse the conflict and the
sex of the images,'' he says. ``To see if there is another way for
men to touch that doesn't have to do with fighting or sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen's ``Herakles'' directly addresses the stereotypes that
Wright believes hamper male dancing _ that it deals only with
issues of homoeroticism or aggression. But there is more at stake
for Jensen: ``I like the idea that, for once, I won't have the
dressing room all to myself.'' He laughs. ``I always felt left out.
I missed out on all the gossip! This will be the one time when I
get to be part of the crowd.''

 &HT;    Tabloid seeks more info on Cody Gifford
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kathie Lee Gifford's 10-year-old son may
not be a star yet, but he's getting star treatment by the Boca
Raton-based tabloid, ``The National Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekly trashed Cody Gifford in February with a story
headlined, ``Kathie Lee Wrecking Cody's Life! Pushy Mom's creating
a monster.'' Describing him as a ``rebel without a clue,'' it said
he threw tantrums, spit calamari in a restaurant and took a Magic
Marker to a pair of pants at a children's clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   The Giffords sued April 6, saying the article was false and
defamatory. Now ``The National Examiner'' is getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid is asking the family to turn over anything that
might show that Cody Gifford had behavioral problems before the
article was written.
</P>
<P>
   Report cards. Home movies. Classmates' addresses. The names of
nannies. Prescriptions and medical records. Summer camp records.
Disciplinary records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offensive to me that after they lied about the kid, they
are now asking him to answer these kinds of questions,'' said the
Giffords' attorney, Deborah Drooz, of Los Angeles. ``They don't
care who they hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The requests for personal information won't intimidate the
Giffords, Drooz said. They will ask the judge, Palm Beach County
Circuit Judge Timothy McCarthy, to deny requests for irrelevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in West Palm Beach, McCarthy will hear both sides'
arguments on the tabloid's motion to have the suit thrown out. If
the judge lets it move forward, the Giffords will have 30 days to
ask him to throw out the publication's request for the information.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid's attorney, Jay Shapiro, of Miami, was unable to
return phone calls, according to his office.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is not the first to be spawned by tabloid interest
in the Gifford family. ``The Globe'' sued the ``National Enquirer''
in 1998 over a story about Frank Gifford's 1997 affair with Delray
Beach flight attendant Suzen Johnson, saying they had exclusive
rights to the story. American Media Inc., which owned ``The
National Enquirer `` then, now owns ``The Globe'' and ``The
National Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kathie Lee Gifford has fought to keep her children's lives
out of the the tabloids, she has let Cody appear on television
shows. In the March 12 ABC-TV movie ``Janine &AMP; Alex: Cover Girls,''
Cody played the younger brother of a sexy supermodel. He also has
appeared on Kathie Lee's talk show and holiday specials.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie and Frank Gifford understand that they are fodder for the
tabloids, said Drooz. That doesn't mean their children should be,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gifford's primary concern is about the kids,'' Drooz said.
``They want to send the message to the hounding tabloids: Stay away
from our kids.''

 &HT;    Knight did this to himself
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Knight _ or Coach Knight or Mister Knight or General Knight
or god or whatever it is he wants to be called by anyone he deems
unworthy of his presence _ had this coming.
</P>
<P>
   And he has had this coming for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he looks pathetic, which is what happens to a bully the
instant he discovers his number really is up. Knight bleating about
how he's misunderstood and mistreated comes as no surprise. He has
his apostles and apologists who agree with him when he says his
words and actions are too often misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   How convenient. It's always somebody else's fault.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to list again the litany of misbehavior Knight
exhibited during his 29-year dictatorship as head basketball coach
at Indiana University. In the end, the only review necessary is
this one: Knight couldn't control himself even when he knew the
slightest step outside a zero-tolerance guideline set down by
school administrators just four months ago would result in his
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Knight couldn't even do that. Not even when he was warned,
finally, in public and private by university officials that the
institution wouldn't stand for another of his embarrassing
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Know why he couldn't control himself?
</P>
<P>
   Because he didn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody tells Knight what to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's absurd to believe Knight didn't understand the rules set
forth under the zero-tolerance policy. What's not absurd is to
believe he contested the policy's constraints whenever it suited
his purpose. He had to know a physical confrontation with a student
_ over nothing more than the student addressing him as ``Knight''
and Knight finding that discourteous _ would mean trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he grabbed the kid hard by the arm or maybe he just
grabbed him. Maybe he cursed the kid and maybe he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in and of itself, as Indiana University President
Myles Brand said, wasn't enough to warrant Knight's firing. It was
the incident heaped upon several others cited since the May edict
was put into effect. This wasn't the first time Knight violated the
zero terms of zero tolerance; it just happened to be the last.
</P>
<P>
   JUST ENOUGH ROPE
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Knight has acted in a ``defiant and hostile'' manner
and been argumentative and uncooperative in several instances since
May.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was the university gave Knight enough rope to hang
himself, and he obliged. Knight's explanation for the campus
encounter with freshman Kent Harvey _ and good luck to that kid at
dear ol' IU _ was that he felt disrespected and was trying to teach
him some manners.
</P>
<P>
   Knight on civility.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, somebody hire him to teach a class on human relations.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody will hire him, of course.
</P>
<P>
   He's a brilliant basketball coach. He never cheated to win, and
he won a lot. His players graduated at a rate far above the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst part of Knight long ago consumed the best part.
Knight's belligerent arrogance was so staggering he couldn't save
himself from himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember that. Nobody did this to Knight. He
did it to himself.

BOMB BLASTS THROUGH INDONESIAN STOCK EXCHANGE BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES death total in lede; SUBS 15th graf to conform)  
(This story does not carry a byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A car bomb exploded in the parking garage
of the Indonesian Stock Exchange building Wednesday, killing at
least 13 people and wounding dozens in the latest round of violence
to hit this troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion was the latest unexplained bombing in recent weeks
in Jakarta and other cities, and came just hours before a
high-profile corruption trial against Indonesia's former president,
Suharto, was to resume on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Jakarta police detective said that anecdotal evidence linked
Wednesday's blast to the case against Suharto. The night before the
trial opened on Aug. 31, another car bomb exploded 300 yards from a
building in south Jakarta where the case was being tried.
</P>
<P>
   The police detective, Harry Montolalu, told reporters at the
scene, ``This is being done to create instability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, who uses only
one name, refused to speculate about the involvement of anyone
linked to Suharto or his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we haven't caught the suspects yet and the motive
is still not clear, we shouldn't conclude that way,'' the general
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has accused military and political
extremists linked to Suharto of planting bombs and inciting unrest
across the country to discredit him and destabilize his
democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wahid also accused elements within the army of responsibility
for an attack last week on a U.N. refugee agency office in West
Timor that killed three foreign aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The country's attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, who spent
eight months investigating the Suharto family, has contended that
Suharto's supporters were instigating violence in order to derail
the corruption trial as well as investigations into past human
rights abuses by the military, including in East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said those incidents included a bomb explosion at his
office complex in July, just one hour after Suharto's youngest son
was questioned in connection with the corruption case against his
father. No one was injured in that blast.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's short-staffed and poorly equipped police force has
failed to name a single suspect in any of the incidents, and
Wednesday's explosion was expected to increase international
pressure on Wahid to restore order in his country of 210 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rusdihardjo said, ``I apologize for not being able to solve the
previous explosion cases, but trust me, the Indonesian police are
doing our best, and we will guarantee an improvement of security.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred about 3:25 p.m. on the second basement
level of the 36-story building's underground parking garage in
Jakarta's central business district.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people fled as the blast reverberated throughout
the building and black smoke billowed into the sky from the parking
garage entrance.
</P>
<P>
   At least 27 people were rushed to the nearby Pertamina state
hospital, which soon overflowed with casualties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Firefighters rushed to the scene to battle an underground blaze
in the garage that was apparently started by a power generator
damaged in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people were believed to have died from smoke
inhalation, some while hiding in their cars in hopes of escaping
the fire. Rescue workers pulled at least three burned bodies from
the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is confirmed that the explosion came from a bomb in a
car,''the police spokesman, Nur Usman, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's bombing appeared to further erode the public's faith
in the country's security forces and re-enforced the perception
that Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest nation, is spiraling out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what has happened is that the capacity of the security
forces to control this has really broken down,'' said Andi
Mallarangeng, a leading political analyst, who said he had been in
the stock exchange building only two hours before the blast.

 &HT;    Tabloid seeks more info on Cody Gifford
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kathie Lee Gifford's 10-year-old son may
not be a star yet, but he's getting star treatment by the Boca
Raton-based tabloid, ``The National Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekly trashed Cody Gifford in February with a story
headlined, ``Kathie Lee Wrecking Cody's Life! Pushy Mom's creating
a monster.'' Describing him as a ``rebel without a clue,'' it said
he threw tantrums, spit calamari in a restaurant and took a Magic
Marker to a pair of pants at a children's clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   The Giffords sued April 6, saying the article was false and
defamatory. Now ``The National Examiner'' is getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid is asking the family to turn over anything that
might show that Cody Gifford had behavioral problems before the
article was written.
</P>
<P>
   Report cards. Home movies. Classmates' addresses. The names of
nannies. Prescriptions and medical records. Summer camp records.
Disciplinary records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offensive to me that after they lied about the kid, they
are now asking him to answer these kinds of questions,'' said the
Giffords' attorney, Deborah Drooz, of Los Angeles. ``They don't
care who they hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The requests for personal information won't intimidate the
Giffords, Drooz said. They will ask the judge, Palm Beach County
Circuit Judge Timothy McCarthy, to deny requests for irrelevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in West Palm Beach, McCarthy will hear both sides'
arguments on the tabloid's motion to have the suit thrown out. If
the judge lets it move forward, the Giffords will have 30 days to
ask him to throw out the publication's request for the information.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid's attorney, Jay Shapiro, of Miami, was unable to
return phone calls, according to his office.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is not the first to be spawned by tabloid interest
in the Gifford family. ``The Globe'' sued the ``National Enquirer''
in 1998 over a story about Frank Gifford's 1997 affair with Delray
Beach flight attendant Suzen Johnson, saying they had exclusive
rights to the story. American Media Inc., which owned ``The
National Enquirer `` then, now owns ``The Globe'' and ``The

 &HT;    The General's last stand
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, IND. _ On a festive evening that evoked Indian
summer, Bob Knight bid farewell Wednesday to the crowd that always
loved him best, the University of Indiana student body.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling 20-minute speech, Knight made a pitch for his wife
Karen's walk-run for cancer fund raiser next month, took several
minor shots at the administration that fired him Sunday, even
complaining that none of the top executives at IU thanked him for
doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   But his big pitch was to the students, asking that they support
this year's team as they had supported his teams since 1971, though
it appeared none of the 2000-01 team members was present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted our players to be members of the student body
and the students to be a part of our team,'' he said. ``If you want
to do something to remember me by, contribute the same energy, the
same enthusiasm as the students who came before you.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telling omission, he did not mention interim coach Mike
Davis. And when he recounted the names of favorite Hoosier players,
he mentioned Indiana Pacers coach Isiah Thomas, who offered Knight
a spot on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   The farewell to Knight, sponsored by the student newspaper, the
Indiana Daily Student, was held on a dirt-pocked field known as
Dunn Meadow, a long block down from the main entrance to the
campus. There were no less than less than 10 satellite TV trucks
with 21 cameras set up in areas that were ribboned off.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a few students watched from the porch of a
narrow frame house called ``The Roach Motel.'' Someone had put a
hand-lettered sign that read, ``The Roach Motel Supports the
General.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs produced pro-Knight T-shirts that sold for $15.
One read ``Hoosier Daddy Now'' on the front and on the back said,
``Good Knight General, the day IU died, Sept. 10, 2000.'' Joe Dorn
sold his shirts, 200 of them, out of the back of a Chevy Blazer.
``Good Knight, Farewell Coach, Farewell Basketball Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   And the student body responded, starting to gather two hours
before Knight's scheduled appearance at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some students admitted they were skipping class to honor Knight.
In an area police suggested could accommodate 6,000, there were
students up on banks leading to the sidewalks, flowing into the
street and perched in trees, a few holding placards that supported
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there might have been about 8,000, approximating the
number allowed in Assembly Hall for each Indiana basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving them, Knight said he hoped he would find students as
responsive in his next coaching post and asked them for one more
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a minute and in any fashion that you want, say a prayer
for my family and for me just as I will say one for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes after he arrived, Knight was gone. The students
cheered and then wandered into the adjacent village.

2 BROOKLYN MEN ARE CHARGED WITH DEFRAUDING IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calling themselves ``the pastor'' and ``the
apostle,'' two Brooklyn men stole at least $500,000 from immigrants
by promising them permanent visas if they trained to be church
workers, prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1999, Stephen Andrews, 50, and Andre Mason, 28, ran
the Faith Dynamics Center in Brooklyn, holding services, awards
ceremonies and fake ordinations for hundreds of people who were
told that for $1,000 to $2,000 they could get permanent resident
status as religious workers.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were indicted Wednesday in New York State Supreme
Court on 17 counts, including grand larceny and criminal possession
of forged alien registration cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men heartlessly preyed on the hopes and desires of
immigrants who sought status here in America,'' said Charles J.
Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Faith Dynamics, claiming to be a
Christian ministry, filed at least 473 applications with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for ``religious worker''
status, but never followed up on them. The indictment covers 12 of
these cases, and may include more as investigators find more
victims. Most were from the West Indies and lived in Brooklyn or
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very betrayed,'' said Jennifer, a native of Trinidad
and Tobago, who spoke on the condition that her full name not be
used. She said that for two years, she and her husband paid $50 per
service as a tithe to the center, as well as $2,500 for immigration
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going more than once a week,'' to church services, she
said, adding that as months passed with no reply from the INS,
Andrews repeatedly told her, ``It takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after hearing about a similar swindle in Nassau County,
she consulted an immigration counselor at another church who helped
begin the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That counselor, the Rev. Brian J. Jordan, a Franciscan friar of
the St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan, said the victims
were reluctant to give their names because they fear reprisals from
accomplices of the two men, who were arrested last week and face up
to seven years in prison. Their center had been closed since
December.
</P>
<P>
   According to immigration rules, an applicant for religious
worker status must have worked full time in a religious vocation
for two years before making the application.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Miles, a prosecutor in the case, said that the immigration
service had asked Faith Dynamics to document the workers'
employment. ``They didn't respond,'' he said, and the service
eventually abandoned the applications.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Andrews and Mason held fake ordination and awards
ceremonies for which participants were required to purchase tickets
and special clothing.
</P>
<P>
   While the victims held legitimate visitor visas at the time of
their applications, some may have returned to their home countries
since then, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Hynes. As for the 12
who have been located, Hynes said their status was under review,
but they would stay in the country during the trial. Jordan said he
would help them reapply for permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer said that Andrews was also an immigrant from her
country added an extra sting to her disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He of all people should understand that we need that visa,''
she said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even 141 years ago, New York City was the most
conceited city in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the landmark 1859 map that depicts a fish-eye view of
New York Harbor as nothing less than the entire globe of the earth.
This lithograph of Gotham as the hub of the world is a startling
forerunner of that iconic, much-copied New Yorker cover by Saul
Steinberg in 1976, an illustration that portrayed the city as the
self-absorbed epicenter of all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century lithograph, by John Bachmann, an artist and
publisher, is presented in ``Art and the Empire City: New York,
1825-1861,'' an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that
opens on Tuesday. It highlights the era when New York grew
exponentially from a promising provincial port city to the largest
metropolis in the Western Hemisphere, the locus of American trade,
culture and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as John K. Howat, chairman of the departments of American
art at the museum, puts it, when ``New York City became the center
of all things.'' The exhibition features 301 paintings, sculptures,
lithographs, photographs and decorative objects from 84 lenders in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If by its very title the presentation seems an exercise in New
York chauvinism, the show ``is, unrepentantly, a New York event,''
said Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, ``because it was
during that four-decade period that New York became acknowledged as
the great city in America and a great capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Catherine Hoover Voorsanger, an associate curator
at the Met and the project director of the show, putting together
the exhibition, the first comprehensive investigation of the era,
was ``a detective story on a massive scale, trying to discover how
New York became the city we know today.'' The curators attempted to
solve the mystery by conducting five years of research into the
spirit of the time, including page-by-page surveys of thousands of
magazines ranging from The New York Mirror to Godey's Lady's Book.
Then curators traveled the country to track down long-lost trophies
so they could be returned to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The works they assembled illuminate the economic, cultural and
artistic ferment that drove New York to prominence, starting in
1825, the year the city celebrated the completion of the Erie
Canal. The show ends with the firing on Fort Sumter that ushered in
the Civil War, when New York was poised to become a world city on a
par with London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a period that all historians, not just art historians,
have ignored,'' said Dr. Dell Upton, professor of architectural
history at the University of California at Berkeley. He walked
every block from the Battery to 21st Street while researching his
lead essay in the exhibition catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works have been rescued from obscurity, like the
imposing 8-foot-by-5-foot, full-length portrait of the Marquis de
Lafayette, dating from 1825-1826. He posed during his triumphant
return to America to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
Declaration of Independence. One of the most famous portraits of
its day, it was painted by Samuel F.B. Morse (yes, the inventor of
the telegraph).
</P>
<P>
   For ages it hung to the right of the speaker's rostrum in the
higher reaches of the City Council chamber, less visible to art
lovers than to the protesters who periodically rained abuse on
Council members from the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Other objects in the show have newly come to light, like a
long-lost rosewood sofa and two armchairs, made in Manhattan by the
Prussian-born cabinetmaker Julius Dessoir. The suite of furniture
was so celebrated in 1853 that it was exhibited in Manhattan at the
first American world's fair ``These are masterpieces of American
furniture-making of the period, as good as it gets in Europe or
America,'' said Voorsanger, who ran them to ground in a collector's
home in West Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important finds, original 1857 presentation boards for
Central Park, were unearthed in the city's Municipal Archives.
Created by Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux, the park's
designers, they feature photographs by Mathew Brady and oil
paintings by Vaux. They were used in 19th-century pitch-sessions
``to sell people on the idea of creating a park that could be the
lungs of the city,'' Howat said.
</P>
<P>
   The curators were also successful in landing some rarely
exhibited treasures, like a pale-pink seed-pearl necklace and a
pair of bracelets from the Library of Congress. President Abraham
Lincoln bought them from Tiffany's for $530 for his wife, Mary Todd
Lincoln, who wore them to the inaugural ball in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is the Met's largest in its American Wing since
its ``19th Century America'' show in 1970. Strangely, this exercise
in New York egoism is being sponsored, to the tune of $2 million,
by Fleet bank, the largest bank in Boston, ``because we're the
leading real-estate lender in New York, and we want to associate
ourselves with things that say New York,'' said Rena DeSisto, a
spokeswoman for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition highlights not only the work of New York artists
but also illustrates the high level of craftsmanship attained by
Gotham's immigrants from France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and other
countries. For example, on exhibit is a 10-foot-high mahogany door
and pedimented frame from the Clarkson Lawn, a grand Greek Revival
house built in Brooklyn in 1835 by immigrant craftsmen,
demonstrating the grandeur of the Greek Revival style in New York.
The house was demolished in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``Empire City'' has been traced by some historians to
George Washington. As the 19th century progressed, the city also
became known as ``The Great Emporium,'' commercially growing in
stature with the explosion of European trade and the completion of
the Erie Canal, which connected New York to the Great Lakes and the
Western Territories via the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the English, who dumped a huge inventory of textiles
in the city, New York became ``the nation's center of textile
distribution for the rest of the century,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the social forces of economic, political and population
growth, Upton said, there were important individuals who fostered
the explosion, especially Samuel Morse, who in founding the
artist-run National Academy of Design in 1826 gave American artists
recognition as independent creators rather than patrons' servants.
</P>
<P>
   New York was not only the creative center of art, but also ``the
marketplace to buy and sell paintings, cabinets and other art
forms,'' Voorsanger said.
</P>
<P>
   So, the exhibition offers an abundance of portraits, landscapes,
genre and history pictures, including some rarely loaned works by
painters in what came to be known as the Hudson River School, like
one gallery centerpiece, ``Kindred Spirits,'' the 4-foot-by-3-foot
landscape by Asher B. Durand from 1849. It normally resides in the
New York Public Library, in the gallery opposite the third-floor
reading rooms. ``We begged to get this one, and we're grateful to
have gotten it,'' Howat said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bachmann lithograph of New York City as a globe, it
is but one of a chronological array of images and maps in the
exhibition ``that show the progression from the local to the
global,'' Voorsanger said. Conventional maps and street-level views
yield to bird's-eye views from towers like the steeple of St.
Paul's Church on Broadway in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   By 1855, there was a panorama of the city from the 350-foot
wooden tower of the Latting Observatory on West 43rd Street.
Ultimately, there are views from balloons, and then the
astronaut's-eye lithograph by Bachmann in 1859.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an image that says, if you live in New York you can
command the entire world,'' Upton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The exhibition's final gallery offers a piece de resistance, the
12-foot-by-6-foot ``Heart of the Andes,'' painted by Frederic E.
Church in 1859. It has significance for the Met beyond the fact
that the artist, who became a founding trustee, donated the
painting to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the dramatic, idealized landscape of exotic
Ecuadorean mountains created a sensation, drawing 12,000 people in
three weeks to the artist's studio in Greenwich Village. It toured
Europe for two years to the acclaim of armchair travelers, and upon
its return was exhibited in Manhattan to raise money for medical
supplies for Union troops.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that exhibition ``began discussions saying that we ought
to have an art building in New York,'' Howat said. ``And,'' he
added, ``that led to the creation, six years, later, in 1870, of
the Metropolitan Museum.''

 &HT;    Harshest drought in decades looms
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After nine rain-filled years, South Florida
may be on the brink of its harshest water shortage in modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an unusually dry summer and predictions of an even
drier winter, water managers issued a warning Wednesday asking
residents, utilities and farms to conserve voluntarily in almost
all of South Florida from southern Martin County to the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   And they warned that the region faces a 90 percent chance of
mandatory cuts between now and June, which could include limiting
lawn sprinkling to three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   To keep water flowing to farms and cities throughout the winter,
water managers also are ready to drain Lake Okeechobee below its
lowest levels ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   But at least for now, they've abandoned a proposal that drew
immediate opposition from lake activists and state environmental
regulators: replenishing the lake with polluted runoff from sugar
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The district's roster of possible strategies even includes
cloud-seeding _ dropping chemicals in clouds to induce rain _ a
perennial favorite in desperate times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to prepare for the worst,'' said Frank Finch,
executive director of the South Florida Water Management District.
And according to his staff, the worst might be on the way _ a
situation that had farmers fretting about lost crops and burning
muck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a dry winter, it will be the most serious
(shortage) we've ever had,'' said Tom MacVicar, an agricultural
water consultant and former district deputy director. Even if fall
and winter rainfall is average, the growers are preparing for a 20
to 30 percent shortfall in the water available for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   While South Florida's last drought ended in 1991, the rest of
Florida and the Southeastern United States have been in the grip of
a three-year drought that has killed crops, shriveled rivers and
caused wells to go dry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's water shortage declaration, accompanied by $3.3
million in emergency spending, was a sharp turnabout from last
spring, when the district dumped 130 billion gallons out of the
lake to rescue its vast interior marsh after years of drowning.
</P>
<P>
   The lake has dropped about 3 feet since then _ 1 foot because of
those drastic releases and 2 feet because of evaporation and normal
lake releases to cities and farms, hydrologists said.
</P>
<P>
   The lower lake levels have resulted in clearer water and modest
regrowth of bottom plants along much of the south and west shores.
But the district's actions brought renewed criticism Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say, 'I told you so,' `` said Fred Rapach of
Palm Beach County's utilities department.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just did,'' said district Chairman Mike Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Even one supporter of the lake lowering was in disbelief about
the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely incredible to me that in two months' time
we've gone from 'The lake's too high' to 'Maybe the lake is too
low,' `` said Okeechobee County fisherman Wayne Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the recriminations, some board members criticized the
majority for having cut millions of dollars from next year's budget
for conservation programs and development of water supplies.
Audubon Society activist Rosa Durando said the district had
worsened the region's readiness for drought by approving scores of
development projects that will increase the demand for water.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, West Palm Beach had received 23.31 inches of
rain this year, 44 percent below normal. The lake, the heart of
South Florida's water system, stood at 11.8 feet above sea level
Wednesday, 3 feet below average for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   By the next rainy season in June, district planners said, the
lake could break its all-time record low, 9.8 feet, reached in 1981
during a severe drought. It could even fall below 9 feet, so low
that water couldn't drain on its own into canals that serve the
region's farms, the Everglades and coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for that possibility, the district is spending $2.2
million on a dozen electric pumps that could pull water out of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory cutbacks will take place if the lake falls below 11
feet after Oct. 1. On the plus side, the district hopes the low
water will allow it to burn 10,000 acres of foreign weeds that have
taken over much of the lake's marsh.
</P>
<P>
   The most furor erupted Wednesday after water managers revived
the idea of pumping sugar farm drainage _ possibly laden with
phosphorus, nitrogen and pesticides _ into the south end of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists warned that the pumping could turn the lake
murky, killing the plants that have resprouted this summer. Heavy
pumping has also coincided with increases in suspected carcinogens
in the drinking water of some lakeside cities.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed pumping test showed up on the final agenda for
Wednesday's meeting, prepared at 6 a.m. Finch and other employees
said they didn't know who had suggested the tests. Collins rebuffed
requests from Audubon activist Paul Gray for a public explanation
of how the tests would work, suggesting he speak privately with a
district scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Gray wasn't the only one baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you guys, I don't know what in the world they are
proposing,'' said Melissa Meeker, regional director for the state
Department of Environmental Protection. She said the DEP would have
to approve any pumping, and so far, the answer was no. Collins
withdrew the idea, but said pumping could return as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the water managers are hoping their appeal for
voluntary conservation will reap better results than government
commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large part of how we do during the coming year will depend
on the homeowners _ how they water their lawns, how they take their
showers,'' said district spokesman Bruce Adams.

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio
slashed into each other for nearly 60 minutes on television
Wednesday night, attacking each other's credentials, integrity and
political views.
</P>
<P>
   Near the debate's end, Lazio walked over to the first lady,
waving a piece of paper at her, and unsuccessfully challenged her
to sign a pledge, on stage, to renounce the use of soft money in
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontational approach of both candidates transformed this
first matchup between them _ indeed, the first debate Clinton has
engaged in as a candidate for public office _ into one of the
sharpest debates between two candidates for statewide office in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, viewing Wednesday night as his best chance yet to
introduce himself to New York voters, took after Clinton from the
very first question and hammered her at virtually every opportunity
for the rest of the evening. He attacked her as untrustworthy, and
mocked her attempt to serve as a senator from a state where she had
never lived until recently.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the first lady repeatedly sought to link Lazio to
the policies of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, noting
that Lazio voted with Republicans in shutting down the government
in 1994. She attacked what she described as his ``reckless'' plan
to cut taxes by at least $770 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most striking moment of the evening came not
with Lazio and Clinton, but with the first lady and the host of the
debate: Tim Russert, the host of NBC's Sunday program ``Meet the
Press.'' He showed a videotape from the ``Today'' show of Jan. 27,
1998, just after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, in which
Clinton defended her husband and denied the allegations that he had
had an affair with a White House intern. Russert asked Clinton if
she regretted ``misleading the American people'' and if she would
``now apologize for branding people as part of a vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has repeatedly declined to appear as a guest on
``Meet the Press,'' appeared shaken by the question. Her eyes
turned down and her face tensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you know Tim, that was a very, a very painful time for
me, for my family and for our country,'' she said quietly at the
debate, which was broadcast from a public television studio in
Buffalo. ``It is something that I regret deeply that anyone had to
go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to be as forthcoming as I could, given the
circumstances that I faced,'' she said, her eyes still downcast.
``Obviously I didn't mislead anyone. I didn't know the truth. And
there's a great deal of pain associated with that and my husband
has certainly acknowledged that and made it clear that he did
mislead the country as well as his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came in a debate that had been viewed as a critical
juncture for both sides _ and particularly for Lazio, who seemed
intent on erasing any doubt among Republicans about the vigor he
might bring to this contest against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio fairly leapt from the lectern as he went after the first
lady, even after her response to the question about her husband's
infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that frankly, what's so troubling here with respect to
what my opponent just said, is somehow that it only matters what
you say when you get caught,'' Lazio said. ``And character and
trust is about, well, more than that. And blaming others every time
you have responsibility? Unfortunately, that's become a pattern, I
think, for my opponent. And it's something that I reject and I
believe that New Yorkers reject. We can do well better.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lazio who went after Clinton first. But the first lady
did anything but turn the other cheek. Following up on Russert's
first question _ on the failed overhaul of health care in 1993-94 _
Lazio attacked Clinton's effort to advocate a national health care
system, saying that ``a New Yorker would have never made that
proposal'' and that ``the bottom line is, it would have been
terrible for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his response to turn to what became one of her
recurrent themes this evening: Lazio's political alliance with
Gingrich, when he served as a whip to the House speaker.
``Listening to the congressman's response reminds me of a word I've
heard a lot this year: chutzpah,'' she said. ``He'll stand here and
tell us he's a moderate mainstream member of Congress. Well, in
fact he was a deputy whip to Newt Gingrich. He voted to shut down
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert proved to be a tough questioner, though there were times
it seemed that the debate here was on the verge of spinning beyond
even his control, particularly when Lazio prodded Clinton to sign
his pledge renouncing the use of soft money, the largely
unregulated campaign contributions that have proven to be a major
benefit for the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has raised nearly $23 million for her campaign, both
through millions in soft money and in direct contributions, and
Lazio has accumulated about $19 million in one of the most
expensive Senate campaigns in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has, so far, not set up any soft-money fund-raising
committees on his behalf. However, he has benefited from spending
by independent committees, presumably not affiliated with his
campaign, which have been running ads in New York attacking
Clinton. The first lady has said that she is willing to renounce
the use of soft money, providing that Lazio obtains ``signed
agreements'' from those committees promising not to advertise in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, a number of political analysts have suggested, given
the complicated demands set down by both sides, that Clinton and
Lazio were more interested in winning political advantage than in
actually changing their campaign finance projects. At the end of
the exchange, the two candidates were talking over each other, with
Lazio standing by Clinton trying to press the piece of paper in her
hand, shouting ``We need your signature!'' and grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire that,'' Clinton said, an edge of sarcasm in her
voice. ``That was a wonderful performance. And you did it very
well.''

AN ABSTRACTIONIST MAINTAINS THE FAITH IN A SKEPTICAL ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 17)  
 By EDWARD M. GOMEZ

<P>
   In his diaries from the heyday of abstract painting in the
1950s, Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967) observed that each time he started
a new canvas, he felt a frisson of awe _ and an inevitable weight
of familiarity. He suggested that each new work was, perhaps
inescapably, one and the same with those that came before it.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, in the 1970s, process art, with links to
abstraction and minimalism, called attention to how artists
manipulated their media: sometimes finished objects looked like
specimens from testing labs for industrial materials _ a
transformation that was exactly the artists' point.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of those eras and the artistic self-awareness they
awakened are still discernible in the paintings of Louise Fishman.
Fishman, who was born and grew up in Philadelphia, is now 61 years
old. Over the years this self-described ``third-generation Abstract
Expressionist'' has not dominated art-world headlines, but since
settling in New York in 1965, she has created a substantial body of
work that has been shown regularly in gallery and museum shows and
that has won the admiration of dealers, collectors and other
artists for her dogged commitment to the language, ethos and
expressive power of abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a group of new Fishman canvases on view at Cheim and
Read, a gallery in Chelsea, through Oct. 21, people can see for
themselves how a thoughtful, self-critical artist is holding up the
mantle of abstract painting in an era of familiar, sometimes tired
postmodern polemics. The subject of the new paintings is the making
of abstract paintings itself _ the methods an artist can use to
create them and, ultimately, what they may mean and how they convey
their meanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, making a painting is a very complicated process; often
there's a lot of struggle,'' the artist said during a recent
interview at her gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in work pants and a sweatshirt, Fishman cut a reedy
figure standing before some of her largest new canvases; at times,
expansive swaths of strong color slapped against their surfaces
seemed to engulf her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may work on four or five pieces at a time, including little
ones,'' she said. ``But I don't intentionally work in series. Many
of these got started last year after I pulled out some paintings I
had been working on but had put away, then took out and started
scraping and reworking.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishman's laborious approach is well-known to her peers. In
1988, she made a trip to Eastern Europe, accompanied by a friend
who was an artist, a collector and a survivor of Nazi death camps.
The travelers visited the region's major capitals, as well as
Auschwitz and Terezin. After returning to New York, Fishman
produced a group of somber tableaus.
</P>
<P>
   Honoring Jewish themes of survival and remembrance in mood and
title, they use unfussy, rectilinear arrangements of broad
brushstrokes to whisper hauntingly for attention through nearly
transparent washes of dark color. Subsequently, Fishman said, she
found that her art ``loosened up'' _ but she worked at freeing up
her touch, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman recalled: ``Gesture came up in the early '90s for me,
but one reason I had difficulty using it was that I had a
rigid &UR;  &LR; understanding of what I wanted. I rely on my intuition, but
what fuels my work is my intellectual side.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``letting the ease'' of more free-flowing, gestural
painting ``become the brain of a work,'' she has tended to ``put a
lot of things together and throw a lot of things out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishman added: ``I think of myself as a perpetual student.''
</P>
<P>
   Her education began at home, for both her mother and an aunt
were accomplished painters. Young Louise devoured the issues of
Artnews her mother received by mail, poring over photo essays by
Rudy Burckhardt that showed Abstract Expressionists like Joan
Mitchell in the step-by-step process _ and considerable drama _ of
making a painting. As a teen-ager, Fishman played basketball; then,
in 1956, at the Philadelphia College of Art, she took up a brush.
``I fell in love with oil painting,'' she said. ``I just loved it.
There's something about this that never ceases to interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, Fishman became deeply involved in the feminist
movement, and her work took a mixed-media turn toward the
sculptural. It reflected the themes of handicrafts and ``women's
work'' that feminist artists were reconsidering from a new
aesthetic and political perspective. In time, though, she returned
to oil painting.
</P>
<P>
   While some artists are known for bringing color theory
prominently to their work, Fishman has been more fascinated by the
physical qualities of oil paint's luminous, elastic goo. ``It's
ground-up earth and rocks; it's earthy, plastic and metallic,'' she
said, referring to its pigments. Only recently, she said, has she
been able to regard standard cadmium red as something more than an
industrially concocted, aspiring-color interloper on her own
palette.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties of such bright hues, along with new elaborations of
the darting, calligraphic strokes and ``now you see them, now you
don't,'' underlying structural grids that have characterized her
paintings in recent years turn up in the new works at Cheim and
Read. In ``Razzmatazz,'' shots of pastel yellow poke through a
cascade of black-gray strokes that almost obscure a middle layer of
turquoise. A twister of broad, knotted gray strokes gathers gale
force in the big, pink expanse of ``A Stranger,'' and in ``Sunrise
Ruby,'' one of Fishman's largest new pictures, patches of mossy
green hug its surface, at once in the field of color and seemingly
afloat on a separate plane above it.
</P>
<P>
   Although she focuses intensely on her work, Fishman, who lives
in and keeps a studio in Manhattan, routinely makes time to see
museum and gallery shows. She is interested in contemporary video
art and has a small collection of Chinese scholars' rocks. Lately
she has steeped herself in Emily Dickinson's poetry and Emerson's
essays. Then there's Pollock. Of the Abstract Expressionist giant's
career-spanning exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art last year,
Fishman said: ``I was willing to go everywhere with him to see what
he kept uncovering about abstraction's emotional and psychological
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after four decades of creating abstract works herself, she
holds no formulas for making an image say or mean anything in
particular. A work's emotive force, she said, still emerges
mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   With a group of ambitious new paintings freshly behind her,
Fishman appeared both enormously satisfied and a bit on edge.
``After a show, when I go back to work, I feel I'll never paint
again,'' she said. anxiety in her voice. Then, resuming the role of
her own strictest critic, she added: ``I'm not concerned about
whether the next work will be good or not. I'm just concerned about
making it _ that it'll be something really vital and fighting that
makes me feel alive.''

   EVERETT, Wash. _ Democrats held the congressional seat here in
this northwest Washington district for 30 years until the
Republican tide of 1994 brought in Jack Metcalf, a former high
school history teacher and state legislator who finally made it to
the House of Representatives 26 years after his first attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Metcalf sticking to a pledge to leave Congress after
three terms, and with Democrats seeing the open seat as a prime
opportunity to gain in the battle for control of the House, the
race here in the 2nd Congressional District shows signs of becoming
one of the most tightly fought in the nation this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And though each of the major party candidates plays down the
notion that presidential coattails will be a major factor, some of
the emerging themes in their race are strikingly similar to those
in the campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, John Koster, a 49-year-old state
representative and third-generation dairy farmer, puts it simply in
promising to push for a big federal tax cut: ``Taxes are the first
thing people are talking about to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic foe, Rick Larsen, 35, a Snohomish County
councilman, says he will push for first reducing the national debt
and shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear from people in this district is, they're more
concerned about using the surplus to pay down the debt,'' Larsen
said. ``They want government to get its fiscal house in order. They
want schools to be safe, they want to be sure seniors can get
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   While drawing considerable attention because it involves the
only open congressional seat in the state, the race here is one of
at least three congressional contests that are considered
competitive this fall in Washington, a state that proved to be an
interesting electoral bellwether in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The state's voters broadly backed Bill Clinton and congressional
Democrats in 1992, then turned with a fury to Republicans in 1994,
giving them a 7-2 margin in the House delegation and even throwing
out the speaker of the House, Thomas Foley, a Spokane Democrat. But
they returned to Clinton in 1996, and by 1998, the Democrats had
regained the edge, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Now Democrats are hoping to add to that advantage by winning the
district, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs northward to the
Canadian border, and possibly even oust George Nethercutt, the
Republican who unseated Foley six years ago and is now reneging on
a term-limits pledge he made then.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping to hold on to both of those seats and
even regain an edge by knocking off the incumbent Democrat in the
neighboring 1st District, Jay Inslee, whose seat changed hands
three times in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the closely contested races here in Washington
could go a long way to determining control of the House, where the
Republicans now have a tenuous majority: 222 seats, as against 210
for the Democrats and two for independents, one routinely in the
Democratic camp, the other in the Republican. (One seat is vacant.)
Those numbers mean that Democrats can regain control by picking up
as few as seven seats in November.
</P>
<P>
   The district here was once reliably, even staunchly, Democratic.
It was represented in the 1940s by Henry M. Jackson of Everett, who
went on to become a senator and a national political figure. In the
years afterward, as the Boeing Co. became the ever more dominant
employer in the region, thousands of union workers here voted the
Democratic line.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Koster noted in an interview, a number of Snohomish
County's fastest-growing suburbs have leaned Republican in recent
years, and the more agricultural areas to the north also have
tended to vote Republican. Koster and Larsen agree that roughly
speaking, the district's electorate now is probably a third
Democratic, a third Republican and a third independent.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign here has yet to catch fire but will undoubtedly do
so as Election Day draws nearer. The two candidates have debated
face to face only once so far, in a relatively polite exchange in
July at a Rotary Club. But they have clashed more recently over
each other's records in office, and are expected to debate in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither expects to run expensive television advertising until
next month. For one thing, while the primaries Tuesday are
crucially important in some races, they are not central to this
one: Each man is running unopposed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, neither currently reports having a huge amount of cash
on hand _ Koster had only $176,00 as of Aug. 31, Larsen $212,000 _
although national leaders in both parties have said they expect to
pour significant amounts into the race.
</P>
<P>
   If moderate swing voters are the key to the election, some
advantages may befall Larsen, who often casts himself as a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Koster is an unabashed conservative. He said at the July debate
that he was proud to have voted against every state budget since
1994, and he is staunchly anti-abortion: In fund-raising letter
earlier this year, he said he would ``support all efforts to defund
the abortion industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with voters in the district suggested that many are
only beginning to focus on the race, although quite a few cited
cultural issues that had them leaning Republican and could energize
the turnout for Koster.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the tax reductions advocated by Koster did not
hold a lot of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tax cut, that's not as important as knowing your Medicare
coverage will be there, knowing Social Security is sound,'' said
Sherry Andrews, 51, a human resources administrator at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor at play is Vice President Al Gore's rising
standing in some statewide polls. If that trend holds, Koster might
get less of a ride on the coattails of Gov. George W. Bush than
some analysts were predicting earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've heard a lot of theories on this,'' said Koster.
``Of course, when Bush's numbers were much higher, everyone
expected there'd be coattails. But we're running this campaign like
it all depends on us. If there are coattails, that's fine and
dandy, but I'm not counting on it.''

HOUSE ADDS ASSAULTS ON GAYS TO HATE CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C., Mass., Ore., Mich., Wyo., Texas, Ill.)   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives on Wednesday endorsed
for the first time a measure to make attacks on gays a federal hate
crime, a move that was one of President Clinton's legislative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But the 232-192 vote was entirely symbolic because it did not
force lawmakers to adopt the measure, which passed the Senate as an
amendment to a defense bill in June, with broad bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the measure, which drew the support of 41 Republicans,
was an effort by Democrats to force Republicans, as the elections
approach, to take a recorded stand on expanding the hate crimes
definition to include attacks on gays and to pressure Republicans
into accepting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said Wednesday that the Senate amendment
would be stripped from the defense bill, a decision that is likely
to lead to an end-of-the-year confrontation with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the House cast its vote, the president attended a
rally for supporters of the measure, including Sherialyn Byrdsong,
the widow of Ricky Byrdsong, a black man who was killed in 1999 by
a 21-year-old white supremacist.
</P>
<P>
   Likening hate crimes to the Holocaust and efforts by Serbs to
force ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, Clinton urged Congress to
endorse the measure, and he said he was ordering the Justice
Department to improve its reporting of hate crimes. Some 7,755 hate
crimes were reported last year, ``only the tip of the iceberg,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is very important,'' he added. ``It is just not true
that hate crimes are like other crimes. It is not even true that
every crime is a hate crime. And that fundamentally is at the heart
of this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional Democrats say they hope today's strong
vote sends a signal to Republican leaders that they should rethink
their decision to kill the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that it will be very hard to explain to the
American people why, with bipartisan votes in both Houses, this
isn't included in legislation that becomes law this year,'' said
Jake Siewert, Clinton's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Wednesday was a procedural one, a request that the
lawmakers who are negotiating the defense authorization bill
include the Senate hate crimes legislation in the final product.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen.
Gordon Smith, R-Ore., would expand federal jurisdiction for crimes
based on race, religion and national origin to include sexual
orientation, sex and disabilities. It passed the Senate 57-42.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said, ``Passage of a strong hate crimes
law will send a clear message that we value everyone in our
society, and we will work together to oppose those who use hate to
divide us.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who voted not to endorse the motion argued that the
legislation was unnecessary because hate crimes were already
adequately prosecuted by states and localities. They also sought to
frame the debate as one of state rights, maintaining that the bill
would grant the U.S. attorney general too much power.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., offered an alternative proposal
that failed. Graham argued that all crimes were heinous, none more
so than the next.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said: ``When hateful thoughts
turn into hateful deeds, the Congress must act and act decisively.
We can't outlaw hatred, but we have a moral responsibility to stand
up to those who could be its victims.''

LOS ANGELES TIMES CLOSING 14 PAPERS FOCUSING ON SUBURBAN COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (This story, eliminated earlier, is now restored)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives of The Los Angeles Times said Wednesday that they
were closing 14 money-losing ``Our Times'' local newspapers, laying
off 125 employees and abandoning the strategy of winning new
readers and advertisers with hyperlocal coverage of traffic,
schools and community groups.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the paper's publisher, John Puerner, and its editor,
John S. Carroll, represents the sharpest break from the past since
Tribune Co. announced in March that it was buying Times Mirror Co.,
the newspaper's parent. Still, it continued a pattern set almost
immediately, when Tribune executives revised The Times' March
circulation figures downward, indicating that the original numbers
were overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said that the decision largely to scrap the ``Our
Times'' strategy was ``difficult in terms of the human
consequences, and also difficult in terms of community relations,
but journalistically and financially it was an easy decision.''
Puerner said that ``all of them were losing money, and the
financial performance was deterioriating.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the publications, which were run under a separate
division called Times Community Newspapers, will close, the section
that served the inland area around Ontario, in western San
Bernardino County, will continue, as will three other local weekly
supplements. The local newspaper in Ontario is owned by the
MediaNews Group, whose chief executive, Dean Singleton, owns
several newspapers that compete with The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Also surviving are some Times-owned local newspapers that served
areas like Newport Beach, Glendale and Huntington Beach and Burbank
before being absorbed into Times Community Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision undoes one of the last strategic initiatives begun
by Mark H. Willes, the former chief executive of Times Mirror, and
Kathryn Downing, who succeeded Willes as publisher of The Times.
Robert G. Magnuson, the executive who had been in charge of the
``Our Times'' effort, left the newspaper not long after it was
bought by Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said in an interview that part of the savings would be
reinvested in news coverage. He added that the closing of the local
newspapers _ some of which had been published as stand-alone papers
and some of which were distributed as sections within The Times _
was a step in rethinking local coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything that suggests we're not as
committed as we've ever been to national and foreign news,'' he
said, ``but I do think there's more work that needs to be done in
figuring out how you cover this region. In some ways it's a much
more complicated question.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and Puerner said they would continue publication of the
newspaper's three regional editions in Orange County, Ventura
County and in the San Fernando Valley.

HOUSE UPHOLDS VETO OF MARRIAGE-PENALTY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for refinements and additional information; story grows by
about 200 words)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans fell short Wednesday in their
attempt to override President Clinton's veto of the
marriage-penalty bill. But while the bill is dead, the issue it
addresses is very much alive politically.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 270-158 in favor of overriding Clinton's veto,
short of the two-thirds needed. Even if the bill had garnered
enough votes in the House, it was given virtually no chance of
getting two-thirds in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is our chance to right this wrong and finally put an end
to the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married couples,'' said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the Republicans of being more interested in
nurturing a political issue than in passing fair tax relief. ``It's
the show that counts,'' said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have made relief from the marriage penalty a focal
point for the fall campaign. ``Americans understand it is wrong to
tax marriage,'' Armey said. ``We will have to put it up on the
floor next year and have a president who will sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday's vote showed that the Republican
majority in Congress wanted to steer the country off the ``path of
fiscal discipline'' that he said his administration had followed,
and he appealed to lawmakers to work with him on fair tax relief
for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have cut taxes for married couples by $292
billion over the next decade. Forty-nine Democrats joined 220
Republicans in trying to override the president's veto. Voting to
sustain the veto were 157 Democrats and no Republicans. (The two
independents in the House were divided.)
</P>
<P>
   The vote Wednesday was similar to the 271-156 tally by which the
House voted for a somewhat smaller marriage-penalty-relief bill in
February. The Senate passed its version on July 18, by 61-38.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty is more complicated than it is sometimes
made out to be. It affects many two-income couples in the middle-
and upper-income brackets, typically those in which husband and
wife earn roughly the same amount, by pushing them into a higher
tax bracket than they would be in if they could file as single
people.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department study found that about 25 million couples
paid an average marriage penalty of $1,141 on their 1999 returns.
</P>
<P>
   But the study found that 21 million couples received a ``bonus''
averaging $1,274 because they were married. These were couples in
which only one spouse worked, or in which one partner earned much
more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   When he vetoed the Republican-backed bill last month, Clinton
said it would have benefited the wealthy while providing little
relief to middle-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the year, Clinton proposed his own idea for alleviating
the marriage penalty. His plan would not have helped couples who
itemize their deductions, as most people with higher incomes do.
The White House estimated the cost of his proposal at $45 billion
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that fell short in the House on Wednesday would have
cut taxes for almost all married couples, regardless of whether
they now pay a penalty. It would have raised the standard deduction
for married couples filing jointly but not itemizing, so that their
deduction would be equal to that of two single people.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have also gradually expanded the bottom 15
percent tax bracket for married couples to twice the corresponding
bracket for single taxpayers. And it would have increased the
earned-income tax credit limit for low-income families by $2,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage-penalty quirk arose from an effort to correct an
inequity that went the other way. Until about 50 years ago,
households with one wage earner were taxed more heavily than those
with a similar total income in which there were two wage earners.

VERMONT LAW ON GAY RIGHTS PROVES A FACTOR IN PRIMARIES
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a sign that voters in Vermont remain divided over
the state's new civil union law, five Republican state legislators
who supported the gay-rights law were defeated in Tuesday's
primary, while four other Republicans and one Democrat who
supported the law won their contested primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The primary was largely seen as a referendum on civil unions,
with many challengers campaigning largely on the issue. Earlier
this year, the Legislature enacted the nation's first law granting
same-sex couples many of the benefits and protections of marriage.
At the time, some voters threatened to retaliate at the polls
against legislators who voted for the law.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Marion Milne, a Republican who was the top
vote-getter in her central Vermont district two years ago, lost
overwhelmingly to Sylvia Kennedy, who was strongly opposed to the
civil-union law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of angry people out there,'' Milne said of
her campaign this summer. ``I saw it and I tried to talk to people
about some of the other issues, although I did tell everybody that
I was proud of my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Thomas Little, a Republican who led the House
Judiciary Committee in writing the civil-union law, defeated his
challenger, Rod Fisher. But Little said he was shaken up by the
fact that about 40 percent of his district's voters cast ballots
against him.
</P>
<P>
   In another Vermont race, Ed Flanagan, the state auditor,
narrowly defeated state Sen. Jan Backus in the Democratic primary
for U.S. Senate. Flanagan will challenge Sen. James Jeffords, a
Republican, who is running for a third term. Flanagan is the first
openly gay candidate to win a major party nomination for the U.S.
Senate, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a national
organization seeking to increase the number of openly gay and
lesbian public officials.
</P>
<P>
   The civil-unions law was not an issue in the Senate race because
Flanagan and Backus supported it. Jeffords also has said he
believed the law was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the electoral fates of about a dozen House incumbents,
most of them Republicans, were thought to have hinged on their
civil-union votes. One Democrat from Burlington, Vt., who opposed
the law was ousted in favor of a candidate who said he would have
supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Abbarno, executive director of the Vermont Republican
Party, said that voters were clearly ``sending a message,'' in
keeping with the ``Take Back Vermont'' signs that have sprung up
across the state in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it's a backlash at civil unions or not, you
can't ignore that there is an umbrella issue over Vermont,''
Abbarno said, ``that those in Montpelier aren't listening to what
the people really want.''

A BRITISH WOOLWORTH'S HANGS ON IN THE MODERN MARKETPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ One of the last vestiges of the Woolworth's empire
lives on in a British company, Kingfisher PLC, and though it has
managed to outlast its American parent, the chain of five-and-dime
stores is still searching for its place in modern retailing.
</P>
<P>
   That place looked a bit less certain Wednesday, when Kingfisher
said it would split itself in two as it reported half-year
financial results that were dragged down by sagging profit in its
general merchandise business.
</P>
<P>
   Pretax profit for the group fell 10 percent to 232.5 million
pounds, or nearly $328 million, on sales of 5.4 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement and electronics stores will form a new
Kingfisher, the company said, while the general merchandise
business, consisting of Woolworth's and a drugstore chain, will be
shunted off into an as-yet-unnamed separate company. Kingfisher's
chief executive, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, said the breakup would help
stimulate international expansion in the new Kingfisher's
businesses. The old one will try to stem its profit decline at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a shareholder, you'd want your shares in new
Kingfisher, that's the bit that's doing very well,'' said Michael
Godliman, a director with Verdict Research, a consulting group
here.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agreed. Kingfisher shares, which fell more
than 6 percent on the news of the breakup, rebounded to close in
London with a 5.3 percent gain, at 4.775 pounds, or $6.73.
</P>
<P>
   For the Woolworth store brand, however, the breakup is an
indignity, merely the latest in a series of retreats that resulted
in the near-disappearance of the famous name in the United States _
the long shadow of the Woolworth Building in Manhattan aside. The
spread of discount stores, and later the huge, specialized
``category killers,'' made the Woolworth five-and-dime format
obsolete, a relic of retailing. Remnants of it were repackaged into
Venator Group, but even those stores would be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Britain, the Woolworth chain, which was founded by the
same Frank W. Woolworth, has managed to live on. The first British
Woolworth opened on Nov. 5, 1909, on Church Street in Liverpool.
The stores, selling everything from ladies' gloves to confectionery
for less than a dime, numbered 768 by the outset of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Woolworth, in disarray, was bought by a
London-based consortium, which closed 200 stores and revitalized
the rest. By the mid-1980s, the company was expanding, purchasing
Comet, a British electronics retailer, in 1984, and Superdrug, a
cut-price chain, three years later. The transformation was complete
in 1989, when the company changed its name to Kingfisher. Woolworth
continued to thrive for the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woolworth's has managed to survive because Britain hasn't had
a tradition of discount stores,'' Godliman said, ``and so it didn't
have a lot of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, discounting is coming to this country with a vengeance.
Stores like Matalan, modeled on Wal-Mart, are booming. Wal-Mart
itself has opened a supercenter and has bought the British
supermarket chain Asda. All the while, the Internet is taking an
increased share of Woolworth's music, video and book businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Woolworth is feeling the bite. For the
six-month period ending on July 29, its profit declined 40 percent,
to 10 million pounds, or about $14.1 million, on sales of 735
million pounds. The business that begot Kingfisher accounts today
for just 4 percent of the company's overall profit and 14 percent
of its sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, British Woolworth, unwilling to go the way of its
moribund American relative, keeps trying to modernize. It is
opening general stores that sell food. And a Big W format, 10 times
the size of a typical store, is seeking to compete with
supercenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to reconfigure what Woolworth's means in the
21st century,'' Godliman said.

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES RESIST CUTTING FUEL TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT _ Truckers and farmers around Europe continued their
protests Wednesday, but political leaders dug in their heels
against cuts in the gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Schwerin, an east German city, about 400 truckers and farmers
heckled Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder as he visited the city, and
they drowned out much of his speech with whistles and horns.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, truck drivers blocked fuel deliveries to express
their anger at the rising prices and tied up streets in Brussels
and Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gasoline prices have soared, and in Germany gasoline is
fetching about $4 a gallon. That has fomented public ire at fuel
taxes, which make up as much as three-quarters of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But mindful of the huge contribution to government coffers,
political leaders have ruled out a cut in fuel taxes and have
proposed narrower and often temporary reductions on other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop this dangerous game, because it could threaten the growth
and employment prospects we currently have,'' Schroeder warned
protesting truckers in Schwerin.
</P>
<P>
   And he told ARD television, ``We have to make the use of our
resources, especially energy, more costly. The money we get will go
immediately to cut pension insurance costs. This policy has been a
success, and we can't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium refused demands for a
fuel tax rebate for the trucking industry, offering instead
reductions in taxes on truckers' insurance and a postponement on
paying next year's road taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian truckers seized the inner ring road in Brussels, but
outside the view of television cameras, the mood was surprisingly
tranquil, with some protesters even sipping beer at an outdoor cafe
near the Transportation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Gerlache, a spokesman for the Belgian government, said
officials simply were not willing to offer a permanent reduction in
gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truckers are asking for a structural reduction in the
price of fuel,'' Gerlache said. ``We don't agree to that. European
Union rules don't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, France agreed to cut its fuel tax by 15 percent, a
move that largely calmed protests that had gathered force there.
</P>
<P>
   Though gasoline taxes are sky-high across most of Europe, they
have become a particularly sore topic among Germans because
Schroeder's government has pushed through two gasoline tax
increases in the last year, with another one to take effect in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's center-right opposition party, the Christian
Democratic Union, has begun an advertising and petitioning campaign
aimed at blaming Schroeder's Social Democratic Party and its
coalition partner, the Green Party, for the gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The German federation of truckers announced plans to hold a
four-hour slowdown on Sept. 26. As envisioned, the truckers will
creep along at 40 mph on the autobahns and well below the speed
limits on smaller roads.
</P>
<P>
   Among other protests Wednesday, truckers blocked many of the
roads in and around Antwerp, a vital Belgian port city, and they
succeeded in blocking many if not most of the gasoline trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Total Fina Elf SA, Belgium's leading gasoline supplier, said it
was able to deliver only about 20 percent of the gasoline its
customers needed. ``If it lasts for a couple more days, the damage
could be catastrophic,'' a company spokesman told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, highway traffic and gasoline supplies were
normal in most countries and did not come close to the paralysis
this week in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, where strikes are common, remained tranquil and free of
gasoline shortages as trucking leaders and government officials
negotiated over competing proposals for relief.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of widespread anger about high gasoline prices
poses a problems for many European political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Most governments are now controlled by left-of-center parties,
most of which support high fuel taxes as a method of reducing
gasoline consumption and reducing the production of greenhouse
gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline taxes also represent an important and simple way for
governments to raise revenue. And under rules restricting budget
deficits for countries that have adopted the euro as a common
currency, most governments would have to offset any reductions in
gasoline taxes by increasing other taxes or by cutting spending.

FIRM CHOSEN TO BUILD MEMORIAL TO MARTIN LUTHER KING

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A monument with a ``stone of hope'' that represents
the nonviolent civil rights movement was selected Wednesday night
as the memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that will be
built on the Washington Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will convey the meaning of Martin's life,'' said Coretta
Scott King, King's widow.
</P>
<P>
   The winning design was submitted by the ROMA Design Group, an
architecture firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A likeness of King will be cut into a rock facing the nearby
Jefferson Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Dramov, president of the design firm, said the position of
King's statue would represent the unkept promises that were due to
blacks and members of other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not intended to be a eulogy,'' Dramov said. ``It is
about life and positive social change.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will be built next to the Tidal Basin between the
Jefferson Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. In keeping with its
surroundings, it will be edged with flowering cherry trees.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Fisher, a landscape architect with the design firm, said
the cherry trees were appropriate because, each spring, ``they
happen to bloom at the moment of Martin Luther King's death.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of company was made by Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity,
which was established in 1906 and later counted King among its
members. Congress granted authority to the fraternity to select the
winning design and to raise money for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much the monument will cost, Adrian L. Wallace, the
president of the fraternity, said, ``We don't have a definitive
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those participating in the announcement today were the
clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger, whose company pledged to
contribute at least $5 million for the construction.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of the monument's designer is an early step in the
process of building the first monument to an African-American on
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Approvals are still needed from three federal commissions and
the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The design will include a wall, streams of water, and a path
with niches to commemorate others who contributed to the civil
rights movement. Among them will be memorials to the four girls
killed in 1963 in the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Ala., and
to Medgar Evers, the murdered Mississippi civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   King was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis, and the place where
his memorial will be built is not far from the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial where he made his famous ``I have a dream'' speech in
1963.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were two other developments Wednesday regarding monuments
on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed monument to former President Ronald Reagan received
its first approval when the House Committee of Resources sent it to
the full House of Representatives on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The other development was a recommendation by the staff of the
planning commission that it approve the location and building plans
of the World War II Memorial at its proposed site on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   That site is just west of 17th Street, with the memorial
essentially replacing the Rainbow Pool. There has been much
opposition to the location because it would impair the grand view
of the Lincoln Memorial at the end of the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission of Fine Arts approved the design of the war
memorial on July 30, and the planning commission usually follows
the lead of the arts commissions on matters of aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   The planning commission is scheduled to vote on the memorial
next Thursday.

EVERYTHING NOT PEACHY WITH BULLDOGS FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following an embarrassing 21-10 loss to South Carolina last
Saturday, Georgia coach Jim Donnan is no doubt regretting his
summer comments about the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting last month with the Bulldog Club booster group,
Donnan gushed, ``I've been waiting 55 years to be the head coach of
a football team that has this much potential. And I guarantee you
that we're going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   That guarantee proved costly as the normally genteel residents
of the Peach State reacted in a nasty manner this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humiliating upset has the line buzzing and many people want
Donnan's head,'' roared a headline in the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Augusta Chronicle began its report of the loss this way: ``A
moment of silence, please, for the death of the Georgia Bulldogs'
2000 football season.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be enough to make Donnan regret his offseason decision
to refuse a job offer from his alma mater, North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Donnan denied reports he was up for the Wolfpack
job. Then, during the summer, he admitted the university had
offered him ``an unbelievable'' deal.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's denial and contradictory admission hardly endeared him
to Georgia fans, who already consider him untrustworthy because of
his penchant for interviewing at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling to Georgia fans: Donnan is just 20-13 in
Southeastern Conference games and 2-8 against top-10 teams since
being hired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   __ Playing on fire: During the San Diego State mascot's dance
prior to the Illinois game on Saturday night, the fireball from his
torch accidentally fell onto the Qualcomm Stadium turf.
</P>
<P>
   After five minutes and several attempts to extinguish the flame,
the fire still burned on the 5-yard line before it eventually went
out.
</P>
<P>
   __ Boller wiser: Cal quarterback Kyle Boller, a graduate of Hart
High of Newhall, admitted last season was confusing at times as he
tried to run the offense as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like playing cards and not knowing how to play the
game,'' Boller said. ``Some of the plays last year were like a
blur. I would drop back and all I would see were jerseys.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some thought that the experience might leave him a bit
shell shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him smack in the middle of some turmoil,'' Cal coach
Tom Holmoe said. ``People wondered whether I was going to scar him.
Well, maybe he got some physical scars but not emotional ones.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Class warfare: Stanford was humiliated for the third
consecutive season by San Jose State, the lightly regarded public
school 10 miles down the road from ritzy Palo Alto. And that angle
is precisely what drives Spartan players against the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the little rich kids up the street,'' San Jose State
defensive tackle John Hammer said. ``They won the Pac-10, but how
good is the Pac-10? I think the WAC is better than the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Said running Deonce Whitaker: ``Everyone knows what they have up
there and what we don't. It's like Beverly Hills getting beat by
Watts.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Spartans' 40-27 victory, San Jose State fans began
chanting ``Three-peat, three-peat, three-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State players walked past the Stanford locker room on
the way to the visiting locker room and shouted, ``Pac-10,
schmack-10,'' and ``Pac-Who?''
</P>
<P>
   __ No responsibility: The Pac-10's perceived weakness has
nothing to do with Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers' victory over New Mexico marked Oregon State's 12th
consecutive regular-season victory over a nonconference opponent.
Their last loss was at Baylor on Sept. 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   __ Miraculous recovery: Wisconsin originally said wide receiver
Chris Chambers would be unavailable for its first four games when
he suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers stuck with that diagnosis when Chambers was one of
26 players suspended for their role in receiving improper discounts
from an athletic shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   Then the NCAA, which originally said Chambers could serve his
three-game suspension while injured, changed its mind and decided
Chambers' suspensions couldn't start until he was deemed healthy
enough to play.
</P>
<P>
   Now, magically, it seems, Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said a
second diagnosis by team trainers has determined that Chambers
could have played against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Oregon game and games this week against
Cincinnati and next week against Northwestern will complete
Chambers' suspension and make him eligible to return Sept. 30
against Michigan, which is when he was originally scheduled to
return.
</P>
<P>
   __ No fan of media: Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz ripped reporters
following the Hawkeyes' 27-21 loss to Western Michigan, Iowa's 10th
straight defeat and 16th in the past 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a headline in a paper that said if we didn't win today,
we may never win this year,'' Ferentz said. ``I'm glad that guy
wasn't in charge of our country. I don't think most competitive
people think like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have 10 games left. I like the guys we have on our
football team. We're far from ready to pack it in.''

FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHEF FILES HARASSMENT SUIT
</HEADLINE>
  By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first woman hired as a full-time chef at the White House has
filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her boss, the executive
pastry chef, and against President Clinton, accusing the president
of failing to provide a procedure for filing such a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Franette McCulloch, who went to work for the executive pastry
chef, Roland Mesnier, in 1983 as assistant pastry chef, claims in
her suit that Mesnier had subjected her to ``severe sexual
harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is named in the complaint because the head of a federal
agency, in this case the White House, is typically named in civil
rights suits brought against the agency. The complaint says that he
failed to establish a method for White House employees to report
civil rights violations, as required by a 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch is asking for $1 million from Mesnier and $1 million
from the president in the suit, which was filed Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mesnier refused to comment on the suit. The White House press
secretary, Joe Lockhart, refused to discuss details of the case,
but said that all employees were informed of their rights for
filing grievances with the equal employment opportunity office at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for McCulloch said there was no equal employment
opportunity office at the White House until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Mesnier hired McCulloch after she completed an apprenticeship
with him. Her suit claims Mesnier began harassing her in 1991 when
he told her he was planning to divorce his wife. When she refused
his overtures, the suit claims, the harassment escalated, with
demands for sex, phone calls to her at home, hostility and
abusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Over several years, McCulloch complained to Gary Walters, the
chief usher at the White House, who, the suit claims, said he would
talk to Mesnier. This angered Mesnier, the suit says, and he became
more abusive, excluding her from the creative process of dessert
planning, and instead assigning her menial tasks like peeling kiwis
and cleaning out the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, McCulloch received her first less-than-perfect
evaluation, the suit says, claiming that Mesnier linked the
evaluation to ``the little problem we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation became increasingly tense until 1997 when, the
suit says, McCulloch began to see a therapist on a regular basis
for stress and depression. In June 1999, McCulloch, on the advice
of a doctor, went on disability leave without pay, the suit says.

RUNYAN ALREADY BIG WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATTHEW KREDELL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a runner at Camarillo (Calif.) High, Marla
Runyan would sometimes break down and cry before races because she
was so scared. Insecurity over her running is something Runyan
battled throughout high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had butterflies before a race,'' said Chuck
Stevenson, who coaches track at Camarillo. ``I tried to calm her
down. I told her, 'Marla, you'll be OK.' And then of course, she
would go out and win.''
</P>
<P>
   When Runyan took her position before the start of the 1,500 at
the Olympic Trials in Sacramento in July, she had every reason to
go through all of those same insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   Here was her chance to do something special, not just for
herself but for all blind people and those with other disabilities
who look to her, and Runyan couldn't even run a practice lap.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't her eyesight _ Runyan has been legally blind since
childhood because of a retina-deteriorating condition called
Stargardt's Disease _ that made her status unknown up until race
time.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan hurt her knee while training on a public trail near her
home in Eugene, Ore., six weeks before the trials. She jumped out
of the way of a child on a bicycle who she couldn't see until she
was too close.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a Colorado doctor who had worked miracles before for
rehabilitation. With only a few weeks until the Olympic Trials, it
was as if she was being plopped in front of Billy Crystal's miracle
man in ``The Princess Bride,'' needing to be brought back from the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 12 days before her Olympic hopes in the 1,500 would
be on the line, Runyan thought she would need to pull out of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the world could I do it?'' Runyan said. ``But the next
day I could rotate my knee in the pool and started doing pool
workouts. I could only take two strides running and then the knee
would lock up, but it gave me hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan went to Sacramento and prepared for the biggest race of
her life in the only way she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days before the race, I couldn't run,'' Runyan said. ``I
tried to jog and could only make it six minutes. The day of the
race, I was able to jog one lap. Then I tried to do one more and I
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still had confidence in myself. I felt that, other than
my knee being injured, my body was really fit. I felt my mind was
really fit. I visualized the race so many times, like I was
training in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before the race, Runyan sat up visualizing herself
running. She didn't visualize herself winning, she told her
boyfriend and trainer, Matt Lonergan. She saw herself finishing
third (the top three finishers qualify for the Olympics).
</P>
<P>
   It sounded great, and Lonergan hoped that once the race started,
Runyan's mind would be able to overcome her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier for her than for us watching,'' Lonergan said.
``From our perspective it was, `How the hell is she going to do
it?' '' I was a wreck. I was sitting in the stands off the last
turn with a college friend of mine. When she was at the line, I
told him I was going to be sick, I was so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Runyan stayed calm. She found that if she crossed her
legs and pulled her left toe up, she could get a really good
stretch that made her forget about the pain for a bit.
</P>
<P>
   She ignored first and second _ Regina Jacobs and Suzy Favor
Hamilton would have been heavily favored even if Runyan had two
good wheels _ and focused on third.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan started out cautiously but got in a good position because
of what she called a perfect pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really thankful that Suzy and Regina didn't go out like
crazy,'' Runyan said. ``When I saw how Suzy (who started next to
Runyan) went off the line, I knew I would have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan hoped that if the pace began slowly, she could reach
another gear down the backstrech. In fifth place, Runyan pushed for
that gear and found it, blowing by Shayne Culpepper to take third
by nearly two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As the former four-time gold medalist in the World Paralympics
Games crossed the finish line, becoming the first legally blind
athlete to make a U.S. Olympic team, she thrust her arms in the air
triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   That was just for finishing. She still wasn't sure she had
qualified for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually went up to the official and asked if I was third,''
Runyan said. ``I couldn't see Suzy or Regina ahead of me and I
wasn't sure there was not another runner with them. I was 98
percent sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The official confirmed and Runyan got to do another thing she
had been visualizing, taking an American flag and doing a victory
lap with Jacobs and Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan's feelings after qualifying for the Olympics were not
what she had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would feel like a different person, but I felt
like the same person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from others, however, was much more than she had
expected. Runyan was been bombarded by media requests from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back from Sacramento, I had 250 e-mails,'' said
Runyan, who had to change her e-mail address as the messages piled
up. ``Most of the response was from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the media attention has focused on her eyesight,
something Runyan has always tried to downplay. She was in the
fourth grade when diagnosed with Stargardt's Disease and her
eyesight now is about the same as it was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her vision is 20/300 in her left eye and 20/400 in her
right _ and that's with contact lenses. She can barely see things
directly in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media has always thought I was the type of kid that
couldn't do it, but there was always one person who said, 'Yes, you
can,' '' Runyan said. ``It's the other way around, with me always
saying I can do this and everyone else saying you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who beamed with pride while talking about his first
Camarillo High disciple to make the Olympics, found out quickly to
never doubt what Runyan could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never a big deal,'' Stevenson said of Runyan's
eyesight. ``We knew she had the handicap and I'm sure the people
she ran against, some realized it and some didn't even know. She
didn't ask for any special favors or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson points out that Runyan didn't only find a way to excel
on the track but also in the classroom. Using a camera that
projected pages of books onto a screen so they could be enlarged,
Runyan finished high school with a 3.98 GPA. She went on to get a
bachelor's degree in education of the deaf and a master's degree in
education of deaf-blind children from San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that this is the way the world has
looked to me since I was 10,'' Runyan said. ``I have only seen the
track as I see it now. I have nothing else to compare it to. I
don't think I have a disability. I think I'm normal and everyone
else just has really good vision.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was so surprising to Runyan when she returned from
the Trials to get so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing,'' she said. ``I have received more e-mails
and letters than I know what to do with. In many ways, the positive
results (from making the Olympics) are more important than my race
at the Olympics itself. I didn't think it would be like this. It's
kind of cool. A lot of people make the Olympic team and it goes
unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trials, Runyan fit visits to blind children into her
busy training and rehabilitation schedule. She escaped the confines
of her Colorado-based training site to meet with kids at a Denver
center for blind children in early August and has exchanged e-mails
with legally blind children through the U.S. Association of Blind
Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat lost in all of the commotion is that she still has a
little business to take care of in Sydney. Runyan is progressing
well in recovering fully from her knee injury. In mid-August, she
could run 46 minutes without pain, a far cry from the six minutes
she was jogging leading up to the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan's ultimate goal has been to qualify for the Olympics. She
is not expected to medal in Sydney. Her new goal is to make the
finals and run a personal-best time.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those races back in high school, Runyan will step to
the line with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just shows how much I've matured,'' she said.
``I've heard myself say how important attitude is because I have
many interviews with people who always want to talk about my
vision. I've said it millions of times in interviews. If I get into
a funk, I can hear myself, and I tell myself that I need to take my
own advice or I'm a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing people with disabilities, the United States,
Camarillo and herself, Runyan won't have a shortage of people
pulling for another miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she will represent us very well there,'' Stevenson
said. ``She won't give up, that's for sure.''

COWBOYS' WORTHAM EAGER TO MAKE DEBUT AGAINST REDSKINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Is it possible for the Cowboys' defense to be
better without middle linebacker Dat Nguyen?
</P>
<P>
   At least for one game, according to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   With Nguyen sidelined two to four weeks because of a sprained
medial collateral ligament in his left knee, former Everman star
Barron Wortham moves into the starting lineup against the
Washington Redskins on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said everything the Redskins do on
offense is predicated off of their power running game. Tailback
Stephen Davis is fourth in the NFL in rushing with 192 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Cowboys' woeful run defense, stopping the run is
paramount if the Cowboys (0-2) have any hope of ending their losing
ways. Dallas ranks 31st in the league against the run. It has never
finished a season lower than 24th. That dubious distinction came in
1997 when the Cowboys finished 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the run is our No. 1 priority,'' Campo said. ``We
have to get better against the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen win situation.]
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, who won the starting job in training camp, is considered
an undersized linebacker who relies on instinct. However, Wortham,
5-foot-11 and 245 pounds, is an old-fashioned hole plugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we made the decision that Dat was the starter. But
\RBarron being in there\S could really help us. Dat may be a little
more squirmier, but Barron is more physical. He is stronger in the
middle than Dat. I think he will play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Without taking anything away from Nguyen, Wortham, a seven-year
veteran, agrees that his style best fits the Cowboys' needs against
the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those old-school type of guys,'' Wortham said.
``The power part of my game is my strength, the physical part.
That's what I like. I really think that's what's going to help us
out on the defensive side of the ball. Not that Dat did a bad job.
Dat is a tremendous linebacker, but I think my game is different
from his.''
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, who signed with the Cowboys during the off-season after
starting on Tennessee's 1999 Super Bowl team, was unable to
showcase his differences when Nguyen won the starting job in
training camp. Wortham injured a knee two weeks into camp and was
sidelined until the final preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, however, knows that he would have been hard-pressed to
unseat Nguyen. Nguyen won the starting job because of his long-term
potential, his speed and his ability to cover the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wortham will be replaced in the Cowboys nickel defense
on Sunday by teammate Joe Bowden because of his deficiencies
against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   And Wortham also knows that he will go back to the bench when
Nguyen regains his health. Wortham said he is just trying do his
part in helping the Cowboys win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my role,'' Wortham said. ``Even if it was close in
training camp, they would have started Dat. I'm cool with that. I'm
here in case Dat goes down. That's what they got me here for _
quality depth. Dat went down and I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wortham is not happy about Nguyen's injury, but he is excited to
get more playing time. He has recorded five tackles in two games of
spot duty in place of Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that he got hurt, but I like that I get an
opportunity to play,'' Wortham said. ``I haven't really played a
full game since the Super Bowl. When you've been a starter and now
you are behind somebody, you feel like you are missing something
because you are used to being out there. I'm going to have fun with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Wortham's excitement is the fact that his first start
for his home-town team is against the rival Redskins on Monday
Night Football. He said he is played this game many times in his
head as a child. He calls it a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man, that's just a blessing in itself,'' Wortham said.
``Deion \RSanders\S talked about he was born on Monday night.
Monday night might be my night. That's the way I'm looking at it.
I've watched this matchup over the years. John Riggins. Doomsday.
I'm going to take it for what it's worth, relax and have fun.'' nn

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Clinton's veto is upheld on marriage tax
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KAREN MASTERSON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not enough Democrats said, ``I do,'' Wednesday in a
bid to override the president's veto of the so-called marriage
penalty tax repeal, killing the proposal for the remainder of this
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   In a House vote of 270-158, the veto override effort fell 16
votes short of the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote may be the GOP's last major battle with the White House
over tax-cut proposals. And the party didn't give it up without a
show.
</P>
<P>
   On the Capitol grounds, Republicans constructed a scene that
looked a lot like the top of a crowded wedding cake. A marriage
trellis with braided white taffeta hung over three recently married
couples dressed in white gowns and tuxedoes.
</P>
<P>
   The scene served as the backdrop for an afternoon news
conference. As Felix Mendelssohn's wedding march sounded from a
small boom box, the Republican leadership slammed Democrats for
failing to support ``love and marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats want to spend the surplus on new, big government
programs,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land.
Republicans, he said, want to return that money to taxpayers,
especially married couples now paying the ``unfair'' and
``immoral`` penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the bill in August because he said it was part of
a package of Republican tax cuts that would eat too much of the
nation's projected $2.2 trillion, 10-year budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terribly disappointed,'' said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The
Woodlands. ``Ending the marriage penalty should be a bipartisan
effort. I'm frustrated because many Democrats claim they stand for
working families.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats maintained that they support repealing the
``marriage penalty'' tax, although not as proposed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to repeal the penalty,'' said Rep. Gene Green,
D-Houston. ``But we should have one tax cut, one bill at a time.
Republicans included so much into the same bill, it was not really
just the marriage penalty. The rest was other little things they
wanted in there, like a tax benefit to stay-at-home parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said he backed the Democrats' alternative, which would
have cost less and been limited in scope.
</P>
<P>
   Only 49 Democrats joined 220 Republicans and one Independent in
support of the override; 157 Democrats and one Independent backed
the president and voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Democrats who voted for the override, two were from
Texas: Rep. Ralph M. Hall of Rockwall and Rep. Max Sandlin of
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the Houston area voted along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's latest veto leaves a Clinton/Gore legacy
of denying 25 million married couples relief from the marriage tax
penalty,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston. Archer is chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Marriage Penalty Tax Relief Act, drafted by Archer, would
have cut married couples' taxes by $292 billion over 10 years. The
Democrats' plan would have cut taxes by $95 billion over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would have changed the standard deduction for
married couples filing jointly to make it equal to twice the
standard deduction for single tax payers, which is similar to the
Democrats' bill. Currently, those deductions are $4,400 for single
people and $7,350 for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Democrats' bill, Archer's legislation would have
expanded tax credit programs for families living on one income, for
low-incomes families and for families with children and expenses
associated with education and adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to failing to override the veto, Republicans also
could not muster the votes last week to override the president's
veto of the estate tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have since switched gears and are now calling on
Democrats to roll 90 percent of next year's projected surplus _
about $240 billion _ into a one-time pay-down of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped the tax cuts because they know Al Gore has a big
spending program,'' said Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill. ``Let's pay down the debt, so taxpayers don't have to
continue to pay for the interest.''
</P>
<P>
   As for couples in the warm Washington weather, they made their
own plea to end the ``marriage penalty.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wedding was a happy day for us,'' said Helena Charters,
standing before reporters in a pearl-studded white dress and veil.
``But it was also a happy day for the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   Charters is an elementary school teacher, and her husband,
Timothy, is an aide to a Republican congressman.

SPORTS COLUMN: NFL'S ELITE IS CAUGHT IN THE CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In San Francisco, defensive players apologized to the team and
fans on Sunday for falling behind the Carolina Panthers, 14-0, at
the end of the first quarter, and 28-0 by the end of the first
half. When 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia was benched in favor of
Rick Mirer, as big a bust on the West Coast as he was in the East,
Joe Montana must have been considering a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers play St. Louis this week. The Rams might score 50 . .
. in one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proud Green Bay franchise lost to Buffalo and
fell to 0-2 for the first time since 1992. ``There's nothing worse
than being 0-2 when you're playing football,'' said Packers
offensive tackle Mark Tauscher. Yes, there is: it is being 0-2 and
a member of the Dallas Cowboys, a team that was once the most
feared franchise in football. On Sunday night in the desert, the
Cowboys lost to the Arizona Cardinals. At the end of the game,
offensive lineman Larry Allen and safety Darren Woodson threw their
helmets in disgust while standing on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   They must have thought helmet-tossing was a new Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, San Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas have been
role-model franchises in the National Football League. The 49ers
won with Montana, Young and Rice, and the Packers with the arm of
Brett Favre, while the Dallas trio of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and
Michael Irvin resurrected a winning tradition that was started by
Tom Landry.
</P>
<P>
   The success of these teams, in a way, helped to further
glamorize the NFL and bolster pro football's status as the
country's most popular professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   But now the teams that were the toast of the league _ staying on
top by manipulating the salary-cap system, massaging it, stretching
it, even sometimes abusing it _ are suddenly victims of it, and the
punch line of jokes. (Question: How many 49ers does it take to
screw in a light bulb? Answer: None, because the team can't fit the
cost of electricity under the cap.)
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, Packers and Cowboys have won seven of the past 12
Super Bowls, and some of those were captured because these three
franchises skillfully worked the salary cap. Now the system is
nipping at their heels. For the first time in 40 years, the three
teams have started 0-2 in the same season. That is a stunning
statistic and a sign that the mighty have truly fallen, choked by
the cap.
</P>
<P>
   The more you beat the $62 million salary cap by spreading out
high signing bonuses deep into the future to avoid paying the price
now, the more the cap fights back in the long run. Teams give
players fat bonuses and low base salaries as a way to temporarily
exceed the cap limit, but eventually the back ends of those
contracts grow to the point where teams cannot keep other players.
The franchise caps out, cuts talent and takes several steps
backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has caught up with those three teams,'' said Ernie
Accorsi, the New York Giants' general manager. ``They worked it to
perfection. Now they're paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Some team executives talk of the cap as if it is a living thing,
a beast than can wreck teams like a giant sea squid in a Jules
Verne novel, or an angel that can deliver them from last place and
empty stadiums. Older players, usually salary-cap victims because
of their age, curse it worse than a steaming training camp day. The
NFL office loves the cap, because it levels the playing field,
allowing practically any team, in any year, to win a Super Bowl,
something that cannot be said about Major League Baseball or the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants and Jets win this weekend, it will be the first
time both teams begin the same season at 3-0. The Giants are a
playoff team, and maybe with a lucky bounce or two in the
postseason _ like the kind the Tennessee Titans got last year _
they could get to the Super Bowl. Same with the Jets. The salary
cap can grind great teams into dust and turn better-than-average
ones into champions.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Giants and Jets do somehow get to the Super Bowl,
they would face their own cap nightmares in the years to come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to do everything you can in as short a period of
time to win a championship,'' said Accorsi, ``but if you do, the
slip will come. You can't avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, Dallas and Green Bay _ the three salary-cap
amigos _ won three consecutive Super Bowls, from 1995 to 1997,
using the salary-cap system to their advantage. Yet only a short
time later, they're in salary-cap jail.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no presidential pardon for this offense. &QL;

 &HT;    Hayes presence will be felt in Saturday's game between Miami
University and Ohio State
 &HT;    By Pete Conrad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Woody Hayes. Mention the name, and you've
conjured up vivid images of a man with a passion for college
football. Images of Heisman Trophy running backs and clouds of
dust, of Rose Bowls and national championship celebrations, of a
gentle man with an explosive temper.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the name, and you're likely to start an argument.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no argument about the fact, however, that when
Miami University and Ohio State finally collide Saturday afternoon
after going their separate ways for 89 years, the atmosphere of
Ohio Stadium will be saturated by the
</P>
<P>
   spirit of Woody Hayes, probably more than any other college game
played since his death in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   On one sideline will be the red and white of Miami, the
university where Hayes flared briefly like a shooting star and then
was gone, leaving one of the great seasons in school history in his
wake.
</P>
<P>
   On the other sideline will be the scarlet and gray of Ohio
State, the university where Hayes spent 28 of the most
unpredictable years in college football history, and where he
coached two of the greatest teams in college football history _ the
1954 and 1968 Buckeyes _ to undefeated national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Former players who were coached by Hayes at each school remember
him not only as the same type of man, but use the same words to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a stern taskmaster,'' said Joe Codiano, who played for
Hayes at Miami in 1949 and '50, ``but he really liked the people
around him and he'd do anything for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a taskmaster and he expected the best,'' said Bill
Wilks, the former Hamilton High football and basketball standout
who became Hayes' first recruit at Ohio State in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Codiano, a resident of Brookville, Ind., who graduated from
Miami in 1952 and went on to a distinguished coaching career in
Indiana, was recruited as a quarterback by Hayes' predecessor in
Oxford, George Blackburn. Blackburn spent only one year at Miami,
guiding the 1948 Redskins to the Mid-American Conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost transferred to the University of Cincinnati after
Coach Blackburn left,'' Codiano recalled. ``But Coach Hayes talked
me out of it, and I'm happy he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Codiano changed positions and started as a defensive back and
inside linebacker for the Miami team that won the 1950 Salad Bowl
(now it's the Fiesta Bowl) by whipping Arizona State 34-21.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Hayes found himself in the big time. He also
found himself without a suitable starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wesley Fesler was coach of Ohio State and left to go to
another school,'' Wilks said, ``so Woody got the job. Coach Fesler
had a single-wing offense, and (after he left) they didn't have a
`T' quarterback at Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilks, who had played quarterback for the Big Blue under coach
Chuck Thackara, had been recruited out of Hamilton as a basketball
player and became a three-year starter for the Buckeyes. Hayes knew
about Wilks' other talents, so he went to OSU basketball coach
Floyd Stahl and asked if he would allow Wilks, who was then a
junior, to play quarterback during football season. Stahl said
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks started a handful of games in Hayes' first season at Ohio
State, but saw little playing time during his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody was looking to build, and he wasn't looking at me as his
future quarterback,'' Wilks said. ``Eventually he developed Will
Leggett as his quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Leggett, under Hayes' guidance, helped lead the 1954 Buckeyes to
the national championship, along with legendary running back Howard
``Hopalong'' Cassady. Wilks said he is bothered by comparisons in
recent days between Hayes and Indiana basketball coach Bobby
Knight. Both lost their jobs because of well-publicized outbursts,
but Wilks said Hayes and Knight really have little in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison,'' Wilks said. ``Woody never used
profanity, and he never was disrespectful to his players. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd throw his hat on the ground and jump on it and pound his
fist. Whether he had lost his temper and was trying to take it out
on the ground or was just trying to make a point, I don't know. But
Woody said he'd never blame a player, and he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Codiano, Hayes ``was a stickler on getting things
done and getting them done his way, but he was also a friend to
you.''

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
Dear American readers,
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll find considerably more queues (lines) than kangaroos in
and around Sydney Olympic Park. So when a hotelier in Bondi Beach
lamented in one of the local newspapers that the site of the
Olympic beach-volleyball competition is ``like a ghost town,''
that's straight where I headed.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi Bay is less than 20 miles from Homebush Bay, but the drive
took an hour in midday traffic. No worries; the scene that awaited
me was more soothing than a 60-minute massage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely day for sunbathing, with the temperature
climbing into the 70s. And yet the crowd spread along the mile-long
stretch of beach was tinier than a string bikini. This was so, said
Greg, the lifeguard on duty, not because of any Olympics backlash
but because Sydneysiders are no more conditioned to go to the beach
in September than Summer Olympians are to go for the gold in
September.
</P>
<P>
   In November, when spring is heating up here, ``we'll get 10,000
to 15,000 people a day,'' Greg said. ``Some days you can't see the
sand, there are so many bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   As Greg scanned the sand from his tower, what he mostly saw were
unfamiliar faces. He estimated 80 percent of the sunbathers were
tourists. Who were we to disagree with him? The first person we
randomly picked to converse with to soak up some local color turned
out to be a tourist from Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The riptide was strong, which explained the ``No Swimming'' sign
that looked so out of place, standing as it was against a backdrop
of surfers meshed in emerald waves.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi Olympic Watch, an environmental activist group, gathered
12,000 signatures opposing the development of the venue, which its
members consider a blight on their shores. I couldn't disagree
more. I think the Olympic volleyball venue blends into the scenery
like a red and orange sunset. &QL;

MORE YOUNG GIRLS TRYING TO GROW UP TOO FAST, GIRL SCOUT SURVEY
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Too many little girls are taking on big-girl
worries, says a new study released Wednesday by the Girl Scouts of
the USA.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of girls 8 to 12 worry about their
popularity and their appearance, the study said. They dress and act
like teen-agers. Some are even dating.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, teen angst has descended upon the elementary school
playground.
</P>
<P>
   Girls who may still believe in the tooth fairy fret they may
never get a boyfriend or be accepted by the cool clique at school.
Girls too young to spell bulimia are worried about their weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls Speak Out: Teens Before Their Time'' was based on
conversations and surveys involving 214 girls aged 8-12 in seven
cities, and on Internet surveys with more than 1,000 other girls in
the same age range.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first produced by the new Girl Scout Research
Institute. But girls in the ages of 8 to 12 are seemingly caught in
an ``age compression'' caused by a society that forces children to
grow up too fast and a pop culture obsessed with sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Barben, 9, of Leawood, isn't part of the trend. She's
more interested in playing basketball than in looking like pop
singer Britney Spears, but says some of her friends are wearing
lipstick and eye shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just want to be cool,'' Jennifer said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it working?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the survey's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the third grade, 75 percent of girls liked the way they
looked. But by the seventh grade, that number dropped to 56
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Britney Spears would be nice because you could wear a
bikini without a big, fat tummy sticking out all over the place,''
one third-grade girl told researchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among girls 10 to 12, nearly a fourth _ 23 percent _ thought
that 12 or 13 was an appropriate age for a person's first romantic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go into her elementary school and you'd swear you were in a
high school,'' Stephanie Gromling said of her daughter's fifth- and
sixth-grade school in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   Gromling said many parents fail to set boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Her 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, said she isn't allowed to
wear makeup or buy skimpy clothing, but many girls in her school
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are already dating and stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of girls 8 to 12 appear to have strong
ties to their families.
</P>
<P>
   But many girls said their parents were unwilling to talk about
sex and boys if they thought the girl was too young to be asking
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are begging for the adults in their lives to listen to
them,'' said Ellen Christie, national spokeswoman for the Girl
Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say girls today develop physically and cognitively at a
younger age, but their emotional development has not kept pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worries we used to hear from 15-and 16-year-olds _ we're
now hearing from 8-year olds and they don't have the emotional
tools to handle the stress and anxiety,'' said Leslie T. Dunn,
director of the Teel Institute in Kansas City, which does research
into child development.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, who also is a board member for Girl Scouts of
Mid-Continent Council, said she hoped the study serves as a red
flag to parents and others who work with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten to 15 years from now, we could have a major problem with
preteen pregnancy and preteen suicide,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dunn nor Christie knew of similar studies involving
boys.
</P>
<P>
   So what's caused this loss of childhood?
</P>
<P>
   Some local parents blamed the entertainment industry. They say
movies and television harm children with unrealistic portrayals of
love and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Scout leader Grace Barben also said television has failed to
provide programming for 8-to 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grow up with Barney and then go to MTV _ there's nothing
in between for these kids,'' Barben said.
</P>
<P>
   Other mothers complained that it's difficult to purchase
``little girl'' clothes today. They say designers have simply
shrunk junior styles to fit younger girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to dress a little girl these days,'' said Antoinette
Robinson of Lee's Summit. ``But you can sure find a lot of bare
midriffs, short skirts and platform shoes.''

 MEDIA BYTES (COLUMN): ANNOY.COM CLAIMS VICTORY FOR FREE SPEECH  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now it can be told: Annoy.com, a San Francisco
Web site that tests the limits of the First Amendment, has declared
victory in a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case was kept under tight wraps for the past year, as
Annoy.com was the subject of an incredibly restrictive gag order.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, of course, could make any reasonable person want
to gag. The main page features ethnic slurs, four-letter words and
photos of body parts flashing on the screen. Then you get into the
really nasty stuff, including e-postcards about controversial
subjects and obnoxious form letters to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In words posted at the top of the home page: ``The intention of
this site is to annoy, to disturb or bother in a way that
displeases, troubles or irritates.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive material is Annoy.com's way of saying freedom of
speech protects everything, not just the nice stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vile e-postcard that someone found on Annoy.com's site
and sent to a staffer at the University of Houston that started the
current legal mess. Investigators wanted Annoy.com to reveal the
identity of the person who sent it; Annoy.com viewed that as an
invasion of privacy and said it wouldn't name names without a court
order.
</P>
<P>
   When the mess wound up in court, Annoy.com found itself slapped
with the gag order. The free-speech advocate was not allowed to
discuss any aspect of the case _ or even the existence of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, a federal court in Texas lifted the gag order,
and the government revealed it had dropped its investigation.
Annoy.com is now free to reveal virtually all the details of the
case and to crow about its victory. It wasted no time publishing
all the court documents _ as well as an essay blasting the
government _ at a related site, www.ejournalism.com.
</P>
<P>
   Annoy.com is the brainchild of Clinton Fein, a 35-year-old from
South Africa who runs a small Web development firm, ApolloMedia.
Fein (rhymes with pain) used to work for Orion Pictures before that
firm went bankrupt. He went on to establish ApolloMedia, which got
its start by making the CD-ROM of the late Chronicle reporter Randy
Shilts' book about gays in the military, ``Conduct Unbecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   In that effort, Fein fought the Navy over trademark issues and
became something of a free-speech advocate. After Congress passed
the controversial Communications Decency Act in 1996, Fein sued
Attorney General Janet Reno over the provisions prohibiting
communications that are ``indecent'' with an intent to ``annoy.''
At the same time, he started Annoy.com.
</P>
<P>
   After a long and complicated court battle, he lost at the U.S.
Supreme Court _ but he and others consider his cause the true
victor. Although he did not succeed in overturning the
Communications Decency Act, he did get it re-defined so that
offensive and annoying communications remain a form of protected
speech online.
</P>
<P>
   While that case was wrapping up, however, the Houston case was
starting. Someone used Annoy.com to send an e-mail with a picture
that can be described as pornographic, and a message saying, in
less-polite terms, ``Tell your husband that I want to f_ your
brains out, you slut, while he watches.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, who believed the message was a threat that carried
criminal intent, asked Fein for the sender's identity. Fein's
policy in such situations: ``We're not going to turn over anything
unless we're ordered by a court.'' So the U.S. attorney's office in
Houston filed suit. (The attorney handling the case did not return
phone calls seeking comment.)
</P>
<P>
   A magistrate in Texas issued the gag order, and Fein fought it _
taking his fight first to U.S. District Court and then seeking
emergency intervention from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, who oversees appeals from Texas. Fein lost at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard oral
arguments in May and ordered the district court to have another
look at the issue. In oral arguments, the government admitted it
was no longer interested in obtaining the name of the offending
party. The issue was moot. The gag was lifted and, last week, Fein
was given the green light to make all court records public.
</P>
<P>
   There's still one record he won't publicize: the name of the
victim. ``I respect privacy enormously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fein said he brings passion to his free-speech advocacy because
of his experience living under South Africa's hated apartheid
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be imprisoned for quoting Nelson Mandela,'' he said.
``That's insane.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Americans don't appreciate the freedoms bestowed under
the First Amendment. He sees any threat as ``serious and not to be
taken for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ApolloMedia has about five employees and swells to 20
when it has a major project, Fein said he has not yet tried to make
Annoy.com a commercial venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found anyone stupid enough to brand their product
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he counts, Annoy.com gets as many as 100,000 users in a
day. Someday, he may try to sell ads on the site. After spending
what he said was hundreds of thousands of dollars on the site, Fein
said, ``I'd like to see it generate some revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's not about money for Fein. Instead, he has created a
place where provocative opinions actually get discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might sound hokey, but it's unbelievable. You get white
racists and homophobic people and black racists who started
communicating with each other in a way that allows them to express
whatever anger or hatred or fear they have, because it's not
punished,'' he said. ``Over time, I've seen people transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   One white supremacist wrote in, ``Thanks for providing a space
where over time, I can change my way of thinking,'' Fein said.
``That's where my motivation lies. It's not about being able to
piss someone off. Anyone can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   PAYBACK TIME: According to published news reports, Gannett Co.
is in discussions to sell its Bay Area paper, the Marin Independent
Journal, to Dean Singleton's ANG Newspapers. (Disclosure: I used to
work at the IJ, and I still own Gannett stock.)
</P>
<P>
   Gannett is looking to keep costs in check after a year in which
it spent $4.5 billion on acquisitions, including the Arizona
Republic and the Indianapolis Star. According to the Wall Street
Journal, the company _ based in Arlington, Va. _ has ordered its
divisions to keep a close eye on their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett spokeswoman Tara Connell said the memo goes out
routinely. As for the Journal report that the memo is tied to
acquisitions, ``Our official comment on it is, `Bull_.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gannett already runs a pretty lean operation, though, so it
makes sense that it might sell off a paper or two in an effort to
raise some cash.
</P>
<P>
   The IJ is a likely candidate: Although profitable, its position
in a competitive market means that it doesn't rake in nearly as
much money as its sister papers in monopoly markets throughout the
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend in the newspaper business is clustering, meaning
the IJ would be worth more to chains like Knight Ridder and
Singleton's MediaNews Group _ which already own several papers in
the Bay Area _ than to Gannett.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Gannett refused to comment on the prospective
sale of the IJ. As to whether that, or any other belt tightening,
is related to debt taken on by the acquisition spree, Connell said,
``There is no connection to any of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   But it still makes for gloomy days at my old stomping ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, I attended the funeral of Mary Leydecker, a veteran
of 24 years at the paper. Many other reporters and editors turned
out to pay tribute to a first-rate journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Even though everyone I spoke to is accustomed to Gannett's
penny-pinching ways, not too many seem enthused to entrust their
livelihoods to Singleton, an even more notorious budget slasher.
</P>
<P>
   And so, a word for my old comrades at the IJ.
</P>
<P>
   Courage.

 Palo Alto's WineBuyer.com Gets Bought  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Grapes are not the only things getting crushed
and blended this harvest season. So are wineries and wine
e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest deal, EVineyard of Portland, Ore., said Wednesday
that it is acquiring WineBuyer.com of Palo Alto for an undisclosed
price. The companies operate in separate e-commerce niches.
</P>
<P>
   WineBuyer.com claims to be the wine industry's first
business-to-business marketplace linking licensed
alcoholic-beverage wholesalers and retailers. By contrast,
EVineyard is an online wine retailer licensed to sell more than
5,000 domestic and imported brands in 25 states that account for
more than 70 percent of U.S. premium wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like other dot-coms that have rushed to merge since the Nasdaq
Stock Market correction in April, online wine vendors are feeling
the urge to merge to conserve capital and gain economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers of wine also must cope with complex U.S. and state laws
governing the sale of alcoholic beverages and a cumbersome
three-tier distribution system that typically requires that wine
move through a distributor/wholesaler and then retailer before it
reaches the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving our inventory management through strengthened
wholesaler partnerships will enable us to offer our customers
consistently efficient service and an even greater selection of
wines,'' said EVineyard CEO Larry Gerhard in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   WineBuyer.com founder and CEO John Boone, who will be vice
president of business services at EVineyard, said the deal
``expands EVineyard's access to the wines its customers seek''
while giving distributors access to EVineyard's ``virtual
storefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney estimates that online business-to-consumer
wine sales will grow from $150 million this year to $1.2 billion in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest merger of e-wine companies last month, Wine.com
of Napa combined with WineShopper.com of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com had raised $96 million from venture capital investors
and WineShopper.com had raised about $46 million. By contrast,
EVineyard built its business since May 1999 with just $13 million
million in private capital. Sales this year will be approximately
$10 million to $15 million.

 APPLE COUNTING ON THE POWER OF 10  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A moment Macintosh fans and developers have
awaited for more than a decade finally arrived Wednesday: Apple
Computer released, if only in beta-test form, a thoroughly modern
version of the 16-year-old Mac operating system.
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1988, Apple's then-chief executive officer, John
Sculley, said Apple engineers were rewriting the Mac system
software from the ground up, to put it on a more-stable foundation
that would support future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Apple has delivered a variety of compelling
improvements, but it never quite delivered on Sculley's promise.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday. Ironically, it was Steve Jobs _ the man who
co-founded Apple, got pushed out by Sculley in 1985, took charge
again in 1997 and since then has spearheaded the company's
remarkable recovery _ who had the honor of introducing the radical
rewrite his former-friend-turned-nemesis had promised so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote address to a Paris trade show called Apple Expo,
Jobs proclaimed the new system, called Mac OS X (pronounced
``ten''), ``the future of Apple.'' The test version is available on
CD-ROM for $29.95 at Apple's online store (www.apple.com/store).
The official 1.0 is slated for release sometime in ``early 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The lowest levels of Mac OS X are based on Unix, the
``industrial-strength'' operating system used on most servers and
workstations. That will make Mac OS X, unlike any previous version,
what industry insiders jokingly call ``buzzword-compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it is based on principles of operating-system
design such as pre-emptive multitasking, protected memory and
symmetrical multitasking. Clearly, only a minority of Apple's
customers can define those terms, but they will translate into
something all users are bound to appreciate: more stable, powerful
and responsive computers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's not counting just on new plumbing, however, to sell Mac
OS X. The system also boasts powerful new graphics capabilities _
based largely on industry standards like Adobe's .pdf (Acrobat)
format and the OpenGL 3D technology relied on by many game
developers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, Apple has endowed Mac OS X with a slick and
streamlined new look it calls Aqua. The interface borrows heavily
from the software developed at NeXT, the failed computer company
Jobs ran during his exile from Apple, and it will require the Mac
faithful to forsake some core elements of the traditional Mac look
and feel in favor of NeXT-derived widgets.
</P>
<P>
   Mac users who want to try all this out will need up-to-date
hardware and plenty of memory. The system will run, according to
Apple, only on Macs with factory-installed PowerPC G3 and G4
processors _ in other words, not on Mac clones or even most
Apple-branded models made before mid-1998, even if they since have
had processor upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Even one G3-based model, the original PowerBook G3, didn't quite
make the cutoff. But the new system will run on all versions of the
iMac, the popular consumer model Apple introduced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many iMacs, though _ among other qualifying models _ will need a
memory upgrade to handle the new system. The beta version requires
128 megabytes of RAM, twice as much as Apple had previously said
would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said Wednesday that they still hope to make
the final Mac OS X run on 64 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Making the transition to the new system smooth for developers
and customers is the toughest technical challenge Apple has faced
since it adopted a new processor _ the PowerPC _ in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that Apple did a remarkable job in that case, by
providing software that enabled programs written for older chips to
run, with only minimal slowdown, on PowerPC-based Macs.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company is trying to pull off a similar trick:
Mac OS X can run most existing Mac applications in what Apple calls
the ``Classic'' environment, a version of the older Mac OS that
loads automatically inside the new one when users launch an older
application.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic environment, though, offers no clear advantage over
Mac OS 9, so the long-run success of Mac OS X will be determined by
how many developers invest in updating their applications to take
full advantage of the new system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a handful has done so. Mac OS X CD comes with a
beta version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer that fully exploits
the new system, but Office 2001, an updated productivity suite the
Redmond, Wash., company plans to release next month, will run only
in the Classic mode.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, Quark and other developers that are key to the Mac's
professional market also have promised but not yet delivered Mac OS
X-optimized versions of their products.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Apple updated its iBook portable line Wednesday,
introducing faster chips, larger drives, FireWire ports, a DVD
option and new colors. One new model, available in indigo and key
lime, will sell for $1,499. The iBook Special Edition, equipped
with a DVD-ROM drive, will go for $1,799 in lime or graphite.

 INKTOMI BETS BIG ON WEBCASTING  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Inktomi Corp. leaped into the emerging Internet
broadcasting industry Wednesday by disclosing the acquisition of
FastForward Networks, a San Francisco maker of Webcasting software,
in a deal valued at $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will give Foster City, Calif.'s Inktomi
technology to distribute and monitor live Internet broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   That market is expected to grow dramatically with increasing
broadcasts of concerts, conferences and sporting events, now
notorious for jerky images and poor sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are seeing the Internet as a new channel capable of
delivering new experiences,'' said Dick Pierce, an executive vice
president at Inktomi. ``This could be a significant chunk of
Inktomi's revenues in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   FastForward's clients include Digital Island, an online content
delivery company, and RealNetworks, which sells multimedia software
for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said he expects many more clients as technology improves.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Elstein, an analyst who specializes in multimedia for the
Aberdeen Group, a market research firm in Boston, said Inktomi's
acquisition is a significant addition to the company's arsenal of
software.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Internet broadcasting will become increasingly
prevalent and profitable but added that there are many technical
hurdles to overcome before most consumers will get high-resolution
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television quality is still a few years away,'' Elstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi's acquisition underscores the firm's continuing
transformation from a Internet search engine provider to a Internet
infrastructure business. Search now accounts for only 30 percent of
Inktomi's revenue, versus 70 percent for services like data caching
and Internet content delivery software.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter of this year, Inktomi reported that it had
$61.5 million in revenue. The company had a profit of $4.5 million
(4 cents per share).
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi's image suffered in June when Yahoo dropped the firm's
search engine on its portal in favor of Google, the Internet
upstart from Mountain View. The loss for Inktomi was not big in
terms of revenue, but it caused the company's stock to decline
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi's last acquisition was in June, when the company bought
the Ultraseek software division of the Go Network, Disney's online
properties. The $344.7 million deal gave Inktomi a search engine
for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with FastForward, a private firm with 75 employees, is
an all-stock transaction. Inktomi will exchange nearly 11.9 million
shares of its common stock, which closed at $111 a share on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Inktomi's stock was down $2.25 to $108.75 in regular
trading.

 NAPSTER SAYS RECORD FIRMS OUT TO `KILL'  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In its final legal pleading before going to
court, Napster Inc. argued the record industry is trying to kill
new technology to keep control over music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the San Mateo, Calif., firm late Tuesday filed a
36-page brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco,
which will decide next month whether to overturn a lower court's
preliminary injunction against Napster, creator of a popular online
music-sharing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about whether plaintiffs (major record companies)
can use their control over music copyrights to achieve control over
Napster's decentralized technology and prevent it from transforming
the Internet in ways that might undermine their present chokehold
on music promotion and distribution,'' according to the brief filed
by Napster's legal team, headed by high-powered attorney David
Boies.
</P>
<P>
   Napster also contends the record industry, which is trying to
stop the the company on grounds that it violates federal copyright
laws, has refused Napster's offers to negotiate a ``reasonable
license'' to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs seek not fair compensation for what they own, but
to kill or control a technology that is not theirs,'' the brief
says.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's brief was in response to a 94-page brief filed Friday
by the Recording Industry Association of America. The RIAA argues
that U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel was correct when
she issued a preliminary injunction against Napster in July to
prevent users from downloading copyright-protected songs.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is scheduled for Oct. 2, when the appeals court
will hear lawyers for both sides argue the case in court.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies said the injunction was needed to stop the
copyright infringement of 12 million to 30 million songs per day.
Napster officials argued the injunction would unfairly shut down
their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster's business strategy from the inception was to use
plaintiff's music to usurp and undermine the record industry, to
take over, or at least threaten, plaintiff's role in the promotion
and distribution of music,'' the RIAA brief said.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA also rebuffed Napster's argument that instead of an
injunction, Patel could have ordered Napster to pay royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster never explains how the court could set rates or terms
of a royalty, how such a royalty would be calculated or supervised
or how it possibly could pay a royalty for the millions of songs
unlawfully copied,'' the RIAA brief said.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A (COLUMN): FILTERS CAN CUT SPAM  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm getting more junk e-mail than ever these days. Mostly it
falls into two categories: get-rich-quick schemes, like how to make
$10,000 a month working at home, and solicitations from sexually
oriented Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   I can delete unwanted messages easily enough, but now my
12-year-old daughter wants to send e-mail to her friends. I'd like
to give her a separate e-mail account, but my guess is that the
junk mailers would find her, too. Any suggestions for how I can
keep her safe from this seamy side of the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You're right _ giving your daughter her own e-mail account
wouldn't protect her from junk mail (also known as spam). But you
can take steps to reduce how much of the stuff actually reaches her
_ or you, for that matter. Your e-mail software, whether it's
Outlook Express, Eudora, Netscape or some other program, has
filters that let you block incoming messages whose subject lines
and text fields contain words commonly associated with junk mail.
And you can block mail from spammers if you know their e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   You can also get additional software that does a fair job of
keeping junk mail out of your inbox. Some of the more popular
programs include SpamKiller ($29.95 from Novasoft at
www.spamkiller.com) and Spam Buster ($19.95 from Contact Plus at
www.contactplus.com). If you use America Online, there's Garbage
Man ($8 from WaveOp at www.waveop.com).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PC Blackout
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I bought my IBM Aptiva PC with Windows 98 a little more than a
year ago. Here's my problem: Whenever the computer isn't used for
15 minutes or so, the screen goes dark. I am supposed to hit any
key to reactivate it, but that doesn't work. The only way to get
any action is to turn the computer off and then turn it on again.
And that initiates the scan process because Windows doesn't like to
be shut down that way. Do you have any clues or suggestions for
solving this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Sounds like your PC is having a hard time with its energy-saving
feature (something that all newer PCs have). I'll bet the monitor
is set to turn off after 15 minutes, and it's just not able to
power back up. This is a pretty common problem, and there's an easy
fix. Right-click your mouse on an empty area of your Windows
desktop to bring up the Display Properties dialog box. Click
Settings, then select ``Never'' in the Turn off Monitor option.
</P>
<P>
   You can always activate a screen saver if you plan to leave the
PC on when you're not using it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Text Where You Want It
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm doing a project in Microsoft Excel and would like to insert
some text in a worksheet. I know I can type words into the cells,
but that's awkward and imprecise. Is there an easier way to enter
text that I could position anywhere on the page?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: Indeed there is. What you want to do is create a text
box, which lays on top of the spreadsheet's grid. To create a text
box, right-click on an unused area of the Excel menu bar, then
select Drawing. This will display the Drawing toolbar, probably
along the bottom of the screen. One of the icons on the toolbar
looks like a page of text with an ``A'' at the top. That's the Text
Box icon. Click it, then position your mouse pointer where you want
the text box to be and drag the mouse to create the box as big as
you like.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've created a text box, you can use the mouse to resize
or move it to a different spot on the page. You can also change the
type style, size and attributes of the text in the box as you would
for any document.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Computer Fatigue
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Sometimes my computer slows down after I've been using it for a
long time _ say, several hours. What's causing this, and what can I
do about it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It could be that you have too many programs open at the same
time, or perhaps some temporary files have stayed in the PC's
memory even after programs have been closed. The result is a
reduction in the amount of ``system resources'' that are available
to the PC. Next time you experience a slowdown, do this:
Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop, choose Properties
and tab over to Performance to see how much of your System
Resources are free. If it's less than 70 percent, try closing some
programs. If that doesn't work, I'd restart the computer to bring
the resources back up to snuff.

   Valderrama, with a Major League Soccer-record 26 assists, and
Diallo, with an MLS-best 26 goals, could go down as the best
one-two punch in MLS history. After a forgettable two losses in the
final week of the regular season, this is the Galaxy's punishment
for dropping to the fifth seed.
</P>
<P>
   After losing home-field advantage, the Galaxy opens the
first-round, best-of-three playoff series against the Mutiny
tonight at Raymond James Stadium. In two meetings this season, each
team has won at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valderrama is like Magic Johnson,'' Galaxy defender Paul
Caligiuri said. ``He's confusing and hard to read. He can be
looking one way, then pass the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Diallo, the 6-foot-2, 190-pound bulldozer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Valderrama is the key to Diallo, but Diallo does his own
work,'' Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman said. ``He doesn't beat you
with his pace, he beats you by knocking you around and bumping you
off the ball with his intimidating frame.''
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid's concern. Normally,
Danny Pena would mark Valderrama, but he's out after undergoing
season-ending knee surgery. With Pena down, Schmid figured he could
rely on Peter Vagenas to stop the Colombian wizard, but Vagenas is
with the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's containment by committee. Midfielders Brian Kelly and
Simon Elliott will take turns on Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' said Schmid. ``You can't take your
eye off of (Carlos) for a second. We will have our hands full, but
if our concentration level is high, we should find a way to manage
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility of tracking Diallo falls on Caligiuri, 35,
who steps in for Olympian Danny Califf.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he might contain Diallo, Caligiuri didn't
hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With brains,'' he said. ``It's mind over matter, there isn't
anyone in this league I don't think I can't shut down. But to do
it, it's all in your head. You have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the U.S. National team and former player in the
German Bundesliga, Caligiuri realizes he's going to have to rely on
his years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   To stop Diallo, it doesn't matter where you position your body.
He has enough size and quickness to physically punish defenders,
and he's mobile enough to turn and free himself for quick shots.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many players who think Diallo is nothing more
than a cheap-shot artist. A month ago, Diallo crashed into New
York/New Jersey goalkeeper Mike Ammann, ending Ammann's season with
punctured lungs, broken ribs and a scratched face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the first time I've played against cheap and dirty
players,'' Caligiuri said. ``I've played internationally so many
times that you encounter this everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Caligiuri can't get involved in Diallo's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to use my control and experience to not get sucked into
his style of play,'' Caligiuri said. ``He isn't going to change the
way he plays so I just have to stand in there and match what he
brings.''

 REVIEW: WINDOWS ME BRINGS MOVIES HOME  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's difficult to resist the temptation to poke
fun at Microsoft's claim that Windows Millennium Edition, the new
version that goes on sale Thursday, is ``a simpler, more robust and
more useful operating system'' for home users.
</P>
<P>
   You could, for example, point to plenty of ``enhancements'' that
hardly seem worth the price of admission ($59.95 if you upgrade
from Windows 98 by Jan. 15, 2001, around $90 thereafter, or if you
are starting from an earlier version of Windows).
</P>
<P>
   Is networking any easier now that the former Network
Neighborhood has been rechristened My Network Places? Whose
experience was improved by changing the Start menu's Find command
to Search or by replacing the radio buttons in the Shutdown dialog
(the ones for Shutdown, Restart and other available options) with a
pop-up menu offering similar choices?
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, it probably won't be long, if you make ME yours,
before you are forced to acknowledge that ``more robust'' is
strictly a relative term _ it might be true, but it doesn't
actually mean stable and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   As I was typing this text into Microsoft Word, with no other
applications open and no third-party gizmos to blame for messing up
a fresh ME installation, I suddenly found myself staring at a
feature that hasn't changed at all _ the infamous ``blue screen of
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's hibernation. For years, makes of notebook PCs have
offered their own software that lets users power down temporarily
without closing all of their applications and documents.
Unfortunately, these Standby or Hibernate features were notoriously
unreliable _ they never worked consistently on any notebook I have
used, and many corporate IT managers (including The Chronicle's)
warn users not to try these features because they often result in
serious disk corruption.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Crashing While Sleeping
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft promised to address the problem in Windows ME, and
indeed it did, with a new option in that Shutdown dialog called
Hibernate. Now, instead of the frozen black screen I usually faced
when I tried to wake up from hibernation in Windows 95 and 98, ME
on my Compaq Armada produces a spectacular display of alternating,
pulsating pink, lime and black quarter-inch blocks, with a
smattering of asterisks and parentheses visible in the background
like so many twinkling stars and crescent moons.
</P>
<P>
   As with the previous versions of Windows, the only way out was
to force a restart. But after this happened three or four times, I
got to experience another way ME leaves its predecessors in the
dust: A dialog popped up noting that the last few times I'd tried
hibernation, it hadn't worked properly and asking if I'd like to
have the feature disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 and 98 were never so polite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Inside Story
</P>
<P>
   Behind all these glitches and tweaks to Windows' facade is a
painful reality: Even though much of the 500-odd megabytes of code
that Windows ME installs on your hard drive is relatively new, it
all rests on an ancient foundation never designed to carry such a
load.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ME is still built on DOS, the primitive operating
system that put Microsoft on the map 20 years ago, when IBM (to its
enduring regret) adopted it for the original PC. DOS is hidden a
little deeper than in previous Windows releases _ you can no longer
boot your machine into it, except from your emergency startup
floppy, and the MS-DOS Prompt command has been moved off the main
Programs menu to the Accessories submenu _ but most of it is still
there.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, the code that lets DOS programs work in a state
known as ``real mode.'' Microsoft has finally removed it, which
means that starting up your PC is now marginally faster (perhaps 10
percent) but also that old games and applications that require real
mode will no longer work. In theory, however, most DOS software can
still be used. But when I tried, just for old times' sake, to peek
at the C: prompt, Windows informed me, in its inimitable way, that
the program had ``performed an illegal operation and (would) be
terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Still Using DOS
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way. A couple of years ago, when
it announced Windows 98, Microsoft said that would be the last
DOS-based version; what has now become ME was to be based on the
relatively modern and robust core code of Windows NT/2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the company soon dropped that plan, apparently because there
were too many popular Windows games, plus driver software for many
peripherals, that wouldn't work on NT. For home users, the
transition is now scheduled for the next release of Windows, a
combined business-and-consumer version code-named Whistler, that is
expected late next year.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Windows ME is really just a stopgap product,
designed to give Bill Gates et al. something fresh to peddle while
their programmers work on Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Goodies Galore
</P>
<P>
   Subject to all those limitations, Windows ME does include some
potentially worthwhile new features and enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   -- Behavior modification. The most valuable of these,
considering the fundamental instability of Windows, are several
Microsoft classified under the rubric ``PC Health.''
</P>
<P>
   A feature called System File Protection, borrowed from Windows
2000, prevents newly installed programs from overwriting critical
system files with outdated or nonstandard versions, thus reducing
the odds of crashes or other odd behavior from other programs.
</P>
<P>
   A new Help and Support Center provides a single, consistent
point of access to tips, tours and tutorials from both Microsoft
and, in the future, third-party developers. A link in this center
takes you to a new feature called System Restore, which lets you
roll your system back to a previous state in case corruption or
newly installed software cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   By default, it takes a ``snapshot'' of your setup after every 10
hours of computing, but you can make a new one at any time _ a good
idea before you install a new program or make any other major
changes to your system.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I failed to do that before I let someone modify
my laptop's networking configuration last week. And now, for
reasons I don't understand, the only snapshot available is one
taken after those changes.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it sounds nifty, and I'm sure it will be helpful to
some people some of the time, but so far, the one time I could
actually have used its help, it failed me.
</P>
<P>
   A popular utility called GoBack, now published by Adaptec,
offers a similar function. If you're using it, though, be sure you
have the latest version before installing Windows ME _ older ones
are not compatible.
</P>
<P>
   -- Internet integration. Windows ME comes with Internet Explorer
5.5, a recent version that differs from 5.0 mainly by the addition
of a Print Preview feature, which can help you avoid wasting lots
of time, toner and paper if you print often from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as soon as you get your Windows ME online _ a
process that went remarkably smoothly with all four PCs where I
installed the new system _ another new feature will let you know
that your version of IE is no longer the latest and greatest.
</P>
<P>
   The feature, called AutoUpdate, checks the Microsoft Web site
for updates in the background while you're online but your modem or
network connection isn't active. You can customize its behavior (or
shut it off altogether), but at its default settings, it
automatically downloads any relevant updates it finds, then asks
you if you want them installed.
</P>
<P>
   (The new software that AutoUpdate recommends is a beta test
version of IE with new cookie-management features.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood, ME replaces the TCP/IP ``stack'' _ the Internet
plumbing software _ from Windows 98 with a newer version borrowed
from Windows 2000. It's supposed to be more stable and secure; all
I can say is that I got all four of the PCs on which I installed ME
online without incident. The only downside: Most of the popular
personal firewall software packages, including Network ICE's
BlackICE Defender and Symantec's Norton Internet Security (but not
Zone Labs' ZoneAlarm), require updates.
</P>
<P>
   Another new feature in ME is a ``wizard'' that is supposed to
make it much easier to create a home network, particularly to
enable multiple machines to share Internet access. I didn't test it
_ my home network has worked fine for years, and I wasn't about to
jeopardize its stability even for the sake of science _ but by all
accounts it works well.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Net is apparent in lots of smaller ways,
too. The new Help center and even ordinary desktop windows, for
example, now have forward and back buttons, History and Favorites
menus and other browser-style features. And from the Help center
lists you can go with a single click to online support sites, just
as easily, if not quite as quickly, as you can jump to help files
on your own hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Last but, for gamers, not least, Windows ME includes five new
games _ versions of backgammon, checkers, hearts, Reversi and
spades _ designed to be played against online opponents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Digital media. Included with ME is the latest version of the
Windows Media Player, a slick and versatile, though somewhat
unstable, program for playing and managing digital audio and video
in several formats, including MP3 (but not RealAudio or RealVideo).
Like most competing products, it lets you choose among a variety of
``skins,'' or onscreen interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Player doesn't require Windows ME, and it is freely
downloadable from Microsoft's Web site (www.microsoft.com/windows
/windowsmedia/en/software /Playerv7.asp). But that's not the case
with several other digital-media programs in the new Windows.
</P>
<P>
   One is Windows Movie Maker, which lets you edit digital videos,
then share them via e-mail or posting to the Web. Like iMovie, the
video application Apple now ships with nearly all Macs, the program
automatically divides video sequences into separate scenes, which
makes it relatively easy to get rid of those you don't want and
reorganize what's left.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Apple program, Movie Maker works with clips imported
from conventional analog video cameras as well as the newer (and
pricier) digital kind. But because very few PCs ship with the
hardware needed to import video _ either a FireWire/i.Link/1394
port for digital camcorders, or a PCI card or external device for
digitizing and capturing analog video _ you will probably still
need to spend additional time and money before you can start
editing.
</P>
<P>
   And because most if not all such hardware add-ons come with
their own editing software, even aspiring Spielbergs may never need
Movie Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Another new media feature in ME, carrying the catchy name
Windows Image Acquisition, simplifies the process of downloading
still images from a digital camera or scanner via Universal Serial
Bus or a conventional serial connection _ provided your images are
coming from a new, WIA-compatible device.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all digital cameras and scanners already come with
download software for Windows, but some of these programs are
clunky, whereas WIA seems to work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; The Bottom Line
</P>
<P>
   Windows ME requires, at a minimum, a 150-megahertz processor and
32 megabytes of memory, but I wouldn't even consider it unless you
already have or are willing to get at least 64 megabytes of memory.
Microsoft says a typical installation requires about 295 megabytes
of available space on your hard drive, including about 100
megabytes for backup files created during installation. When I
installed it on a freshly formatted drive, however, it filled a
whopping 513 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you meet the technical requirements, there's some risk
of hassles if you install ME on an older PC. When I tried it on a
5-year-old Dell Pentium Pro system, Windows ME couldn't find
software for either my NumberNine video card or my Kingston network
adapter. (The latter worked fine anyway; the former, though, worked
only in 640-by-480-pixel mode.)
</P>
<P>
   But suppose you have a relatively up-to-date PC with plenty of
disk space and memory, and you aren't bothered by any of the
relatively few incompatibilities that have turned up thus far _
should you upgrade to Windows ME?
</P>
<P>
   The question to ask, I think, is whether any of the system's new
features sounds like something you really don't want to be without.
If so, you probably don't have a lot to lose except the hour or so
the installation will take; at $60 _ no more than many popular
utilities _ it's difficult to argue that ME isn't worth the price
if you actually expect to use new features like Movie Maker or the
online games, or if you now frequently run into issues, like DLL
conflicts, that the new PC health features might prevent or
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, though, my advice is to wait, either until you
get a new machine with ME already installed or until Whistler
arrives. At its roots, despite some welcome improvements, ME is
clearly last-millennium software. Whatever you think about
Microsoft, it's a shame that despite all its riches and talent, it
couldn't deliver a Millennium Edition that deserves to be called
21st century technology.

the naming to be a simple part of the process. The center's mandate
is to sift out, from observatories on five continents, evidence of
new objects so that their orbits can be calculated, with a careful
eye to ``near-earth objects.'' Marsden with the ``Great Refractor''

Futile care, almost everyone agrees, is any attempt to save lives
after that point. Nor is there much dispute that futile care is
something to be avoided, inflicting physical and emotional pain
along with expense. But the consensus evaporates over exactly where
the noble fight against death turns into unwarranted interference.
``I think it's always going to be a squiggly line,'' says Sister
Carol Bauer, an ethicist who is vice president of mission
effectiveness at Good Samaritan Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. ``It
depends, for example, on individual circumstances and the patient's
wishes.'' (Bill Reinke/Cox News Service)

 PALO ALTO'S WINEBUYER.COM GETS BOUGHT  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Grapes are not the only things getting crushed
and blended this harvest season. So are wineries and wine
e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest deal, EVineyard of Portland, Ore., said Wednesday
that it is acquiring WineBuyer.com of Palo Alto for an undisclosed
price. The companies operate in separate e-commerce niches.
</P>
<P>
   WineBuyer.com claims to be the wine industry's first
business-to-business marketplace linking licensed
alcoholic-beverage wholesalers and retailers. By contrast,
EVineyard is an online wine retailer licensed to sell more than
5,000 domestic and imported brands in 25 states that account for
more than 70 percent of U.S. premium wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like other dot-coms that have rushed to merge since the Nasdaq
Stock Market correction in April, online wine vendors are feeling
the urge to merge to conserve capital and gain economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers of wine also must cope with complex U.S. and state laws
governing the sale of alcoholic beverages and a cumbersome
three-tier distribution system that typically requires that wine
move through a distributor/wholesaler and then retailer before it
reaches the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving our inventory management through strengthened
wholesaler partnerships will enable us to offer our customers
consistently efficient service and an even greater selection of
wines,'' said EVineyard CEO Larry Gerhard in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   WineBuyer.com founder and CEO John Boone, who will be vice
president of business services at EVineyard, said the deal
``expands EVineyard's access to the wines its customers seek''
while giving distributors access to EVineyard's ``virtual
storefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney estimates that online business-to-consumer
wine sales will grow from $150 million this year to $1.2 billion in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest merger of e-wine companies last month, Wine.com
of Napa combined with WineShopper.com of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com had raised $96 million from venture capital investors
and WineShopper.com had raised about $46 million. By contrast,
EVineyard built its business since May 1999 with just $13 million
million in private capital. Sales this year will be approximately
$10 million to $15 million.

 &HT;    Clinton and Lazio spar in televised debate
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. &Cx1f;  _ A Senate campaign that began as a polite
listening tour 14 months ago turned into an old-fashioned New
York-style political brawl Wednesday night as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Republican congressman Rick Lazio held their
first debate.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates started out trading accusations of chutzpah and
ended up pointedly not shaking hands after practically
arm-wrestling at midstage over the subject of soft money. In
between, things occasionally verged on mudslinging as Mrs. Clinton
kept trying to link Lazio to the worst aspects of Newt Gingrich's
congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when moderator Tim Russert brought up the subject of
Monica Lewinsky, Lazio was only too happy to help tie Mrs. Clinton
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, frankly, what's so troubling here with respect
to what my opponent just said is somehow that it only matters what
you say when you get caught,'' Lazio said after Mrs. Clinton had
been forced to watch a long-ago ``Today'' show clip in which she
blamed her husband's Lewinsky problems on a ``vast right wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lazio: ``Blaming others every time you have responsibility,
unfortunately that's become a pattern, I think, for my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lazio was only giving as good as he'd already gotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mentioned trust,'' Mrs. Clinton told Russert just before
turning to look in Lazio's direction. ``I didn't cast the votes
that Newt Gingrich asked me to cast.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a bit of telecast showmanship on Lazio's part for
the millions of viewers watching the live broadcast on all the NBC
affiliates in New York. Near the end of the debate, Lazio walked
over to Mrs. Clinton's podium and tried to induce her to sign a
copy of what he called his ``New York Freedom from Soft Money
Agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire that,'' Mrs. Clinton laughingly told him, just after
saying she would sign the agreement if and when he produced signed
letters from outside groups she said were creating so-called ``soft
money'' ads on Lazio's behalf. ``That was a wonderful
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to admire it,'' Lazio cut in, while Russert
essentially told them to break it up because the debate was nearly
over. ``I'm asking you to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only didn't they sign it. They didn't even shake hands
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat tense standoff was symbolic of a race in which the
stakes are high and every vote literally counts. Two polls released
Tuesday showed Mrs. Clinton barely leading by under 5 points. The
outcome likely will be decided by a small bloc of undecided voters,
some of whom say that Mrs. Clinton hasn't made a case for herself
as a representative New Yorker and that Lazio is running on little
else but his local roots.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the debate, many New Yorkers had complained that they
didn't yet know enough about the two candidates. That may explain
why four of five likely voters polled this past week said they
intended to watch.
</P>
<P>
   While it's too soon to say if the hourlong encounter made up
many voters' minds in this neck-and-neck race, history undeniably
was made the moment the debate began inside Buffalo's public
television station WNED.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is the first presidential spouse to run for public
office while still living in the White House. And for all her
attempts to sound like an average, albeit incredibly well-informed
New Yorker _ at one point getting specific about overcrowding in
one Queens school and wiring problems in another in Buffalo _ it
was impossible to ignore the Secret Service agents or international
press corps of approximately 150 her presence attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Or the range of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's only here so she can run for president someday!'' a
Lazio supporter yelled outside the studio where some 150 boosters
of both candidates mingled behind yellow police crime tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're only here so you can get on TV!'' a Clinton
supporter yelled back while a half-dozen TV news crews taped the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio only entered the race in late May, when Mrs. Clinton's
colorful Republican opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
dropped out due to prostate cancer and marital difficulties. Since
then, however, the relatively unknown four-term congressman from
suburban Long Island has raised nearly as much money as Mrs.
Clinton _ $19.2 million to her $21.9 million. Meanwhile, his public
profile has soared as a result of campaign ads featuring the likes
of Sen. John McCain and his repeated comparisons of his own
elective experience and lifelong New York residency to that of Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Lazio said in his first remarks during Wednesday's debate,
commenting on Mrs. Clinton's failed 1994 efforts at health care
reform:
</P>
<P>
   ``A New Yorker never would have made that proposal!''
</P>
<P>
   She may be a first lady, but the next time she got a chance to
talk, Mrs. Clinton fired right back:
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to the congressman's response,'' she told Russert
with a smile, ``reminds me of a word I've heard a lot this year.
Chutzpah.''

 &HT;    U.S. firm wins competition to design MLK monument on the Mall
 &HT;    By Melanie Eversley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A San Francisco architectural firm won a worldwide
competition Wednesday to design a memorial to the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on the National Mall with a plan for an open-air
stone structure highlighted by curtains of water and the words of
the late civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinators for the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial
Project presented the Roma Design Group with a check for $20,000
and the opportunity to design the edifice. The announcement was
made during a one-hour ceremony at a Washington hotel Wednesday
night. The firm beat out 900 other entrants for the chance to
design the first memorial to an individual African American on the
National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Dramov, a principal partner of Roma, said the structure is
intended to serve as an uplifting tribute to a man who hoped beyond
hope, not a dismal reminder of the pain of the civil rights
struggles. King, who grew up in Atlanta, was gunned down in April
1968 while standing on the porch of a Memphis motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a place . . . for all people to come, to
be exposed to the civil rights movement, and to give a proper
honoring for the man, the movement and the message,'' Dramov said.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King, who attended the ceremony with her daughter,
Bernice, said her late husband knew a perfect world is elusive, but
people must continue to strive for that perfect world. The striving
is what makes for social change, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, she added she felt the memorial design was one
that acknowledged the pain of segregation and racism, but also
recognized her late husband's vision of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Martin was concerned that freedom never stopped.
He realized the dream is always becoming,'' she said. ``I think
this will continue to motivate people. I think it will continue to
inspire generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Three commissions in Washington must approve the structure
design before it can become reality, but coordinators said they
hope to break ground by November 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will be an open-air design, much like the one
dedicated to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, also overlooking the Tidal
Basin. It will feature walls of water inscribed with the words of
King, as well as a towering stone structure at the entrance, in
which King's profile will be sculpted as well as the words from his
``promissory note'' passage, in which he declares America owes
black Americans freedom and fairness. King's profile will face the
memorial to Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, which coordinators anticipate will draw admirers
from around the world, had a very simple genesis. Five members of
the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity were sitting around a kitchen table
in 1983 when they came up with the idea. In 1998, Congress passed
legislation authorizing creation of the foundation, which is headed
by Alpha Phi Alpha President Adrian Wallace. Wallace and other
members of the 94-year-old fraternity, based in Baltimore, hosted
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger, who has vowed to donate at
least $5 million toward the project, also was on hand. He said he
learned of the project just as he had created a new foundation he
hoped he could devote to honoring America's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Andrew Young, a King aide who later served as Atlanta
mayor and ambassador to the United Nations, also attended
Wednesday's ceremony, leading the event with a prayer of thanks for
King and his spirit of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to raise a stone of hope, a beacon of
understanding, a ray of warmth and nonviolence that might give
additional life to those yet unborn,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Young said he was touched by the design.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be a really powerful statement of what the
movement was all about because it represents the images of hope,''

COMPLICATED OFFENSE NO PROBLEM FOR PURDUE'S DREW BREES

<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. _ Here's why Purdue quarterback Drew Brees
is one of the leading candidates for the Heisman Trophy: 69
touchdown passes, 8,857 passing yards, .617 completion percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one way how: Fox Right Gun Red 74 X Z Under
</P>
<P>
   That is one of a hundred or so different calls Brees might make
in the huddle Saturday during the 13th-ranked Boilermakers' game at
No. 21 Notre Dame. And that one mouthful of a play call does not
take into account the possibility he calls an audible at the line
of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good decision-maker,'' Purdue coach Joe Tiller said.
``Here, so many things happen after you're at the line of scrimmage
as opposed to what's in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Brees, a senior, is on pace to become the most prolific passer
in Big Ten Conference history. The former Austin Westlake High
School star is the major reason that Tiller's pass-intensive
offense _ one that critics said would not work in the
brass-knuckled Big Ten _ is now accepted as dangerous and
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Brees faces the same game-day challenges and difficulties as
other high-profile quarterbacks, though he works in a more
complicated scheme than most. To an outside observer, the
information he processes in the 25 seconds from calling the play to
executing it appears comparable to assembling a 1,000-piece jigsaw
puzzle in half a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what it is like to be Drew Brees: \Nsubheds:Intense
study In preparing for a game like Notre Dame, Brees often watches
two to three hours of film per day. That is in addition to the two
hours of daily practice. And then there is the little challenge of
learning the game plan, backward, forward, inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a restricted number of plays that are run out of an
unrestricted number of formations,'' Tiller said. ``How many plays
do we have? I don't know. We have an infinite number.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge is not just for Brees to know which plays to
call in the huddle or which audibles will work. The other 10
offensive players need to be able to quickly adjust to whatever
change Brees orders. Each game plan provides two specific options
for Brees to call audibles out of the plays that Purdue has
packaged for that opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quarterbacks who can't keep it in the right order
sequentially,'' Tiller said. ``They know they want to audible, but
they take you to the wrong audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other quarterbacks are robotic. They think the blitz is
coming, they get ready to make a `hot' throw to beat the blitz and
then the blitz isn't there and it's `Oh, ... Drew goes from A to E
on the checklist; other quarterbacks have trouble going from A to
B.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the plays and all the audibles go against a defense
trying to disguise coverage and confuse the quarterback. Like a
veteran comedian who can pull the right joke out of his mental card
file, Brees can call the right play in a moment's notice. It is as
if his quarterback's mind is equipped with a Pentium III processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to fool him every now and then \Rbut\S if you tip
your hand, he'll be 100 percent on his decisions,'' Tiller said.
``He's going to get the ball to the right guy, then it's a matter
of us catching it.'' \Nsubheds:Chess game For Brees, the perfect
scenario for each play gives him 15 seconds at the line of
scrimmage to assess the defense, see if the play called will work
and if he should audible. And never mind the television cameras,
the 70,000 screaming fans, the late-game pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I do is look at the play clock,'' said Brees,
who must decide which of Tiller's 22 offensive commandments he must
check off on any given play. ``If there's less than 10 seconds,
I'll yell, `Alert, alert.' That tells our guys there's not much
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where he lines up _ under center or in the shotgun
_ Brees' next challenge is scouting the defense. His eyes sweep the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the safeties, glance to the cornerbacks, come along
to the linebackers, the defensive line,'' he said. ``It's kind of a
circle I make with my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where football turns into a rapid-fire chess game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coverage has either one safety or two,'' Brees said, his
hands moving to add to his narrative. ``If there's one safety
playing back and the corners are playing soft, I know it's one of
two coverages _ `man free' or `cover three.' \RThe first is
man-to-man, the second is a three-deep zone played by the safety
and the two cornerbacks.\S
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams play a soft man-to-man with the safety back. It
looks like zone, but it's man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the linebackers, if they're lined up outside
and aren't looking at me, I know it's a zone. If they're head up on
the receivers, I know it's man. I look at the inside linebackers. I
can usually tell by how they're lined up or their body lean whether
or not they're blitzing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brees paused and smiled. ``Sure, sure, Drew, this is all so easy
to understand; right there with ya, pal.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense might drop eight men in coverage _ or blitz any of
eight players. Beyond the disguised coverages _ is it man or is it
zone? _ zone blitzes add to the confusion. That is when a
linebacker blitzes, but a defensive lineman drops into coverage.
Very tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry if they're trying to fool me,'' the 6-foot-1,
220-pound Brees said. ``If I can see a safety, I know there's no
way they can bring more guys than we can block, unless they want to
leave one of our receivers open. If a guy comes free untouched,
I've got about 1.5 seconds to get a pass off. That's enough for
me.'' \Nsubheds:No sweat OK, Mr. Brees, please explain that play
call. What the heck is ``Fox Right Gun Red 74 X Z Under''?
</P>
<P>
   Fox: Number of receivers (five)
</P>
<P>
   Right: Which side of the formation the tight end starts.
</P>
<P>
   Gun: Shotgun formation
</P>
<P>
   Red: Type of pass protection.
</P>
<P>
   74 X Z Under: The type of the routes. The receivers (labeled A,
F, X, Y and Z in Purdue lingo) all know what routes they are
supposed to run. In this case, the outside receivers run hitch
patterns, the inside receivers run fade patterns, the tight end
runs up the hash mark (down the middle of the field).
</P>
<P>
   ``All the receivers have to know what the other receivers are
doing on each play,'' Brees said. ``They've all got
responsibilities on each play, even if they're not the main
receiver. We've all got to be doing our jobs right for it to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox Right Gun Red 74 X Z Under'' is just one play. In the roar
of competition, with blitzes flying and receivers digging and
cornerbacks bumping, making all the pieces fit into a play that
gains yardage is ... Oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``All defenses have a man in all areas of the field,'' said
Brees, who has a 3.41 grade point average in Purdue's School of
Management. ``How can an offense move against that? That's where
the quarterback comes in. You have two receivers go where just one
defender is. The quarterback uses his eyes to move the defender,
the receiver reads where the opening is and you throw it to where
the defender isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all makes sense and it becomes simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say.

   (NYT4) NEW YORK -- Sept. 13, 2000 -- CHINESE-ANTIQUES-1 -- Since
the late 19th century, when Westerners began trading with China,
there have been collectors who sought Chinese antiques. But in the
past 10 years, a group of younger, less wealthy collectors has
emerged. Mary Peng, who sells $50 Chinese wedding baskets and
$3,500 Chinese antiques out of her Manhattan loft, says ``The
younger collectors are seasoned travelers in their 20's, coming
back to the United States, who want to purchase the furniture they
had seen overseas, and who know that antiques don't have to be
$10,000 to start.'' (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)

<P>
   Changes have been the story for the Major League Soccer's fifth
season. The season began with a new commissioner, Don Garber in his
first full year. Taking a look at the playoff picture shows plenty
else that's new this year: from coaching changes, to first-year
impact players, to teams that have made impressive turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring absence in this year's playoffs is D.C. United.
The three-time MLS champion inexplicably fizzled this season,
despite returning the bulk of a team that had never missed the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting United's fall from the top is the rise of two
cellar-d wellers _ Kansas City and the MetroStars. Under former
Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano, New York/New Jersey captured the
franchise's first division title. Bob Gansler orchestrated another
reversal of fortunes in his first full season with Kansas City,
guiding the Wizards to the Western Division title after Kansas City
had missed the playoffs the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   MLS also moved from two to three divisions and, under the new
format, playoff races came down to the final game. Colorado
clinched a berth with an overtime goal, and the Burn jumped from
eighth to sixth place with a last-gasp victory against San Jose,
shuffling the order in the bottom of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs should be just as exciting. Chicago is the only
other team besides United to have won a title, but that could
change with D.C. out of the picture.
\Nsubheds:The lowdown A look at the best in this year's playoffs:
</P>
<P>
   Goalie: Tony Meola, Kansas City Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Meola battled injuries, but this year he has a
league-record 16 shutouts and registered a league-best 0.89
goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder: Carlos Valderrama, Tampa Bay Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The orange-haired Colombian may be 39, but he set a league
record with 26 assists and has veteran experience to draw on for
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Defender: Mike Petke, MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   The blond-haired Petke is one of the most fiery players in the
league, and his ability to frustrate strikers could be a major
sticking point for opponents in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Forward: Mamadou Diallo, Tampa Bay Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was one goal short of tying the league record of 27 goals
in a season, and paired with Valderrama, he should continue to be a
major threat.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Bob Gansler, Kansas City Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full season with the Wizards, Gansler has utilized
the experience of his veterans and the contributions of his
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Chicago vs. Dallas in the second round. These teams have
already met 17 times in only three seasons, and last year's
first-round series _ which the Burn won in three _ set the stage
for a heated rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Cup finalists: Chicago vs. Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards will the ride momentum of their best season to the
Cup final, and Chicago will make up for some absences in its
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   2000 Champion: Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of winning the Cup in 1998 as an expansion team
should propel the Fire back to the top. \Nsubheds:First-round
matchups 1. Kansas City Wizards vs. 8. Colorado Rapids
</P>
<P>
   Records: Wizards 16-7-9, Rapids 13-15-4 Game 1: Saturday, 7:30
p.m., Arrowhead Stadium Game 2: Wednesday, 8:30 p.m.; Mile High
Stadium Game 3: Sunday, Sept. 24, 7:30 p.m., Arrowhead Stadium; .
The superstar: Wizards GK Tony Meola. His resurgence as one of the
league's best keepers is one of the key reasons for Kansas City's
leap to the top. The scoop: The Rapids managed to cap an
injury-plagued season with a miraculous berth into the playoffs,
thanks to an overtime goal from Paul Bravo in their season-ending
victory against the Galaxy. But Colorado's luck could run out
against a powerful Kansas City squad, which will be looking to
avenge the '97 playoffs when it was bumped by the Rapids. The pick:
Kansas City in two games. 2. Chicago Fire vs. 7. New England
Revolution
</P>
<P>
   Records: Fire 17-9-6, Revolution 13-13-6 Game 1: Friday, 7:30
p.m., at Soldier Field; Game 2: Tuesday, 7:30 p.m.; at Foxboro
Stadium; Game 3: Friday, Sept. 22, 7:30 p.m. at Soldier Field; The
superstar: Chicago midfielder Hristo Stoitchov. The fiery Bulgarian
standout is brash, athletic and outspoken. He brings a flair to the
game that is worth more than the price of admission. The scoop: The
Revolution is the only MLS team not to suffer a loss to Chicago
this season, but Chicago is on a late-season tear, averaging three
goals a game during its four-game winning streak. Nevertheless,
Chicago has several key players out of the lineup (midfielder Chris
Armas and defender Lubos Kubik with injuries; forward Josh Wolff
and midfielder Evan Whitfield, with the U.S. Olympic team), which
could offer the Revs some hope to advance. The pick: Chicago in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   3. New York/New Jersey MetroStars vs. 6. Dallas Burn
</P>
<P>
   Records: MetroStars 17-12-3, Burn 14-14-4 Game 1: Friday at
Giants Stadium, 7 p.m.; KSTR/Ch. 49 Game 2: Wednesday at the Cotton
Bowl; 7:30 p.m.; KSTR/Ch. 49 Game 3: Saturday, Sept. 23 at Giants
Stadium, 2:30 p.m.; ESPN2. The superstar: MetroStars M/F Clint
Mathis. MVP candidate has six goals in two games against the Burn
this season. The scoop: A rivalry that is getting fiercer by the
game, this first postseason meeting won't lack in physical play _
or goals. The Burn will be looking to exact some revenge after
losing the last meeting, 6-4, at the Cotton Bowl. A hotly contested
penalty kick from Mathis proved to be the game-winner. The
MetroStars' biggest weakness is in the net, where they will have to
use third-string goalkeeper Paul Grafer. Usual starter, Mike Ammann
is out with season-ending rib and lung injuries after a tackle from
Mamadou Diallo, and backup Tim Howard is playing in Australia with
the U.S. Olympic team. The pick: The Burn in three games.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tampa Bay Mutiny vs. 5. Los Angeles Galaxy
</P>
<P>
   Records: Mutiny 16-12-4, Galaxy 14-10-8. Game 1: Tonight,
Raymond James Stadium at 7 p.m.; ESPN2. Game 2: Wednesday at the
Rose Bowl, 9:30 p.m.; TBA Game 3: Saturday, Sept. 23, at Raymond
James Stadium, TBD; The superstar: Tampa Bay striker Mamadou
Diallo. The Senegalese striker, nicknamed ``Big Mama,'' might have
a controversial physical style, but he always manages to find the
back of the net. The scoop: Another budding rivalry, this closely
matched series has the promise of a thriller. The Galaxy has held
Diallo to only one goal in two meetings this season. Home-field
advantage could be the difference for the Mutiny, but Tampa Bay has
a history of stalling in the postseason, losing its past six
playoff games. The pick: Tampa Bay in three games. _if necessary

JACKSON COUNTY ASSISTANT PROSECUTORS VOTE TO JOIN FIREFIGHTERS
UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hoping to address longstanding concerns about
low pay, Jackson County assistant prosecutors announced Wednesday
they had voted to join one of the most politically powerful unions
in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of about 70 assistant prosecutors have
voted to join Local 42 of the International Association of Fire
Fighters, assistant prosecutor Bryan Krantz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said assistant prosecutors chose the union, which represents
Kansas City firefighters, over seven others, because ``the only
card we have is political pressure, and we felt they had the most
clout.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Jackson County prosecutors are the lowest-paid in the
metropolitan area and deal with the most crime, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With starting pay of $32,000, several assistant prosecutors take
second jobs to make ends meet and pay off student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Riederer, niece of a former three-term Jackson County
prosecutor, serves the Jackson County Drug Court in the day and
serves food at a Country Club Plaza restaurant in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   She has $56,000 in student loans, Riederer said, and needs the
waitress work several nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make more in five hours there than I do in a day at the
courthouse,'' she said. Riederer, 30, voted for the union.
</P>
<P>
   More prosecutors are joining unions nationally, but lawyers say
they know of no other prosecutors in Missouri or Kansas who have
done so. They are the first such white-collar professional group to
join Local 42.
</P>
<P>
   Louie A. Wright, president of Local 42, said unions across the
United States were signing more professional workers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like to start contract negotiations with
Jackson County within weeks, before a budget is approved in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters union soon will ask the Jackson County
Legislature and the county executive to accept it as the assistant
prosecutors' bargaining agent, Wright said. The county could
approve the request quickly or ask for another vote by assistant
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative Chairman Victor Callahan said he would not oppose
the union. County Executive Katheryn Shields could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said his staff should be
paid more, adding he did not try to influence them on the union
decision.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Krantz said, Jackson County assistant
prosecutors ``would like to not be the worst-paid attorneys in
town.'' They will seek more money in contract negotiations, Krantz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 42 has won good raises from the Kansas City Council but
sometimes with hard-nosed tactics. Firefighters struck twice in the
1970s and threatened to strike in 1998 pay negotiations, even
though it is illegal for public workers to strike in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant prosecutors will never strike, Krantz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take an oath to uphold the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant prosecutors get few raises, Krantz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we start low,'' he said, ``we stay low.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant prosecutor Carol Quinn is an 11-year veteran who makes
$40,000 a year. She works up to 16 evening hours a week, she said,
making calls to verify insurance information. She voted union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I can't do any worse,'' she said. ``When we go to the
well to ask for more money, they just pat us on the head and send
us away.''

Stanley Turrentine, a jazz tenor saxophonist whose blues-based,
easygoing style appealed to a market wider than the jazz world for
40 years, died on Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center. He was 66 and lived in Fort Washington, Md. The
cause of death was a stroke, said Robin Burgess, his agent.

debate Wednesday, wielding soundbite-sized insults and an actual

Facing off in what turned out to be an often testy first debate of
their Senate campaign in New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton
repeatedly attacked Republican Rep. Rick Lazio on Wednesday as a
disciple of conservative former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Lazio,

Vice President Al Gore, a November 1995 fund-raising dinner at the
Houston home of attorney John Eddie Williams Jr., was the chance to
promote a budding relationship between the Democratic Party and a
handful of powerful Texas trial lawyers. The relationship blossomed
but it produced heavy-handed fund-raising techniques that have

<P>
   BUSH EXPANDS MESSAGE TEAM
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential race now a dead heat, Gov. George W. Bush
has added a Washington-based Republican consultant, Ed Gillespie,
to his communications team to help sharpen his campaign message.
Gillespie, 39, has been senior adviser to the House majority
leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, director of policy and
communications for the House Republican Conference and a senior
staff member at the Republican National Committee. He was one of
six Washington advisers named by the Bush campaign earlier this
year when national Republicans complained that the Austin-based
Bush campaign was too insular. His hiring for the new job, which
Bush advisers called a natural extension of his earlier role, comes
at a time when Vice President Al Gore has caught Bush in the polls
and some Republicans have been urging Bush to sharpen his campaign
themes.

<P>
   A REUNION FOR CHENEY AND FORD
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney paid a call Wednesday on his old boss, former
President Gerald Ford, in a campaign swing through Grand Rapids,
Mich. Twenty-five years ago, Cheney, then 34, became Ford's White
House chief of staff. Warmly greeted by Ford and his wife, Betty,
outside the Gerald R. Ford Museum, on the banks of the Grand River,
Cheney said: ``It's fun just to come back and spend some time with
the president, get words of wisdom from somebody who has been where
I'm trying to go, as vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford called his old protege ``a very dear friend and a person
who did a superb job for me when I was in the White House.'' And
what advice and wisdom did Cheney get during the 10-minute meeting?
Cheney proved that he could still keep his old boss' confidences.
``I've always kept my conversations with him private over the
years,'' he said, adding that Ford was ``looking much better''
since his minor stroke last month at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN FINANCE ATTACK ON SOFT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Three advocates of stronger campaign finance laws asked a
federal court in Washington Wednesday to rule that coordination of
advertising and other expenditures between a presidential candidate
and a political party represents an illegal campaign contribution.
The trio _ Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21; Scott
Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, and Archibald Cox, the
former Watergate special prosecutor _ argued that the use of
so-called soft money by the Democratic National Committee and
Republican National Committee on behalf of Vice President Al Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush constitutes a ``massive'' violation of
current election law.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have accepted $68 million in public funds for the
general election and are not supposed to receive any other direct
contributions. But using soft funds raised in large amounts from
corporations, unions and rich contributors, the two parties are
spending tens of millions on television ads that, in effect,
promote their candidates and attack their opponents. Under federal
law, soft money ads are not supposed to advocate the election or
defeat of a specific candidate, and the ad campaigns are not
supposed to be coordinated with candidates.
</P>
<P>
   THE STATES
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE RACES IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Two new polls indicate that Vice President Al Gore's support
among voters in Florida has surged and that he now is neck and neck
with Gov. George W. Bush, who once appeared to have a lock on the
state's 25 electoral votes. The first poll, conducted by the
Mason-Dixon survey group for several Florida media outlets, found
Bush only two percentage points ahead; the second poll, conducted
by the University of Connecticut's polling organization, showed the
contest dead even.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, is Bush's brother, and Republicans
have been gaining strength in the state in recent years. The
university poll also found that in the race for the Florida's open
Senate seat, Rep. Bill McCollum, a Republican, and state Insurance
Commissioner Bill Nelson, a Democrat, were in a dead heat.

</P>
<P>
   FINAL DEBATE IN WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for the Democratic nomination for senator
from Washington clashed Wednesday at their final scheduled debate
before next Tuesday's primary. Speaking before the Rotary Club of
Seattle, the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn, and former
Rep. Maria Cantwell traded barbs over their records, Internet
privacy issues and Cantwell's largely self-financed and more lavish
campaign spending. But they also spent time criticizing the record
of the Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, whom the winner of the
primary will take on in the general election. Senn identified
protecting prescription drug coverage for older Americans as her
top legislative priority, while Cantwell, a millionaire high-tech
executive, singled out campaign finance reform. Compiled by B.

   FEWER BRITISH JOBLESS
</P>
<P>
   Britain said the number of unemployed fell to a 25-year low of
3.6 percent in August from 3.7 percent in July as a further 18,000
people found work. The figures reflect the contrast between Britain
and continental Europe, where the average unemployment rate is
almost three times as high, but the fall is causing problems for
manufacturers unable to find skilled workers. Other figures showed
wage increases also fell in the three months through July to an
annualized 3.9 percent, down from 4.1 percent in the previous
quarter, reducing worries about the likely impact of inflation on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER INFUSION FOR DOME
</P>
<P>
   British authorities acknowledged that more public financing
would be given in subsidies to keep the ill-starred Millennium Dome
open until the end of the year. A spokeswoman said the grant _ the
sixth this year _ would total around $110 million, including funds
previously announced and new money to compensate for the collapse
this week of a $157 million deal for the project to be sold to a
division of Nomura, the Japanese investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   QUEBEC CABLE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The Quebec government's pension fund and a private-sector
partner, Quebecor Inc., have won control of the province's largest
cable television company, Groupe Videotron Ltd., with a $3.3
billion all-cash offer. The two topped a bid by Rogers
Communications Inc. of Toronto. Rogers withdrew its bid Wednesday
and will be paid a $163 million breakup fee. The value of its offer
had fallen below the all-cash counter-bid of about 4.9 billion
Canadian dollars from the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec,
the provincial pension fund, and Quebecor, a Montreal media
company.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-GERMAN INTERNET ALLIANCE
</P>
<P>
   Japan's leading Internet service provider, the Nifty Corp.,
agreed to a cooperative alliance with T-Online International AG of
Germany, Europe's largest Internet service provider. Nifty, owned
by Fujitsu Ltd., and T-Online, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, will
make available to each other's customers access points in Japan and
Europe. Nifty has 3.9 million subscribers, while T-Online has 6
million spread through Germany, France and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   CADBURY IN PEPSI DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC of Britain will buy Pepsi Cola Bottlers
Australia to increase its market share in carbonated soft drinks.
Terms were not disclosed. The deal will make Cadbury, through its
Australian subsidiary, Schweppes Cottee's, the exclusive bottler of
such brands as Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7 Up and Mountain Dew. John
Sunderland, Cadbury's chief executive, said the expansion would
enhance the efficiency and profitability of Schweppes Cottee in the
$2.5 billion (Australian) soft-drink market and nearly double its
market share to 25 percent. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE TO REVISIT CHILE FILES THAT CIA WANTS TO BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House ordered a new look Wednesday at
several hundred files that the CIA intends to withhold when it
releases American documents about the 1973 military coup in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns that the agency is overly protective of
its secrets, Sandy Berger, national security adviser, postponed the
governmentwide release of documents and asked aides to review the
CIA papers and seek the ``fullest possible disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   The move appeared to signal a victory for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and other advocates of a broad disclosure of the
American role in the overthrow of the socialist government of
President Salvador Allende and in the ensuing 17-year dictatorship
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be read as a rebuke to CIA Director George Tenet,
who last month overruled his own declassification experts and
announced that he would withhold certain files on the ground that
they would compromise intelligence techniques still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said the re-examination
of the CIA papers would take ``no more than a few weeks.'' In two
previous releases of about 7,500 documents, there has been no
explicit evidence of a CIA role in destabilizing the Allende
government, archivists say.
</P>
<P>
   The declassification effort was ordered last year by President
Clinton to shed light on rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of
political violence in Chile from 1968 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee reported in 1975 on CIA efforts to prevent
Allende from taking office. But the official record remains
somewhat murky on whether American intelligence operatives had a
direct role in the 1973 coup, and on what the American government
knew about the murders of thousands of Chileans _ and some
Americans _ under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Tenet told members of Congress that some of the
documents in question had to be withheld because they presented ``a
pattern of activity that had the effect of revealing intelligence
methods that have been employed worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet insisted that he was not trying to shield his agency or
the United States from embarrassment.  &QL;

FAA WILL REQUIRE CHANGES FOR RUDDERS ON BOEING 737'S 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration plans to
announce on Thursday that it will require replacement of the rudder
control system on the Boeing 737, the most widely used airliner in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The agency concluded that safety improvements were still needed,
even after three orders were issued to airlines in recent years to
change hardware and emergency procedures were developed for pilots
to use if the rudders failed.
</P>
<P>
   A rudder malfunction was blamed for the crash of USAir Flight
427, which flipped over and plunged to earth on approach to
Pittsburgh International Airport six years ago this month, killing
all 132 people on board. It is also suspected in the crash of a
United Airlines Boeing 737 on approach to the airport in Colorado
Springs, Colo., in 1991 that killed all 25 on board. But aviation
experts continue to characterize rudder problems on the plane as
rare.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA intends to issue an order by next July that will specify
precisely what changes will be needed and will require finishing
the changes within three to five years. Planes coming off the
assembly line will have to comply sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a reversal for the agency, which had previously
argued that smaller changes in hardware and procedures would
suffice. Even after the flaw that caused the Pittsburgh crash was
demonstrated, senior agency officials had argued that the existing
system was quite reliable and that a new system could conceivably
have a higher failure rate.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 1,500 737s registered in this country would be
covered directly by the order and most of the 2,000 registered in
other countries would also be covered, because regulators abroad
typically adopt the same rules as the FAA for American-built
planes. The number of planes in service and the expected scope of
the work are likely to make this one of the biggest orders
affecting planes already in service, aviation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the design of the new system is ``still a work in
progress,'' said Diane Spitaliere, a spokeswoman for the FAA. And
even when the new system is completed, the agency will take some
time to approve it, aviation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear what the changes will cost, ``other than the
fact that it's going to be expensive,'' said David Fuscus, a
spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the
major airlines. In such cases the cost is typically shared by
airlines and the aircraft manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pittsburgh case, investigators believe that a malfunction
in the hydraulic system made the rudder swing all the way to one
side and stick there. When the plane's design was first approved,
engineers believed that the control system was redundant, meaning
that there were two separate control systems and one would take
over if the other failed. The system used two valves, one sliding
back and forth within the other.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of investigation, engineers concluded that they
were wrong. One sliding valve could fail without any sign and that
if it did so in one particular position, the other half could later
fail and produce ``rudder reversal,'' which would swing the rudder
hard to the opposite side from what the pilot intended.

AIRLINES CALL FOR TIGHTER LIMIT ON PILOTS' DAILY WORK HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's major airlines said Wednesday that the
Federal Aviation Administration should tighten restrictions on how
many hours a day a pilot could work. They also said the agency
should repeal a ``regulatory loophole'' allowing crews to ferry
empty airplanes at the end of the day without regard to how many
hours a pilot had already flown.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest pilots' union said the airlines' proposals were ``a
delaying tactic'' in implementing new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has been trying since 1995 to rewrite the rules on how
long pilots can work, but its proposal attracted 2,000 comments
from airlines, pilots and others, and the agency is still
considering those comments. Without a consensus, it is not certain
that the agency will be able to write a new rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots now are limited to 16 scheduled hours a day, but the
aviation agency said in 1995 that it would like to shorten that to
14. As air traffic delays have worsened, pilots' workdays have
stretched, even if the number of miles they fly has stayed
constant.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines' trade group, the Air Transport Association,
which made the announcement Wednesday, called for tightening
certain exceptions to the 16-hour rule; in 1995 it opposed a
14-hour limit as too short.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a DC-8 cargo plane on a ferry flight crashed on
approach to Guantanamo Bay, the American military base on the Cuban
coast; all three cockpit crew members were sleepy, the National
Transportation Safety Board found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of something that should simply not
happen,'' said Carol Hallett, the executive director of the Air
Transport Association, a trade association made up of 23 airlines.
The member airlines have agreed to stop using a rule that lets them
conduct such flights regardless of how long the crew has worked,
Hallett said.
</P>
<P>
   The association wants the FAA to impose the same restriction on
smaller carriers. Hallett acknowledged, however, that most, if not
all, members of the group had stopped such flights before the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the Air Line Pilots Association, Capt.
Duane Woerth, said Wednesday that the airlines' announcement fell
short of what was required. The pilots have been complaining about
short turnarounds that they say leave them too little time for rest
between workdays.
</P>
<P>
   But pilots themselves are divided over the limits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Turrentine, a jazz tenor saxophonist whose
blues-based, easygoing style appealed to a market wider than the
jazz world for 40 years, died on Tuesday at New York Presbyterian
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 66 and lived in Fort
Washington, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said Robin Burgess, his agent.
Turrentine collapsed in his hotel room on Sunday before finishing a
six-night run at the Blue Note in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not a schooled musician, Turrentine had the
essence of blues and gospel playing; there was a lithe sensuousness
in his sound.
</P>
<P>
   His early influences were Coleman Hawkins and Don Byas, and,
like them, he had a broad tone. But he was not a cathartic or
harmonically complex player; he broke up his improvisations with
subtle cries and sighs and made his improvisations easy to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine was born in Pittsburgh. His father was a part-time
jazz musician who had performed with Al Cooper's Savoy Sultans and
his mother played church piano. His elder brother, Tommy, became a
trumpeter.
</P>
<P>
   After taking up the saxophone at the age of 11, he began his
career as a teen-ager, touring for two years with Lowell Fulson's
group, a band that also included Ray Charles on piano. He moved to
Cleveland and worked with Tadd Dameron. In 1953 he replaced John
Coltrane in the saxophonist Earl Bostic's group.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the Army in 1956 and played in the 158th Army Band,
which he said was the only formal schooling in music he ever had.
At the end of the 1950s he worked with the Max Roach Quintet
alongside his brother.
</P>
<P>
   He began his affiliation with Blue Note records in 1960, making
his own first album, ``Look Out!,'' after appearing as a sideman on
records by the Blue Note artists Dizzy Reece and Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   With Blue Note, he would become one of the top figures in the
field that became known as soul-jazz, unpretentious working-class
music that usually featured a tenor saxophonist and an organ and
that had a circuit of small clubs in black neighborhoods across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s he was married for a time to the organist Shirley
Scott. They appeared on each other's albums, which became
increasingly commercial and exposed the artists to rock and soul
audiences. In 1969 his contract with Blue Note ended, and he jumped
to CTI. His 1970 album, ``Sugar,'' made with George Benson, was his
biggest hit and was his springboard into a long period of light
pop-jazz, the antecedent for today's smooth jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He later recorded for Fantasy, on recording dates arranged by
Gene Page and Elektra. He reappeared on Blue Note after it
reactivated itself in the mid-1980s, making a tribute record to
Stevie Wonder. Throughout the 1990s, Turrentine recorded for
Musicmaster, and kept up a busy performance schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Turrentine's group opened for Aretha Franklin at a JVC Jazz
Festival concert at Avery Fisher Hall this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Judith; his daughters, Sheri, Lisa,
Pamela and Nicole, all of Philadelphia; a stepson, Mark Weatherly
of Falls Church, Va.; two sisters; three grandchildren; and one
great-grandchild.

HOUSE COMMITTEE PASSES MEASURE THAT WOULD BAN BETTING ON AMATEUR
SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Efforts advanced Wednesday to outlaw legalized
betting on college, high school and Olympic sports..MDSD/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to make betting on
amateur sports illegal, which already is the case virtually
everywhere in the country, except Nevada. A Senate panel took
similar action in June, saying it would protect the integrity of
amateur athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for Congress in the last hours of this
session to do something for a cause many Americans really love and
appreciate, and that is college sports,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham,
a South Carolina Republican and bill sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who sponsored a similar
bill passed in June by the Senate Commerce Committee, said he was
glad there was support in both houses of Congress for the
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not gamble with the integrity of the Olympic Games,
our colleges or the future of college athletics,'' Brownback said.
``Gambling has become a black eye on too many of our colleges and
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that betting on amateur sports was a $1 billion
annual enterprise in Nevada and that betting can influence young
athletes and teams.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the bill did nothing to curb widespread illegal
betting on college sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to make a bit of difference in the real
world,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat who
is on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Betting is common on college campuses, in workplaces, on the
Internet and through bookmaking operations, some lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me trying to focus on Nevada as a way of stamping
out illegal betting is a little bit overdone,'' said Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee. ``We are really ignoring illegal gambling in the other
49 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, who spoke favorably of the bill when it first was
introduced, suggested that a task force be appointed to study the
issue. The committee rejected that idea and voted 17-11 for the
bill, mostly along party lines, with Republicans in support of the
measure. ``It's been studied to death,'' Graham said. ``We don't
need another study.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president and chief executive of the
American Gaming Association, said he was encouraged that there were
numerous votes against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have been saying all along, when people start focusing
on the facts, they would recognize this bill for what it is: a
cosmetic response to serious campus gambling problems,'' he said in
a news release.

PAYTON PUTS END TO DRAMA WITH 10TH-INNING HOMER
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets' 4-1 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers Wednesday was a Jay Payton production in three acts. Mixing
tragicomedy with suspense, Payton presented the Brewers with a gift
run in the first inning, then wrote himself award-winning parts in
the ninth and 10th innings.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the Mets' clubhouse applauded Payton's second- and
third-act performances because they turned another potentially
devastating loss attributed to the missing-offense malady into an
uplifting victory that strengthened the Mets' hold on the National
League wild-card spot and let the Atlanta Braves know they
shouldn't celebrate the East division championship yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offering steak dinners for anybody who got a run back
for us,'' Payton said of his first-inning play that allowed the
certain third out to become a run-scoring error.
</P>
<P>
   On the 11-game road trip that begins Thursday night, Payton can
take himself and Robin Ventura to dinner. Their doubles produced
the tying run in the ninth, and Payton lined a two-out, three-run
home run over the left-center-field fence in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the third in the Mets' last four games, and even
though they aren't scoring tons of runs consistently, at this
juncture of the season, a victory is a victory, however it is
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that a missed fly ball in the first inning would
decide the outcome. Angel Echevarria walked with two out, and
Richie Sexson hit an eminently catchable fly to right-center. Lenny
Harris, starting in right for the first time this season, called
for the ball. But so did center fielder Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both could have caught it,'' Payton said. ``Lenny probably
could have caught it easier than me. But when I'm in center, I'm
aggressive. I go after the ball, and I'm going to call for it. I
want my corner outfielders to get behind me. But Lenny was probably
there before me. I'm just coming over. He heard me at the last
second and bailed. I wasn't sure he was going to bail, so we both
bailed. It was my fault. It's my responsibility to catch that
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball fell between the outfielders _ Harris was charged with
the error _ and Echevarria raced home with the unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's first-inning play was not far from his thoughts. ``I
was thinking about that the whole game,'' he said. ``We haven't
been scoring runs and I didn't want us to go down because of a ball
that was misplayed in the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed-hitting Payton lined the fourth pitch to right
field for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Payton moved to third as Edgardo Alfonzo bounced out. After Mike
Piazza swung at a high fastball well out of the strike zone and sat
down with strikeout No. 4, Ventura swung at the first pitch and
lined a double to left, driving in Payton with the steak-producing
run.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's Act III came not much later. With one out in the 10th,
Mike Bordick singled. Joe McEwing then lofted a high pop-up into
short center, and the Brewers proceeded to reprise the Mets'
first-inning farce.
</P>
<P>
   As McEwing slammed his bat to the ground, shortstop Mark Loretta
went back and center fielder Marquis Grissom came in. It appeared
that either could catch the ball. But Grissom called for it,
Loretta fell to the ground to get out of his way and Grissom, like
Payton, did not make the catch. It fell for a single, giving the
Mets runners at first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Trammell popped up for the second out, but Payton lashed a
line drive to left-center that Lou Collier pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I thought it probably was going to be caught,''
Payton said. ``I didn't think I hit it that good. It was a slider,
and I stayed back and I put a good swing on it, but I thought I got
out in front of it just a little bit. I was running hard watching
the left fielder. I thought the way he was running he would go back
and make a play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ball took off and sailed over the fence. ``I got some
new bats today,'' the jubilant Payton said, ``so maybe the wood's a
little better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets felt much better when Payton reached his place at home
plate and his play was over.

latest in a series of mergers that have wiped out many of New York
City's great banks of the past. Gone as independent banks are
Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Bankers Trust and Guaranty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the great banks survive in name only. Once
Chemical took over Chase in 1996, an independent Chase ceased to
exist. But Chemical ditched its own name in favor of one that
evoked images of Abraham Lincoln's Treasury secretary, after whom
Chase Bank was named, and the Rockefeller family.
</P>
<P>
   After this latest takeover, an independent J.P. Morgan will also
cease to exist, though the merged corporation will be called J.P.
Morgan Chase. That sounds more impressive than Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   As mergers swallow one bank after another, the survivors grow
gargantuan. J.P. Morgan Chase rolls the former Chemical, Chase,
Manufacturers Hanover and J.P. Morgan banks into one financial
goliath controlling more than $650 billion in assets. That leaves
it behind only Citigroup and Bank of America. Chase and J.P. Morgan
together account for more than 90,000 employees and $17 billion in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning theory says banks can survive only as part of
global conglomerates that offer corporate customers every
conceivable financial product. International markets may
accommodate only a few conglomerates. The likely survivors include
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
Standing alone, neither Chase nor J.P. Morgan would make the cut.
Together, they might.
</P>
<P>
   Size may not, however, prove to be a magic elixir. Citigroup,
which combined Citibank and Travelers Group two years ago, appears
to be doing well. But huge Japanese banks and European banks have
stumbled. Shareholders have a lot to fear if gigantism proves a
failure. But the general public does not. There are plenty of banks
and securities firms to compete for customers' business.
</P>
<P>
   For New York City, the merger threatens to produce layoffs in
the short term. But if the merger puts J.P. Morgan Chase on the
short list of corporate survivors, it will help keep New York at
the center of the financial world.

DREAM TEAM SEEKS A CHALLENGE; SUPPORT FOR KNIGHT; HOUSTON SPRAINS
WRIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia _ Alonzo Mourning acknowledged Wednesday what
his teammates already knew: getting motivated to annihilate
inferior basketball nations is hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really difficult to get yourself up to play against
international competition because, first of all, you know you're
superior to them,'' Mourning said Wednesday as the U.S. men's
basketball team prepared for its opening game of the 2000 Olympics
against China on Sunday (Saturday Eastern time).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're competing against the guys we compete
against in the league,'' Mourning said. ``It's like Gary Payton
says, `We're getting ready for the Clippers.'''
</P>
<P>
   The American men are a lock to capture a third consecutive gold
medal. With a 40-0 mark in international play since National
Basketball Association players were allowed to compete in 1992, the
pressure is not merely to win. They have to win by astronomical
scores to keep up with distant Dream Team cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of those Dream Teams are different,'' Mourning said.
``International competition has gotten better and better. They've
improved from back when Jordan was playing eight years ago. It's
improved dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning will miss two games next week to return home to be with
his wife, Tracy Wilson-Mourning, who is expected to give birth to a
baby daughter, Myka Sydney. He will travel 9,330 miles roundtrip
over four days.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rousing half-court scrimmage in a community center
gymnasium about an hour's drive west of Sydney may be the best
competition Mourning and his teammates face.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're here, we've got to get something out of this, even
if it's in practice against ourselves,'' he said. ``Execute, work
and let our talents take over. We do that, this thing will care of
itself. We want to put on a show for the world and let everybody
know that USA Basketball is still the best.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not endear themselves to Australians during an
exhibition in Melbourne last Saturday night that featured an
altercation between Vince Carter and Andrew Gaze and as much
physical play as a Heat-Knicks series. The crowd, ready to embrace
the NBA All-Stars before the game began, chanted derisively at
Carter in the second half of an 89-64 victory by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several players admitted that playing the dual role of
international good sportsman and dominant gold-medal favorite can
be a chore. The talking and shoving on Saturday night was more than
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go and tell Tim Hardaway not to play the way he's
been playing for 25 years,'' Payton said. ``Off the court, we're
great people. But on the court, we're trying to get a job done and
win. And if it comes across bad, we've got to be that way. As long
as we don't do anything to really embarrass our country or team _
like a big altercation or fight _ then it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston said: ``We're worried about winning. Who we are is
who we are. We don't have any knuckleheads on this team that's
going to misrepresent the United States anyway. We're not going out
there to do anything crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning also divulged another badly kept secret. The Americans
have no chance of losing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worried about that,'' he said. ``If we played five
players the whole game, I couldn't see us losing. We might not win
by a big margin, but I still can't see us losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for Knight
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 miles from Bloomington, Ind., one of Bobby
Knight's longtime rivals and the point guard on his first national
championship team was surprised and disappointed over the Indiana
coach's firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed for basketball because he's a great mind,''
said Quinn Buckner, USA Basketball's vice president, who won a
national championship with Knight. ``I'm disappointed for the
university because they lose a great coach. I'm obviously
disappointed for him because he loses not just a job but also a
program that he built. Indiana basketball was Bob Knight
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckner, who started on the last undefeated team in men's
Division I basketball, in 1976, added: ``I still remember when we
won the championship. I hadn't seen him happy before that. His hair
was mussed; he used to wear those ugly checked suits. But he was
finally happy when we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Keady, an assistant coach with the men's team and a fixture
at Purdue for two decades, said he was stunned by the news
delivered to him by an assistant coach in his hotel room on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were fierce rivals in the Big Ten Conference,
Keady, who has been involved with USA Basketball for 21 years,
helped Knight select the 1984 Olympic team. He conceded that
calling Knight to express his condolences would probably not be a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done much of that because we've always just played
each other,'' Keady said. ``I don't think Coach Knight would return
a call to me. It'd be wasted money. He's got more important things
to worry about. I'll miss mostly the competition and what it took
to prepare for his teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Sprains Wrist
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston sat out most of practice after spraining his right
wrist as he was driving to the basket against Shareef-Abdur Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like I kind of jammed it,'' Houston said of his
shooting hand, which was surgically repaired after the 1996-97
season. ``I don't feel like I did anything serious, but hopefully
by tomorrow I can shoot the ball. If I can shoot, I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston said he would put off any decision on X-rays until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I worried? If I can't practice, it's going to worry me a
little,'' he said. ``I want to be able to play in practice and in
the Games.''

SMITH'S SECRET PACT UNDERCUTS NBA CAP
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Joe Smith signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves in January
1999, he accepted a one-year contract worth only $1.75 million, a
small sum for a 6-foot-10-inch forward with immense potential who
had been the first pick in the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised a few eyebrows around the NBA. Smith, who is 25,
should have been worth between three to five times as much on the
open market, league officials say. Indeed, he had earned $2.5
million his rookie year with the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics, it turns out, had reason to doubt. Smith signed
two agreements with the Timberwolves: The first was the one-year
contract that the team sent to the league office in New York. But
the second was an extensive secret agreement in which the team's
owner promised Smith, in writing, a seven-year deal worth as much
as $86 million after he had worked for three years under less
lucrative, one-year contracts, said several people who have seen
both documents.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics of the Timberwolves, Smith and his agent, Eric
Fleisher, reflect a widespread problem in professional basketball
that has undercut the effectiveness of the NBA's salary-cap rules.
Those rules, league officials say, are intended to keep rich teams
from hoarding the best talent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, there have been allegations that some agents and
owners were circumventing the salary cap, using a loophole that
lets a team re-sign its own free agents after three years even if
the new contract exceeds the cap. Known as the Larry Bird rule, the
provision was originally meant to protect owners from being forced
to break up a great team just to remain under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   But some owners and agents have been exploiting the loophole,
agents and officials from the league and the players union say.
Teams who cannot afford an expensive player because of the salary
cap sometimes sign him first to a series of low-paying, one-year
contracts, while promising, with a wink and a nod, to give him a
lucrative multiyear deal three years later, when he gets what are
known as his ``Bird rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials in the NFL have also been concerned about teams
doing an end run around salary-cap restrictions. The league's
management council has been investigating whether Carmen Policy,
the former president of the San Francisco 49ers, violated
salary-cap rules in contracts in the 1990s with Steve Young, a
former quarterback, and Brent Jones, a former tight end.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the NBA has made fruitless attempts to investigate
allegations of secret deals to circumvent the salary cap. The
league's lawyers have always failed to find a paper trail proving
that secret agreements existed.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's case, however, the league has obtained copies of the
two agreements, which show that in early 1999 Smith and his agent,
Fleisher, negotiated not only a standard one-year contract, which
was filed with the league, but also an extensive separate pact with
the Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   That secret agreement was never shown to the NBA, league
officials said. People who have read the second agreement said it
laid out a 10-year arrangement under which Taylor agreed to sign
Smith to three one-year contracts, of $1.75 million, $2.1 million
and $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also agreed that he would give Smith, before the 2001-2
season, two additional contracts that cumulatively over seven years
would be worth between $40.6 million and $86.6 million. The final
value of the deal depended on whether Smith became an All-Star or
led the team to a championship, several people who have read the
documents said. The secret agreement is dated Jan. 22, 1999, a day
before the one-year contract for $1.75 million was signed,
notarized and sent by the team to the league's offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-year contract filed with the league, Fleisher signed
an oath, under penalty of perjury, saying that ``there are no
undisclosed agreements of any kind, express or implied, oral or
written.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the secret agreement, signed by Smith and Taylor the
previous day, said its provisions would override any other
contracts the parties had signed. ``The terms of this agreement
shall control,'' the document says, people who have read it said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher did not return telephone calls left Wednesday at his
office.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's new agent, Daniel Fegan, portrayed his client as a
victim of an unscrupulous agent. He said the secret agreements were
unnecessary and ``were designed to protect the interests of the
player agent, not the player.'' He also said Smith had never asked
Fleisher or the team to draft the documents, and that the agent had
advised Smith to sign them without explaining that they violated
the salary-cap rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe for a minute that he understood exactly what
he was signing,'' Fegan said. ``And I don't believe it was ever
explained to him or that he understood what he was risking.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor declined a request to be interviewed for this article. In
an article last weekend in The Minneapolis Star Tribune, he
acknowledged the secret agreement, but stopped short of admitting
that he had violated the salary-cap provisions in the collective
bargaining agreement between the NBA and the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement called for a number of things to be phased in
each year,'' Taylor said. ``We agreed on different scenarios of
what his market value would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it basically just said that we had to conform with the
collective bargaining rules; it would be an agreement that we would
send into the commissioner for his approval. There were no side
deals or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials do not see it that way. In a news release, league
officials called the existence of a secret agreement ``the most
serious salary-cap offense that can be committed by teams, players
or agents.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An arbitrator, Kenneth Dam, a University of Chicago professor,
has been hired to hold private hearings into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are alleging that there is a written undisclosed agreement
between Joe Smith and the Timberwolves,'' Joel Litvin, the NBA
executive vice president for legal and business affairs, said.
``The agreement, which is set forth in writing, calls for future
payments to Smith of tens of millions of dollars and was
deliberately hidden from the league by the parties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator could order several penalties against the team,
including a fine of up to $3.5 million, the forfeiture of draft
picks and the suspension of team officials for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher could face severe sanctions from the player's union,
which certifies agents. The union's committee on agent regulation
could strip him of his license to represent NBA players. As a
lawyer, he also runs a risk of being sanctioned by the bar
association if it is shown he committed perjury. As a player, Smith
faces a less severe penalty. His pacts with the team could be
voided, leaving him once more a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, the Larry Bird loophole has made the cap easy to
override. In most cases, league officials have been powerless
because they have been unable to prove the existence of secret
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we've got them dead to rights,'' one league official
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plans by The New York Times to build a new
headquarters on Eighth Avenue took intriguing form this week with
the submission of competing proposals by some of the world's most
renowned architects.
</P>
<P>
   Prismatic, polymorphous, scintillating and starkly angular, they
defy the conventional idea of a boxy or stepped New York
skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   Though Times executives were quick to say that the architects'
visions would bear little or no relation to the final design of the
building, if such a building is even constructed, the models offer
a tantalizing glimpse of the company's ambitious aspirations for
the site, between 40th and 41st streets.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four entrants have won the Pritzker Architecture
Prize, widely considered the platinum bar of the profession. They
are Renzo Piano, Norman Foster and Frank Gehry, who is allied in
his submission with Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill. The other entrant,
Cesar Pelli, has been a Pritzker juror.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Golden, the vice chairman and senior vice president of
The New York Times Co., said Wednesday that he hoped the final
choice could be made next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we wanted this to be a difficult decision, and boy, is
it,'' he said after the four presentations concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a building that is an icon,'' Golden said, ``that
speaks to our heritage and also speaks to our future.'' New York
City, he said, is already rich in architecture. ``We want to make
it richer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. and its development partner, Forest City Ratner
Companies, are planning a tower about 650 feet high, with 1.3
million square feet of space, across Eighth Avenue from the Port
Authority Bus Terminal. The Times would occupy a little more than
half the building, including the larger floors at its base. The
rest would be leased to commercial and retail tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 200-by-400-foot site is part of the Times Square
redevelopment area, it is still in the hands of 11 different
owners. The 42nd Street Development Project, a subsidiary of the
Empire State Development Corp., would acquire the properties
through eminent domain and lease the land to the Times Co. and
Forest City Ratner.
</P>
<P>
   Construction might begin late next year or early in 2002, Golden
said, with occupancy of the new building about two years later. The
Times would probably sell the building at 229 W. 43rd St., which it
has occupied since 1913, Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that the Times board had not yet decided to
make the move and declined to estimate the cost of the project,
saying it was too early to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should warn you that what you see won't be what you get,''
Golden told Times employees in a memo about the architectural
presentations. ``The models represent the architects' design
concepts at this point in time. The architect that is chosen will
then embark upon a yearlong, detailed and complex process to design
the building we will ultimately occupy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That said, each concept is arresting.
</P>
<P>
   A towering right triangle has been proposed by Foster &AMP; Partners
of London. The high point would be on Eighth Avenue and the
inclined facade on the east, with tree-filled terraces every seven
stories. The sides would be crisscrossed with bold X bracing. The
top of the building would be illuminated and could, the architect
said, be assigned to an artist as a ``cultural billboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's projects have included the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank
in Hong Kong and the reconstruction of the Reichstag in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   From Frank O. Gehry &AMP; Associates of Santa Monica, Calif., has
come a proposal for a tower with an undulating facade, wrapped in
twisting, sinewy planes that blossom at the top and bustle at the
bottom; not unlike pappardelle pasta on a colossal scale. At the
top of the building would appear an ``N'' and ``Y'' in the
black-letter typeface from the newspaper's nameplate.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry, who astonished the world with the sinuous,
titanium-roofed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has more
recently designed a proposal for a new Guggenheim Museum on the
Lower Manhattan waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   He is associated with Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, whose current
projects include Columbus Center, soon to rise on the site of the
New York Coliseum; the new Pennsylvania Station; and the new New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Pelli &AMP; Associates of New Haven is probably best known in
New York as the architect of the World Financial Center at Battery
Park City and the Carnegie Hall Tower. But its proposal for the
Times building is nothing like those.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than four square walls, Pelli calls for a series of
suave, tapered, intersecting planes, each at a slightly different
angle, topped by a slanting roof. There would be tree-filled
atriums at either end of the building, which would rise out of a
low base covering the entire site.
</P>
<P>
   Piano has proposed an irregular, rectangular tower whose facade
consists of layers of diaphanous glass screens that almost seem to
float in the air around the building. There would be a five-story
atrium in the base, opening from Eighth Avenue, and a roof garden.
</P>
<P>
   In a caption accompanying his presentation, Piano said the Times
building ``should introduce new qualities: lightness, vibration,
transparency and immateriality.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano attracted world attention in the 1970s with the
startlingly exoskeletal Pompidou Center in Paris, designed with
Richard Rogers. Recent projects include the redevelopment of
Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. The Renzo Piano Building Workshop is
based in Paris and in Genoa, Italy.

EDITORIAL: MOVIE THEATERS SEEK HAPPY ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   If it were a Hollywood production, ``The Plight of the
Megaplex'' would be a tear-jerker starring companies brought to
ruin because they sought to bring hourly show times, reclining seat
backs, retractable armrests and stadium seating to every last
corner of America.
</P>
<P>
   Movie theater chains have been building plush, massive
``megaplexes'' since 1995, when a 24-screen theater went up in
Dallas. Customers seem to love them. While ``stadium seating'' may
conjure up images of freezing temperatures, hard seats and
fistfights at a professional football game, it actually means
building theaters so as to enable all moviegoers to see the screen
instead of only the back of someone's cranium. It is the most
revolutionary film-exhibiting development to come along since the
cup holder, which took the industry by storm in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, these new facilities have been taking business
away from the same operators' older screens, often located at mere
``multiplexes.'' There simply aren't enough customers to go around.
Although the number of movie screens in the United States has more
than doubled over the past two decades _ from 17,675 in 1980 to
37,185 in 1999 _ only 50 percent more tickets were sold last year
than in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because theaters take a smaller slice of the box office in
a movie's first weeks, putting the hottest movies on five screens
with staggered starting hours may turn out to be a poor business
strategy, insofar as it shortens a film's life span.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties are mounting. This year United Artists, Carmike
Cinemas, Edwards Cinemas and Silver Cinemas have filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy petitions. Loews Cineplex said on Aug. 25 that it might
default on debt payments. Not even $5 bags of popcorn can stem the
tide of red ink that resulted when these companies overbuilt to
protect market share. The summer of 2000, short on blockbuster
hits, proved little relief, with box office receipts down $210
million from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the crisis is past, surviving movie theater chains will be
left to confront the question haunting the 500-channel cable TV
universe: Is there enough good material to put on all those
screens?

NEW YORK COMMENTARY: TWO CANDIDATES WHO DIFFER MEAN A CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would not have seemed possible before Wednesday
night's Senate debate, not remotely possible that you could feel
sympathy for Hillary Rodham Clinton _ tough-as-nails, implacable
Hillary, of the Rose Law Firm and Travelgate and Whitewater and the
Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   But when Tim Russert ran that tape of her from January 1998,
defending her husband on the ``Today'' program against charges of
sexual impropriety; and her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, hammered
away at  &UR; the issues &LR;  of ``character and trust''; and then he
marched over to her, demanding, like a Long Island Joe McCarthy,
that she sign a pledge saying she never again would spend soft
money, let's face it. The first lady was getting beaten up and
except for the entrenched Hillary-haters, more than a few viewers
probably felt a twinge of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't. That's politics. Clinton gets no more protection
than any other candidate, should and probably does not expect
special treatment as a woman or first lady, nor should voters take
umbrage when she takes her knocks. Campaigns get nasty. Indeed,
many times Wednesday night, Clinton let Lazio have it, accusing him
of ``chutzpah,'' and linking him time and again to Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But this had a different quality to it. This was harsh and
personal, this was wince-making, especially to hear her hesitate
and watch her look down at her hands and reach for words, repeating
``you know'' over and over again as she tried to answer Russert
about the ``Today'' program, saying ``Well, you know, Tim, that was
a very, a very painful time for me, for my family and for our
country.'' To his question about whether she would apologize for
misleading the country, she said she didn't know the truth about
her husband, which maybe was true, maybe was not.
</P>
<P>
   But you had to wish she would tell Russert: enough, it's none of
your business. Except candidates, especially women, cannot lose
their tempers with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   What does this all have to do with being a senator? With who won
this debate? Probably very little. But extraordinary things happen
in campaigns that reveal a great deal about this country and our
politics, and this was one of those moments.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder that the playing field is not level and that
there are unwritten rules for women in politics, still. Just as an
aggressive female politician will be labeled shrill and unappealing
while an aggressive man will be, well, manly and tough, a male
candidate can't be too harsh toward a female opponent because he
will come across as a bully. Same for the reporters. Russert was
doing his job and did it well. But his style made this viewer, and
surely others, cringe. Same for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Not fair, absolutely. Not fair. But that's how it is and that is
why, we predict, the Russert-Clinton moment, followed by the Lazio
paper-signing act, will be what most viewers take away from
Wednesday night's debate in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   As for the less-laden question of who won, who knows? We do know
that New Yorkers should feel pretty good about the debate. It
showed that they have two significant candidates with real
differences between them. A choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who had to prove Wednesday night that he wasn't New
York's Dan Quayle, held his own and then some, deflecting charges
that he was a puppet of the Republican leadership and staking out
positions on key issues. Clinton, who had to show she wasn't Lady
Macbeth, stuck to substance and was, if not relaxed and
comfortable, prepared and in command.
</P>
<P>
   They disagreed on health care, education and fiscal policy. He's
for vouchers, she isn't. He opposes casino gambling, she would
support it if the community wanted it. Both object to the teachers
strike in Buffalo, he more assertively than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They linked each other to other politicians: Clinton aligning
Lazio with Gingrich; Lazio blaming Clinton for some of President
Clinton's policies. And each played games with soft money. Lazio
pushed his pledge, Clinton said she'd tried to get a mutual soft
money ban early on, and of course both are raising and spending all
they can get.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio even tried to sound like the New York equivalent of a good
old boy, quoting _ that is, misquoting _ Casey Stengel. ``I've
delivered for New York,'' said the congressman. ``And as that old
Yankee manager, Casey Stengel, used to say, `You can check it
out.''' Actually, the line attributed to Casey Stengel is, ``You
could look it up.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour Wednesday night, New York was treated to a good
political debate. Standard politics. Except for what was not,
which, we suspect, is what we will remember.

   Athletes from North and South Korea will march into Sydney's
Olympic Stadium as one nation Friday, in what should prove one of
the emotional highlights of the Games' opening ceremony. Though the
two nations will compete separately, their decision to march
together under a single white flag with a blue depiction of an
undivided peninsula should be greeted as another significant step
toward reconciliation. The joint march will also be a tribute to
the Olympic aspiration that sports can break down barriers between
people.
</P>
<P>
   Koreans have experienced a perceptible thaw in relations ever
since the June meeting in Pyongyang between South Korea's
president, Kim Dae-jung, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il.
Wednesday, Kim Jong Il agreed to visit Seoul next spring. An
exchange of family visits last month that brought together
relatives who had not heard from each other in a half-century
transfixed South Korea and served as a reminder to the rest of the
world of the lingering tragedy that Korea's division represents.
More such family visits are planned, and South Korea has agreed to
import grain to provide to its hunger-stricken communist neighbor.
Both countries, still technically at war since their conflict ended
with a mere truce in 1953, have also agreed to rebuild the rail
link between them.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Olympics, South Korea is to play host, along with
Japan, to the other major global sporting event, soccer's 2002
World Cup. Organizers are already discussing the possibility of
holding one or two matches in reclusive North Korea. That would be
another valuable step toward reconciliation brought about by
sports.

FISHER COULD MISS ENTIRE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Already lacking in muscle and depth, the
Los Angeles Lakers are soon to face a deficit in heart and sweat as
well as they prepare to defend their NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, a spot starter and key reserve for the defending
NBA champions, is out for at least three months _ and potentially
the entire season _ because of a stress fracture in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers open training camp in three weeks and, at the moment,
retain just two healthy guards from their championship team _ Kobe
Bryant and 35-year-old Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a four-year veteran, injured the foot last season and
played in pain throughout the playoffs and the Finals. Yet the
6-foot-1 Fisher played a major role in stopping opponents' smaller
guards, from Portland's Damon Stoudamire to Indiana's Travis Best.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who has been working out with teammates at the Lakers'
training facility, probably aggravated the injury while playing
pickup games this summer, but a Lakers spokesman said the team does
not know all the details yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although not among the Lakers' top scorers, Fisher is a
hard-nosed defender, unselfish playmaker and one of the
hardest-working members of the team. He has earned minutes and
popularity with his frequent dives across the court and into the
seats to save loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   Without Fisher, the Lakers will be even more reliant on the
recently acquired and tempestuous Isaiah Rider. They also are
likely to increase efforts to re-sign free agent Brian Shaw. But if
the season opened today, the Lakers' fourth guard would be
little-used Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher received the diagnosis Tuesday from team orthopedist Dr.
Stephen Lombardo and was given two options: rest and therapy, with
the hope of returning in three months, or surgery, which would
knock him out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher flew to his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. on Wednesday to
get a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and coach Phil Jackson were
unavailable for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Fisher played in 78 games, averaging a career-high
6.3 points in 23.1 minutes per game. He averaged 6.0 points and 3.8
assists during the Finals.

POLITICAL HOT POTATO RECEIVED AND LET GO BY GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (INSERTS grafs 8-14 with quotes from press conference with Bush's
spokeswoman)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A close adviser to Vice President Al Gore said he
had received an anonymously mailed package on Wednesday that
involved material designed to prepare Gov. George W. Bush for his
debates with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser, former Rep. Tom Downey of New York, said he
examined the materials briefly before giving them to his lawyer,
who turned them over to the FBI on Wednesday afternoon. Downey, who
has been helping Gore prepare for the Bush debates and was standing
in for Bush in mock debates, also said he would recuse himself from
any further debate preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns are to meet on Thursday to negotiate
the debate schedule. If the candidates adhere to a plan set up by a
bipartisan commission, the first debate will be on Oct. 3 in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said they did not know if the materials sent
to Downey had been stolen from the Bush campaign or were meant to
trap the Gore adviser in some sort of dirty trick. Downey's lawyer,
Marc Miller, said the material _ a videotape and a sheaf of papers
_ arrived in an envelope postmarked Austin, Texas, where the Bush
campaign has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was eager to dissociate itself quickly from
the incident. After Miller called the FBI, campaign officials
alerted The Associated Press that the packet had arrived and
provided a detailed time line of Downey's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore, said of Downey: ``He's being
very careful and very prudent. He's handled this exactly right. No
one can raise any questions about how it's being handled. What to
make of it, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ``We
don't know what the Gore campaign claims to have in their
possession, but we take it very seriously. We have asked our
attorneys to review it to try to determine what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu news conference Wednesday in Westminster,
Calif., the chief spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, Karen Hughes,
said that his campaign had not yet determined whether the materials
Downey received were legitimate, but that she was not aware of any
missing materials like the videotape or briefing papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that the campaign had asked the FBI for permission
to review the materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking this seriously,'' Hughes said. ``We think the
first step is to find out what the materials are, and if in fact
they are legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Bush and a small group senior advisers had begun
debate preparations last May. She said that while the earliest
sessions were not videotaped, some later ones were. She said that
only Bush and a few senior advisers _ including herself; the
campaign's manager, Joe Allbaugh; Karl Rove, the campaign's chief
strategist; Donald L. Evans, the campaign's chairman, and Mark
McKinnon, the chief media adviser _ had legitimate access to the
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hughes said that William M. Daley of the Gore campaign had
called Evans Wednesday to tell him that they had received the
materials. ``He was fairly vague about what materials,'' she said.
Asked whether the Gore campaign had handled the situation well, she
said she had so few details that it was impossible to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was right for them to send them over to
authorities,'' she said of the videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the materials, she stressed: ``We have not seen it and we
really have not had a very detailed description at all given to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Gore campaign was eager to get the story out in a
hurry was a fear that Gore's current political momentum might
suffer from a perception of any improperly gained advantage. Ronald
Reagan's presidential campaign was criticized in 1980 after it
obtained secret briefing papers on the debate strategy of President
Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers, made public in 1983, revealed that Carter planned
to expose Reagan's ``flip-flops'' on various issues when the two
debated on Oct. 28, 1980. Reagan aides said that the information
was mostly conventional wisdom, and Reagan himself said that the
material had simply saved his team the trouble of ``having to go
out and dig up'' widely known information. But Carter aides said
that it had given Reagan a significant advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when the package arrived at Downey's office, he
happened to be preparing debate materials for Gore. ``It looked
like our debate material,'' Downey said.
</P>
<P>
   Downey said he watched 60 to 90 seconds of the video, and saw
Bush and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who is playing Gore in
the mock debates, and another person he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it, and I said, `I shouldn't have this and
shouldn't be looking at this,''' he said. ``I knew that it was
serious stuff. I know what ours looks like.''

ECO-CHALLENGE RACERS FELLED BY BACTERIAL DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By ALICIA AULT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Participants in the Eco-Challenge expedition race in Malaysian
Borneo that ended Sept. 1 got more than they bargained for, the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.
The CDC said that at least 30 of the 155 Americans who participated
in the event have come down with a bacterial infection,
leptospirosis, and many have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC is investigating how the racers got the infection, which
causes severe fever, headache, chills, muscle pain and cramps. If
untreated, it can lead to kidney and liver failure or meningitis.
Because the infection is hard to diagnose and potentially deadly,
the CDC is urging athletes with symptoms to consult with their
doctors and discuss taking doxycycline, an antibiotic that
eradicates the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Even if someone feels all right, the CDC is still recommending a
doctor's visit to discuss taking doxycycline preventively, said Dr.
Nancy Rosenstein of the CDC's National Center for Infectious
Diseases. Leptospirosis can incubate from a few days to a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has been notified in an effort to
reach all 304 participants. In all, 76 four-person teams from 22
countries paid $12,500 to enter the Eco-Challenge, plus thousands
more on equipment and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Leptospirosis is contracted by coming into contact with or
swallowing water contaminated with animal urine. It is especially
easy to get when someone has open cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12-day Eco-Challenge, racers sailed on open ocean, and
then mountain biked and slogged through torrential jungle rain and
mud while being assaulted by voracious leeches. After that, they
swam and canoed in a storm-swollen river, then waded through caves
filled with bat guano. It is unclear whether the bacteria was in
the river or the bat caves.
</P>
<P>
   The first racer felled was a 40-year-old New Yorker, Vadim
Khazatsky, who participated as part of Team RacingThePlanet.com.
Khazatsky, a managing director at Salomon Smith Barney, said he got
a high fever a week into the race.
</P>
<P>
   The on-site medical staff gave him intravenous fluids and
transferred him on a 10-hour bus ride to a hospital. When
Khazatsky's 104-degree fever did not respond to initial treatment,
doctors gave him a trio of high-dose antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me this carpet-bombing,'' Khazatsky said. He was
still weak upon his return to New York and consulted his physician,
Dr. Bradley Connor. Connor, medical director of the New York Center
for Travel and Tropical Medicine, posted his case online in
GeoSentinel, a database maintained by travel medicine specialists.
Colleagues from London and Toronto reported similar illnesses in
Eco-Challenge racers. Connor called the CDC on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Cooper of West Hills, Calif., who raced on Team Oobe,
spent four days at UCLA Medical Center. ``I had a headache so bad I
just wanted someone to shoot me,'' said Cooper, a breast cancer
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper does not blame race officials for the outbreak. ``I'm not
that quick to judge and point fingers, because we all go into these
things knowing the risks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cooper is looking forward to her next race, in New
Zealand in November, she said she would not do another jungle
event. In 1994, a New Zealand athlete spent 10 days in intensive
care after an adventure race through Borneo with circulatory
collapse and kidney failure because of leptospirosis. Last year, a
number of racers got leptospirosis after a Philippines adventure
race.

KONRAD KUJAU, 62, `HITLER DIARIES' SWINDLER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Konrad Kujau, a raffish German swindler who sold 60 volumes of
forged ``Hitler diaries'' to a German magazine for $4.8 million,
died Sept. 12 in a hospital in Stuttgart, Germany. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was stomach cancer, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   Kujau's bogus handiwork, described as private journals written
by the Fuehrer, was published by Stern, the weekly, in 1983. The
first excerpts appeared in Stern and in a British newspaper, The
Sunday Times, which bought them from Stern. Hugh Trevor-Roper, the
British historian, had read the material before The Times began to
publish it, in English.
</P>
<P>
   But their authenticity was quickly challenged. On the day after
The Times printed the first excerpt, Trevor-Roper acknowledged that
he had ``misunderstood the nature of their procurement.'' He said
he had come to have doubts that they were authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the diaries were definitively found to be fakes.
Authorities on Hitler-era documents who were on the staff of the
federal German archives declared that the ``diaries'' were made
with postwar ink, paper, glue and even binding.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1983, the West German government declared that chemical
testing had shown that without doubt the ``diaries'' were fake. The
director of the archives, Hans Booms, said much of the content had
seemingly been lifted from a book, ``Hitler: Speeches and
Proclamations _ 1932-1945,'' that Max Domarus compiled and
published privately in the early 1960s. Booms said mistakes in the
book also appeared in the ``diaries,'' which he called a
``grotesque, superficial forgery.'' He insinuated that they had
originated with Nazi sympathizers or Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Also in May 1983, a West German journalist who had brought the
``diaries'' to light reported that he had obtained them from a
dealer of Nazi memorabilia in Stuttgart. The dealer was said to
have done the forging and he was said to have called himself Konrad
Kujau. By then, he had disappeared from Stuttgart. Kujau was later
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   People who had dealings with the journalist said the dealer,
using the name Konrad Fischer, asserted that the ``diaries'' had
been smuggled out of East Germany by an East German officer who was
his brother
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the regional court in Hamburg found Kujau guilty of
fraud. He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, but was
released a year and a half early.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Kujau got into more _ but lesser _ trouble. Late
last year, he was charged a hefty fine by a Stuttgart court because
a number of falsified driving licenses were found in his apartment
in a police raid. In the same period, he was also fined for having
fired a semiautomatic weapon in a Stuttgart pub and was accused of
keeping seven unregistered weapons in his house in
Bietigheim-Bissingen in southwestern Germany. The judge in the
weapons case in Stuttgart, Ulf Petzold, said to him, ``You are very
apparently a man who is attracted by that which is illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kujau was born in eastern Germany, studied art for a time in
Dresden in East Germany in the late 1950s and moved to what was
then West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife and a son.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Kujau also became somewhat respectable in his later
years. In 1996, he was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of
Stuttgart. And this year he was selling what he called Old Master
paintings, but was advertising them as fakes.

   Wicks was the organizer and chief proponent of the school, which
grew out of playground chatter with other neighborhood mothers and
now enrolls about 500 children in kindergarten through eighth grade
on West 93rd Street.

   While there has been a long history of alternative public
schools in Manhattan, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the
city, most were founded by groups of teachers, administrators or
civic groups. The Manhattan School is one of a tiny group of
schools founded by parents, and Wicks was widely recognized as
zealous, canny and willing to pull strings to make the school
possible.

   The school, founded in 1992, was born in part out of
frustration. As Wicks' children approached school age, she visited
her neighborhood school, at the time suffering from low test
scores, demoralized teachers and leaky walls. The principal told
her that as a parent, she should not expect to play a role in
improving the school, her husband recalled. ``To Lucy, that simply
wasn't acceptable,'' Arshack said.

   The school Wicks conceived was small and intimate, with only two
classes per grade. It now attracts dozens of applicants for each
vacancy. Unlike many other public and private schools, it invites
parents to share in every aspect of the school day, from leading
reading groups to cleaning up after lunch to simply sitting and
watching.

   In 1996, Wicks won a seat on the local school board. She was
director of the HIV Mental Health Clinic of Columbia-Presbyterian
Hospital.

   Wicks was born in Manhattan and grew up in Franklin Lakes, N.J.
She graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. She
worked as an artist, making tapestries, quilts and oil paintings,
before earning her doctorate in clinical psychology at the New
School in Manhattan. She was a student of the Sufi branch of Islam.

   Besides her husband, she is survived by her children, Adam, 12,
and Eliza, 10; her father, Zeno W. Wicks of Louisville, Ky.; three
brothers, Zeno Wicks of Brookings, S.D., David Wicks of Louisville
and Douglas Wicks of Pittsburgh; and two sisters, Kayo Wicks of
Louisville and Robin Wicks of Mogadore, Ohio.
