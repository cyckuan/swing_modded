<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Lesotho King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and Lesotho King Letsie III Tuesday appealed to
anti-government protesters camped inside the royal palace to
return home, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made after a 90-minute meeting between the two
heads of state in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the protesters at the palace has raised
questions about the king's impartiality in Lesotho's political
battle. Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili last Tuesday
accused the king of siding with the opposition parties, saying
the king was "part of the problem."
</P>
<P>
The protesters, supporters of Lesotho's opposition parties who
claim the May 23 elections were rigged, have sought refuge at the
palace for nearly two months, saying they fear for their safety.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would make a statement assuring the protesters
that they would be safe when they left the palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the palace protesters was an important part of
the discussions between Mandela and the king.
</P>
<P>
Mandela questioned whether South Africa should be expected to
help rebuild Lesotho's economy when it was the Basotho people
themselves who were responsible for destroying their capital.
</P>
<P>
He said his government had yet to receive a formal request to
help rebuild the kingdom's economy, which was devastated in
unrest following military intervention by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
He expected the subject to be raised at Friday's peace talks
between the rival parties brokered by mediators from Botswana,
South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would listen sympathetically to
such a request, but its response would depend on whether "we can
afford the resources that are required in order to repair the
damage that has been done."
</P>
<P>
"SADC went there in the spirit of peace and those are things
that have to be considered: whether the Basotho can actually
start destroying their capital and expect us to be responsible
for that damage," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC intervention force, made up of South African and
Botswanan soldiers had gone to Lesotho in peace.
</P>
<P>
"They were shot at. The firing did not start from SADC,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the SADC troops would withdraw from Lesotho in due
course.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the resources to keep our forces there
indefinitely. We want a speedy resolution to save our scarce
resources for things that are essential for bettering the lives
of our people."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A ninth South African
soldier doing peace-keeping duty in Lesotho died when an armored
vehicle overturned Sunday, the South African National Defense
Force (SANDF) announced in Pretoria Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
Eight South African soldiers were killed and 17 injured last
week in clashes between mutinous Lesotho soldiers and a Southern
African Development Community (SADC) task force from South Africa

</P>
<P>
The SADC force entered Lesotho Last Tuesday to help restore
order in the kingdom after protests over the May 23 general
elections caused anarchy in the capital of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Machine said more than 100 tons of weapons and ammunition had
been retrieved from Lesotho military bases by Tuesday morning.
</P>

<P>
"The task force will process these soldiers before handing
them over to the Lesotho Defense Force, where they will either be

WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The policy-makers of the

The meeting's decision is expected to be announced at around

KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri

said a press release from the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The press release, however, did not say what are high on his

enhancing EU-SAARC cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Rwandan Army Officers Allegedly Join Kabila's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Rwandan army (ex-FAR)
senior officers who were staying in Congo Brazzaville (B) have
crossed into Kinshasa to assist Congolese (K) President Laurent
Kabila, Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among those who left Congo (B) and have now established their
headquarters in Kinshasa is Major General Augustin Bizimungu, the
report quoted a well-informed source as claiming.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Bizimungu was formerly the overall
commander of ex-FAR operations in Rwanda during the 1994
genocide, and later fought to defend late dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko against Kabila, but now he has changed side to join Kabila
in fighting the Tutsi-led rebels in Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Kinshasa have also revealed that Kabila
recently obtained from Chadian president Idriss Deby 2,000
fighters who were air-lifted to Congo (K) with the help of Libyan
President Muammar al-Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had talked of the presence of up to 10,000 Sudanese
troops near Kindu to defend the town against attacks from
Congolese rebels. But Sudan has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also claimed that up to 3,000 fighters of ex-FAR
have been deployed in the south of Congo (K) and that a good
number of them were captured in the third city Kisangani, and
near Kindu.
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows how many Rwandan former soldiers have crossed
into Congo (K). But humanitarian sources in Congo (B) have
affirmed that people at camps of Rwandan refugees in Congo (B),
notably Rukolela and Oyo have been leaving for Congo (K) to fight
for embattled Kabila, according to the RNA report.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
announced last Friday that a mass exodus of Rwandan Hutu refugees
were leaving camps in Congo (B) to join Kabila's ranks.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR spokeswoman, Judith Kumin, had expressed concern
that the movement of refugees was going to "add oil to the fire."
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian sources said about 11,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees,
including defeated ex-FAR soldiers and the "Interahamwe" militia
were sheltered in refugee camps in Congo (B).
</P>
<P>
Some people, however, view the flight of ex-FAR soldiers to
fight for Kabila as a blessing for President Sassou Nguessou who
is keen in getting rid of these forces the international
community blames for the Genocide of half a million of Tutsis and
moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994, said the RNA report.
</P>
<P>
But President Kabila's chief of staff, Abdoulaye Yerodiya,
have denied the involvement of ex-FAR soldiers from camps in
Congo (B), Central African Republic (CAR), Gabon, and the Sudan
in the fight.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in Goma, a town of eastern Congo (K), have also
charged that the CAR dispatched 2,000 troops to fight on Kabila's
side in Kinshasa, but this has not been confirmed by Bangui.
</P>
<P>
They also claimed that ex-FAR soldiers estimated at 1,000 also
left Bouca, 350 km north of Bangui, were assisted by CAR
government to cross into Sudan where they are undergoing training
in preparation for joining Kabila's forces.
</P>
<P>
Military observers in Rwanda, however, wondered how President
Kabila will manage to co-ordinate these forces that he has
mobilized to crush the rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Missing of Ugandan Officers in Congo (K) Denied </HEADLINE>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Defense Ministry
Tuesday refuted a Monitor report that a planeful of top Ugandan
officers was missing in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
dismissing it as "sensational and false."
</P>
<P>
The Monitor newspaper reported Tuesday that a well-placed
military source said a plane carrying senior army officers was
missing in eastern Congo (K) and that President Yoweri Museveni's
brother Salim Saleh called the paper and commented on the report.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma in a statement called
the report "not only sensational, alarmist but also completely
false."
</P>
<P>
Kavuma also refuted the allegations that Brigadier James
Kazini has been instructed to trace the plane, saying that Major
General Saleh did not talk to any Monitor reporter about that
issue as reported.
</P>
<P>
The state minister called on Monitor to desist from doing
propaganda for the enemies of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor paper also claimed that the plane carried some
officials of the rebel alliance that is fighting to oust

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Extended, Broadened Ceasefire in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The three-month
ceasefire between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Peoples'
Liberation Movement must be extended in time and broadened in
scope, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said the ceasefire,
which will expire on October 15, must be extended to a six-month one
and to include the regions outside of Bahr el Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
"A prolonged ceasefire must include all areas of southern Sudan
and be seen as a step towards a permanent political settlement, so
that the civilian population can escape a continuation of the
famine and war related carnage that have ravaged their lives, "
said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire opened a window of opportunity, enabling the
humanitarian community to address the acute crises in southern
Sudan," she added.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF also called on all parties, and on the international
community, to work urgently during the coming weeks to extend
peace and stability throughout the country.

<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The British Airways has
signed an agreement with the Nigeria Airways to resume flights
between London and Lagos, the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, approved by both the Nigerian and British
authorities, British Airways Boeing 747s will fly between London
and Lagos three times a week from November, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The British government banned Nigeria Airways flights to
London in May last year on the grounds of poor standards. Nigeria
responded by banning British flights.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes a week after Nigerian new leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar visited London, where prime minister
Tony Blair promised to support easing of European Union sanctions
against Nigeria and help Nigeria rejoin the Commonwealth.

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Urges Efficient Education, Strong Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, England, September 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday took the chance of the Labor Party
Conference to urge a more efficient education and strong family in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the conference held in Blackpool in
northwest England, Blair said since Labor took power in May of
last year, a lot of changes have taken place.
</P>
<P>
"This September, 100,000 more children aged five, six and seven
are in classes under thirty, under this Labor Government," he
said, adding 500,000 more young people over three years to go into
higher and further education with extra 19 billion pounds (32
billion U.S dollars) to be poured into the field.
</P>
<P>
But he said that was not enough. "When later this year we
propose the most fundamental reform of the teaching profession
since state education began, where there will be increased rewards
but tied to higher performance, help us get it through."
</P>
<P>
He said if head teachers failed to run a school properly, they
should quit or be sacked.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged his people to accept that a strong family
life is the basic unit of a strong community, for "strong
families mean strong Britain."
</P>
<P>
"The family is central to our vision of a modern Britain built
on the kinds of rights and responsibilities that we learn in the
home."
</P>
<P>
He added the first ever Government Paper on the Family will be
published next month, in which ideas to give practical support to
parents and children and help in dealing with poverty will be put
forward.
</P>
<P>
With these plans, he hoped that the younger generation can
"grow up in a country of which they feel proud" and a country
"every school is a good school, and every child able to fulfill
their potential."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Asia Nations to Take Concerted Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
urged East Asian countries to lower interest rates and increase
spending to stimulate economic growth in the region to help get
rid of unprecedented recession.
</P>
<P>
East Asia has everything it needs to restore economic growth so
long as it keeps faith with economic reforms and protects the poor
during the long and difficulty recovery, according to a new World
Bank report "East Asia: the Road to Recovery" released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said interest rates in crisis economies should be
allowed to fall further to spur growth, and said a 10 billion U.S.
dollar "concerted fiscal stimulus" by Asian states would have a
"profound" positive impact on the region's prospects.
</P>
<P>
"The task ahead is enormous," the World Bank Vice-President for
East Asia and the Pacific Jean-Michel Severino noted at the press
briefing for the release of the 138-page report. "But economic
growth must resume as soon as possible if the poor and vulnerable
are to be spared from disaster."

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Reiterates Intention to Retire from Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president
Kenneth Kaunda reiterated Tuesday his intention to retire from
party politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 74, made the statement here following local mass media
reports that he will continue to lead his opposition United
National Independent Party (UNIP) until some time next year.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said that just as he announced last June he will
continue to work to detach himself from party politics.
</P>
<P>
The former president said he will not change mind despite the
calls by several of his party members to remain in active
politics.
</P>
<P>
Most of UNIP members fear that the party will split if Kaunda
leaves the leadership, thereby weakening and making it an
uneffective opposition to the government.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who had been the country's president since its
independence in 1964 until 1991 when he was defeated by current
President Frederick Chiluba in general elections, said that UNIP
National Council is the body to have the mandate to approve his
retirement while the national congress should immediately follow
this to choose a new party leader.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of funds, Kaunda's party has been failing to fix a
concrete date for a meeting of the National Council to ratify his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
On speculations that he has not written to the party central
committee to indicate his intention to retire, Kaunda said this
is not the case as the supreme decision-making organ of the party
is aware of his intentions.
</P>
<P>
Four days after his release from under house arrest on June 1
this year, Kaunda announced that he would quit party politics so
that he could serve the nation and the continent on a wider
scope.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was detained on December 25 last year for his alleged
involvement in the coup attempt of last October 28.
</P>
<P>
Six days after the arrest he was put under house arrest and in
February this year he was formally charged with misprision of
treason.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Blames Italy over PKK Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday blamed Italy
for permitting the "Kurdish Parliament in Exile," outlawed in
Turkey, to hold a two-day meeting at the Italian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a written statement that Italy's
permission for the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) to convene
the meeting means that "Turkey's peace, stability and territorial
integrity are ignored."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that Turkey called on Italy to deal with
the issue with sensitivity, saying that "we had expected Italian
officials to prevent the developments which could harm bilateral
relations."
</P>
<P>
This event will cause wounds in Turkish-Italian ties which are
difficult to be cured, it said, adding that "Italian officials
have the obligations to prevent the activities of a terrorist
organization in their country as this organization targets the
territorial integrity of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that several Italian deputies seem
to be in an alliance with the group. The Italian administrators
are not pleased with the situation, but they could not exert
effective efforts to prevent the developments, it added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the "Kurdish Parliament in Exile" will hold a
meeting on "making Kurdish and Turkish people come closer to each
other" at the Italian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that several Italian deputies had met with PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan in Syria a short time ago. However, no
details of the meeting between Italian deputies and Ocalan are
available.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem have sent letters to their Italian counterparts,
urging Italy to prevent the developments.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Foreign Ministry summoned the Italian ambassador
to Turkey and gave a note on the developments at the Italian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old war against Turkish
government for autonomy in the southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK leadership unilaterally declared a ceasefire late last
month, but Ankara rejected the offer, saying that it would never
negotiate with the militant group.

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts Attempts to Hamper Its Role in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin on Tuesday expressed regret over
attempts "to limit Russia's involvement in considering military
and political problems of the Balkan region."
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin's statement came after defense ministers of several
Southeast European countries, the United States and other NATO
countries and representatives of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, NATO and the Western European Union met in
the Macedonian town of Skopje and agreed to establish
international peacekeeping forces in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting "Russia reminded the organizers that it
wanted to attend," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the reply from the Macedonian side was negative,
regardless of their excuses," the Interfax quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposed peacekeeping forces will include servicemen from
some countries of the region and Italy. Slovenia and the United
States will act as observers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The selective approach" in choosing the composition of the
force "reveals a course for forming sub-regional structures fully
bonded to certain non-regional organizations and countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin expressed regret that "some countries of the region,
in striving to join NATO, are following the tendency of drawing
new division lines in the southeast of the continent and in
Europe's single security space as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Such actions "demonstrate insincerity and a double standard on
the part of the participants," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Palestine, Israel Narrow Gaps on Land Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said on Tuesday after meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton that he has accepted a latest proposal under which Israel
would turn over another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters that he hopes a West Bank agreement can
be concluded in October when a summit takes place in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest proposal, three percent of the land that
Israel yields back would be turned into a nature reserve under
joint Israeli-Palestinian security oversight.
</P>
<P>
"I said we had accepted it," Arafat said, stressing the
security arrangement will be jointly provided.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met Arafat after a three-way meeting attended also by
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, after an 18-month deadlock, is
reviving with the new efforts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton was prepared to
become directly involved in the mid-October summit with Arafat and
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president is determined to see an agreement arise
from this exercise," McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Early on Monday morning, Arafat and Netanyahu met in New York
under the auspices of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
the first one-one-one meeting they had in a year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has directed Albright and special envoy Dennis Ross to
the region to prepare for the Israel-Palestine summit, which is to
be held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we all agree that we have made progress on the
path to peace," Clinton said during a photo opportunity with
Netanyahu and Arafat standing beside him in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a significant narrowing of the gaps between the
two parties across a wide range of issues that were in the
American initiative we've been working on for months," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton noted that "there is still a substantial
amount of work to be done until a comprehensive agreement can be
reached."
</P>
<P>
After Monday's meeting of the three leaders, Clinton also met
privately with Netanyahu while Arafat returned to New York to
address the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew back on Tuesday morning to the White House and held
a meeting for more than one hour with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been in an impasse because
the Israelis disagreed on a U.S. proposal that Israeli troops
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, claiming it created too
much security risk for Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Pledges Support for Press Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani Tuesday pledged
to continue his support for press freedom in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I said that we will not back down from our principle of
defending legitimate freedoms," Mohajerani said emerging from a
closed-door session of the conservative Majlis (Parliament) in
which he was asked to answer questions about the press.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Article 29 of the Constitution granted
freedom to the press, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his overall approval of the state of the press in
the country, the minister said that any problem involves only less
than 1 percent of the press corps.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani's words came in response to criticism by Majlis
conservatives who accused several Iranian dailies and weeklies of
insulting the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini in
their articles.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his ministry will defend the whole press and
will continue the policies announced before.
</P>
<P>
"While trusting the whole ensemble of the publications, we
allow a role for the monitoring committee to deal with any
violations. The committee, having such an important role, should
be strengthened more than before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent ban on the pro-liberal daily Tous,
Mohajerani said that Tous had before received several warnings
about its published material and the warnings were issued with the
intention of "avoiding a deadlock and having to ban the paper."
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I myself arrived at the conclusion that Tous and
its predecessor Jame'e (Society) are part of some political
movement. My impression was that the management wanted to revive
certain personalities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani said that "a group with certain agenda was using a
media facility, for example in the interview (by Tous) with
(former French President) Giscard d'Estaing, the terms used
insinuated that the administration is in a face off with the
system."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he has sensed an inclination on part of
some Majlis deputies, but not the majority, for his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"I will not change my mind, if I am impeached, my speech would
be the same as I said on August 20, 1997 when the Majlis gave vote
of confidence to me," he said.
</P>
<P>
On some conservatives' proposals to amend the press law,
Mohajerani said that the law does not need any major changes,
"it's rather the ambiguities which have to be addressed."

<HEADLINE> Russia Stock Market Capitalization Down 90 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of Russia's most
liquid stocks plunged some 90 percent this year, the Interfax news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Capitalization of the 100 most liquid stocks included on the
RTS-Interfax composite index has dipped to 11.175 billion U.S.
dollars on September 29 from 103.356 billion dollars on January 5,
Interfax said, quoting experts with its Center for Economic
Analysis.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Russian Trading System (RTS),
prices for the most liquid shares, which account for
three-quarters of overall RTS volume, have tumbled by 10 to 15
times since the beginning of the year to where they were in
1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
In the six weeks since August 17, when the government of Sergei
Kiriyenko effectively devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of
its domestic and foreign debts, the value of the stock market
tumbled by 2.4 times to 11.175 billion dollars from 27.0 billion
dollars on August 14.
</P>
<P>
Common shares in Unified Energy Systems of Russia went down by
more than 16 times since the beginning of the year to 0.0195
dollar from 0.3165 dollar. Oil giant Lukoil dropped eight fold to
3.06 dollars from 23.85 dollars a share. Power utility Mosenergo
fell by almost 14 times to 0.01 dollar from 0.1369 dollar.
</P>
<P>
Given the uncertainty over the new government's financial and
economic policies, as well as a lack of cash, analysts say, many
investment firms have cut stock trading to a minimum or halted
operations altogether.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter alone, about 100 firms said they wanted to
withdraw their membership in the RTS, which now has some 530
members, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Many of Those remained have stopped trading and are only
watching the market, RTS president Dimitry Ponomarev said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has set up a task force to grapple with the impending
problem of "the millennium bug" which might affect computer
worldwide at the start of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Communications and Transport
confirmed Tuesday of its existence, saying that the task force
has started working for the aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
The task force, under the umbrella of the National Year 2000
Kilo-ohms (Y2K) program, is operating with technological and
financial assitance from Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The Y2K took off with the aviation sector because it is one
of the most sensitive areas that cannot afford to be bitten by
the millenium bug," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said technicians will inspect all aviation centers, whose
computers are vulnerable to the attack of the millenium bug.
</P>
<P>
The official also named the Tanzania National Electric Supply
Company, the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited and
national financial institutions as areas sensitive to the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The task force's main objective is to assess technology in
existence and try to find a solution or alternate means to be
applied should the bug strike sensitive areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Director General of the Tanzania Communications
Commission, Abihudi Nalingigwa, said although the that Tanzanians
seemed to be less concerned with the imminent technological
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Nalingigwa said the commission has felt the pinch of the
problem and started to deal with it in the aviation sector.

<HEADLINE> Blair Determined to Stick to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, England, September 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister said here on Tuesday he was determined to stick to the
reform on welfare, education and health system without backing
down.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the delegates at the annual Labor Party
Conference, Blair said although the Labor government has made
remarkable progress in the past year, there are many challenges
ahead and they should not back down.
</P>
<P>
"There will be attacks to the left of you, attacks to the right
of you, attacks from behind and in front," he said, but "success
in life never comes without a struggle."
</P>
<P>
He said the government would rather be popular than unpopular,
"but better to be unpopular than wrong."
</P>
<P>
"You can't say you want more people at university but oppose
reform of student finance, and you can't say you want 40 billion
pounds of extra spending on schools and hospital and not defend
the two tough years that made it possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister conceded that the welfare system had failed
to help those who need it with billions of pounds being wasted and
so it needed change.
</P>
<P>
"So when we bring forward proposals for change in our welfare
reform bill in the coming Queen's Speech, don't tell us it is a
betrayal of the welfare state when in truth welfare reform is its
only salvation."
</P>
<P>
"Strength comes not from saying our constitution is perfect
when the people know that it needs reform. Strength will come from
reform. From facing up to its challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the keynote speech, Blair also announced an agreement
between police, car manufacturers and government on a target to
cut car crime by 30 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
He boasted that it was "one of the boldest partnerships in
fighting crime this country has seen, and done under a Labor
government."
</P>
<P>
He urged the police to use the powers and bring down crimes
rates. "Don't show zero imagination. Help us to have zero
tolerance of crime."

MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday denied as "brazen lie" a report that some Taliban fighters
are being held prisoner in the Central Asian republic bordering
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, the
ministry said the report, by a Pakistani newspaper, of the
transfer to Tajikistan of more than 80 Taliban soldiers, among
them three Arabs and two Pakistanis, "is a brazen lie aimed at
fanning tensions over Afghanistan and depicting Tajikistan as
supporter of someone's interests in the alignment of political
forces in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Tajikistan has stated at various levels that
it will continue to advocate noninterference in Afghanistan's
internal affairs and to support peaceful settlement of the armed
conflict between Afghanistan's warring parties," the Interfax
quoted the statement as saying.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY) on Tuesday described "direct and unconditional
dialogue as the only way of solving any outstanding political
issue" in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Zivadin Jovanovic, foreign minister of the FRY, told a press
conference that "there is no other way" to solve the any
outstanding issue in Kosovo, where "the reality is terrorism based
on separatism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any threat of pressure or any plan of military nature can not
help solving issues not only in that part of Serbia, but in any
part of the Southeast Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue must be held "to secure equality of all citizens
regardless of their nationality or faith, to ensure equality of
all ethnic national minority or national communities in Kosovo, to
ensure the highest European and international standards concerning
humans and national minority rights, to fully respect the
principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and
Yugoslavia," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The FRY Government has been seeking all the time to have
dialogue with other parties concerned to find a political solution
to Kosovo issue, but "there is no response" to the Government's
dialogue appeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any ideas to promise air support for terrorists and separatists
in Kosovo do not "help good causes" in the area, but "really do
help and encourage those who claimed illegitimate objectives, such
as separation by force," he said.
</P>
<P>
To support that ideas would amoumt to threatening the FRY
Government, the sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They support terrorists and separatists from which principle?"
the foreign minister asked, but he declined to identify the
source of such a kind of support.
</P>
<P>
"The question remains how the international community can help
in this legitimate endeavors like dialogue, how the international
community and certain organs, including the Security Council, can
promote peaceful dialogue and democratic solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister blamed that the world can not be exposed
to "complete and correct information on the situation of Kosovo,
although there are about 400 foreign journalists" in Kosovo, a
southernmost province in Serbia, the FRY.
</P>
<P>
On a recent Security Council resolution based on the Chapter
VII of the U.N. Charter, the foreign minister asked, "Is this
Chapter VII applied to European countries from which armament,
finance, training comes for terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the resolution failed to include the role of
neighboring Albania, he said, Albania "has been beyond any doubt
for financing, training and arming terrorists on the territory
of another sovereign country."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has an area of 10,000 square kilometers and a population
of 2 million. The ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
province's population, seek independence from the FRY.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM: Assad Holds Key to Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz said Tuesday that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
himself holds the key to Lebanon's presidential election due next
month.
</P>
<P>
"President Assad, who has been authorized by Lebanon's troika
members to choose the country's next president, is himself
holding the final key for the polls," he said in an interview with
the country's National Broadcast Network radio.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has special relations with Lebanon and some 40,000
troops there, is considered by western countries as the undisputed
power broker and king-maker in the country.
</P>
<P>
With Assad's strong backing, the incumbent President Elias
Hrawi came to power in 1989, on the eve of the end of the
country's 15-year-old sectarian civil war. In 1995, the parliament
voted a one-time constitutional amendment allowing him to stay for
an additional 3-year term.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Christian Maronite president will end his
nine-year tenure at midnight October 23-24, when a new president
should be chosen by the 128 members of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new president should still come from Hrawi's religious
community in line with Lebanon's Taif agreement, which ended the
civil war and put in place a power-sharing system among
Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulated that the top authority posts should
be shared equally among Muslims and Christians. So the prime
minister always come from the Sunnis and house speaker the
Shiites.
</P>
<P>
With less than one month to go, the country's several
prestigious politicians have emerged as candidates for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
But local reports said their chances in the race are slimmer
than that of the current army commander General Emile Lahoud, who
leads public opinion polls and has the backing of an overwhelming
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
There is a general conviction among Lebanon's parliament
members that Lahoud, a close Syrian ally who has succeeded in
rebuilding the country's army into a cohesive fighting machine
after its tragic disintegration during the civil war, will be a
reform-minded leader, if elected, to introduce drastic changes
into political life.
</P>
<P>
But his election will be achieved only after the parliament
introduces constitutional amendment allowing him to run for the
race.
</P>
<P>
Article 49 of the Constitution stipulates that grade-one state
employees wishing to run for the presidency should quit their
posts two years in advance of the vote.
</P>
<P>
But the demand for a constitutional amendment should be
submitted by the sitting president some analysts said is also
awaiting hint from Assad.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that a long-awaited Hrawi-Assad summit will be
held within a few days to finalized the election process.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Diagnostic Center to Open in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will open first
HIV/AIDS diagnostic center for the anonymous and volunteer people
on October 1, a Mozambican health official announced here

<P>
The center will serve as an important tool in fighting against
AIDS and helping the Mozambicans understand the killing disease,
Barreto said.
</P>
<P>
According to the health official, estimatedly more than one
million Mozambicans are HIV-infected, but only 8,000 HIV cases

<HEADLINE> Iraq Consulting Security Council on Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz has started a process of consultations with
members of the U.N. Security Council on how to solve the
differences on arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During an hour-long meeting between Aziz and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday, the two discussed the
seven-week long standoff between the U.N. inspectors and Iraq and
the U.N. chief's proposal to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
The two also touched on Annan's ideas for a comprehensive
review of the Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions which
requested Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters after the meeting that Iraq was prepared to
cooperate fully with Annan in good faith and in a professional and
objective manner in solving the standoff.
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted that the Security Council make the
comprehensive review first.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has complied with resolutions of the Security Council for
seven years and a half, and the Security Council has not taken
steps to reduce or lift the sanctions against Iraq according to
its own resolution," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Annan's position in the meeting, Eckhard said that
"he made it very clear that the council expects Iraq to come back
into compliance (with U.N. resolutions) before consideration would
be given to the comprehensive review.
</P>
<P>
"But of course the meeting yesterday was really just the
beginning of the process" of consultations between Aziz and
council members, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has started to meet Security Council members individually
and "they agreed that he and the Secretary-General would get
together once again towards the end of the week once the Deputy
Prime Minister has completed this round of consultations, Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
The standoff came after Iraq announced its decision to suspend
cooperation with U.N. inspectors following the collapse of talks
between Iraq and UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's disarmament is the prerequisite for the U.N. to lift the
sanctions imposed in 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> New Survey Reveals Working Women's Desire for Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Most working women
worldwide are concerned about not getting access to the right
technology to assist in the future growth of their companies,
according to a new study released today.
</P>
<P>
Out of a group of women business owners surveyed at two
international conferences, 83 percent said they already use
computers at work, but 79 percent expressed concern that they were
not getting adequate access to information about new technologies
that could help expand their businesses.
</P>
<P>
The research was sponsored by IBM and conducted by the National
Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) of the United States.
Responses from women from countries as diverse as Argentina,
Canada, Ethiopia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Senegal, Uganda
and the United States were included in the study, which was
conducted over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the women said computers constitute an important aspect
of their business today, and they consider new developments in
technology as key to their companies' future growth, the study
said. Small business owners, in particular, feel technology can
help them expand internationally.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, 100 percent of those women polled said that they
used computers, as compared with 95 percent in Argentina, 93
percent in the United States, and 60 percent in Finland, according
to individual studies done in these countries.
</P>
<P>
In each country surveyed, more than two-thirds of the women
entrepreneurs said that learning about new technology was "very
important" or "extremely important," according to the study. In
Argentina, 80 percent of the women surveyed made such an
assessment, compared with 69 percent in Canada and 62 percent in
Ireland, for example.
</P>
<P>
However, since most women have had little formal training in
the use of computers, it comes as no surprise that they feel
distanced from new developments in technology, said IBM in a
statement. Only three percent of those enrolled in technology
career-training programs around the world are women, the company
said. IBM plans to work with women business owners globally to
understand their needs in order to market products specifically to
their needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the NFWBO, women-owned businesses generate
revenues of 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars annualy in the United States
alone, and account for one-quarter of overall business in the
economy worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is a popular technology tool for many of today's
business women, but usage rates varied widely, according to the
study. Eighty-five percent of women business owners in Canada use
the Internet for work, while only 50 percent do so in Ireland and
37 percent in Argentina. Overall, 51 percent of the women surveyed
at the two international conferences use the Internet on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
Also based on the two conference surveys, 26 percent of women
entrepreneurs have business home pages on the Internet. Forty-one
of women entrepreneurs in Canada and 23 percent of their American
counterpart have home pages.

ADDIS ABABA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Airlines (EAL)
announced Tuesday that it will resume its flight from Addis Ababa
to Khartoum, capital of the Sudan, beginning from October 27.
</P>
<P>
EAL disrupted its flight to Khartoum after the attempt to
assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak who was here to
attend the Organization of African Unity summit in June, 1995.
</P>

EAL, reported the Ethiopia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
EAL will fly to Khartoum twice a week, Yossef Wolde-Yohannes
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a good market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EAL will also resume its flight to Beirut which has
been disrupted for the last 20 years because of the civil war in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Its flight to Beirut via Khartoum will begin as of November
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday accused the
United States of interfering in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consul-General Carolyn Huggins met Monday with convicted
Istanbul Mayor Tayip Erdogan. After the meeting, Huggins said: "it
is a very serious issue for the elected leaders to face crimes."
</P>
<P>
A 10-month prison sentence meted out last Wednesday on Erdogan
will serve to "weaken confidence in Turkish democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
the words of Huggins have violated the principles of
non-intervention in internal affairs of Turkey and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"We consider comments by a foreigner on a verdict by Turkey's
highest judicial authority as an intervention in our internal
affairs," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan, the pro-Islamic mayor, was found guilty by the
Diyarbakir State Security Court in April of "inciting hatred based
on religious differences."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Supreme Appeals Court upheld the sentence of a
10-month imprisonment for Erdogan, who will therefore be unseated
as mayor of this Turkey's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan, 45, was elected Istanbul mayor in March 1994 as a
candidate of the Islamist Welfare Party (RP). After the RP was
outlawed last January, he joined the Islamist Virtue Party.

KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has
sentenced 14,000 people from 45 countries since a nationwide
crackdown on illegal immigrants started a year ago, the official
Saudi Press Agency reported (SPA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Passports Department Major General
Assad Abdelkarim told SPA that the sentences ranged between
imprisonment, deportation and fines, adding that a number of
Saudis who helped the illegal immigrants were also sentenced, but
he gave no figures.
</P>
<P>
Abdelkarim reiterated Saudi Arabia's determination to go ahead
with plans to put an end to the phenomenon of illegal residents
in the Gulf Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The official warned that those who illegally remain after
pilgrimage and all violators of regulations will be forced to
leave the country regardless of their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
There are 5 million foreigners living in Saudi Arabia
representing 70 percent of the workforce. Since the campaign

KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Border guards in Saudi
Arabia have aborted an attempt to smuggle 550 kilograms of hashish
to the eastern region of the country, a military official told the
state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
General Director of the Border Guards Talal Al-Amkawi, who did
not reveal the identity of the smugglers, said the border troops
were vigilant to foil smuggling bids.
</P>
<P>
This is the second narcotics smuggling bid the Saudi anti-drug
authorities have foiled this month. On September 2, the Saudi
Interior Ministry announced that patrols near the Saudi-Yemeni
border seized 651,000 drug tablets.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, like other oil-rich Gulf countries, is becoming
a clear target of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf kingdom, which adopts a strict policy against
narcotics as destructive to the society, imposes capital
punishment against drug traffickers and dealers.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Tuesday underlined that religion and freedom should be in
conformity in Iran to serve stability and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of university professors and students on
the occasion of the start of new academic year, Khatami said
that freedom was the foundation of stability and tranquillity in
the society.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will show that religion is in conformity with
freedom and we will pay the price for this end," he was quoted by
the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that there exist two groups in Iran against
prosperity of the nation, the first one is against freedom and the
other is against religion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the comments on freedom at a time when freedom of
the press became a hot topic throughout the country following the
close-down of several dailies and weeklies on charge of insulting
the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president noted that under the atmosphere of
freedom, the faith of the public should not be targeted, instead,
the freedom should be utilized to reinforce the people's faith.
</P>
<P>
He referred the warning of the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on freedom-abusing by some of the Iranian press,
saying that the leader's definition of freedom and his stress on
avoiding the extremes indicated to what extent Iran is treading
the path of freedom.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Tuesday strongly
denounced a Greek resolution declaring September 14 a day of
remembrance for genocide against Greeks by Turks.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn and protest" the resolution adopted recently by the
Greek Parliament, a statement issued by the Turkish Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
There are no historical records about the happening of a
genocide against the Greeks at that time, instead the Lausanne
Treaty signed in 1923 noted that Greece was to blame for
devastation of western Turkish cities and villages, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Parliament resolution said the genocide took place in
the Aegean coastal region between 1919 and 1922 when Greece was at
war with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops defeated the Greek forces and recaptured the
major Aegean city of Izmir, where there were a lot of Greek
residents.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over the limits of air space,
seabed resources, sovereignty over some Aegean islands and the

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Calls for Global Effort on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, Germany, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang,
Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), on Tuesday called for concerted global efforts to prevent
an economic crisis that started in Asia from turning into a global
recession.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a lunch reception at the German financial center
Frankfurt at the start of a three-week trip to Europe and the
United States, Tsang said a global recession was possible if the
current economic crisis could not be turned around.
</P>
<P>
"We live in a global village and a sustained economic crisis of
the magnitude now being experienced in East Asia is affecting
markets in the US and Europe," Tsang said, adding that developed
and developing world must work together to prevent similar
economic disasters.
</P>
<P>
Tsang made a call to devise a new set of international
guidelines which will facilitate smooth, sustainable growth rather
than "boom and bust cycles, and to formulate new rules and
strategies to cope with the huge in- and outflows of international
capital.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning in Frankfurt, Tsang held talks with
president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, as well as
president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that more transparency and some degrees of order
are needed in the global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Tsang, who left Hong Kong on Sunday, will make a stop in Munich
before a visit to the Netherlands. After a stay in the United
States to attend the annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, he will come back to Europe for a visit
to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Better Ties with Iran Takes Patience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- It will take time and
patience to establish good relations with Iran, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday in a response to a statement by
Iran's foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to engage in a process in which each side is able
to address the other's concerns," Albright said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Monday to the Asia Society in New York, Karrazi
said that despite U.S. calls for formal talks with his country,
there was no basis for negotiations without a meaningful change in
Washington's behavior toward Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Objecting to Kharazzi's criticism of U.S. policy, Albright
praised Iran for having an anti-drug policy, for its stand of
Afghanistan and for giving Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat space
to negotiate peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"While we see the emergence of a new tone in the United States,
old unfounded allegations are yet to cease," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that prolongation of outdated behavior... can
simply not provide the necessary basis for an invitation to
political dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright persisted in making overtures to Iran that are based
on a judgment within the Clinton administration that President
Mohammad Khatami represents a new moderation in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, she mixed in some criticism of Iran
with her overtures. She cited, for instance, support for terrorism
and trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States had proposed "parallel steps" toward a
reconciliation, she said, adding, "We know this will require
patience."

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Vows Commitment to Free Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, Germany, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang,
Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), reiterated here Tuesday Hong Kong's commitment to free
and open markets despite the recent Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tsang, who is in Frankfurt at the start of a three-week trip to
Europe and the United States, also stressed Hong Kong's ability
and determination to ride through the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a lunch reception at the German financial center,
Tsang dismissed many negative speculations about recent actions
taken by the HKSAR government to buying into Hong Kong's stock and
futures markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was made "first and most importantly" to
protect and reinforce the integrity of the Hong Kong dollar's
linked exchange rate with the U.S. dollar under the currency board
system.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot stress too strongly our absolute determination to
main our linked exchange rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government's buying was also designed to stop the
manipulation of Hong Kong's stock and currency markets by some
"over-aggressive" fund managers, and to "reintroduce stability and
a level playing field into our markets which were in dire danger
of over-correcting", Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Our actions do not signal the beginning of an interventionist
era for Hong Kong or a departure from our commitment to free trade
and open market.... We are still probably the world's freest and
most open market," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is a trifle unfair to say that the reason the HKSAR
government bought into the stock market was because we could not
take the pain of economic adjustment.... We have been taking the
pain for more than a year, and are prepared to take more pain if
that is the price to pay for economic recovery and leadership,"
Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong financial secretary also mentioned a number of
factors that will guarantee Hong Kong's ability to weather the
financial turmoil, including a healthy banking and financial
system, sufficient foreign reserves, as well as currency stability.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this stability in the Hong Kong dollar and the
Chinese renminbi will eventually help pave the way for a recovery
in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite its negative impact, the Asian turmoil has been "a
somewhat sobering and also enlightening experience", Tsang said,
adding that "As a result, we have been able to make our stock and
money markets more transparent and less susceptible to
manipulation."
</P>
<P>
"We have proved that even during such difficult times we are
still the best place in Asia in which to do business. And when the
storm is over, we will be even better," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unlikely to Travel to South Asia This Year </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton is unlikely to visit India and Pakistan this fall as
planned and is contacting leaders there to discuss future
relations, said the White House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike McCurry cited unconfirmed news reports that
Clinton probably will not make the trip. "I don't have any reason
to dispute that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When we have any official announcement, I'll make it," he
added.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have said they intended to make a final
decision by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has planned to trip to India and Pakistan. But their
nuclear weapons tests last May prompted the president to
reconsider his trip.
</P>
<P>
The president was going to make the visit as part of a
still-planned trip to Malaysia for an Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting on November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton already is "in the process of contacting"
the Indian and Pakistani governments to talk about "the importance
he attaches to the relations and how we see relations unfolding."

<HEADLINE> 46,360 Landmines Cleared in Mozambique Since 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican official
revealed Tuesday that a total of 46,360 landmines have been
cleared in Mozambique since 1993, among which 46,000 were
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Osorio Mateus, the director of National De-mining Committee,
said that mines have been cleared from 7,200 kilometers of
highways, 371 kilometers of transmission line and 3,200 hectares
of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Reports said about two million of landmines had been planted
during the 16 years of civil war in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 cases of mine explosion were reported in six of
the country's ten provinces in the first half of this year,
killing at least five, and wounding 20.
</P>
<P>
To prevent people from being hurt by landmines, said Mateus,
the committee is now undertaking a draft agreement with the
Ministry of Education to include landmine education for primary
school students.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will soon start de-mining in Cabo
Delgado Province in north Mozambique with the two-million-U.S.-Dollar
aid from Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Seek Overthrow of Iraq's Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Some key U.S. congressmen
said on Tuesday they intended to offer military aid as well as
broadcasting support to foes of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein with
the goal of bringing him down.
</P>
<P>
House International Relations Committee chairman Ben Gilman
introduced a bill to provide 97 million U.S. dollars in military
aid to democratic opponents of Saddam's government.
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, Saddam must go," said Gilman, adding it would
"finally and irrevocably" commit the United Sates to the overthrow
of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a direct, active, overt support of the
opposition that would lead to the removal of Saddam Hussein from
office," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to move beyond political support to direct military
assistance," Lott said in calling for an open U.S. policy to oust
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
"We must abandon the fiction that there can be peace and
security in the Persian Gulf region with Saddam Hussein's regime
still in power," Gilman added.
</P>
<P>
Their criticisms were based in part on the testimony by arms
expert Scott Ritter who has accused the White House of undermining
U.N. inspections of Iraqi nuclear, ballistic and chemical weapons
sites.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, an American, resigned from the U.N. inspections team in
part due to disputes over the policy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 97 million U.S. dollars of military aid to
the democratic opposition in Iraq, the proposed bill also gives
Saddam's opponents two million U.S. dollars for broadcasts from
outside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain's Envoy Sees Iraq Softing Stand on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq seemed ready to
respond positively to demands of the Security Council of the
United Nations that Iraq reverse its August 5 decision to suspend
cooperation with the U.N., Bahrain's U.N. envoy said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Jassim Mohammed Buallay, the only Arab member in the
Security Council, made the remark after Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz briefed developing nations in the council on
the current standoff with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Buallay said "Iraq is ready to respond
positively" in an effort to get the comprehensive review, which
was proposed by U.N. chief Kofi Annan and accepted by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Aziz knows that no elements of a comprehensive review will be
discussed until Iraq cooperates," Buallay said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not the details of the review. The problem is
the stalemate. Somebody needs to defuse this crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who came here over the weekend at the invitation of the
U.N. chief, said Monday that he first wanted a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with the relevant resolution of the
council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced suspension of its cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors on August 5. The Security Council adopted a resolution
on September 9 which decided to suspend its regular reviews of the
sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad reverses its decision.
</P>
<P>
Aziz will meet members of the council in the course of the
week. He is due to meet once again with Annan by the weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Meddling in Turkey's Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday accused the
United States of interfering in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consul-General Carolyn Huggins met Monday with convicted
Istanbul Mayor Tayip Erdogan. After the meeting, Huggins said: "it
is a very serious issue for the elected leaders to face crimes."
</P>
<P>
A 10-month prison sentence meted out last Wednesday on Erdogan
will serve to "weaken confidence in Turkish democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
the words of Huggins have violated the principles of
non-intervention in internal affairs of Turkey and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"We consider comments by a foreigner on a verdict by Turkey's
highest judicial authority as an intervention in our internal
affairs," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan, the pro-Islamic mayor, was found guilty by the
Diyarbakir State Security Court in April of "inciting hatred based
on religious differences."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Supreme Appeals Court upheld the sentence of a
10-month imprisonment for Erdogan, who will therefore be unseated
as mayor of this Turkey's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan, 45, was elected Istanbul mayor in March 1994 as a
candidate of the Islamist Welfare Party (RP). After the RP was
outlawed last January, he joined the Islamist Virtue Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly on Tuesday reelected Sadako Ogata as the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees for a term of two years.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the mandate followed a recommendation by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he respected Ogata's request not to serve another
full five-year period for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of her new term which will run from 1 January
1999 to 31 December 2000, Ogata will have served as High
Commissioner for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, 71, is from Japan. She took office in 1 January 1991 to
replace Norwegian Thorvald Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
designated as humanitarian and non-political, was established in
December 1950.
</P>
<P>
Its principal functions are to provide international protection
to refugees, seek durable solutions to their plight and furnish
them with material assistance.
</P>
<P>
In seeking durable solutions to refugees' problems, UNHCR tries
to help refugees reintegrate into their home communities.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees rose from 15 million in 1991 when Ogata
took office, to 22.4 million today, due to growing conflict cases.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.N. Position on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Tuesday hailed the U.N. position to reject Turkish
Cypriots' demand for the establishment of a confederation in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed his appreciation upon his return from a
two-week stay in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council has issued a
statement saying they backed "a sustained process of direct
negotiations between the two communities" to achieve a
comprehensive political settlement in line with relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in the north in 1983, which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal formula, but the Turkish Cypriots opted out
of the peace talks last year to protest a European decision to
start accession talks with Cyprus, but not their ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash raised a proposal in
August, calling for the establishment of a confederation of two
equal states in Cyprus as the basis for resuming talks, which was
rejected by Greek Cypriot-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cypriot president complained about the
non-implementation of the U.N. resolutions, saying "how long will
it (U.N.) continue to allow one country (Turkey), not only not to
implement their resolutions but also to violate them flagrantly."
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in New York, Clerides said the U.N. chief is "studying some
initiatives which he is not yet ready to announce."
</P>
<P>
He said the results of his contacts in New York will be
reviewed at a meeting of the National Council, his top advisory
body on handling the Cyprus problem, on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed pessimism over the resumption of the peace
talks based on U.N. resolutions, saying "the position of the
Turks" to condition the restoration of negotiations on a
confederation foundation will maintain for some time.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Denktash's visit to New York this week, Clerides
only said "as far as I know he will meet Annan and, of course, the
secretary-general will talk about the resumption of the talks on
the basis of the U.N. resolutions."

UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition
commemorating the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos
Aires Plan of Action opened Tuesday at the headquarters of the
United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits, on display from September 29 to October 16, have
two main components. One part, entitled "Building Bridges Across
the South," demonstrates the importance of technical cooperation
among developing countries (TCDC) for promoting development and
for building partnerships among countries and key national and
regional institutions.
</P>
<P>
The second, "South-South Cooperation," features images of
successful TCDC programs supported by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and other U.N. organizations.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among
Developing Countries organized the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"South-South cooperation has become increasingly accepted as a
vital dimension of development cooperation," said John
Ohiorhenuan, director of the UNDP's Special Unit for Technical
Cooperation among Developing Countries.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the new millennium, the effective participation of
developing countries in the processes of globalization requires
intense collective action and international support," he said.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Fall with Anxiety on Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Most European stock markets
fell on Tuesday, as investors anxiously awaited an interest rate
cut decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The London market fared better, as the FTSE 100 index of
leading shares ended the day up 15 points higher after falling by
50 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
Caution ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy
meeting capped volume and keep investors sidelined. At the close
the FTSE 100 share index stood at 5108, with the December Footsie
contract up at 5178.
</P>
<P>
Second liners outperformed the rest of the market, underpinned
by the recent spate of positive corporate news. Turnover was 860
million shares.
</P>
<P>
Charterhouse salesman James Dewhurst said there were a number
of factors affecting the market. "It's very thin volume, we've got
the penultimate day of the third quarter account to get through
and sterling is moving around," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asian markets were noticeably subdued, hampered by credit and
earnings worries. Dealers said a quarter point cut in the Fed
funds rate was well discounted and likely to disappoint.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax index was unable to maintain
yesterday's gains, falling back from the start of trade as global
worries overtook domestic euphoria. At the close the Xetra DAX
index was deeply in the red, down 77.23 points at 4600.33.
</P>
<P>
Political developments hit utility stocks, as the likelihood of
a Red-Green coalition with the Green Party led to fears of an
energy tax and cutbacks to nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares were broadly unchanged ahead of the U.S.
Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates. At the close the Cac
40 index of leading shares was 0.59 points lower at 3337.
</P>
<P>
Traders said attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and that
market players were unlikely to take any strong stands ahead of
the meeting's conclusion.

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks Industrial Fishing Ban to Help Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain proposed Tuesday that
a ban on industrial fishing be imposed along its northeast coast
to protect seabirds highly reliant on sandeels during the breeding
and chick-rearing season.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Minister Elliot Morley was quoted by Reuters as
saying that he was asking the European Commission to propose an
April-to-August ban which would hit Danish fishermen who use
industrial trawlers in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The area proposed has been shown to include major
concentrations of several species of seabirds which are highly
reliant on sandeels: Arctic tern, black guillemot, common tern,
guillemot, kittiwake, puffin, razorbill, Sandwich tern and shag,"
Morley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At present, the European Union allows fishermen to catch up to
a million tons of sandeels annually in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
David Minns, Scottish spokesman for the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, Britain's largest pressure group, said the
ban was "absolutely vital" to guard against a disastrous drop in
sea bird populations, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
He said that a big crash in the population of Arctic terns in
the Shetland Isles in the late 1980s was only reversed when a
similar ban was implemented in British coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
"The Shetland crash was one of the most severe seabird crashes
known in the world," Minns said. "We hope the lessons of that have
been learned."

LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two-thirds of British
companies want Britain to adopt the European single currency after
the next general election at the latest, according to the first
independent and comprehensive survey of business opinion on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Mori for the Financial Times
newspaper, found that 26 percent of British businesses wanted
Britain to join the system during this parliament, a further 37
percent favored entry after the election, and only 23 per cent
wanted to stay out permanently.
</P>
<P>
There was a majority for entry into the euro zone in all UK
regions, and among small, medium and large companies. Key business
sectors such as manufacturing and financial services were also in
favor.
</P>
<P>
However, opponents of early British entry will take heart from
Mori's finding that fewer than half of businesses think joining
the single currency would be good for the economy.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that only 22 per cent of companies have
taken any action to prepare for the euro.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday strongly
denied that it had any links to Saudi-born Osama Bin Laden who is
accused by the United States to have plotted the bombings on U.S.
embassies in Tanzania and and Kenya last month.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Iraq's mission to the United Nations said,
"The Iranian government categorically denies that it has any sort
of relations, coordination and agreement with Bin Laden or his
associates for any purpose."
</P>
<P>
"Iran categorically rejected terrorism in all its forms. It
condemned the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and
did not allow its territory to be used for the purpose of
instigating, planning, financing or supporting terrorist
activities in other countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's denial was prompted by charges against Mamdouh Mahmud
Salim who was arrested in Germany earlier this month after flying
there from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The embassy bombings in Africa last month killed at least 263
people.

TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday categorically
denied any cooperation with Saudi multi-millionaire Osama bin Laden
who is accused by the U.S. of having connection with dozens of
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iran's denial in a statement to the United Nations came after a
U.S. court accused Iran of cooperating with bin Laden and another
terrorist, Mahmoud Salem, who was arrested in Germany, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. court said that Iran, bin Laden and the Islamic
National Front of Sudan reached a formal agreement to take actions
against the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government denied that it had any cooperation, or
agreement with bin Laden or any of his assistants, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Tehran opposes terrorism in any form and in
any place, and does not allow terrorists to use its territory to
instigate and plan terror attacks, nor does it allow anyone to
provide financial assistance to terrorist actions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused bin Laden of financing and engaging in a
string of terrorist acts and the August 7 bomb attacks on the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were the lastest crimes Bin
Laden was suspected of being involved in.

<HEADLINE> Germany Assists Egypt to Remove Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Germany has provided Egypt with
110 pieces of equipment for removing land mines planted in the
Western Desert during World War II, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The equipment worth 1.6 million Egyptian pounds (about 471,000
U.S. dollars) was delivered at the request of Egyptian government,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the German Embassy in Cairo said Wednesday that a
German Foreign Ministry delegation visited Egypt early this year
to examine the problem of the land mines in Egypt's Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
Germany has provided Egypt with maps delineating the locations
of the millions of land mines left behind by troops of Nazi
Germany and the allied forces led by Britain battling for the
control of North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt wants to rid its northern coast and the Western Desert of
mines to clear the way for development projects. It has asked all
the countries which had an active role in the Battle of el-Alamein
to help remove the mines.
</P>
<P>
Allied forces led by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery
launched a huge offensive against Italian and German troops under
Erwin Rommel on October 23, 1942 and won a decisive victory in
el-Alamein, about 300 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa,
Egypt has an estimated 23 million land mines on its soil, topping
the world countries. About one person is killed every month in the
country by land mines spawned half a century ago.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian national soccer
team will play its first game after the World Cup against Ecuador
in a friendly on October 14 at the RFK Stadium in Washington, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team has released its roster for the game and
two-time world player of the year Ronaldo is not on it.
</P>
<P>
However, the Brazilians have included superstar Denilson,
World Cup starters Cafu and Rivaldo, and two late scratches from
the World Cup team because of injury, Flavio Conceicao and Elber.
</P>
<P>
They also have called up Felipe, a 21-year-old defender who is
considered one of the top emerging players in the world.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil's new coach, Vanderley Luxemburgo, has chosen to
rest 22-year-old Ronaldo, whose grueling schedule the past two
years apparently has taken a physical and psychological toll.
</P>
<P>
The other notable omission was left back Roberto Carlos of
Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
In Ronaldo's place, Luxemburgo will expect the attack to
revolve around Denilson, a 21-year-old wing who was a second-half
substitute in each of Brazil's World Cup games.
</P>
<P>
Also included on the roster was high-scoring Marcelinho
Casrioc of Brazil's Corinthians, one of several domestic-based
players under consideration for the 2002 World Cup squad.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, which never has qualified for the World Cup, is
expected to release its roster next week.

<HEADLINE> NBA Talks to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The NBA and the players'
union have agreed to resume collective bargaining next week for
the first time in two months. But neither side was optimistic
that the labor stalemate will be broken.
</P>
<P>
In addition, NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik, who
announced the cancellation of 24 preseason games last week, said
that, "As a practical matter, I don't see much of a chance of
playing any of the exhibition games as scheduled."
</P>
<P>
He said a decision about canceling more preseason games will
be made late this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
Training camps were supposed to open October 5 and the regular
season on November 3. Granik and NBA Commissioner David Stern
said last week that unless a deal is reached by the middle of Octo
ber, games will not likely be played before the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of collective bargaining was set for October 8.
</P>
<P>
The impetus for the negotiating session - the first since
August 6 and only the second since the league locked out the p
layers on July 1 - occurred "spontaneously" when union chief Bill
Hunter called Granik Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing of the New York
Knicks met for an hour with Granik and Stern early that evening
and agreed to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
The league is seeking a labor system that includes an
inflexible ceiling on team payrolls, or a "hard" salary cap.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to do is get together so something can be
resolved," Hunter said from Texas where he was meeting with
players. "They insist on a hard salary cap, so I can't say
there's any optimism at all. But who knows what will happen once
you get into the room."
</P>
<P>
Granik said: "We told them we need a system that sets
percentages of revenues to be shared by the players and the
owners. I have no reason to be optimistic. The only way to make a
deal is to keep negotiating."

CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's mobile telephone industry sources estimated
the market volume in the Gulf region at approximately 500 million
U.S. dollars a year, Wednesday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported.
</P>
<P>
The sources also expect the sector to grow by over 40 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
Statistical data of U.S. company Motorola reveals that the
number of subscribers to mobile phone services in the six Gulf
Cooperation Council states stands at about 1.445 million now as
compared to less than 500,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Iraq and Saudi companies have signed a series of
agreements for the provision of medicine and foodstuffs to the
tune of 100 million U.S. dollars, within the framework of the
fourth stage of the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food program, reports
reaching here from Saudi Arabia said.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi source has described the agreements as of paramount
importance, being the first commercial deal between the two
countries since 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt Tuesday warned against sugar dumping as a
serious trade problem and called for imposing customs fees to help
cut down imported sugar, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's output of sugar stands at 1.3 million tonnes a year,
while its total consumption of sugar hits around 1.6 million
tonnes, said Adel Shahawi, chairman of the Egyptian Holding
Company for Foodstuffs Industries.
</P>
<P>
Shahawi noted that sugar dumping in Egyptian markets still
constitutes a major problem, because sugar import tops 600,000
tonnes a year at a time when the gap between production and
consumption does not exceed 300,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the Saudi Ministry of Pilgrimage Tuesday
reached an agreement for exporting 100,000 inflammable tents to
Saudi Arabia, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
These tents will be used at the time of pilgrimage, said Samy

<HEADLINE> HK Railway Corporation Celebrates 88th Birthday (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation (KCRC), which offers the railway linkage
between Hong Kong and China's mainland and Hong Kong's urban areas
and the "New Territories," marked its 88th birthday here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the celebration attended by Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and his
wife, Betty Tung, and other officials of the SAR, KCRC Chairman
and Chief Executive K.Y. Yeung briefed those present on the future
development plan of the KCRC.
</P>
<P>
Yeung said his corporation has three objects in the future --
to improve the link between the "New Territories" and the urban
areas, to improve the freight links between the mainland and Hong
Kong's container terminals and to improve the inter-city passenger
services.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that initial plans are being considered for a
dedicated freight line which, if approved, will link the
Kowloon-Canton Railway, which is now called East Rail, system at
Tai Wai with the Port Rail Terminals at Kwai Chung, a major
container terminal of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since late August the KCRC has been running its trains to and
from Guangzhou of the mainland in demonstration of its commitment
to serving the market for inter-city passenger services, Yeung
said.

Yeung noted that the first major civil works contract for West
Rail linking the western "New Territories" with the urban areas,
the Tai Lam Tunnel contract, was awarded last week. The West Rail
is planned to be completed by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Detailed planning for extending the East Rail system,
comprising the Ma On Shan Line in the eastern "New Territories"
and the Tsim Sha Tsui extension, was approved eight days ago,
Yeung said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that KCRC would soon get approval for the Sheung Shui
to Lok Ma Chau spur line that will create a badly needed second
rail boundary crossing between Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The first steam-driven train started running on the
Kowloon-Canton Railway on October 1, 1910.
</P>
<P>
In the past 88 years, the railway changed from steam-driven to
diesel-electric trains, from a single to a double track, from
simple to modern stations, from manual signaling to an Automatic
Train Protection System and to full electrification of the tracks
and rolling stock.
</P>
<P>
Yeung described East Rail now as one of the safest, most
efficient and reliable mass transit systems in the world, carrying
more than 740,000 passenger-trips a day.
</P>
<P>
Taken together with Light Rail, which connects the western part

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Rejects PM Nominee Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagabandy Wednesday rejected the nomination of Erdene
Bat-uul, general secretary of the Mongolian National Democratic
Party, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The president's press spokesman said Bat-uul, also member of
the Great Hural (parliament), was nominated as a candidate for
premier by the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) in a letter to the
president on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, rejected the nomination because of
Bat-uul's stand on some major issues, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
First, Bat-uul deemed legal the government's May decision to
merge the state-owned Renovation Bank with the private Golomt
Bank, which led to the dismissal of the government by parliament
on July 24. He also strongly opposed the recall of the bank merger
decision.
</P>
<P>
Second, Bat-uul said the parliament was wrong in its dismissal
of the government after the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
Viewing Bat-uul's above mentioned stands, the spokesman said,
the president has refused to submit the nomination for approval by
the parliament. He hoped the MDU would come up with other nominees
to fill the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president and the parliament turned down several
nominations made by the leadership of the ruling union -- the
Mongolian National Democratic Party and the Social Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolia's law, the parliament should appoint a new prime
minister within 30 days of the government's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The nomination is to be made by the ruling party. The president
then submits the nomination to the Great Hural for approval.
</P>
<P>
Observers have noticed that the prolonged government crisis in
Mongolia is likely to bring about more political turbulence in the
country.

OTTAWA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy edged
down for a fourth consecutive month in July, falling by 0.3
percent, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The latest decline leaves economic activity at 0.7 percent
below its March 1998 peak," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) grew
1.1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Widespread weakness and several strikes left the goods
producing industries down 1.1 percent for the month.
</P>

Meanwhile, activity in the service industry gained 0.1 percent,
according to the agency.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Don King, already in a
New York courtroom Tuesday over promotional rights to
welterweight boxer Felix Trinidad, was served with his latest
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Cedric Kushner announced he has filed a 12 million
federal lawsuit in New York, alleging King is in violation of the
anti-racketeering act and has committed fraud and contractual
interference with fighters.
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten heavyweight Hasim "Rock" Rahman said he was paid
125,000 dollars by King and induced to fake an injury for the
purposes of withdrawing from a fight against David Tua.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said King threatened him and he subsequently pulled
out, claiming an injured hand.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said he changed his mind about signing with King
because of what he was subsequently told about the promoter's
notorious past in dealing with Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes, Tim
Witherspoon, Mike Tyson and other fighters.
</P>
<P>
"The stories were horrible," Rahman said. "I wasn't going to
be part of that legacy."

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash with Israeli Troops Near Ramallah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops Wednesday near the West Bank city of
Ramallah after the funeral of a Hamas member who was killed in a
car explosion Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zahran Ibrahim, who was killed Tuesday in the car explosion in
an industrial area of Beitunia near Ramallah, was buried
Wednesday in his home village of Biddou, also near Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the funeral, hundreds of villagers and young
people rushed to a nearby Jewish settlement Har Adar and began
throwing stones at the Israeli troops posted at the gates.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets and six
Palestinians were injured.
</P>
<P>
Two survivors in Tuesday's powerful explosion denied that the
blast went off while they were loading the car for bombing attack
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police said Wednesday that the two activists of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) - Abu Eid brothers - told the
Palestinian security officials that just before the explosion,
they met an Israeli Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia
industrial area, to buy from him three guns and pistols.
</P>
<P>
The brothers said they sat in the front while Zahran sat in the
back of the car with the Israeli Arab, and they wanted to complete
the deal quickly and therefore did not check the bag the Israeli
Arab handed over before leaving the car.
</P>
<P>
The bag exploded shortly after they started the car, they said.
</P>
<P>
The two brothers remained in a Ramallah hospital under the
Palestinian police guard.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police officials said Wednesday that the car
explosion was a "plot" and the middleman who arranged the
transaction has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Hamas on Wednesday vowed revenge, saying that "these who
involved in the plot" have to pay for Zahran's life.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Sharp Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua)--The Zimbabwean government on
Wednesday denied media reports of imminent sharp price rises in
consumer goods which had sparked panic buying and raised
fears of possible social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Since the Zimbabwean media reported last week that prices
would go up on September 30, the supermarkets have been hit by a
wave of panic buying, said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Chen Chimutengwende denied the reports
and said the government had not approved new prices, which trade
unions condemned as "unacceptable" and similar to those that
sparked riots earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Herald newspaper, the minister said the
government was still considering price proposals and at the same
time investigating industries that had implemented increases
without its authority.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the staple maize meal, which
currently costs about 50 Zimbabwe Dollars (1.5 U.S.Dollars ) for
a 10 kg bag, cooking oil, bread and meat were among products set
to rise by about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chimutengwende said: " At the moment, cabinet has not
authorised any increases and the task force (on prices) is going
to investigate how the producers increased their prices when
discussions had not been completed," he added.
</P>
<P>
the government has forced private businesses to keep prices
down for months, saying "unjustified" increases would stir social
unrest. But industry held that new prices were vital for viability.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's trade unions were due to meet later on Wednesday to
discuss the proposed price rises, which had stoked fears the
country might suffer a new wave of social unrest, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
At least six people died in unprecedented anti-price hike
riots that hit the country in January.
</P>
<P>
The unions have issued a statement condemning the proposed
price rises, saying the government was undermining the spirit of
cooperation that was emerging.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Pump-Storage Power Station Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The first generators of
China's largest pump-storage hydropower station, still under
construction, began operating at 4 p.m. today in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Located in Anji County in Zhejiang, about 175 kilometers
from Shanghai, the Tianhuangping pump-storage power station has a
total installed capacity of 1.8 million kilowatts, and can produce
3.16 billion kilowatts of electricity annually when fully
operational.
</P>
<P>
The first generators, with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, was
put into 72-hour experimental operation before formally connecting
to the East China Power Grid.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the power station began on March 1, 1994, and
is expected to be completed in June 2000. The second set of
generators will begin functioning before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The budgeted cost of this power station is 7.11 billion yuan
(about 900 million U.S. dollars). The World Bank loaned 300
million U.S. dollars to the project, and the rest of the money was
raised from Shanghai and its neighboring provinces including
Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
Engineers from the Shanghai-based East China Power Company
(Group) said the power station will play a vital role in
stabilizing the entire East China Power Grid, improving the
quality of the power supply in east China, and ensuring the safe
operation of the nuclear power stations in the surrounding areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Minister of
Commerce and Industry Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel Wednesday
voiced his support for economic integration among the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel said that economic integration is a strategic goal
for the GCC members to confront political and economic challenges
that might result from international changes, the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated his position at the opening session of a
one-day meeting of the GCC industry ministers to discuss issues
related to industrial integration and development, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Industry integration is the strategic choice to achieve
economic development goals in the GCC countries because it can
diversify income sources and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel stressed that international changes "are leading us
to deal with a world without customs barriers."
</P>
<P>
And national industries are facing new challenges as the world
markets are demanding products of higher quality, which requires
the introduction of the most sophisticated technologies in the
production process, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium earlier this month, GCC trade ministers adopted
an industrial development strategy with a view to expediting the
industrial development process and increasing the national
manpower in the industrial sector to 75 percent by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

ROME, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A positive doping test
involving a first division soccer match was covered up and
falsified, a Milan newspaper said on Wednesday.

<P>
Milan's Corriere della Sera reported that a random doping test

The same technician later discovered that a second test tube
which contained more of the same player's urine for a cross check
had been tampered with.

Its seal was broken in violation of standard procedures and
the results of the test disappeared, Corriere said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
expressed his belief that so long as the whole nation is of one
heart and mind to build on progress and effectively accomplish all
tasks in the flood-fighting spirit, China will be able to achieve
all the set objectives for reform and development this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark here this evening while hosting a grand

have withstood severe tests and won major victories.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the flood season this year when the
valleys of the Yangtze River, the Nenjiang River and the Songhua
River were all hit by huge and unprecedented floods, both the
military and civilians, under the leadership of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin
at the core, waged a tough and united struggle and scored victory
on all fronts in the fight against the floods and in disaster
relief.

<P>
Zhu continued, saying that since the beginning of this year,
the volatile international financial market has brought
difficulties and pressures to bear on China's economic growth, and
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have taken timely
and effective measures to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
While deepening the reform, he said China has introduced
more forceful financial policies to increase input and expand
domestic demand so that its national economy can maintain a
favorable momentum and a more rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the serious floods which affected China's
agriculture, its grain production for the whole year is still
expected to yield a fairly good harvest, Zhu went on to say,
noting that the country's industrial production has grown steadily
and the fiscal and financial situation has remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Also, China's foreign trade has continued to expand and the
amount of foreign funds attracted has been kept at a reasonable
level, the level of our foreign exchange reserves has been
maintained and even increased somewhat, and the RMB exchange rate
has remained stable, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that "with the deepening reform of state-owned
enterprises, we have been in a better position to ensure the daily
needs of the laid-off workers and their reemployment."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the restructuring of government
institutions of the State Council and reforms of the grain
circulation system, the banking system, the urban residential
housing system and other reforms are going smoothly, and initial
results have been attained in our campaign to crack down on
smuggling, and the fight against corruption is being carried out
in a thorough way."

<HEADLINE> Indian Customs Seize Heroin, 2 Nigerians Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian customs officials
recovered 18.7 kilograms of heroin from two Nigerian nationals
Monday at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two Nigerians, who allegedly admitted their offense during
interrogation, were arrested in this connection, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an official at the Air Cargo Unit as saying officials
of the export branch of the unit found the drugs packed in
polythene packets concealed in layers of curtain fabrics. The
drugs are worth about 4.75 million U.S. dollars in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Dalbir Singh, customs commissioner, said the two Nigerians were
traced and arrested along with five polythene packets containing
the heroin, which was concealed in five out of 10 bales of the
fabrics brought for export to Luanda, Angola.
</P>
<P>
One Nigerian, who had been visiting the country frequently, was
scheduled to board an Ethiopian aircraft for Lagos, Nigeria,
Tuesday, while the other, suspected to be the mastermind behind
the whole operation, had been staying in the Indian capital for
the last five months.
</P>
<P>
Instead of off-loading the consignment in New Delhi and
exporting it, Singh said, they chose Mumbai, a financial city in
western India, for the operation to dodge the customs officials.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- As long as the people's
thinking is unified and effective measures are taken, China's goal
of achieving an eight percent economic growth this year is
attainable, says the People's Daily, China's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to appear on Thursday to mark the 49th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
paper says, "Attaining this year's reform and economic growth goal
will create favorable conditions for our country's development in
the next few years."
</P>
<P>
The article titled "Carry Forward the Flood-fighting Spirit and
Promote All Kinds of Work" says the Chinese people have ushered in
the 49th birthday of the People's Republic with a tremendous
victory in the flood-fighting struggle and splendid achievements
over the past two decades of reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
It notes that 1998 is the first year of implementation of the
strategic plan for China's development at the turn of the century,
mapped out during the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"This year we have taken a series of reform steps and achieved
initial success; we have withstood the economic turbulence that
negatively affected Asia and even the whole world, and gained new
development which draws worldwide attention; we have also
triumphed over the serious flooding and protected the fruits of
our reform and opening-up drive," the article says.
</P>
<P>
During the battle against the floods nationwide, the article
says, a "flooding-fighting spirit" of solidarity, tenacity,
perseverance and bravery has emerged, which has both realistic and
historical significance for attaining the magnificent goal of
China's cross-century development.
</P>
<P>
"At present, China maintains fairly good development momentum,"
it notes. "While seeing the negative factors brought by this
extremely serious natural disaster and the complicated global
environment, we must also see the opportunities for our
development."
</P>
<P>
It suggests that greater efforts be made to further expand
domestic demand and improve the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"We must take the great flood-fighting spirit as our motive
force, mobilize and organize people across the country, make use
of all positive factors, and strive for the accomplishment of this
year's economic goal," it urges.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Football
Association (CFA) on Wednesday banned a referee in an attempt to
calm down the country's most successful club Dalian Wanda, whose
owners had announced on Monday to withdraw from the Chinese
football.
</P>
<P>
The CFA also accepted league champion Wanda's "rational"
protest and expressed regrets over a dispute and the "wrong
ruling" in a CFA Cup semifinal.
</P>
<P>
"With a careful study of the video footage of the match
between Wanda and Liaoning Tianrun, the Referee's Committee found
the referee made some serious mistakes," CFA vice president Zhang
Jilong said in a press conference on Wednesday. "CFA has
disqualified the referee based on relevant regulations."
</P>
<P>
But Zhang, also vice president of the Asian Football
Confederation, refused to disclose how long the referee Yu
Yuancong would be suspended.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely accepted Wanda's criticism, in which the club
demands referees should be fair and correct in the field," Zhang
said. "We feel regret at the referee's severe mistakes and their
consequences."
</P>
<P>
Yu, a national class referee, failed to award Wanda a single
penalty kick from three alleged bookable fouls in the area that
second-division squad Tianrun committed in the second leg of CFA
Cup semifinal. He also disallowed a goal by Wanda saying that the
club's striker was offside.
</P>
<P>
Wanda lost the eventful penalty shoot-out 5-6 after being held
1-1 in 120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Wanda Group general manager and club president Wang Jianlin
then announced on Monday a shocking decision to sell the club at
the end of the season and withdraw from football for ever.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he had lost confidence in the Chinese soccer because
"there was a dark side to that match, as in most matches now."
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang rebuffed Wang's remarks as "irresponsible" and
"not serious."
</P>
<P>
"As a general manager of a football club, he has run counter
to the CAF regulations," Zhang said. "It's hard to believe such
words were from the general manager of a top club."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said referees make mistakes in almost every
pitch of the world. "It's not avoidable even in the World Cup."
</P>
<P>
He added, "The CFA welcomes all clubs to offer advice and
suggestions. If we join hands, we will find a way to solve the
problems."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Wanda Group had thought about withdrawal
from football last year since it had been running the club in red
and it was hard to make money out of China's football market.
</P>
<P>
But Wang denied Wanda was pulling out for financial reasons.
"I only hope our action will bring the problem to the attention
of the soccer leaders," the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said, "In fact, it's up to them whether or not to stay
in the football market since Wanda Group is a business.
</P>
<P>
"But the CFA also wants to know how the sponsors are running
behind the seemingly booming football market."
</P>
<P>
Wanda, league champion in 1994, 1996, 1997, has secured its
fourth national title in the top-flight professional first
division league this season with four rounds to go.

<HEADLINE> Flood Centers May Be Vacated Soon in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- All the flood centers, opened
for sheltering thousands of marooned people, are expected to be
vacated within a couple of days as the flood situation in
Bangladesh has now become normal, an English newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are very few people still living in the shelters now and
they will leave the centers within one or two days, The Bangladesh
Observer daily quoted an official at the Disaster Management and
Relief Ministry as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,049,525 people had taken refuge at 2,716 centers
across the country during the 10-week-long flood, which seriously
affected 30,916,351 people in 52 of the country's 64 districts,
according to a ministry release.
</P>
<P>
Situation in 47 districts has become normal and the remaining
five are expected to be totally free from flooding within a
couple of days, the release stated.
</P>
<P>
Official figure showed that 918 people were killed by drowning,
snake biting or electrocution during the catastrophic flood and
deaths from diarrhea, however, are not included in this figure.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Relief Fund and the Relief Ministry have
so far distributed 65.8 million taka (about 1.4 million U.S.
dollars) and foodgrains worth about 1.29 billion taka (about 27.45
million dollars) among the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the Ganges rivers marked
a rise at upstream while rivers in the Meghna and southeastern
hill basins observed rise and fall, the Flood Forecasting and
Warning Center said. "But there is nothing to be worried with this
slight rise, and its very normal and natural," the center added.

<HEADLINE> India Becomes Dumping Ground for Foreign Waste: Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- India is fast becoming a
dumping ground for foreign waste, from American municipal sludge
to Indonesian garbage, from Arabian mining waste to Kuwaiti rubber
waste, the Hindu Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said shiploads of old paints, chemicals, pesticides,
tires, crashed automobiles, discarded ships, batteries,
radioactive waste, ash, slag, asbestos, mercury and lead have been
imported by scrap traders and sent to illegal backyard recycling
units in spite of a Supreme Court ruling two years ago banning the
trade of hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
India's waste import increased to 1.885 billion tons, worth 11
billion rupees (about 275 million U.S. dollars) in 1997-98, from
980 million tons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
A report by Vatavaran, a non-governmental organization, said
400 million of the 1.885 billion tons are hazardous scrap,
produced mostly by the developed world.
</P>
<P>
Increased dumping had led to unchecked growth of illegal
backyard recycling units almost in the whole country, the report
said, adding that "workers are dying prematurely and traders are
making a quick buck..."
</P>
<P>
Tons of used car batteries and lead ash residue were exported
to the South Asian country from Australia, the United States,
Britain and Germany, which found these materials too toxic to
recycle.
</P>
<P>
The uncontrolled import of scrap waste, most of which is rich
in poisonous, toxic and radioactive substances, had been a result
of lax laws, zero enforcement policy and ignorance among the
locals, according to Iqbal Malik, an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
Import of scrap was regulated earlier, but after the government
decanalized scrap imports in 1992, traders got full freedom to
import whatever scrap was available in international markets, said
officials of the Mineral and Scrap Trading Corporation (MSTC), a
government undertaking.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, till 1992, when imports had to be
through a canalizing agency, scrap import was permitted in India
on the basis of the gap between indigenous demand and availability
of the material and the foreign exchange allocated to the
canalizing agency.
</P>
<P>
But after the decanalization, market forces operate freely and
individual traders import scrap depending upon the price, quality
and availability in the international markets.
</P>
<P>
The demand for imported scrap is also affected by the existing
import duty structure, which also determines the landed cost of
the imported scrap, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Supreme Court in 1996 banned the import of hazardous
materials which include non-ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
"No containers were cleared at the ports, the metal got
oxidized and started rusting ... scrap worth billions of rupees
was lost in the process," a metal scrap trader said.
</P>
<P>
Following traders' appeal before the apex court, the government
partially ended the ban, but the import of certain waste is still
prohibited.

WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate on Tuesday
approved a 250.5 billion U.S. dollar defense spending bill for
fiscal 1999 and sent it to President Bill Clinton for signature.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill by a 94-2 vote. On Monday, the House
of Representatives passed the bill, which accounts for about 15
percent of federal spending.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides a 3.6 percent pay raise for military
personnel and also contains 951 million dollars for anti-missile
defense research.
</P>
<P>
Overall military operations and maintenance would get 84
billion dollars, and 48.5 billion dollars would be available to
buy weapons and equipment.
</P>
<P>
It represents a 2.8 billion dollar increase over the current
level. But Clinton and many lawmakers of both parties agree that
it is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
They are working on a separate bill that would include 1.9
billion dollars for U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and one
billion dollars for training and intelligence operations.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here today with Hong Kong
entrepreneur William Lee and his party.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also head of the United Front Work Department of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
highly praised Lee for his support of education developments in
inland areas and thanked him for helping the flood-stricken
regions this year.
</P>
<P>
William Lee, president of the Main Power Electrical Factory
Ltd. of Hong Kong, today donated 3.24 million yuan (390,000
U.S. dollars) to build 10 schools in the flooded areas along the
Yangtze River and in Guizhou Province. He will also finance the
education of 600 poor middle-school students so they can complete
their studies.
</P>
<P>
These donations are part of the 1998/1999 project under the
"Main Power Education Development Scheme," which is sponsored by
Lee and was established to share a certain proportion of his
company's profits to help the development of education in China's
poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
This project helped build 8 primary schools and one middle
school in Guizhou and Hubei provinces and Guangxi Zhuang and Inner
Mongolia autonomous regions last year.

<HEADLINE> Refug Problem Serious in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of
Assistance and Social Reintegration Albino Malungo has said the
country's refugee problem "is the worst now than any other time."
</P>
<P>
At present, Malungo said, there are 284,000 refugees now
relying on government assistance.
</P>
<P>
Malungo blamed this on the undeclared war by the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Angola
Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a preliminary program set by the government, it takes 18
months to resettle all refugees. However, due to the current
crisis in the peace process, a total of 37,000 people which had
been resettled now once again turned into refugees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of Angolan refugees in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) which is estimated to be 28,000 is still
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Angola has to resort to international assistance to ensure the
basic living of refugees. But the minister noted, so far only 45
percent of the 91-million-U.S. Dollar-grant promised by the World
Bank has been realized.
</P>
<P>
The government also cooperates with foreign non-government
organizations to implement a series of special programs to help
refugees.
</P>
<P>
During the over 20-year-old civil war, the number of refugees
in Angola has once reached more than three million. Even now
there are still one million refugees receiving assistance from
Angolan government and various international aid institutions.

<HEADLINE> New Company in HK to Manage Holding in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
will set up a new company to manage the substantial holding in the
Hang Seng Index constituent stocks acquired by the Exchange Fund
in the recent stock market operation.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new company, called Exchange Fund Investment Limited, will
act as a fund manager of the Exchange Fund and manage the Hong
Kong equity portfolio in accordance with the guidelines issued by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on the advice of the Exchange
Fund Advisory Committee, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
"To address the concerns on the potential conflict of interest
that may arise from the government's ownership of these shares and
the Monetary Authority's role as the regulator of banks in Hong
Kong, the new company will have its own board of directors," Hui
said.
</P>
<P>
"We envisage that the board would have a non-official chairman
and that the majority of the directors would be drawn from
distinguished members of the community, including members of the
Legislative Council," Hui added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the new company is not expected to
engage in active trading of the Hong Kong equity portfolio in
order to avoid giving the wrong impression that the government
continues to operate in the stock market indirectly through the
new company.
</P>
<P>
The company is also responsible for safeguarding the interests
of the SAR government in these share holdings and advising the
financial secretary on major voting decisions which may have
significant financial and corporate governance implications.
</P>
<P>
"Although the new company is not to conduct active trading of
the portfolio, it is responsible for identifying value-added
opportunities for the eventual disposal of the shares with minimum
disruption to the market," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Hui noted: "But I must emphasize that the SARG is prepared to
hold these shares as a long-term investment and has no intention
to dispose of them in a hurry," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be a private limited company and will be
subject to the full regulation of the Securities and Futures
Commission in exactly the same way as any other institutions
engaging in similar businesses in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Labor Party Unveils Final Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Labor Party
Wednesday night unveiled its final advertising drawcard of the
election campaign only hours before the midnight television and
radio blackout.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard delivered a final impassioned
television plea to voters in the final free-to-air broadcast of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party will also air a new 30-second advertisement
appealing to voters to think about their preferences, with polls
predicting a photo-finish result Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Labor aired its final ad early in the evening and has no more
advertisements up its sleeve, after a four-week advertising
campaign attacking the Liberal's Goods and Services Tax and
pushing its jobs message.
</P>
<P>
The battle for votes will switch to the newspapers from
midnight, when the Australian Broadcasting Authority electronic
blackout takes effect.
</P>
<P>
With the polling day just three days away, the massive
discrepancies between the four major opinion polls make it
difficult to pick the outcome of the 1998 federal election.
</P>
<P>
It is a far cry from 1996, when with one notable exception the
night before the polling day, all the polls predicted a clear win
for the coalition throughout the election and were ultimately
proven right on the night.
</P>
<P>
This time around, one poll has had the two parties neck and
neck (Newspoll), another has had Labor turning around an early
deficit to take a narrow lead (AC Nielsen), a third says Labor has
dramatically closed the gap after trailing by 10 points (Bulletin)
while the fourth (Morgan) says Labor has been streets ahead
throughout the entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder voters and political parties have been left
scratching their heads about the outcome Saturday with a landslide
win to either party the only option out of the question.
</P>
<P>
The most consistent of the polls has been Newspoll, which has
never had the parties more than two points apart (it recorded the
Liberal 43 percent over Labor 42 percent in its latest release),
and has recorded movement of less than four points over the course
of the entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
One interesting postscript is the near unanimity of the polls
in determining Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party.
</P>
<P>
While they may differ wildly on the major parties, all agree
support for One Nation at the start of the campaign was nine or 10
percent, and has slipped since to seven percent.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Immigration
Department has introduced a canine squad in its efforts to ward
off illegal immigrants, Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS)
said in its teletext broadcast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These dogs are posted at the Woodland border checkpoint to
sniff out human cargo coming through the border crossing between
Singapore and Malaysia, TCS said.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Department took the move following the arrest
at the Causeway of 12 illegal immigrants who were found hidden in
a camouflaged compartment of a bus, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the teletext, these dogs were primarily trained by
the Civil Defense to sniff out survivors under debris and they now
will add some bite to the bark.
</P>
<P>
Because of their limited number, these dogs will only be used
selectively during the week and only at the Causeway, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The use of the canine squad was the latest step in a string of
measures of the Immigration Department to stem the tide of illegal
immigrants crossing the border.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, EU to Solve Dumping Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will hold talks with the
European Union in November aimed at clinching a trade association
deal snagged on accusations of dumping of its agricultural produce
in the European markets.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to meet again in Cairo in November to bridge as
many gaps as we can," Gamal Bayyoumi, assistant foreign minister
for EU partnership was quoted Wednesday by the English daily the
Egyptian Gazette as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Bayyoumi, Egypt's top negotiator with the
15-nation bloc, there are three or four major issues that are not
settled.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU are negotiating a partnership agreement on
issues including agriculture and trade liberalization under the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership launched by the EU and 12
Mediterranean countries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations have been drawn out mainly because of
disagreements over Egypt's export quotas of food and agricultural
produce.
</P>
<P>
In July, the European Commission called for five-year
anti-dumping duties averaging 12 percent on imports of unbleached
cotton fabric from Egypt, China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. A
final decision will be made on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Bayyoumi said differences over agricultural issues continued to
dominate the negotiations as technical issues were almost
resolved. He did not give any details.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever Europe enters into an agreement, it's agriculture
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping duties on cotton have angered Egypt. Some
Egyptian businessmen suggested finding alternative trading
partners in Africa where Egypt is the largest cotton producer.
</P>
<P>
But Bayyoumi was sceptical about shunning European markets. "I
don't encourage slogans like that... It is not a matter of one or
the other," he said, adding that it would be feasible for Egypt to
expand trade relations in all directions.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Egypt's main trading partner. Egypt's annual imports
from the EU average 5 billion U.S. dollars, while exports are
about 1.7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Situation to Be Calmed Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The situation in
Lesotho has turned stable, following one-week military
intervention by the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
Streets in the war-torn capital of Maseru have once again
become crowded in the day while Lesotho police, together with
troops from South Africa and Botswana, are still patrolling
around the city, a witness, who asked not to be identified, told
Xinhua in a telephone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In Maseru, you can't hear gun-fire any more, but streets in
the city remained dirty following days of looting, shooting and
arson," the witness said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the worst refugee crisis which resulted from Lesotho
turmoil has also appeared to be over in South African border
towns, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday afternoon, the number of refugees from Lesotho has
dropped from 1,300 to 700 in Ladybrand, about 20 km from Maseru,
local daily Business Day quoted the city's police as reporting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been in turmoil since early August when opposition
parties claimed that the May 23 general election was rigged in
favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The government of the mountain kingdom had apparently become
paralyzed before the SADC resorted to military intervention at
the invitation of Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili on
September 22.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Improves International Standing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Chen Xin
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China has enjoyed rapid
economic development since the implementation of the reform
and opening-up policies in 1978, with overall national strength
increasing sharply and closer links with the global economy,
greatly improving the nation's international standing.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) show that
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew from 362.4 billion yuan
in 1978 to 7,477.24 billion yuan (about 902 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1997. China currently ranks seventh in the world in gross terms
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The nation's average annual economic 9.8 percent growth rate
for the past twenty years ranked first in the world and was some
6.5 percentage points higher than the world average.
</P>
<P>
China's 1997 output for major agricultural and industrial
products such as grain, cotton, steel and cement ranked
first in the world, with the nation's power output ranking the
second and crude oil output, the fifth.
</P>
<P>
The opening-up policy has yielded notable achievements over the
past two decades, with broad areas currently opening up to the
outside world. China's 1997 foreign trade volume hit 325.1 billion
U.S. dollars, an annual increase of 15.6 percent and 14.8 times
the 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
The nation ranked 10th in the world in terms of 1997
international trade, up dramatically from 27th place in 1978. The
1997 export volume hit 182.7 billion U.S. dollars, or 3.3 percent
of the world total. The import volume ended the year at 142.4
billion U.S. dollars and accounted for three percent of the global
figure.
</P>
<P>
China's export structure has improved significantly, with
primary products contributing a mere 13.1 percent of the 1997
total, compared to 46.6 percent in 1981. The proportion of
manufactured goods grew from 53.4 percent to 86.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in foreign trade sparked a sharp increase in
China's foreign exchange reserves, with 139.9 billion U.S. dollars
in reserves at the end of last year, ranking second in the
world. The nation's foreign exchange reserves at the end of 1978
stood at only 167 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
SSB economists noted that the strong position of foreign
exchange reserves has laid a solid ground for countering financial
risks, promoting the nation's international status and maintaining
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up policies have also led to a large
influx in foreign capital. Actual foreign investments stand at
348.3 billion U.S. dollars, with some 90 percent of investments
coming from the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
China leads developing countries in terms of the volume of
overseas investment and has ranked second worldwide in each of the
past five years. China used 64.41 billion U.S. dollars in overseas
investment in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
China has also witnessed rapid growth in international tourism
over the past 20-odd years. The industry earned 12.1 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign exchange in 1997, with the figure ranking
eighth in the world and represented a 45-fold rise on 1978.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth continues and the living standards of
Chinese people continue to improve. SSB figures revealed that
consumer spending has jumped by an average annual rate of 7.3
percent over the past 20 years, with the current level ranking
amongst the highest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Macao Enters Crucial Period in Transition: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here Wednesday afternoon that Macao has entered the final stage of
its transition period and the upcoming 400-odd days will be very
crucial to the steady transfer of power and smooth return of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
made the remarks to more than 1,300 guests and celebrities at a
banquet marking the 49th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
During the period, many key issues concerning Macao's smooth
handover have to be resolved well in accordance with the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, and preparations for
establishing the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) have
also to be done in good order, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China and Portugal will steadfastly
enhance cooperation and make concerted efforts to resolve well
the various issues concerning the transfer of power in Macao in
the attitude of being responsible to history and all people in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to unite more Macao people from various social sectors
for their participation in the affairs related to the transition
period and the establishment of the Macao SAR," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang reiterated that the stationing of troops in the future
Macao SAR symbolizes China's resumption of sovereignty over Macao
and will be a major factor for maintaining social stability and
economic development in Macao after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"After Macao's return, the troops sent by the central
government to manage defense affairs in the Macao SAR will not
intervene internal affairs of the SAR, and the military expenses
will be covered by the central government," Wang Qiren said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wang extended heartfelt thanks to the
compatriots in Macao for their support to the motherland's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive, and their assistance to the
people in the flood-hit areas this year.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira expressed congratulations on
the 49th anniversary of the founding of New China. He said at the
gathering that both China and Portugal have set a good example for
the international community with their shared commitment of
cooperation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Sino-Portuguese relations based on mutual
respect will go on and be strengthened in the future.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Capitalizing On Overseas Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of this
year, China's Zhejiang Province managed to avoid the negative
effects of the Southeast Asian financial crisis and had 9.4
percent growth, with exports worth 5.8 billion U.S. dollars, up
15.6 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The province's success is largely attributed to its strategy of
taking advantage of both domestic and overseas markets, one local
government official said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is one of China's fastest growing provinces, but its
limited space and resources have seriously hampered its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The opening up and reform efforts of the past 20 years have
changed Zhejiang from an agricultural province to an economically
strong one with a well developed industrial base.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Zhejiang used international industrial
restructuring for a strategy of opening up to the outside world
and now has eight state-level economic and technological
development zones and 34 open cities and counties, two of them on
the coast.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the province's imports and exports have increased
29.9 percent annually. The export volume in 1997 was 11.2 billion
U.S. dollars, 190 percent more than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, development zones and open cities used 2.8 billion
U.S. dollars of overseas investment, 8.5 times the 1992 amount.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Woos Tourists From Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has invited travel
agents from Czech Republic and Slovak Republic to embark on a
five-day tourism promotion trip as part of a campaign to tap
emerging potential markets in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said Wednesday that it
organized the trip to promote the Amazing Thailand 1998-99
Campaign and allow the agents, many of them newcomers to Thailand,
a chance to see the country for themselves.
</P>
<P>
As the Czech and Slovak markets are growing dramatically, the
number of Czech and Slovak visitors to Thailand surged by 54
percent to 6,737 in 1996 over 1995 and jumped another 9.8 percent
to 7,400 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 statistics showed that Thailand is becoming more
popular among the Czechs and Slovaks, especially the retired.
First-time visitors rose 41 percent to 4,885 and non-group
tourists rose 23.16 percent to 4,199 in 1997. The number of
business travelers nearly doubled, albeit on a small base of 364.
</P>
<P>
Although the Czech and Slovak markets are relatively small
compared with the total number of tourist arrivals of over 7.2
million in 1997, they are still an important market in Eastern
Europe which holds nearly a 24 percent share of the market.
</P>
<P>
The Czech and Slovak markets are particularly interesting to
Thailand because their growing number of affluent people are
diverting their interest away from the same old destinations in
Europe and looking for other interesting places offering new
experiences and cultures, the TAT said.

"And here lies the danger, since if any party goes to the
extremes and use such arms, the fallout will afflict the whole
region," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The president called for rechanneling the money spent on such
weapons into other spheres of avail to poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader gave the interview on the occasion marking
the 25th anniversary of the October 6 war, in which the Egyptian
army took Israeli forces by surprise and crossed the Suez Canal,
which Israel had held since capturing Egypt's Sinai peninsula in
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Egypt and Israel have been rather cool despite
that Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty
with the Jewish state in 1979.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process, the Egyptian leader said Israel does not
want to return rights to their owners and refuse to let peace
prevail.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the Israelis want to live on the logic of war
which is absolutely unacceptable and does not conform to the
interests of the peoples of the region, including the Israelis
themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis are working toward a deal on a
U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank. The peace process has languished for over 18 months
over Israel's settlement building and their differences over
Israeli withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Israel Has Not Accepted U.S. Initiative: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel has not yet accepted the
U.S. initiative on breaking the Mideast peace deadlock,
Palestinian Ambassador to Washington Hassan Abdel-Rahman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat made the remarks in an interview with
the Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio broadcasts from Washington where
he participated in talks held between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks yielded the decision to have U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. peace coordinator
Dennis Ross return to the Middle East to follow up the tentative
progress made in the Washington round of talks, according to
Abdel-Rahman.
</P>
<P>
"They will pursue efforts to convince Israel to accept the
initiative in light of the U.S. administration's belief that the
Israeli stance is closer to accepting the American proposals," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Rahman said the second meeting between Arafat and Clinton
focused on U.S.-Palestinian relations, while the tripartite
meeting grouping Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu tackled the U.S. initiative.
S25151CAB032I30TAQL18:4218:461584
</P>
<P>
As both sides push for a breakthrough to a 18-month peace
impasse, Washington is planning for an extended summit of Israeli
and Palestinian leaders to be hosted by Clinton to try to nail
down an agreement on a U.S. peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to end the deadlock in the peace process, the
U.S. proposed that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, an amount Israelis said created too much of a security risk.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest negotiations, Israel would agree to withdraw
from 13 percent of the land if 3 percent of the territory was set
aside as a nature reserve that could not be developed by either
side.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador defended Arafat's acceptance of the presence of
a nature reserve covering 3 percent of Israel's withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a Palestinian concession because the reserve is a
Palestinian one under the full control of the Palestinian National
Authority in terms of management and civil affairs. Security
responsibility will be shared with the Israeli side," he added.

</P>
<P>

economic difficulties resulting from the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Adopt Tight Financial Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said that his country will adopt a tight financial and
monetary policy to ensure economic stability and make the banking
system and corporate finance healthier, news reports said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Measures must be taken to impose tighter controls on foreign
exchange trading," Khai said at a three-day national conference on
People's Councils and Committees which opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam must cut down the use of foreign currencies to reduce
trade deficit in the face of decreasing exports and crack down on
smuggling and trade frauds, he added.
</P>
<P>
The state budget should be allocated in a way that priorities
are given to investment in the country's development to reverse
the economic slide and ensure debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation requires us to make wide-ranging
adjustments, especially to the economic growth and other major
economic targets," said the prime minister, adding that proper
attention should be paid to in-depth development to overcome the
weaknesses of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The investment restructuring will focus on the development of
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, as well as the rural economy,
Khai noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that if the country fails to establish a
stable foundation for agricultural and rural development, it will
plunge into an even more difficult socio-economic situation as has
happened in several other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The Asian countries, which are Vietnam's traditional markets,
have been hit hard by regional economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Inch Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Share prices ended the day
on marginal gain on the Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as the
smaller-than-expected cut in U.S. interest rates Tuesday brought
little encouragement to the market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) managed to keep its
nose above Tuesday's level with a 1.14 point rise to 939.65 points
at close amid profit-taking activities.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover declined to 111.62 million units valued at
148.97 million Singapore dollars (88.41 million U.S. dollars).
Losers edged out gainers by 124 to 71 while other 207 were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Van DH was the most active stock of the day as it had a
turnover of 10.25 million stocks traded. It was followed by AFP
that had 7.13 million units done. KepLand was next with 5.66
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Ho Royal was the top gainer of the day as it rose by 50 cents
to 1.29 Singapore dollars at close. Transmarco moved up 39.5 cents
to finish at 1.30 Singapore dollars. DBS F edged up 20 cents to
end at 6.80 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was again the biggest loser of the
day as it lost 70 cents to close at 15.50 Singapore dollars. OUS
dropped by 24 cents to finish at 0.90 Singapore dollars. GE Life
shed off 20 cents to end at 6.90 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was let down in the morning session
over a smaller-than-expected cut in U.S. interest rates. The U.S.
Federal Reserve decided to trim the Federal Fund rate by 0.25
percent to 5.25 percent, short of expectations of a 0.5 percent
cut.
</P>
<P>
After the market digested the news, light third quarter window
dressing helped the index recoup earlier losses, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Matchmakers Disappear in Chinese Countryside (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Matchmakers, or Mei Po,
were once influential people who arranged marriages for young
Chinese men and women who were sometimes unable to meet due to the
lack of a formal introduction.
</P>
<P>
Mei Po not only bargained for betrothal gifts and dowries, but
were also often entrusted to arrange wedding ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Elderly women accounted for the vast majority of China's
traditional matchmakers, and the term Mei Po (old women
matchmakers) was laced with a mixture of respect and sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
Anecdotes about Mei Po abound in China, with some depicting
them as warmhearted and willing to help lovers meet, and still
others depicting them as arrogant and snobbish individuals who
often resorted to trickery.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, their authority was undisputable and in the words
of one Chinese saying: "The proper way to contract a marriage is
by the command of parents and through the good offices of a
go-between".
</P>
<P>
Despite the glorious past of her profession, Yu Wenguo, a noted
Mei Po in Zhengding County in north China's Hebei Province,
found she could no longer find clients. Yu was thus forced to earn
her livelihood by raising chickens.
</P>
<P>
Yu, 62, made the bitter decision to abandon matchmaking after
she failed to find a mate for Wu Yujun, a young farmer living in
the same village.
</P>
<P>
"I spent a great deal of time and found several potential wives
for Wu, but he eventually sought the services of a modern
matrimonial agency and eventually married a girl from southwest
China's Sichuan Province," said Yu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese society is continuing to exhibit greater openness along
with modernization and an increasing number of young people prefer to
engage in the free courtship rather than resort to introductions
to strangers. Parents, in fact, no longer pressure youngsters to
seek the help of a Mei Po.

<HEADLINE> Matchmakers Disappear in Chinese Countryside (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The influence of matchmakers has continued to wane since the
founding of New China in 1949, and the government has
consistently advocated freedom for the country's younger
generation to arrange their own marriages.
</P>
<P>
Professional matchmakers initially disappeared from cities,
and are rapidly losing their appeal in the nation's vast
countryside. However, the change has been slower in less developed
rural areas which are most often slow to respond to social changes.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, each of 120 villages in neighboring Zhaoxian
County had as many as a dozen professional matchmakers," said
Yu. "Now, however, it's extremely difficult to find even one Mei
Po in many villages."
</P>
<P>
Modern agencies, which are mushrooming in rural areas, are
rapidly gaining popularity with the young farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Queqiao (matchmaker) Marriage Service Center in Zhongpingle
Village, which is located some 10 km from Yu's home, receives
between 20-50 inquiries from young farmers on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
"I opened the center in 1984. Elderly local residents accused
me of corrupting public morals and I had no clients for a long
period," according to Manager Liang Guoxin. "However, things
started to change after I found my wife by running ads in a number
of newspapers."
</P>
<P>
Liang's wife is from southwestern China's Yunnan Province which
is located several thousand kilometers from Hebei.
</P>
<P>
"I currently publish pamphlets carrying detailed information
about my clients," said the smiling Liang.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey carried out by five coastal and interior
provinces revealed that nearly 70 percent of married couples
living in the Chinese countryside found spouses on their own, with
most young single farmers preferring to find romance without
outside help.

<P>
Xu Fengxian, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, noted that the disappearance of Mei Po has mainly
resulted from economic development in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He said matchmakers began to disappear from villages in coastal
regions in the early 1980s because the said regions experienced
economic development much earlier than interior areas. He noted
that matchmakers are still popular in underdeveloped regions such
as Shaanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the market system rapidly emerging in China has
provided young farmers with greater freedom to choose a
satisfactory spouse.
</P>
<P>
China's migrant population of well over 100 million people
consists of mostly young men and women from rural areas leaving
their homes to engage in various economic activities and
exchanges in cities.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes are taking place in terms of marriage concepts
due to the influences of urban life," said Xu. "Young people now
have the opportunity to find marriage partners in places far from
their home villages."
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongfa, an official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs
which is in charge of marriage registrations, described the
disappearance of Mei Po from the Chinese countryside as a "very
positive sign".
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance of matchmakers will have a significant
impact on the government's efforts to improve the quality of the
Chinese population and promote inter-regional economic exchanges,"
said Liu.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Limits Tree Felling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has set an annual
limit of 500,000 cubic meters for the tree felling, with this
year's target at 401,000 cubic meters, in a bid to protect the
forest resources.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper published here Wednesday quoted Helder
Muteia, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Fishery, as saying
Tuesday that only about 185,000 cubic meters have been permitted
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Muteia said that illegal felling, especially those by foreign
companies were still rampant in the country, adding that at least
30 percent of the tree felling were done by those illegal
fellers.
</P>
<P>
He said that many trees have been felled and left rotten owing
to untimely transportation.
</P>
<P>
The official said that some sellers have brought bad image to
the country's timber business for their mal-practice.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the situation, the government has recently adopted
some measures which include promulgating felling regulations and
issuing licenses to tree fellers for better protection of the
country's resources and timber business, Muteia said.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-long war in the country has greatly hurt
mozambique's timber industry, but Muteia said that he was glad
that timber processing industry is regaining its vigor.

<HEADLINE> Ex-L.A. Only Black Mayor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Tom Bradley, the only
black mayor of Los Angeles, died Tuesday at the age of 80 after a
heart attack at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Bradley suffered a stroke two years ago which left him unable
to speak since then.
</P>
<P>
Bradley's career was a series of firsts for the nation's
second-largest city and an inspiration to a generation of black
politicians who fought their way into mainstream political life by
following his example and building coalitions that crossed and
conquered racial divides.
</P>
<P>
As a son of a poor sharecropper, Bradley was the first black
lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department, the first black
member of the Los Angeles City Council, the first African-American
elected mayor and the longest serving mayor in the city's history,
serving a record five terms from 1973 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
"He was a builder, bringing a remarkably successful Olympic
games to Los Angeles, encouraging a thriving downtown and
improving mass transit," U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Riordan, who succeeded Bradley in 1993, said,
"This is a very sad day for Los Angeles, but also a day to
remember all the great things Tom Bradley did for our city."
</P>
<P>
After taking office in 1973, Bradley, who once called racism
"America's greatest evil," changed the face of city government by
appointing minorities and women.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Airways Resumes Flight to London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Airways is expected to
resume its Lagos-London flight on November 4, 18 months after it
was banned from flying the route by the British government on the
ground of poor safety standard.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the Nigerian national
carrier and the British Airways Tuesday in Lagos, Nigeria Airways
will use a Boeing 747-400 aircraft of the British Airways on the
resumed route.
</P>
<P>
The flights will leave Lagos on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
and return from London on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Breaking the news to the media, Nigeria Airways Managing
Director Alhaji Jani Ibrahim said the commercial agreement was to
"ensure that Nigeria Airways resume fully in its own capacity the
London route."
</P>
<P>
British Airways West Africa manager Andy Ster said the
agreement is mutual beneficial and would help Nigeria Airways
fulfill its key role in the development of the Nigerian aviation
market and as a very important gateway to the West African
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
British authorities banned Nigeria Airways in May last year
for alleged poor safety standard of the national carrier. Nigeria
responded immediately by banning British Airways from flying into
its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian new leader General Abdulsalami Abubakar ordered the
immediate resumption of airlinks between the two countries in
July, shortly after which the British Airways restarted its
London-Lagos flight.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is also seeking to restore direct airlinks with the
United States, as its relations with the West have improved under
the new leadership of Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Nosedive in Tokyo as Fiscal Half Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday with the Nikkei index dipping to a new 12-year low as
the first half of Japan's fiscal year ended amid a fresh batch of
bad news about the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 415.04 points, or 3.0
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 13,406.39, the day's low.
</P>
<P>
The index easily slipped below the previous 12-year low of
13,597.30 marked on September 17.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, fell 19.33 points or 1.82 percent to
1,043.57.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section jumped to an estimated 565
million shares from Tuesday's 391.44 million shares. Of the 1,337
issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced gainers 813 to
353, with 113 issues ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said Wednesday was widely expected to be a day of gains
as investors dressed their portfolios with mainly blue-chip shares.
</P>
<P>
However, it turned into a selling orgy that resulted in 136
issues falling to lows for the year.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares plunged 4.96 percent on the aftershock of two
leasing firms related to the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
(LTCB) going under earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Japan Leasing Corp. and its wholly owned Japan Leasing Auto
Corp. both have filed for bankruptcy protection and together hold
debts totaling 2.31 trillion yen (about 17 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
People are nervous, said a dealer, adding that a lot of
problems are circulating around and investors can't feel good
about owning stock.
</P>
<P>
Although analysts welcomed news of a 0.25 percent cut in the
U.S. federal funds target rate, a key short-term interest rate,
they said this had already been factored into the market since
U.S. monetary authorities were expected to make the cut.

<HEADLINE> Changing Residence Permit Situation In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation that takes
effect tomorrow will do away with the subsidies for non-stable
foods like meat, eggs, and milk, that Beijing residents have
enjoyed for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that many privileges enjoyed only by permanent
residents of cities and towns have already gone as a result of the
market economy, so residence permits are gradually losing their
pull in the lives of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The first residence permit system in China was adopted by the
National People's Congress in 1958 with a regulation that divided
the Chinese residents into rural and urban sectors and placed
rigid and strict restrictions on the migration of farmers to the
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Shen Tirui, a Public Security Ministry official, says that the
strict system was necessitated by low productivity before the
reform and opening up policies were started in the late 1970s and
that an agrarian society was needed to provide sufficient food for
the country. In addition, cities without developed industrial and
commercial sectors could not provide a large number of farmers
with jobs at that time.
</P>
<P>
Li Shulin, 34, a farmer in the village of Caohuang village in
the city of Taizhou in northern part of Jiangsu Province, says,
"Although residence permits in urban areas don't mean much
nowadays, they used to stand for a stable and secured life with
guaranteed medical treatment, education, and employment, and we
really envied that."
</P>
<P>
Li uses housing to show what he means. Most farmers had to use
their life-long savings to build houses for their children's
families.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Adopt Tight Financial Policy: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will adopt a tight
financial and monetary policy to ensure economic stability and
make the banking system and corporate finance healthier, Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai said.
</P>
<P>
Khai made the remarks at a three-day national conference on
people's councils and committees which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Measures must be taken to impose tighter controls on foreign
exchange trading," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam must cut down on using foreign currency to
reduce the trade deficit in the face of falling exports and crack
down on smuggling and trade fraud.
</P>
<P>
The state budget, Khai said, should be allocated in a way that
prioritizes development investment to reverse the economic slide,
and ensure debt repayments.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation requires us to make wide-ranging
adjustments, especially to economic growth and other major
economic targets," the prime minister said, adding that proper
attention should be paid to in-depth development to overcome the
weaknesses of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Investment restructuring will focus on developing agriculture,
forestry and fisheries and the rural economy, Khai noted,
stressing that if the country fails to establish a stable
foundation for agricultural and rural development, it will plunge
into an even more difficult socio-economic position as has
happened in several Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have long been Vietnam's traditional markets,
but the economic crisis has hit them hard. So Vietnam "need to
make proper adjustments concerning export markets", the prime
minister said.

obtain either domestic or overseas loans from October 1.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the central bank Monday to

the organization and operations of foreign banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
Licenses for the establishment of local banking institutions
will be issued pursuant to the prevailing regulations. The
government will soon issue new rules in line with the law on
banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
Joint-stock banks in which the state does not hold any stake
can restructure their capital by selling shares to the state.
</P>
<P>
The maximum duration of capital restructuring is expected to be
two years from the date the law takes effect.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor of the state bank Le Duc Thuy has ordered banks
to stop all operations which the two new banking laws do not
allow, and to issue new internal regulations that suit these laws.

during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The research center is not a propagandistic or a media
center. We focus on facts, documents and research. We give
other people a chance to interpret the documents," Youssef
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the documents have been categorized into three
general classes of crimes as recognized by international law,
namely crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
For now, only contents about the first two categories are
accessible on the website. The section entitled 'crimes against
peace' shows two documents of 23 and 20 pages each, which
have been scanned in and provided with English translation.
</P>
<P>
The section 'crimes against humanity' has only one document of
one page. It detailed how a high ranking Iraqi army official
informed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of preparations for
operations against Kuwait on July 31, 1990, the same day that
Kuwait and Iraq held talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on ways to
keep peace.
</P>
<P>
The website is designed and maintained by Professor
Khaled Al-Manekh at the Communications and Navigation Institute.
</P>
<P>
According to Youssef, the document put on the Internet
are samples of about 500,000 official documents left by the
Iraqis when they were evicted from Kuwait in 1991.

As a result, 22 essential industrial products recorded high
growth rates or reached over 70 percent of the yearly plan,
including electricity, coal, steel, electrical motors, beer,

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian court has
ordered the arrest of a student leader who studies in Poland for
allegedly obtaining 50,000 U.S. Dollars by false pretences.
</P>
<P>
The order to arrest Jonathan Urassa, the chairman of the
Tanzania Students' Association in Poland, was given by the Kisutu
Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam, the state-owned
Daily News said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Principal Resident Magistrate, Projectus Lugazia, however,
adjourned the case to October 21 as Urassa who is still in Poland
will be required to answer the charge.
</P>
<P>
The court Tuesday claimed that Urassa withdrew 50,000 U.S.
Dollars, with a forged letter from PBG Oddzial Bank in Lodz,
Poland, between September 25 and 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
The said amount of money, property of government, was intended
to be used for tuition and allowances for Tanzanian students in
Poland.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that Urassa forged the letter, purporting to be
written by Tanzania's Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher
Education.

<HEADLINE> First Foreign Insurance Company in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- This May, the Shanghai
branch of the American International Assurance Co. Ltd.(AIA) moved
back to its original location on the Bund, where its precursor had
been in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Xu Zhengguang calls the move a returning
home. AIA is the first foreign insurance company to do business on
the Chinese mainland. Its Shanghai branch opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that Shanghai's location on the Yangtze River Mouth is
a favorable one for his company and that its economic base and
stable development policies look good to foreign insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
In the early '90s, Chinese did not know much about insurance
and AIA started a new surge in the quiet insurance business when
it sent agents door to door peddling insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
This system of personal insurance was a gradual return after
having been suspended for 40 years in China. Shanghai now has more
than 15,000 insurance agents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's citizens have also become more aware of the
importance of insurance industry. The life insurance premiums in
Shanghai in 1997 were 5.6 billion yuan (about 700 million US
dollars) and per capita spending was 450 yuan, 10 times the 1992
amount.
</P>
<P>
Gazing out at the Huangpu River from his office, Xu said that
their success in Shanghai over the past six years has demonstrated
the great potential of the Chinese insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Following AIA, four other insurance companies such as Canada's
Manufacturers Life and Switzerland's Witerthur Switzerland have
started business in Shanghai and 40 foreign insurance companies
have set up representative offices here, and the People's
Insurance Company of China's monopoly of the insurance business
has ended.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general Shen Jianzhong of the Shanghai Association of
Insurance Companies, said that the opening up of China's insurance
business has brought in foreign capital and introduced a more
advanced system and competition to the insurance industry.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Largest LAN market in Asia-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China remained the
largest local area networks (LAN) market in the Asia-Pacific
region in the second quarter of this year, according a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
said in the report that China was close to 30 percent share of the
region's LAN markets excluding Japan.
</P>
<P>
"This is equivalent to a quarter-on-quarter growth of close to
50 percent in revenue terms," the IDC report said. "China's
information technology and telecommunication infrastructure
continues to provide LAN vendors with growth opportunities."
</P>
<P>
LAN is referred to networks created out of a certain class of
networking equipment which is tailored to communication over a
short distance.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of China, Australia and India, all other
markets in the region showed negative quarter-on-quarter growth
rates, IDC said. Australia and India LAN markets managed to stave
off significant declines as these markets continued to received
attention from LAN vendors.
</P>
<P>
The IDC report found an overall 12.6 percent decline in revenue
for LAN markets in Asia excluding Japan in the second quarter when
compared with the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The region's LAN markets have been relatively safe from the
currency crisis, but the impact has finally hit in the second
equipment which is tailored to communication over a short
distance.

<HEADLINE> Another Commercial Bank Collapses in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Prudential Bank has become
the fourth commercial bank thrown out of the clearing house at
the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) amid a nearly one-month banking
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources told Xinhua Wednesday that at least another
one or two small banks run by Asian-origin Kenyans are much
likely to follow the suit soon.
</P>
<P>
Prudential Bank was closed down at noon Tuesday due to failure
to honor checks worth only 10 million Shillings (some 170,000
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Bankers Association suspended Prudential Bank from
its membership later the day. The bank now is under the statutory
management of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Reliance Bank, whose management and directors are
facing fraud charges in the High Court, Trust Bank and Bullion
Bank were taken over by CBK due to a run by depositors, leading
to a rising panic in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The chief banking manager at the Central Bank of Kenya, Reuben
Marambii, said Tuesday that Prudential's failure to honor checks
was an indicator of a liquidity problem.
</P>
<P>
However, he was quick to calm fears among depositors, saying
the move need not cause panic withdrawals as the problem could be
rectified if the owners acted quickly to provide funds.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Stresses Labor Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Efforts must be made to expand
and diversify the market for labor export, the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of Vietnam has said.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam News Wednesday, the Political Bureau,
Vietnam 's highest policy-making body, issued an instruction to
this effect on September 22.
</P>
<P>
It said the export of both specialists and workers, together
with the creation of domestic employment, is crucial to Vietnam's
long-term strategy for developing a workforce suitable to
modernization and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Export of labor and experts contributed to developing human
resources, resolving unemployment, generating income and improving
skills for workers, said the instruction.
</P>
<P>
It also said labor export also increases revenues in foreign
currencies for the country and strengthens cooperation between
Vietnam and other countries,
</P>
<P>
Activities in this field must be carried out in accordance with
the market mechanism and under the state's control, the
instruction noted.
</P>
<P>
The Politburo stressed the need to promote training of skilled
workers and experts to ensure the competitiveness of Vietnamese
labor, raise the percentage of highly-skilled labor and improve
the management of guest workers and experts.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports here, around 45,000 Vietnamese
workers have been exported to foreign countries so far. They
remitted home annually about one billion U.S. dollars over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam's labor export has met with more difficulties
since the beginning of this year due to the impact of Asian
financial crisis. Most of Vietnamese workers in South Korea have
been repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Vietnam is on the rise. The jobless rate has
risen from 5.88 percent of a 36 million labor force in 1996 to an
estimated seven percent of 38 million people of working age this
year, according to official reports.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Mayor Sentenced to Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Supreme Court of
Appeals Wednesday decided to approve the sentence of 4.7-year
imprisonment for pro-Islamic Sincan Mayor Bekir Yildiz.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz was found guilty by the Ankara State Security Court
last October for both provoking religious enmity and providing
assistance to an outlawed armed gang.
</P>
<P>
On February 13 last year, the Ankara State Security Court
ordered the arrest of the former Sincan mayor, who was removed
from his office as a result of rendering support for illegal
religious activities.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the commemoration of "Al-Quds (Jerusalem)
Night" on January 31, 1997, Yildiz called for a Sharia-based
state system and this led to his removal four days later.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 people were reportedly arrested with the former
Sincan mayor for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
Police had earlier handed over to the court prosecutor
statements made by the accused as well as some cassettes and
anti-secular practices and rhetoric.
</P>

It was reported that Yildiz praised some extremist

<HEADLINE> China Introduces Standardized Bankruptcy System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Shi Yongjie, the former
director of the first State-owned enterprise in New China to
declare bankruptcy, now owns a private plant and recently received
local government recognition as a model taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Explosion-proof Equipment Plant, Shi's former
company, failed to use assets to retire its debt and was declared
bankrupt on August 3, 1986.
</P>
<P>
"The small factory, which employed 72 people, had total fixed
assets of 200,000 yuan and debt of over 430,000 yuan," said Shi,
adding that "bankruptcy was an inevitability."
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Shi opened an electric appliance switch
manufacturing company in northeast China's Liaoning Province. He
hired 30 employees, including a substantial number of laid-off
workers. Staffers from the bankrupt company also found new jobs
within a six month period.
</P>
<P>
"The bankruptcy of the Shenyang company represented a milestone
in the reform of industrial enterprises in China," according to
Lin Muxi, deputy director of the Economic Research Institute at
Liaoning University.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of bankruptcies represents an important
measure for regrouping state assets. It will not only eliminate
poor enterprises, but will also activate and restructure limited
stock assets to promote greater economic efficiency," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy long remained an unfamiliar concept to Chinese
citizens following the founding of New China in 1949, especially
to people working for State-owned enterprises. Under the planned
economy, Enterprises simply engaged in production, with the State
supplying raw materials and purchasing all their products, and were
not required to operate in a competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
However, the country shifted from a planned to a market economy
in late 1970s and enterprises have since been required to
establish markets for their products. Fierce market competition
has caused some firms to amass sizable debts, with others forced
to declare bankruptcy due to poor management, unmarketable
products and a lack of operating funds.

<HEADLINE> China Introduces Standardized Bankruptcy System  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government has adopted a series of measures to
accelerate the reform of State-owned enterprises in order to
extricate the sector from the current difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcies are an important component in the ongoing reform
of State-owned enterprises. Other measures include adoption of the
modern enterprise system, industrial restructuring, enterprise
mergers, leases, the joint stock system, and a reemployment plan.
</P>
<P>
China promulgated its Bankruptcy Law in 1988, with considerable
success achieved in standardizing related procedures. Some 360
acquisition and bankruptcy cases were reported in 56 cities during
1997, with state assets flowing from loss-making operations to
large enterprises groups.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is home to 1,000 medium- to large-sized enterprises,
or close to 10 percent of the total number of related operations
nationwide. Problems such as inefficiency, outdated technology and
equipment, poor product mixes and financial setbacks have plagued
numerous enterprises of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The province's first large State-owned enterprise declared
bankruptcy in 1994, with 16 bankruptcies in 1995 and an additional
62 enterprises failing in 1996. The pace has slowed somewhat, with
caution prevailing to percent social instability and various other
problems.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang's Li Ming Garment Group became one of China's first
major garment produces to merge with a bankrupt firm -- the
Shenyang No.2 Woolen Mill which formerly employeed 4,000 people
and had total assets of 150 million yuan. The group invested 70
million yuan which enabled the mill to restart operations, with
the venture generating 1997 pretax profits of five million yuan
from the production of raw materials for the group.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict even more bankruptcies and mergers in China in
the wake of the central government decision to extricate all
loss-making firms from the red within three years.
</P>
<P>
However, industrialists point to certain irregularities in
handling bankruptcy cases. For example, the property of some
enterprises evaluated below actual value, full transparency fails
to apply to the disposition of assets and mortgage banks loans are
not retired on a priority basis. Related factors have resulted in
an extremely low debt discharge rate for bankrupt enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The asset value of bankrupt enterprises is often far beyond
the capabilities of buyers, with cashability rates often much
lower than expected. Assuring adequate unemployment compensation
for laid-off workers also remains a big problem," according to Han
Yaoxian, director of the Shenyang Bankruptcy Office.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will allow the
fundamentalist Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) to come to the
country as long as it registe{c!under the Societies Act.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted chief government spokesman,
Information Minister Newstead Zimba as saying here Tuesday that
"The law in Zambia is very clear. Any society or organization is
free to register under the Societies Act as long as its
constitution or rules are not repugnant or inconsistent with any
existing law in Zambia."
</P>
<P>
He said the registrar of Societies will evaluate their
application as he does for all other applications and will decide
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Times of the United States recently reported that the IPK
intended to set up its movement in Zambia and other Southern
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The IPK is reported to be under investigations by the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for possible connections with
the car bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam last month.
</P>
<P>
The party's most outspoken charismatic street preacher Sheik
Khalaid Balala has openly boasted that "The IPK has intentions of
setting up similar movements in Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia and
Uganda," according to the U.S. magazine.
</P>
<P>
Balala was once put on charges of treason by the Kenyan
government and serious violence erupted in Mombasa of Kenya
between IPK supporters and other Moslems in 1993 amid allegations
that attacks on IPK were government sponsored, Times reported.

provide 4.8 million Hong Kong dollars and 825,000 U.S. dollars
respectively for China's flood-stricken areas, UNICEF's

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai Coalition Aims to Consolidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A new political marriage was
sealed Tuesday as the Chart Pattana Party (CPP), Thailand's third
largest political party, accepted the invitation from the ruling
coalition to join the government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the newly-founded alliance is intended to boost
the coalition government's strength in the parliament to 257 MPs,
enough to give Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai a breathing space as
he waits for the battered economy to pick up.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government consists of the Democrat
Party, Chart Thai Party, Social Action Party, Solidarity Party,
Seritham Party and 12 Prachakorn Party MPs who defected to the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The coalition is desperate to lure CPP into the government as
its 206-seat slender majority in the lower house has been shaken
by a corruption scandal and the possible expulsion of the 12
Prachakorn Thai legislators from their party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Public Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana and
his deputy Thirawat Siriwansan, both Social Action Party members,
were forced to step down over the scandal that the ministry has
ordered hospitals to buy medical equipment at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 12 Prachakorn Thai rebels, known as the "cobra
group", are facing threat of expulsion from their party and thus
lose their status as legislators.
</P>
<P>
Without the 12 Prachakorn Thai seats, supporters of the
coalition would fall less than half of the total 389 members of
parliament. In that case, Prime Minister Chuan might be forced to
dissolve the parliament and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers said a dissolved parliament is the last thing Chuan
wants to see as the Democrat leader hopes to go through the next
few months to ensure passage of key economic legislation and buy
time for the economy to show concrete signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the inclusion of the 51-MP CPP
becomes the most convenient way to ensure the coalition
government's majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, from the very beginning, the marriage is far from a
happy one, as the existing parties all have to sacrifice some of
their portfolios to the new "bride".
</P>
<P>
With the bargaining still under way, words are going round that
the CPP will take at least 10 posts in the government, including
one deputy prime minister post, two at the Prime Minister's
Office, industry minister and a deputy, public health minister and
a deputy, labor minister and a deputy, and a deputy interior
minister.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the CPP had asked for some economic
portfolios, but the Democrats won't let them go for fear that the
work on the economic crisis might be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that by bringing in the CPP, Chuan risks losing
other allies. The abrupt resignation Tuesday of Montri Pongpanich
as leader of the Social Action Party and growing resentment of the
"cobra" faction could be only minor signals of worse things to
come.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the CPP has a reputation as an unpredictable force
which likes to flex its muscles and rock a government's boat.
</P>
<P>
The party's populist maneuver against tax measures led or
contributed to the resignation of two finance ministers in the
former Chavalit Yongchaiyudh government.
</P>
<P>
The fragile coalition atmosphere created by the CPP also sped
up Chavalit's downfall.
</P>
<P>
Despite the CPP's reputation, the Democrat Party takes the
marriage as a gambling and counts on a honeymoon to ensure
coalition peace.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are betting on the economy taking off early next
year. If that really happens, the CPP will have to think twice if
it is inclined to rebel.
</P>
<P>
So far, the dice has been cast, and all the parties concerned
are waiting anxiously to see what will come out of it.

<HEADLINE> Plastic Limb Implants Next on Surgeons' List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Doctors may soon be fixing
 broken bones with dissolving plastic implants to take the agony
out of traditional nuts and bolts surgery.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday
that engineers at New Zealand's Auckland University, in
conjunction with German medical researchers, are set to patent a
bio-degradable polymer which dissolves once shattered bone knits,
replacing traditional metal plates.
</P>
<P>
The development means patients could be spared surgery to
remove titanium plates once broken bones have healed.
</P>
<P>
Plastic composites are flexible, light and cope better with the
growth of new bone, according to the NZPA.
</P>
<P>
Though the plastic is slightly more expensive than traditional
materials, surgeons hope to recoup costs by avoiding the
operations to remove the metal plates, it said.
</P>
<P>
The stiffness of metal plates could impede bone growth and slow
healing, project leader professor Debes Bhattacharyya of Auckland
University's Center for Composite Research was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Initial tests suggested that the plastic composite did not
react with human tissue and could be absorbed into the body
without side-effects, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the NZPA, German researchers are planning clinical
trials.

KUALA LUMPUR -- The World Bank is closely monitoring Malaysia's
current experiment with capital and currency controls in coping
with its financial crisis, according to the Malaysian national

</P>
<P>
It is hard to predict what the impact these controls would have
on the Malaysian economy in the long-run, Bernama quoted Masahiro
Kawai, chief economist at the bank's East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office, as saying. Malaysia, severely affected by the
regional financial crisis, imposed earlier this month monetary
controls in efforts to stimulate its domestic economy by shielding
the money market from the rest of the world through capital
controls and by pegging its currency at a fixed exchange rate.

plant produces chemical weapons. But Sudan has denied.

SHENYANG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning Province
leads the country in urbanization, having added 11 county-level
cities since 1990.
</P>
<P>
It now has 31 cities, a 55 percent increase from 1990, an
average 2.1 cities for every 10,000 square kilometers of land. The
urban population is above 16 million, accounting for 39.9 percent
of the total in the province, 5.8 percentage points higher than in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Some 88.7 percent of the GDP in the province this year, nearly
324 billion yuan, was generated in the cities.
</P>
<P>
Living conditions in urban areas have greatly improved, in gas
supplies, disposal of garbage, environmental protection, in
culture and education, and in health care.

<HEADLINE> Hoteliers Search for Missing Media Pack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hoteliers in Bangkok have
found it hard to have enough foreing media contingent coming to
stay in Bangkok during the 13th Asian Games this December.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of the rooms reserved for the travelling media
have been booked so far, according to figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the city's hoteliers, who had been expecting to host a
large number of foreign reporters to cover the games, said the
number thirteen is not known for bringing luck, therefore there i
s no exception when it comes to booking for the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"The economic problems in Asia seem to be the major cause for
the late booking, but we are still confident to welcoming three
thousand foreign media," said Prakit Chinamourphong, secretariate
of Thai Hotels Association and member of the Press Village
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the forein media had booked just 383 hotel rooms from
the total reserved 2,420 rooms.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers from China, Japan and South Korea have made the
most reservations. But most countries have not made any bookings,
even though they have been urged to numerous times, he said.
</P>
<P>
The committee conceded that one possible factor causing the
low bookings was the late issuing of press credentials by the
organizers. The credentials are needed when making a booking. The
committee is now trying to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The lack of bookings has forced the committee to postpone the
deadline for registration from August 15 to September 15 and
then, once again to October 15 -- 50 days before the games begin.
</P>
<P>
Prakit said if the bookings remained low, the committee would
withdraw the service and let the hotels sell the rooms themselves.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the committee expected 5,000 foreign journalists to
attend the games and reserved 2,420 rooms in 14 hotels.
</P>
<P>
The committee has now reduced the number of participating
hotels to six with only 1,130 rooms reserved.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farming More Important To China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Dairy farming has become a
major part of Chinese agriculture, agronomists at a recent dairy
science and technology meeting in the capital of China's Gansu
Province, were told.
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumed 6 kg. of milk last year, one-fifteenth of the
world's average. This came from 6.63 million tons of milk
annually, or 1 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
China needs to develop dairy farming, which consumes less
grain, because of its large population. Dairy farming consumes 65
percent less of grain than pig raising to produce the same amount
of protein, specialists explain, and China has about 500 million
hectares of grassland that could feed cows.
</P>
<P>
Annual milk output could be almost double if more dairy
technology were applied.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have long called attention to the country's
low-protein diet, pointing to milk as the best choice for protein
because ordinary Chinese have low levels of meat consumption
anyway.
</P>
<P>
Recently the State Council listed dairy farming as one of the
key areas of developmental priority and one week in June has been
designated as "milk week", during which there will be a promotion
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The country's milk consumption has grown five-fold since
1980.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Monitoring Malaysia's Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 30 (Xinhua)-- The World Bank is closely
monitoring Malaysia's current experiment with capital and currency
controls in coping with its financial crisis, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to predict what the impact these controls would have
on the Malaysian economy in the long-run, Bernama quoted Masahiro
Kawai, chief economist at the bank's East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, severely affected by the regional financial crisis,
imposed earlier this month monetary controls in efforts to
stimulate its domestic economy by shielding the money market from
the rest of the world through capital controls and by pegging its
currency at a fixed exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The measures are declared by Malaysian officials as temporary.
</P>
<P>
"We are now watching several countries which have been
successful in adopting capital controls -- if these controls are
directed at preventing massive inflows of capital, then some
measure of controls are useful," the bank official was quoted as
saying at a press conference to launch a report entitled "East
Asia: The Road to Recovery."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, richard Newfarmer, principal author of the report,
said Malaysia's exit from the financial storm would depend on
whether the control measures were temporary or were extended over
several years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's success would also depend on how the government used
this period of time to swiftly move on its reform agenda and
inspire domestic and foreign confidence in the economy, Newfarmer
said, adding: "Then perhaps (the measures) would have a positive
outcome."
</P>
<P>
Newfarmer warned of "severe costs" which such controls, if
extended, would have on the economy as it could produce evasion
and corruption "because capital looks for ways to get out when it
wants to get out."
</P>
<P>
The report says that East Asia's crisis is unique in that it
has "fused a currency crisis, banking crisis and a regional
financial panic into a particularly virulent strand of economic
malady."
</P>
<P>
This has led to severe recession in Thailand, South Korea,
Indonesia and Malaysia with spillover effects in the Philippines
and other smaller East Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends a three-point strategy for recovery:
enacting governance, financial and environmental reforms to
stimulate sustainable growth; protecting low-income groups from
the social impact of the crisis; and revitalizing international
capital flows by restoring investor confidence.

BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.5
on the Richter scale hit Xainza County in the Tibet Autonomous
Region at 10:29 a.m. Beijing Time (02:29 GMT) today, according to
the State Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was 30.4 degrees north latitude and
88.5 degrees east longitude.

<HEADLINE> Changing Residence Permit Situation In China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation that takes
effect tomorrow will do away with the subsidies for non-stable
foods like meat, eggs, and milk, that Beijing residents have
enjoyed for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that many privileges enjoyed only by permanent
residents of cities and towns have already gone as a result of the
market economy, so residence permits are gradually losing their
pull in the lives of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The first residence permit system in China was adopted by the
National People's Congress in 1958 with a regulation that divided
the Chinese residents into rural and urban sectors and placed
rigid and strict restrictions on the migration of farmers to the
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Shen Tirui, a Public Security Ministry official, says that the
strict system was necessitated by low productivity before the
reform and opening up policies were started in the late 1070s and
that an agrarian society was needed to provide sufficient food for
the country. In addition, cities without developed industrial and
commercial sectors could not provide a large number of farmers
with jobs at that time.
</P>
<P>
Li Shulin, 34, a farmer in the village of Caohuang village in
the city of Taizhou in northern part of Jiangsu Province, says,
"Although residence permits in urban areas don't mean much
nowadays, they used to stand for a stable and secured life with
guaranteed medical treatment, education, and employment, and we
really envied that."
</P>
<P>
Li uses housing to show what he means. Most farmers had to use
their life-long savings to build houses for their children's
families.

"Urbanites, on the other hand, were far much luckier, because
their children could get jobs and flats from the government after
they graduated and their monthly rent only took about one percent
of their salaries," he says.
</P>
<P>
But, things have changed a lot in China since the early
1980s. Because of the rapid economic growth and use of farm
machinery, agricultural productivity has increased a great deal
and large numbers of rural people have been freed from farmwork
and have gone to cities to make more money.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of demography at the People's
University in Beijing, says that the government has relaxed its
residence policy bit by bit. In 1984, farmers were allowed to work
or do business in cities, but without food stamps. And, by the
early '90s, many provinces registered farmers with stable jobs and
residences in cities as probationary urban residents who got the
same treatment as urbanites.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, also deputy dean of the university's department of
demography, goes on to explain that the ID Card system in 1989
signified a major change in China's registration system and
further eased restrictions and helped develop the market economy.

The growth in township enterprises also helped to fill gaps in
the economy, culture, medical treatment, and education between the
cities and countryside. In some parts of east China where there
was a developed economy, farmers' standard of living was better
than that of urbanites and some urban residents even sought work
in rural areas.

"I no longer admire and envy urbanites," Farmer Li says, "We
have more choices than they do because we can not only do farm
work at home, but also go to make money in the cities."

<HEADLINE> NGOs Take up Post-Flood Rehabilitation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Non-government organizations
(NGOs) in Bangladesh have undertaken a massive post-flood
rehabilitation program alongside with the government's efforts to
overcome the colossal damage caused by the deluge, The Bangladesh
Observer daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs had adopted a post-flood rehabilitation program of 5
billion taka (106.4 million U.S. dollars) at the initial state,
Dr. Qazi Faruque Ahmed, chairperson of the Association of
Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program includes providing special interest-free loans and
normal microcredits, reconstruction of houses and rural
infrastructure, distribution of vegetable seeds, cleaning and
repairing of tubewells, construction of flood-shelters, and
introduction of food-for-work and cash-for-work schemes.
</P>
<P>
The fund may go up to 10 billion taka (212.8 million dollars)
if resources were available from the donors and the international
community, the ADAB chief said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed emphasized the need for expanding the microcredit
operations on a wide-scale to help flood-stricken people to recoup
their losses and start their lives anew.
</P>
<P>
NGOs now need more fund to give fresh microcredits to
borrowers, whose repayment had already been suspended due to the
floods, and expand the program to new people worst-affected by the
floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
ADAB and NGO officials are now holding talks with
representatives of donor countries and organizations to arrange
fund for the post-flood rehabilitation program, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up Second Steel Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will set up its
second largest steel plant at the Makandura Industrial Park in
North Western province of the country, according to the industrial
Development Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An investment of 5.5 million U.S. dollars on the project is
from a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture aims to produce 50,000 tons of steel annually
for the country's growing construction industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's first steel project at Oruwala in Sabargamuwa
Province was established in the mid 1970's.
</P>
<P>
While it was initially considered a major success, production
fell due to labor unrest. Consequently it was unable to meet the
growing demand of the booming construction industry that Sri Lanka
has witnessed in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 23 acre Makandura Industrial Park on which the
government has spent 200,000 U.S. dollars for infrastructural
development has attracted other industries as well, according to
the ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central and Eastern
European countries should adjust their foreign economic policies
and renew the traditional cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
This was the view shared by visiting Croatian Prime Minister
Zlatko Matesa and his Romanian counterpart Radu Vasile during their
meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Matesa noted as they practiced West-oriented foreign economic
policies in the past years, most of the Central and Eastern
European countries suffered frequent setbacks in the extremely
fierce competitions.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the countries enjoyed a long history of
economic cooperation which was neglected in the 1990s, urging for
its renewal as well as more balanced foreign economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Matesa arrived here Tuesday morning for a one-day official
meeting, aiming to push forward the bilateral economic cooperation.

<P>
During their meeting, the two prime ministers agreed that the
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries had far
greater potentials to tap, particularly in electronics, energy,

reconstruction of Bosnia and Croatia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The people of Beijing are
experiencing the warmest September in 62 years, according to local
records.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing Daily quoted sources at the Beijing Observatory
as saying that this is the third September with average
temperatures above 22 degrees Celsius since 1841. The second was
in 1935.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the continued warm weather has added 3
degrees Celsius on average to temperatures in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Warm weather began to hover over the Chinese capital at the
beginning of September, hitting a high of 31.5 degrees Celsius on
September 6. Average temperatures for the first ten days of the
month were 2.5 degrees higher than in previous years. On September
25, the city had another high of 30 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Lei Zhenfa, head of Beijing's Meteorology Station, says that
the high temperatures were caused by relatively stable warm air
and high humidity. The high temperatures also have something to do
with the city's abnormal weather like the 11 warm winters.
</P>
<P>
Some meteorologists attribute the warm weather to the El Nino
phenomenon, which has disrupted air circulation in northern China
and delayed the coming of cool air.
</P>
<P>
Global warm weather over the past decade or more and the
increasing discharge of carbon dioxide and deterioration of forest
areas are also given as the causes of warm weather.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Hopes NLD Will Become Constructive Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
encouraged the National League for Democracy (NLD), a major
opposition party, to become a responsible member of the community
and a constructive force in helping the country along the path to
a strong and stable democracy.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement issued here Wednesday, the government
said it is working hard to develop Myanmar and hopes the NLD will
contribute in a positive and meaningful way to creating a better
life for the people.
</P>
<P>
The official information sheet also said the government is
concerned over a "decree" issued by the NLD on some laws enacted
by the government after September 18, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The NLD-formed "Committee Representing the Parliament Elected
in the 1990 General Election" issued an announcement on Monday
saying it would submit some laws promulgated after then for
approval, rejection, amendment and review by the parliament which
was unilaterally formed on September 16.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a latest statement of the NLD, a total
of 961 of its members -- 202 parliament representatives-elect and
759 organizers -- have been detained by the authorities since May
27.
</P>
<P>
The government said it has allowed 14 NLD members to return
home recently in "batches" after "housing" them for several weeks
at the state guest houses. More will be permitted to return home
if the NLD leadership cooperates, it added.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said its detained members were "interrogated" by the
authorities.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Minister Meets U.S. Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton met with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
Tuesday, sharing the desire to maintain momentum of development in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
They agreed on the importance of following up the summits
between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held since last
October and implementing their agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited the United States last October and Clinton
returned a visit to China in late June. The two leaders agreed to
build a constructive strategic relationship for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived Sunday for his first visit to the U.S. since
becoming foreign minister earlier this year, said that expanded
cooperation and exchanges showed bilateral ties were improving.
Clinton agreed that the relations had entered a new stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised China's effort to keep its currency strong in
the Asian financial crisis, saying China had proven itself as a
stablizing force in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
"The president has pledged to continue to work with China in
stablizing the world economic situation and to expand cooperation
in various fields," said a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman Mike McCurry said after the meeting that
the president reassured the Chinese delegation of its support for
China's accession to the World Trade Organization on commercially
viable terms.
</P>
<P>
Tang visited the State Department around noon for talks with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. It is said that the two
foreign ministers have contacted with each other five times since
early this year, but this was the first time they met face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
Before their meeting, Albright said the talks would cover
cooperation in security, nonproliferation, trade, the Korean
Peninsula, human rights and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
"So that is a full and even daunting agenda, but the United
States and China have proven that even in areas where we have
differences we are capable of making progress that benefits both
of our countries," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that working together to build a constructive
strategic partnership between the two countries followed the trend
of history, and it was the right choice.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's domestic problems would not harm Sino-American
relations because the improvement in relations accorded with the
strong common wish of the two peoples and served the fundamental
interests of both countries, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton himself has made very important and valuable
contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations, which
we'll never forget," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Taiwan question, at the core of
Sino-U.S. relations, would have to be handled carefully.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton reiterated the U.S. policy on the question
of Taiwan, and actually, he reiterated the 'three no' policy in

Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said at the meeting that
the construction of pipelines to transport Caspian oil and natural
gas to Europe is a huge project with a broad prospect in the next
century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Have Ways of Solving Dongting Lake Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are suggesting
that the laws of nature need to be considered in improving the
flood-control capacity of China's Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
The lake figured in this summer's devastating flood problems
and the Hunan provincial government has decided to put over 1,200
square kilometers of reclaimed land back under water to expand the
lake area to 4,000 square kilometers, similar to what it was in
1949. It was partly because of land reclamation around the lake
and silting of the Yangtze River that floods in the Dongting Lake
area have become more frequent.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the reclaimed land in lake areas badly
needs to be re-submerged because those areas are the most
vulnerable to flooding. Embankments in these areas, mainly around
the mouth of the Yangtze and Xiangjiang rivers, are becoming
hopeless in spite of efforts to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Areas to the north of the Dongting lake, where the earth crust
is rising, do not need to be changed, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
Because the the earth has been sinking and river beds in some
areas rising, new protective embankments on the higher beds need
to be built.

LIMA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Gross Domestic Product in
August grew by 4.8 percent, compared with the same month a year
ago, Minister of Economy and Finance Jorge Baca Campodonico said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Peru's economy grew by 0.2 percent in June and 2.1 percent in
July after a respective 3.5 percent and 4.4 percent fall in the
GDP in April and May.
</P>
<P>
That marked the recovery of the Peruvian productivity in the
face of the "el Nino" phenomenon and the Asian economic crisis,
Baca said.
</P>
<P>
He said the consumer price index of September is going to
decrease by 0.4 percent, which means the highest deflation level
in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Baca, the drop would be consistent with the goal
set by the Peruvian government for 1998, which is a deflation
below 8 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The city government of
Chengdu, the capital of southwestern Sichuan Province, has issued
a circular promoting the use of such clean energy like natural and
liquefied petroleum gas as well as electricity, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
From now on, hotels, teahouses, restaurants and work units'
dining-halls applying for permission to operate in the city will
have to use clean energy, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
All of the businesses will have to use clean energy before June
30 in the year 2000. Those who refuse to ban coal in favor of
clean energy will see their businesses license revoked and pay
severe penalties.
</P>
<P>
The move aims at improving Chengdu's air quality. Coal now
creates 50 percent of air pollution, said Duan Yisheng, director
of the Science and Technology Division of Environmental Protection
Bureau of the city.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, when Chengdu's economy started to develop,
most local residents and restaurants used low-quality coal
produced locally.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the local government had taken measures to improve
the environment. Now 90 percent of Chengdu's residents use natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
The city now ranks 7th among the leading 50 large cities in the
country in terms of environmental status.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Bank May Seek Shares Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's only non-State bank
has decided to focus on serving small and medium-sized enterprises
and is seeking listing on the domestic stock market, today's
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The China Minsheng Banking Corp. will provide five billion
yuan (600 million U.S. dollars) in credit to small and medium-sized
firms over the next three years, bank officials said yesterday at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank will cooperate with government
departments to design a mechanism to hedge risks of loan repayment
defaults. Measures under consideration include the establishment
of mutual guarantee funds financed by these firms.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said it is wise for Minsheng to pursue such
a strategy considering its much weaker financial power compared to
China's banking giants.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 60 percent of Minsheng's loans are
granted to small and medium-sized firms. The bank's new decision
implies that the proportion could rise.
</P>
<P>
A source at the securities market said that the bank is doing
preliminary work for a share listing. It has not submitted its
application to securities regulators as the scheme has yet not to
be approved by the bank's board.
</P>
<P>
If Minsheng's listing plan is endorsed by its board members and
approved by the securities watchdog, it is likely to become the
third listed bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The first is the Shenzhen Development Bank, which is now the
market leader at the Shenzhen bourse. Sources said the Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank has already applied for listing.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng was launched by the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce in early 1996. The bulk of its shareholders are
private companies.

condemned the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and
did not allow its territory to be used for the purpose of
instigating, planning, financing or supporting terrorist
activities in other countries," the statement said.
</P>

Iran's denial was prompted by charges against Mamdouh Mahmud
Salim who was arrested in Germany earlier this month after flying

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani on Tuesday evening appointed Pandeli Majko, general
secretary of the ruling Socialist Party (SP), as the new Prime
Minister and instructed him to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Majko, 30, who is also the SP's parliamentary group leader, was
expected to discuss soon with leaders of other parties in the
ruling coalition the formation of the new cabinet, which would
then be submitted to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Majko was chosen by the SP's supreme executive committee
earlier Tuesday to replace Fatos Nano, who resigned late Monday
after two weeks of violent street protests called by the
opposition Democratic Party after its deputy leader was
assassinated earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
A key figure in the 1990 political movement, Majko joined the
SP in 1991 and was elected the party's general secretary in 1997.
He has been in parliament since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Majko told reporters that he was facing two major challenges:
the adoption of a constitution and the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
A draft Albanian constitution was rejected in a referendum in
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Majko said there was a need to hold constructive political
dialogue with the opposition on the constitution issue.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the Kosovo crisis was a severe threat not only
to Albania, but also to the security of the Balkans and other
regions.
</P>
<P>
Majko beat Deputy Prime Minister Kastriot Islami and State
Secretary Ilir Meta, two other candidates proposed by the SP's
executive committee, during a five-hour debate and secret ballot
on Tuesday.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Voters are resisting the central policies of both major
parties--the Coalition's tax reform with a GST and Labor's job
creation target of 500,000 -- in the final days of the election.
More people prefer Labor's tax package without the Liberals' GST,
and more than half say it will be a big influence on their vote.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Tax and jobs are dominating the crucial final days of the
election campaign, with new research claiming the GST (Goods and
Services Tax) will destroy 200,000 jobs in its first year, and
Labor planing legislation before Christmas to kick start jobs
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Victoria's gas shutdown is turning into a national crisis,
with major industries in other states facing serious disruption or
closure and economists warning of a slump in Australia's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Coalition's tax reform package has come under fresh
attack, with the release of independent economic modelling that
claims it could cost 200,000 jobs in its first year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Argentina Tuesday
handed to Brazil the Triple Border Command made up of forces of
Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, at Argentina's port of Iguazu.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Interior Minister Carlos Corach praised at the
hand-over ceremony the tripartite force.
</P>
<P>
Corach said the Triple Border Command, created four years ago,
is one of the examples for coordinated efforts by neighboring
nations.
</P>
<P>
Corach also underscored the need to reinforce resources and to
enhance security equipment to fight against trans-border crimes,
such as drug trafficking, terrorism and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Brazil starts its turn of the command Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Eastern China's Tide-Watching Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The tide-watching festival
on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province, will be
held October 6-10.
</P>
<P>
The festival has been held annually since 1994 and has
attracted some 3 million tourists to the city of Haining on the
northern bank of river, and Xiaoshan on the southern bank.
</P>
<P>
The two cities will stage cultural, economic and trade
activities, including a gong and drum flotilla on the river and a
leather garments fair, in addition to the tide-watching program.
</P>
<P>
The tides on the Qiantang are a strange phenomenon. Scientists
say that the bell-shaped mouth of Qiantang River near the city
helps form the tidal change, which can be as high as 3.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only the mid-August festival on the traditional
Chinese calendar, which falls on October 5 this year, was
considered a good time for tide-watching, but scientists say that
the spring tide there is also interesting.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Farmers Earn Money From Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- He Jijin, a farmer in the
Beichen district of north China's Tianjin Municipality, is very
grateful to the Internet for helping him improve his chicken farm
and bring in much larger orders.
</P>
<P>
He and his family are now running the largest chicken-breeding
farm in north China. In the past, he sold about 2 million chicks
annually, but this year he has already received orders for 3
million chicks, simply because he is now on-line with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Using the Internet, he is able to follow and analyze the market
and publicize his chicken farm. He has learned from the Internet
that there were great opportunities in the Romanian egg market, so
he is now preparing to set up chicken farms abroad.
</P>
<P>
He Jijin's case is not unusual in the Beichen district, as the
people there have established a science and technology information
center affiliated with 12 other towns, which has helped heighten
the local farmers' awareness of the importance of information.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers are now eager to get on-line in Beichen. Some
farmers, though not well educated themselves, ask their children
to learn about computers so they can link on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xushu, a farmer in Beichen's Xiditou village, said, " on
the Internet, I have brighter eyes and sharper ears."

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Hundreds of Artworks in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Fire destroyed an art gallery
on a main downtown street in Bandung, capital of Indonesia's West
Java province, early Tuesday, reportedly incinerating hundreds of
works by famous artists, the Jakarta Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the works destroyed were the late Affandi's sketch Wajah,
Nude by Henk Ngantung and Bali Oh, Bali by Heri Dim. The newspaper
did not say whether all of the works were originals.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the damage to Galeri Braga, the paper said, a
neighboring furniture store was also gutted by the fire.
</P>
<P>
Eleven fire engines eventually brought the fire under control.
</P>
<P>
Located on a street famed for its row of antique and art
stores, the gallery is one of the largest in Bandung. It was set
up in 1990 and inaugurated by then mayor Ateng Wahyudi.
</P>
<P>
The gallery's security guard named Endang said the fire was
believed to have originated from the furniture store at 1:30 a.m.
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> High Technology to Play Important Role in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- High-tech industry will be a
focus on the Maoming Municipal Government's working agenda for the
coming years, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quoted Wang Zhaolin,
secretary of the Maoming Municipal Committee of the Communist
Party of China, as saying that high-tech would play a major role
in increasing the city's economic efficiency by helping foster new
economic growth areas, adjust economic structure and overhaul
traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural products processing, ethylene post-processing and
mineral processing would be the prioritized areas for high-tech
application, and all the three form the pillars in the city's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Maoming is recognized as one of the leading fruit and
trans-seasonal vegetable producers in the country and the city's
agriculture is contributing 28.1 percent of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city is a major oil processing and ethylene
production base in China, boasting an annual oil processing
capacity of 13.5 million tons and annual ethylene production
capacity of 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The city is expecting emergence of a group of heavyweight
high-tech firms, which have their own brand name products.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the city would expand capital input in
high-tech projects by reforming the technological investment
system and enlarging the government budget for the sector.
</P>
<P>
Maoming would seek closer links with colleges and research
institutions in an attempt to bring in better technology, talented
people and patents, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Quakes Kill One, Damage Hundreds of Houses in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Two earthquakes struck
Indonesia late Monday and Tuesday morning, killing at least one
person and damaging or destroying hundreds of houses, national
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first earthquake was recorded at 6.3 on the Richter scale
and took place at 8:34 p.m. on Monday. The tremor was felt in
Central and East Java and Bali.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency reported that the
epicenter of the quake was believed to be located in the Indian
Ocean at a depth of 177 kilometers, some 90 kilometers south of
Blitar in East Java.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit area was East Java province's districts of
Trenggalek, Tulungagung, Malang and Blitar.
</P>
<P>
In Blitar district, Bakung subdistrict was the most affected
area where 45 houses were destroyed. Two people were seriously
injured when the roofs of their homes collapsed.
</P>
<P>
A 40-year-old woman was found dead under the ruins of her
flattened houses in Bantur district, 45 kilometers south of
Malang. In Malang district, The quake ruined 142 houses in 13
subdistricts.
</P>
<P>
In Trenggalek, at least 25 houses were damaged and four others
completely destroyed, with landslides reported to have taken place
along roads and hills.
</P>
<P>
In Bali province, the quake destroyed many stretches of the
road connecting the subdistrict of Munjungan and that of Tawing.
</P>
<P>
The quake was also felt in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara
province. No casualties were reported there.
</P>
<P>
The second earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale hit at
3.28 a.m. Tuesday. Its epicenter was near the Talaud Islands,
about 310 kilometers northeast of Manado in North Sulawesi
province, which is well-known its for coconut and clove
plantations.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Talaud said they felt the tremor, but there were
no reports of damage.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said a series of four other undersea quakes,
ranging in magnitude from 4.5 to 5, were recorded on Monday night
south of the Talaud Islands, about 2,500 kilometers northeast of
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Engkon Kertapati, an official of the geology research division
of the directorate general of mineral resources, told reporters
that the recent earthquakes, judging from their epicenters, were
caused by a shift in the Indo-Australia plate colliding with the
Eurasia plate in the Indian ocean seabed.
</P>
<P>
More potentially dangerous earthquakes could occur due to
movements in other great fault areas: the Sumatra Fault running
along that island, the Palu-Koro Fault passing Palu in Central
Sulawesi and Digul Fault in Irian Jaya, Engkon said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Insists on U.N. Investigation of U.S. Bombing Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudan said Tuesday
that it is the duty of the U.N. Security Council to send a team
to investigate into the August U.S. bombing of a Sudanese
pharmaceutical plant.
</P>
<P>
"We want back our factory, which we built with our toil and
sweat, and which cost us millions of dollars," Sudanese Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail told the U.N. General Assembly
session.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States must compensate Sudan for the loss of
the plant where Sudan produced more than 50 percent of its
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The United States said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary as
U.S. intelligence showed the plant produces chemical weapons. But
Sudan has denied.
</P>
<P>
"We wonder why the Americans are opposing sending of a
fact-finding mission if they are so sure of their own findings,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held consultations Monday on an
Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding a U.N. investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world rejected the American aggression and its
justification," said Ismail.
</P>
<P>
He said the Arab League, the Organization of African Unity,
the Non-Aligned Movement, The Group of 77 and large sectors of
U.S. community all supported the Sudanese demand.

SAN JOSE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's international
reserves have had a 25 percent fall during the year, the central
bank reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's currency reserves fell from 1.141 billion U.S.
dollars, on last December, to 910 million U.S. dollars currently.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the central bank's president, Eduardo Lizano,
said that the situation is under control and does not
represent a danger whatsoever for Costa Rica's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank's president, the reserve's fall
is due to minor capital income in short term investments.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The red tides appearing at
Liaodong Bay in the northern part of the Bohai Sea are expanding
and moving south to the central part of the sea at a fairly rapid
speed, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the State Oceanographic Administration (SOA)
disclosed that by September 24, the area of the red tides had
expanded to about 5,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
On September 18, an SOA oceanic monitoring plane found that in
the western parts of Liaodong Bay the color of the seawater was
unusually different from that in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Since it is now a busy season for fishery production, the SOA
has required the coastal counties and cities near Liaodong Bay to
be on the alert for red tides by strengthening monitoring work and
to be ready to take emergency measures against unfavorable effects
on fishing.
</P>
<P>
The coastal areas along the southern parts of the Bohai Sea
have also been required to keep their eyes open for oceanic
environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
The SOA has set a plane and a ship to carry out comprehensive
monitoring on the expanding red tides.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Testifies He Never Refused to Star in Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan testified
Monday that he never refused to act in a 1991 basketball film
that flopped without him.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls star stood in a courtroom and testified that
he never broke a promise to star in the film "Heaven is a
Playground."
</P>
<P>
"I maintained enthusiasm about the project. I wanted to
participate, even when filming was postponed several times while
the producers sought financing," Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said he even agreed to return the 50,000 U.S. dollars
producers paid him up front and offered his signature to help
draw prospective backers when financing hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble played the role for Jordan in the movie at last, but
it made just 168,000 dollars at the box office. The producers a
ccused of Jordan breaking his promise, and they are seeking
between 16 million to 20 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
When attorney Dean Dickie asked whether Jordan, "as the
greatest basketball player ever," had considered how successful
the film would have been with him in it, Jordan said: "I guess I
should assume that I'm the greatest basketball player. I try to
be the best I can be." And he added: "I haven't really thought
about how the film might have turned out. I haven't seen it."
</P>
<P>
He said both sides agreed to postpone the film, and he has
countersued, alleging that producers knowingly misled him about
financing.

<HEADLINE> Di Canio: Stop Picking on Me </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- English Premiership bad boy
Paolo Di Canio believes he is being victimised for being a
foreigner.
</P>
<P>
The Italian striker faces a long ban for sensationally pushing
referee Paul Alcock to the floor - but in a grudging apology he
accused English players of being jealous of his talents.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio has been pilloried by the media and by leading
figures in the game for his reaction to being sent off for
Sheffield Wednesday in their 1-0 victory over Arsenal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks stepped in when he urged the
Football Association to set an example and "chuck the book at
him" for his "totally unacceptable" actions.
</P>
<P>
While Di Canio admitted the referee had been right to send him
off for his clash with Nigel Winterburn, he still tried to excuse
his behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio said that the clash with Alcock was not all his fault.
</P>
<P>
"Every Saturday, I get kicked around a lot and nobody is there
to protect me.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't fair and it seems to me that the treatment handed
out to foreigners is harsher than what the others get.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the English players are jealous of
foreign players, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, who has returned to Italy with Wednesday's
permission after being suspended by the club, reiterated his
controversial comment that Alcock took a "dive".
</P>
<P>
"I acted badly towards the referee but it was just a slight
push and he took two or three paces back and fell over, just like
a player does when he wants a free-kick.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of play-acting," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
But with Di Canio appearing to dig himself an even deeper hole
with his explanation of the incident, his agent Matteo Roggi
tried to minimise the damage.
</P>
<P>
Roggi said: "he is really sorry for what happened during the
game on Saturday and would like to apologise to everyone for his
actions to the referee, to his manager Danny Wilson, to his
team-mates and the Sheffield Wednesday fans."
</P>
<P>
The FA is set to punish Di Canio after he was charged with
misconduct on Monday, but he feels prejudice against foreign
players could lead to a longer ban than his offence actually
warrants.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to think about it happening, because that would
be extremely serious," Di Canio said.
</P>
<P>
"Last season David Batty of Newcastle gave an identical push
to a referee, perhaps with even more force than I did, and was
suspended for two matches.
</P>
<P>
"Except that the referee didn't fall over. Now if what counts
is whether he falls over or not..," he added.

<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- VfB Stuttgart and Werder
Bremen, both from Germany, completed a stunning UEFA Cup
comebacks after the first round second leg matches on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stuttgart had a thrilling recovery with an injury time goal by
striker Fredi Bobic to win 3-0 at Feyenoord and secure a 4-3
aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
Bremen, who have made the worst start to a Bundesliga season
in their history, also fought back from a first leg defeat to
beat Brann Bergen 4-0 after extra time and go through 4-2 on
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Girondins Bordeaux, the French league leaders, were another
team to leave it late, winning 2-1 at Rapid Vienna for a 3-2
aggregate success with Lassina Diabate scoring the deciding goal
three minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
But there was no respite to the gloom for French rivals Metz.
Despite beating Crvena Zvezda Belgrade 2-1 for their first win of
the season, the teams finished 3-3 on aggregate after extra time
and Crvena Zvezda won 4-3 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
There was no slip-up for English league leaders Aston Villa
who beat Norwegian part-timers Stromsgodset 3-0 for a 6-2
aggregate victory, thanks to a Stan Collymore hat-trick.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool also cruised through to the second round, crushing
FC Kosice 5-0 for an 8-0 aggregate success. Robbie Fowler and J
amie Redknapp speaheaded Liverpool's whitewash with Paul Ince
adding the other.
</P>
<P>
But Blackburn's involvement ended after their 2-2 draw in
France with Olympique Lyon who went through 3-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, who have won their opening three matches in Serie
A and are the top team in Italy, were held to a 0-0 draw by
Hajduk Split in Croatia but went through 2-1 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
However, Schalke 04, who won this competition in 1996-97, were
the first surprise casualties of the night, losing on penalties
to Slavia Prague.
</P>
<P>
Slavia defeated Schalke 1-0 in the second leg with a 17th
minute Richard Dostalek goal that levelled the aggregate score at
1-1.
</P>
<P>
There were no goals in extra time and Slavia went through 5-4
on penalties. Schalke won the UEFA Cup on penalties against Inter
Milan in 1997 and reached the quarter-finals last season.
</P>
<P>
Among other casualties on a night of 31 matches were
Portuguese giants Sporting Lisbon, who were unable to overturn
their home 2-0 first leg defeat by Bologna, losing 2-1 to the
Italians and going out 4-1 on aggregate.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tyson Fails to Collect Medical Reports for Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's advisers
said the tests at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston took
too long and doctors were unable to get the report together in
time for the commission's 5 p.m. Monday deadline.
</P>
<P>
It was said that at least one boxing commissioner of Nevada
Athletic Commission felt upset about the delayed psychological
reports.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Schouten, head of the team that examined Tyson,
sent a letter to commission Dr Elias Ghanem, saying the reports
would be completed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, due to the length of the evaluation process,
the scoring on the psychological and neuropsychological testing
have not been completed," Schouten wrote.
</P>
<P>
Ghanem said he was disappointed the reports were not ready.
The commission meets Saturday to determine whether Tyson will be
able to get back the boxing license.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what is going on, but it is very disappointing,
"Ghanen said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's testing took longer than expected, adviser Jeff Wald
said. Tyson began undergoing examination on Wednesday and it was
completed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to write this up," Wald said. "We can't dictate
to the doctors. They did an incredibly thorough job, and out of
fairness, I don't know why being late would be held against us
since we can't control it."
</P>
<P>
Tyson could regain the license if he passed all the tests, but
Ghanem and commissioner James Nave now say they want to hear
about Tyson's scuffle with two men following a traffic accident
before they make a decision.

OTTAWA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada lowered its
bank rate by a quarter of a percentage point Tuesday after the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board cut its short-term interest rates by
the same margin.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action, "as well as Canada's good underlying inflation
performance, warrant a reduction in Canadian short-term interest
rates," the central bank said in a statement.

After the cut, the bank's short-term rate was lowered to 5.75
percent from 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the first central bank cut in Canada since November
1996.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder to Meet French Leaders in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The incoming German chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder will pay his first foreign visit to France on
Wednesday, three days after an election victory over Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Sunday, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is due to have lunch with French President Jacques
Chirac and then meet French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
German press reports quoted Chirac as saying that he would make
proposals to Schroeder to renew the friendship between Paris and
Bonn and to strengthen the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has evoked controversies during election campaigns by
saying that he would seek to replace the traditional German-French
axis with a Bonn-Paris-London triangle.
</P>
<P>
But he later also tried to dispel fears of a change by pledging
continuity in foreign policy and stressing that the German-French
partnership is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
According to German press reports, Schroeder also plans to
visit U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair before his formal confirmation as German chancellor by the
parliament due late October. He will also pay a visit to Moscow
afterwards.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Little Evidence of Serb Pullout from Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has seen little
evidence that Serb forces withdraw from Kosovo or stop fighting as
demanded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Michael Doubleday said, "At this point, I
think we've got a lot of rhetoric and not much action."
</P>
<P>
"By that I mean there certainly have been statements made by
Serb officials that their activities, their military actions, are
over and done with at this point, but that is not what we have
seen on the ground," he added.
</P>
<P>
Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said Monday government forces
had crushed the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army and that
special police units would be returned to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
But Doubleday noted an international diplomatic observer
mission in the region has seen military activities take place
after those statements were made.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably going to be a day or two before we can make a
full assessment as to whether this, whether any of the statements,
had any meaning at all," Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
NATO is in the last stages of planning for possible military
intervention in Kosovo. But U.S. and other Western officials are
still hoping diplomatic efforts will succeed.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Asian Nations to Take Concerted Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
urged East Asian countries to lower interest rates and increase
spending to stimulate economic growth in the region so as to help
get rid of unprecedented recession.
</P>
<P>
East Asia has everything it needs to restore economic growth so
long as it keeps faith with economic reforms and protects the poor
during the long and difficulty recovery, according to a new World
Bank report "East Asia: the Road to Recovery" released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said interest rates in crisis economies should be
allowed to fall further to spur growth, and a 10 billion U.S.
dollar "concerted fiscal stimulus" by Asian states would have a
"profound" positive impact on the region's prospects.
</P>
<P>
"The task ahead is enormous," the World Bank Vice-President for
East Asia and the Pacific Jean-Michel Severino noted at the press
briefing for the release of the 138-page report. "But economic
growth must resume as soon as possible if the poor and vulnerable
are to be spared from disaster."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, East Asia's road to recovery is based
on a three-point strategy: enacting governance, financial and
environmental reforms to stimulate sustainable growth, protecting
low-income groups from the social impacts of the crisis and
ensuring that they share in the recovery, and revitalizing
international capital flows by restoring investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
"This is the human crisis, one which jeopardizes the hard-won
results of East Asia's three-decade development record and
threatens to return millions of people to poverty," said Richard
Newfarmer, Lead Specialist in the East Asia region and principal
author of the report.
</P>
<P>
Recovery is likely to take longer in East Asia than in Mexico
and Argentina in 1994-95 because of the problems of corporate and
bank insolvency and because of the regional scope of recession,
including Japan, the report said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Reduces Short-Term Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The policy-makers of the
U.S. Federal Reserve Tuesday cut short-term interest rates by a
quarter-percentage point, the first reduction since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary
policy panel, voted to bring the benchmark federal funds rate,
which banks charge each other on overnight loans, from 5.5 percent
to 5.25 percent, in hope of giving a push to the U.S. economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Fed left its discount rate, which it charges on its own
loans to banks, unchanged at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although it was widely expected, the Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks fell nearly 100 points following slight up about
17 points just before the announcement. Many traders had been
hoping for a half-point rather than quarter-point rate reduction.
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing its action, the Federal Reserve said,
"The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective
economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in
foreign economies."
</P>
<P>
It also said policy-makers were concerned about tightening
credit conditions in this country.
</P>
<P>
Because of changes in the global economy and U.S. credit
conditions, the rate cut "should now be consistent with keeping
inflation low and sustaining economic growth going forward," the
Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The interest-rate reduction comes a month after the start of a
sharp correction in the U.S. stock market, triggered in part by
the spread of financial turmoil from Asia to Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The move comes less than a week after a dramatic new indicator
of instability in the U.S. financial system -- the near-collapse
of Long-Term Capital Management LP. Its demise was averted for the
time being when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York arranged a
private 3.5 billion U.S. dollar bailout by the involved banks and
brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan last week delivered what economists
said was an unambiguous signal the Fed was ready to cut the
federal funds rate for the first time in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief told the Senate Budget Committee last Wednesday
that policy-makers have to be "especially sensitive to the
deepening signs of global distress" and the Fed must act
"reasonably shortly to prevent the contagion from really spilling
over."
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Fed action probably would have little
immediate impact on market-set long-term interest rates, such as
30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. They've already fallen to their
lowest level in 30 years. But, it probably won't hurt those rates.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, a series of U.S. rate cuts would make
dollar-denominated securities a little less attractive for global
investors. That would ease downward pressure on some foreign
currencies.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Correlation Between Classroom Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 29 (Xinhua) -- There are proponents as
well as critics of classroom computers in the United States. Now a
new study finds elements of truth in both views.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey released Tuesday by Education Week
magazine, what matters most are not the computers, but what
teachers and students do with them.
</P>
<P>
The study found that while classroom computers can boost
student test scores if used properly, they can also have opposite
effect.
</P>
<P>
Harold Wenglinsky, an associate research scientist at Education
Testing Service, based his study on the performance data of fourth
and eighth grades who took the math section of the 1996 National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Administered by the
U.S. Department of Education, NAEP has tracked student
achievements for nearly three decades. For the first time in 1996,
NAEP asked students and teachers additional questions about how
they used computers in math.
</P>
<P>
The study found that fourth and eighth grade students who spent
more class time learning math at a computer screen earned lower
scores than their peers.
</P>
<P>
The reason may be that some computer time was devoted to
goofing around. Indeed, Wenglinsky said, the benefits brought by
technology depend on how the technology is used.
</P>
<P>
His study found that fourth-grade math scores went up 10
percent of one grade if the teacher was trained in computer use,
and 15 percent of a grade if the teacher used math learning games
on the computer.
</P>
<P>
In the eighth grade, teacher training raised score 35 percent
of a grade and use of computers for simulations and applications
-- such as figuring the velocity of an elevator -- could boost
scores 42 percent of a grade.
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, eighth graders use computers primarily
to drill and practice math problems, scores dropped 0.59 percent
of a grade.
</P>
<P>
A Education Week report on the study said that the findings are
welcome news to school systems under increasing pressure to
justify the nation's substantial investment in education
technology -- now estimated at more than 5 billion U.S. dollars a
year. But they also present a major challenge to policymakers
looking for a good return on that investment. Too often, as the
study found, the tool is being used for the wrong job.
</P>
<P>
The average American school has 17 students per classroom
computer. Nearly eight of every 10 public schools in the country
have access to the Internet, according to Education Week reports.
