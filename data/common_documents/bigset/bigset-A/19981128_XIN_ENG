<HEADLINE> Reports: Clinton to Respond to 81 Questions From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
was studying draft answers to 81 questions from the House
Judiciary Committee and planned to finalize the
impeachment-related document, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after committee Chairman Henry Hyde sent the
president the questions about his truthfulness in the Monica
Lewinsky affair, officials said Friday that Clinton would
interrupt a holiday at the Camp David presidential retreat with
his family and return to the White House. After a final review of
his counsel's work on the answers, he would submit them to Hyde,
Clinton aides said.
</P>
<P>
White House aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
advised reporters that there would be no "bombshells" in Clinton's
response, which is expected to closely track his grand jury
testimony and public denials of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Hyde, a Republican, who first relayed the 81 questions on
November 5, wrote Clinton Wednesday and demanded that he respond
by Monday or face a subpoena.

<HEADLINE> Tyson to Plead No Contest to Traffic Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Former heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson will plead no contest next week to charges of
attacking two men in August after they rear-ended his car in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The plea means Tyson would not have to admit or deny guilt.
But if a judge accepts the plea, Tyson would be sentenced as if
he pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
Each second-degree misdemeanor charge carries a maximum of 10
years in prison. Defense lawyer Paul F. Kemp said he did not know
whether the plea would lead to a revocation of Tyson's probation
in his 1992 Indiana rape conviction, which could send him back to
prison for the three years remaining on his sentence there.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is to go to trial on Tuesday in district court in
Montgomery County, Maryland. His sentencing will be set for a
later date.

the disease, the 11th world AIDS day would be observed on December
1, with the theme "young people: force for change."

PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The African chiefs of state and
government and French President Jacques Chirac attending the 20th
African-French summit here Friday expressed concern over the
situation in the Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros, which is
now faced with separatism of some member islands.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support to Comoran interim president Tadjidine
ben Said Massonde, who succeeded the presidency after President
Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim died of heart attack early this month.
</P>
<P>
"They (the chiefs of state) notably saluted the primary
decisions made by President Massonde for guaranteeing the
continuity of the functioning of the state, the stability of
institutions and civil peace," they said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
They also hailed the measures for cleaning up the economy taken
by the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
They supported the plan by the Organization of African Unity to
hold an inter-Comoran conference for solving the crisis striking
the unity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
A number of islands of the Comoros have declared independence
from the central government because of economic difficulties.

WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is
discovering the ups and downs of basketball, this time from a
coach's perspective.
</P>
<P>
His Alchesay High School team endured a tough 77-75 overtime
loss Tuesday in a tournament but recovered on Wednesday to beat
Arizona Scholl for the Deaf and Blind 82-56.
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't pay me enough to do this," he said. "But it
gives me such a great feeling." The Hall of Fame center gets 1
dollar a year as an assistant to coach Raul Mendoza and says he's
loving every day of it.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Abdul-Jabbar's coaching approach mirrors
that of his UCLA mentor John Wooden as well as late Green Bay
Packers coach Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
He says he's getting something out of it too. "I go to bed at
night feeling good," he said. "It's enough for me that the kids
are working hard, learning, improving through discipline and
effort, and enjoying it all."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Promises to Help Africa Build Peace-Keeping Capacities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday promised 33 African heads of state that France will help
Africa build its own peace-keeping capacities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his African counterparts at the Caroussel du Louvre
conference hall in central Paris, Chirac said France has seen
positive signs in Africa's capacity to deal with regional crises,
as manifested by the intervention of African peace keeping forces
in coups in Sierra Leone and Central African Republic last year.
</P>
<P>
He regretted what he called "international abstention" in
crises in former Zaire and the Congo Brazzaville last year. In
these events, he said, France had pleaded in vain for an
international intervention to avoid human disasters there.
</P>
<P>
Chirac called on the international community to draw a lesson
from them and from now on help Africa prevent crises and build its
own peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
France will carry out military cooperation with African states
in a series of programs aimed at reinforcing the peacekeeping
capacities of Africans, he added.
</P>
<P>
France refused to send intervention troops to former Zaire
during its civil war from late 1996 to May 1997 and only organized
evacuation of foreigners from Congo Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Paris has also adopted the doctrine of "neither interference
nor indifference" in its African policy and has reduced its
military presence in Africa.

KATHMANDU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala reiterated here Friday that April/May next year
would be the appropriate time for general elections, Radio Nepal
said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after accepting a 37-point memorandum from
the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), which, among others, calls for early,
free and fair elections.

The memorandum is the prelude to a three-month struggle against
the government, a senior official from the CPN-UML said.
</P>
<P>
The elections are not due until November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Radio Nepal quoted Koirala as saying that talks with all
parties and groups were possible in politics and he was ready to
go ahead and seek understanding among all the political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which
joined the government in late August, had repeatedly threatened to
quit the government if the ruling Nepali Congress does not
implement the agreements reached with it and other left parties by
December 1.

responsibility to apply doping rules in accordance with their own
procedures.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the cycling body UCI, the soccer body FIFA
and the tennis federation ITF have expressed reserves on specific
points of the above-mentioned proposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exports increased by
2.9 percent and import decreased 1.6 percent in the past 11 months
as compared to the same period last year, Vietnam News Agency
reported Friday, quoting the General Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam obtained an export turnover of nearly 8.5 billion U.S.
dollars in the first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil remains Vietnam's major hard currency earner as the
country shipped abroad 10.7 million tons in the first 11 months of
this year, an increase of 24 percent compared to the previous
corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to reach 13 million tons of crude for
the whole year, three million tons higher than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, earnings from crude oil exports will be less than 1.4
billion U.S. dollars in 1997 due to declining world prices.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment enterprises earned a combined export value
of nearly 1.23 billion dollars in the first 11 months of 1998, up
by 6.4 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the regional monetary and financial crisis,
Vietnam's turnover from exports of textiles and garments have
remarkably decreased.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the industry will gain 1.35 billion
dollars from exports in 1998, with 700 million dollars coming from
non-quota markets.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the country had shipped abroad more
than 3.53 million tons of rice of the planned 3.8 million tons for
the whole year.
A total turnover of one billion dollars, nearly 200 million
dollars higher than last year, is expected for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The large number of export items posting turnover increases
included personal computers and accessories (up by 43.1 percent),
peanuts (up by 7.8 percent), seafood (5.6 percent) and rubber (up
2.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnam's import turnover reached 10.45 billion
dollars in the first 11 months of this year. However, the trade
deficit was nearly 2 billion dollars, representing 23 percent of
export turnover.

<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A United Kingdom court Friday
agreed to give Home Secretary Jack Straw nine more days to decide
whether former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet should be
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The special court in London, where Pinochet was expected to
face hearing if his extradition proceeds, approved Straw's request
and gave the interior minister until December 11 to decide whether
the 83-year-old general should be sent to Spain to face charges of
murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court ruled out last week that Straw must
decide whether the extradition proceedings would go ahead and he
must make up his mind by December 2. The home secretary asked
Thursday for an extra week in order to study all the relevant
documents.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, the UK's highest court, ruled out Wednesday
that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution, opening the way for
possible extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was kept under police guard on October 16, on a
warrant from a Spanish judge, who accused him of involvement in
the deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his
rule from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was Chile's permanent senator and was in London with a
diplomatic passport.

spokesman Hamid Reza Assefi Friday condemned the attack on
American visitors by Iranian hard-liners last weekend.

members of the Central Intelligence Agency and criticized the
Iranian Foreign Ministry for issuing visas for them.
</P>

those involving in the assault.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the Iranian Foreign Ministry has
previously rejected the reports on the presence of a political
American delegation in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Assefi noted that the investigation by the Foreign Ministry
proved that the members of the group had been issued valid entry
visas at the approval of relevant Iranian organizations.

He said that due to the presence of the contingents of the
Mission of the United Nations in the Central African Republic
(MINURCA), his country held the first round of legislative
elections early this month in tranquility.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic was shaken by several mutinies
from 1996 and it was pushed to the verge of civil war until an
intervention by an African peace-keeping force, the Misab, which
was supported by France.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France closed two military bases in the Central
African Republic to the discontent of President Patasse.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and the Central African Republic
remained sour after the expulsion of a retired French officer and
a French military attache suspected of espionage and action of
destabilization this year.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic will hold its presidential
election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has renewed several times the mission of
the MINURCA, which has a three-month mandate each time.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin visited two high-tech spots Friday afternoon after two busy
days of meeting Japanese officials and friends.
</P>
<P>
The first trip to the Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway gave Jiang a
chance to view the largest-scale marine civil engineering project
in the world.
</P>
<P>
After a ride on the southern section of the highway, a 9.5
kilometer-long undersea tunnel, the Chinese president arrived at
the central part of the highway -- the Unihotaru Man-made Island,
a 38,000-square-meter service area.
</P>
<P>
The island, the central joint of the highway linking the
undersea tunnel and a 4.4-kilometer-long elevated expressway on
the northern section, got its name from the sea firefly.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the hosts, Jiang ascended the watchtower on the
island, a five-story concrete building, and took a bird's-eye view
of the architectural wonder and the beautiful scenery on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Japan Highway Public Corporation at the same
time gave Jiang a detailed introduction of the highway, which is
considered by many Japanese as a dream project.
</P>
<P>
The 15.1-kilometer-long highway cost a total of 14 trillion
yen. It was first put under construction in 1987 and opened to
traffic in August, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The second trip took the Chinese president to an exhibition
sponsored by the Mitsubishi Group which displays a number of
high-tech products, including equipment of computerized
communications, satellite communication, environment protection,
and energy exploration and medical machinery.
</P>
<P>
After the visit, the Chinese president reiterated the
importance of the policy of revitalizing China through science and
technology.

<HEADLINE> Chi Haotian Delivers Lecture on China's Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese military
leader Gen. Chi Haotian said here Friday that China pursues an
independent foreign policy of peace and a defense policy that is
defensive in nature.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian also said that the correct way to safeguard
security of a nation and a region is to enhance trust through
dialogues, to seek security through cooperation, to respect
sovereignty mutually and solve disputes peacefully and to pursue
common development.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Chi made the point in his lecture delivered at Singapore's
Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies Friday afternoon with
attendance of more than 400 people including high-ranking
officers, scholars and professionals as well as military attaches
stationed in Singapore from other countries.
</P>
<P>
On China's defense policy, Chi said China's development
requires a lasting and stable environment of peace and a stable
and prosperous China will benefit the peace and development of the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
"That is why China pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace and a defense policy that is defensive in nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the definition by Gen. Chi, the basic contents of
China's defense policy are:
</P>
<P>
-- Consolidating national defense, resisting aggressions,
defending territorial land, sea, air and maritime rights and
safeguarding dignity and security of China;
</P>
<P>
-- The build-up of China's national defense must subordinated
to and in the service of the nation's overall economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
-- Streamlining army in the Chinese way;
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguarding world peace and advancing progressive cause of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
On the negative and unfavorable factors to the international
security in the current situation, Chi said "hegemonism and power
politics remain the main source of threats to world peace and
stability."
</P>
<P>
"Cold war mentality and its influence still have a certain
currency, " he added.
</P>
<P>
"The task for the international community to strengthen
non-proliferation mechanisms has become even more pressing," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Chi severely repudiated the so-called "China threat" theory,
saying that those people disseminating such a theory attempt to
sow discord in the relations between China and its neighboring
countries and damage China's image in the world, so as to contain
the development of China.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Chi reiterated that the "One China"
principle is the foundation of maintaining stability and
development of cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
"China is opposed to any words and actions attempting, in
essence, at 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' and will never
tolerate Taiwan being split from China," Chi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chi's speech won applauds from the more than 400 participants.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Tony Tan Keng Yam presided
over the lecture.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Dr. Tan said China played a critical and
constructive role in helping maintain regional peace and
stability, especially since the onset of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting the lecture is the first time that a Chinese defense
minister is speaking in Southeast Asia on China's defense policy,
Dr. Tan said this lecture presents a valuable opportunity for
Singapore and the countries of Southeast Asia to gain a better
understanding of China.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Holds Banquet for Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi hosted a banquet Friday evening in honor of visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi first recalled his visit to China in 1993 when Jiang
read him a line from a Tang-Dynasty poem: Up a higher story of the
building.
</P>
<P>
By that as he took it, Obuchi said, Jiang meant to raise the
China-Japan relationship to a new stage of development and view it
from a higher perspective.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the normalization of bilateral relations,
the Sino-Japanese ties have witnessed smooth development thanks to
support and efforts of people from all walks of life in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Jiang said that thanks to the joint
efforts of the governments and the peoples of both countries in
the past 20 years and more, the Sino-Japanese relations have been
progressing along the way as paved by the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement in 1972 and the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty
in 1978, and the two countries' exchanges and cooperation in all
fields expanding continuously.
</P>
<P>
The good Sino-Japanese relationship of today has not come
easily, and the two countries should greatly value it, Jiang said,
stressing that the bilateral ties also experienced setbacks in the
20th century when drastic changes occurred in the world.
</P>
<P>
"During the 50 years from the end of the last century to the
middle of this century, Japanese militarists launched several
aggressive wars against China and have caused great harm to the
Chinese people and also taught the Japanese people bitter
lessons," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing the past and looking into the future, we feel that
only by drawing lessons from the history and preventing the
re-occurrence of the past tragedies can China and Japan develop
lasting friendship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that as the biggest developing
country in the world, the core task facing China is to focus on
the country's modernization drive. China's development will expand
the peace forces in the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Japan chose the track of peace and
development after the war and scored big economic
achievements. This is not only beneficial to Japan itself, but
also to the peace and development of Asia and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"My talks with Prime Minister Obuchi yesterday achieved
important results. Both sides agreed to abide strictly by the
joint statement and the peace and friendship treaty, look into the
21st century and establish a friendly and cooperative partnership
devoted to peace and development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that as long as both sides hold grip on the overall
situation of the bilateral relationship, properly handle the
existing issues and remove disturbances, China and Japan will be
capable of making more contributions to the prosperity and
stability of Asia and to the peace and progress of the mankind.

<HEADLINE> Hardliners Call for Impeachment of Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of Iranian hardliners
held an unauthorized rally here Friday, calling for impeachment of
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi over the recent visit by
an American delegation to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The group marched from the campus of Tehran University after
the Friday prayers congregation to Palestine Square, about one
kilometer east of the university, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
The marchers, shouting "Death to America," burned several flags
of the United States to show their anger at the recent visit of
13 Americans to Iran, the agency said without giving the
number of the marchers.
</P>
<P>
"If any American delegation visits Iran under any title, it
will be more seriously dealt with," the hardliners warned.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a group of Iranian hardliners accused the
Americans of being members of the Central Intelligence Agency and
used clubs and iron bars to smash the windows of their bus.
</P>
<P>
Iranian government officials condemned the attack and promised
to punish those responsible for the assault.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Assefi stressed
Friday that the Americans were in Tehran with valid visas and
the Iranian government was responsible for their safety and
security as much as it was for all other foreign nationals in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the investigation by the Foreign Ministry
proved that the members of the group had been issued valid entry
visas at the approval of relevant Iranian organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, hardline Iranian newspapers insisted that the
Americans had political objectives in Tehran and blasted the
Iranian Foreign Ministry for issuing visas for them.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, the hardliners also called on Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to punish those who invited the Americans to
visit Iran, and to prevent any visit by American delegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Shares in Barclays, one of the
biggest banks in Britain, nosedived Friday as it announced that
its chief executive Martin Taylor had resigned.
</P>
<P>
The news stunned the City. By lunchtime the stock was trading
nearly 10 percent, or 125p, lower at 1,363p, wiping 1.8 billion
pounds (2.88 billion U.S. dollars) off the value of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Neither Taylor nor Barclays have given any indication as to the
reason for his sudden departure.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that Taylor will be replaced by Peter
Middleton, previously deputy chairman at the bank's investment arm
Barclays Capital, until the replacement is appointed.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been hit by the financial turmoil in the Far East
and Russia and now may have to dispose of its remaining investment
banking operations.
</P>
<P>
Taylor resigned Thursday night at a board meeting and will
fully leave the bank at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Early Nutrition to Intelligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Giving premature babies highly
nutritious food at an early stage can significantly improve their
intelligence later in life, British researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year study by the British Medical Research Council (MRC)
has demonstrated for the first time that early nutrition plays a
key role in the early development of the brain.
</P>
<P>
Professor Alan Lucas and colleagues from the MRC's Childhood
Nutrition Research Center at the Institute of Child Health, fed
424 premature babies a nutrition-enriched pre-term formula or a
standard infant formula for one month after birth.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published in the British Medical Journal, found
that those infants fed the standard instead of the enriched
formula had reduced verbal IQ at seven-and-a-half to eight years
of age.
</P>
<P>
This effect was found to be particularly notable in boys. Those
fed standard formula had a verbal IQ 12.2 points lower on average
than those fed the enriched formula.
</P>
<P>
The researchers concluded that the study provides a clear
illustration that early nutrition during a brief period of a
child's development can have lifetime effects on health and
performance.
</P>
<P>
They therefore stressed that avoiding under-nutrition in sick
pre-term infants seems to be important in optimizing the
development of the human brain.

<P>
Moyo made the remarks at the annual meeting jointly held here
by the Zimbabwe Association of Safari and Tour Operators and the
Zimbabwe Professional Hunters and Guides Association, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Any other operators who are carrying out business in the
tourism industry, apart from profit maximisation, must look after
the environmental base on which your businesses are founded upon
and depended," he noted.
</P>
<P>
This will ensure that Zimbabwe maintains its position as the
world's number one environmentally friendly tourists destination,
as described by a 1998 survey run by the Sunday Times of London.
</P>
<P>
Moyo also urged tour operators operating in the communal lands
to respect and maintain the cultural values of the people they
interact with.

<HEADLINE> UNITA's Detaining U.N. Observers Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government, in a
statement issued here Friday, "strongly condemned" the rebel
UNITA's detaining of 15 United Nations peace observers in central
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The hostile action has proven again just how Jonas Savimbi and
his followers despise U.N. mediators and human rights, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. staff received a notice to pull out of the central
part of the country 23 days ago, but military men of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) detained them
in Bailundo City of Huambo Province and Andulo City of Bie
Province, on the pretext that they were kept there for the
"maintenance" of the airport runway.
</P>
<P>
The detained U.N. staff include 10 Indians, and other five
from Bulgarian, Sweden, Jordan and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Angolan government finds it
unbelievable that U.N. has been very passive on the incident,
posing a sharp contrast to their stance toward similar incidents
occured to U.N. staff in Iraq, Liberia, Kosovo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The "suspectable stance", the statement said, will encourage
Savimbi " to continue its war, and thus give more disasters to
Angolan people and further delay the materialization of final
peace in the country."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that UNITA is detaining U.N. staff as "human
shield" in response to the government forces' counter-offensive
in the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Issa Diallo, U.N. Special Envoy to Angola, confirmed on
November 16 that UNITA "was obstructing U.N. staff's withdrawal."

<P>
ANKARA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin Friday sent letters to Javier Solana, secretary general of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and defense ministers of
NATO member countries for the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
All countries should act together against terrorism and
terrorism should not be tolerated whichever country it targets,
Sezgin said in the letters.
</P>
<P>
He added that "today, we can start struggle against terrorism
with the extradition of Ocalan to Turkey and his judgement due to
the crimes he committed."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
was detained by Italian police when he arrived in Rome by a
Russian Airlines passenger plane from Moscow on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Rome rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of Ocalan
under the Italian law barring extradition to countries where
suspects may face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has launched embargo on Italian goods and destroyed or
set fire on Italian goods in protest against Italy's refusal.
Italy is one of the largest trade partners in the world for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Justice Ministry Friday sent to the Foreign
Ministry a 900-page file regarding the extradition of Ocalan,
which includes documents about crimes of terrorism, drug
trafficking, massacres and bomb attacks committed by the terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
The file is expected to be conveyed to the Italian government
before December 22.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been waging a separatist war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A Malawian government official
friday urged Southern African Development Community (SADC)
countries to identify regional programs that enhance forestry
research, extension, education and training.
</P>
<P>
These countries have a lot in common in terms of challenges,
goals and limitations in the development of forest resources,
said Ben Mbewe, Malawian principal secretary for Forestry,
Fisheries and Environmental Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is the SADC's forestry coordinator.
</P>
<P>
Mbewe made the call at a joint graduation ceremony held by the
Forest Industries Training Center and Zimbabwe College of
Forestry in Mutare, east Zimbabwe. A total of 42 students
obtained diplomas and certificates in forestry and wood
technology, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The programs, he said, would have to be consistent with SADC
forestry policy development strategy which was signed by member
states in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is aimed at improving the ability of member
states to manage and safeguard their forest resources, facilitate
trade in forest products, promote public awareness in forestry
and enhance forestry research and extension. enditem

<HEADLINE> AIDS Death Falling in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of people dying from
AIDS in Europe has fallen by 8 percent since 1995, according to a
new research published Friday in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The research, led by Dr Amanda Mocroft and colleagues from
University College London, UK, analyzed data on 4,270 HIV-infected
patients across 17 European countries and Israel between September
1994 and March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that at the beginning of 1998, death
rates from HIV in those countries were less than a fifth of their
previous level.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic fall in deaths was amongst those who were
most seriously ill. Patients who had a significantly compromised
immune system were eight times less likely to die after September
1995.
</P>
<P>
The huge drop in AIDS deaths is due to the introduction of new
drug therapies which can keep the virus at bay, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the reduced mortality," Dr Mocroft and colleagues
concluded, "can be attributed to new treatments and the way in
which treatments are combined."
</P>
<P>
These new treatments are protease inhibitors, a class of drugs
directed against HIV, which seem to be fulfilling their early
promise.
</P>
<P>
But although great strides are clearly being made in the search
for effective AIDS treatments in wealthy countries, the high cost
of the new drugs makes them an unaffordable dream for poorer
nations, where the burden of AIDS is most devastating.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS agency,
showed that HIV infection rates worldwide had risen by 10 percent
in 1998, increasing the number of people infected HIV virus to
more than 33 million with the majority of them living in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
AIDS remains one of the leading causes of premature death
worldwide. More than 11 million people have died from the disease
over the last 17 years.

BANGKOK, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has
announced measures to ease some investment restrictions on banks
and finance companies so as to streamline the corporate debt
restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
Thai News Agency on Saturday quoted the bank's deputy governor
Kitti Patpongpibul as saying that a bank's shareholding in a
company would be allowed to exceed the current limit of 10 percent
of the company's registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Total portfolio investments comprising shares in both listed
and non-listed companies would also be allowed to exceed the limit
of 20 percent of the bank's capital.
</P>
<P>
Finance firm investments could exceed the current limit of 20
percent of a company. Overall investments could top 60 percent of
a finance company's capital.
</P>
<P>
The relaxation of limits on equity investments covering banks
and finance companies would last for two years.
</P>
<P>
"The relaxation will make easier debt restructuring for banks
and finance companies. It provides an alternative in restructuring
debt by converting debt to equity," Kitti was quoted as saying
</P>
<P>
The central bank would sent a circular to banks and finance
companies in a few days on the new regulations, which would take
effect once they were officially announced.

<HEADLINE> Chile Warns Pinochet Case May Damage Ties With UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza warned Saturday the case of Chile's ex-president
Augusto Pinochet could damage the relations between Chile and the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Insulza, who is on a special Britain tour to seek the release
of Pinochet, told a news conference that the Pinochet case was the
first serious problem the two nations had ever faced.
</P>
<P>
"I feel it is going to cause some damage, but I hope it won't
be permanent. We will not break diplomatic relations, nor do I
hope to damage economic relations," Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
Insulza spoke after his appeal to the UK government to release
Pinochet was declined by his British counterpart Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Cook Friday told Insulza that the government could not
interfere in the decision on whether to extradite Pinochet to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Insulza insisted that Pinochet's case be an internal affair of
Chile and should be settled by Chile itself.
</P>
<P>
"I fully respect the opinions of everybody, but after all it is
for the Chileans to decide on the processes," Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's highest court ruled on Wednesday that Pinochet
was not immune from prosecution. The ruling opened up the prospect
that he could be extradited to Spain to face alleged charges of
murder, torture and genocide.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was kept under police guard in a London clinic from
October 16. A Spanish judge accused that he is responsible to the
deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Britain on Friday closed its consulate in Chile's second
largest city, Valparaiso, and cancelled a visit by a British
warship on the ground of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw is expected until December 11
to decide whether to go ahead with the extradition proceedings.

Asefi's words came in response to Norwegian Deputy Foreign

had decided to upgrade its relations with iran to ambassadorial
level, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.

Iran's late supreme spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued
an edict ordering the death of Rushdie and anyone connected with
his novel "The Satanic Verses," saying the book blasphemed Islam.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Saturday that
its recognition of the Taliban regime is based on principles and
stressed that the hardline religious militia is a reality in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"And if at all it (Pakistan) is isolated today it is because
the powers that used Afghanistan to advance their own purposes and
objectives, they abandoned Afghan people at their mercy," Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmad said at the weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taliban are a reality. "They are in
control of more than 90 percent of Afghanistan, they are in
control of the capital."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan may be isolated because Pakistan is the only country
that recognizes the Taliban "but our position has always been
guided by principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize states - we recognize the state of Afghanistan
and Taliban are a reality which are in control of that state."
</P>
<P>
About the common points on the Afghanistan issue between
Pakistan and the United States with reference to Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's forthcoming talks with President Bill Clinton,
Shamshad said that everybody agrees on the need for a peaceful
settlement of the Afghanistan problem because the Afghan people
have been suffering for so many years.
</P>
<P>
There is also the need for providing necessary assistance to
Afghans to recover from their miseries and hardships and poverty,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also agree on the need to pursue this process within the
framework of the UN Six Plus Two group and we are in contact with
all members of this group to explore the possibilities of how we
can promote peace in Afghanistan," he added.

<HEADLINE> India Investigates Train Mishap in Punjab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian Railway Minister
Nitish Kumar directed the chief commissioner of Railway Safety to
conduct inquiry into Thursday's rail disaster in Punjab in which
more than 200 passengers were killed.
</P>
<P>
Chief commissioner M. Mani reached the accident site Saturday
morning and began the inquiry in continuation of the probe already
in progress by Commissioner of Railway Safety in northern circle,
an official press release said.
</P>
<P>
The release issued by Indian Northern Railway said that 129
bodies had been identified and identification of another 106 was
still under way.
</P>
<P>
But official figures said the death toll in one of the worst
train accidents of the decade in India was 201 and the search for
possible survivors and bodies ended Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The Pioneer daily reported Saturday that the collision was
caused by a crack in the rails which were, in turn, probably
caused by poor-quality steel.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred early Thursday when a south bound express
train rammed into three derailed coaches nearly Khanna in north
Punjab State.
</P>
<P>
Three bogies of the express train named Frontier Mail from
Mumbai, which had left Khanna at 3:10 am local time, derailed and
fell on the down track near a village called Kohri, some four
kilometres from Khanna township.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that a total of 396 train accidents
have taken place from March 1997 till now, the reasons of which
were mainly on human failure, equipment failure, sabotage,
combination of factors and incidental causes.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants Equal Treatment with India on Nuclear Issue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Reiterating Pakistan's stand
that it would not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
under coercion, Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad said Saturday
that Islamabad and New Delhi ought to be treated at parity
"whether in terms of status or incentives."
</P>
<P>
"Our adherence to CTBT shall take place only in atmosphere free
of coercion and pressure and we also expect equality of treatment
with India," Shamshad told a news briefing on Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's official visit to the United States next week.
</P>
<P>
"Coercion and sanctions are irrelevant in South Asia's security
environment and had not served the purpose of nuclear
non-proliferation," noted the Pakistani official.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sharif, who is leaving for Oslo en route to
Washington on Monday, would urge the United States to lift all
sanctions including Pakistan-specific Pressler Amendment which
over the years had adversely affected the conventional military
balance in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The speculation that the prime minister will sign the CTBT in
Washington is totally baseless," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's position on the CTBT was clearly enunciated by the
prime minister in his address to the U.N. General Assembly on
September 23, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Let met make it clear on behalf of the government that there
is no question of any compromise on Pakistan's strategic nuclear
and missile programs."
</P>
<P>
While maintaining a minimum credible nuclear deterrence, he
said, Pakistan is prepared to enter into "mutually acceptable and
verifiable confidence-building measures with India in nuclear and
conventional fields."
</P>
<P>
As a responsible member of the international community,
Pakistan is committed to containing any further spread of nuclear
weapons, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to promote the goals of disarmament and
non-proliferation. We are prepared to work with our friends and
international community to achieve these goals. We will act with
restraint and responsibility as we always have."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong New Area Getting More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area of
Shanghai had used 10.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
funds and approved 5,404 overseas-funded projects by the end of
last October.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Yang, director of the Shanghai Municipal International
Communications Office, said at a national exhibition of overseas
funds use that Pudong could never have done so much without the
opening-up policy and that the use of overseas funds in the Pudong
New Area appears to have been more systematic and better
coordinated.
</P>
<P>
China announced the opening of Pudong on April 18, 1990. By
the end of last July, it was home to 87 multinationals, with
investment covering automobiles, electronics and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yupeng, Shanghai's vice-mayor, says that the cooperation
between multinationals and large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises helped the improvement process at Pudong's industries
and Pudong has high-tech industrial areas in the Waigaoqiao Bonded
Zone and the Zhangjiang High-tech Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's overseas investment now exceeds 27 billion
U.S. dollars and its industrial output and overseas-funded
enterprise exports account for more than a third of Shanghai's
total.
</P>
<P>
Zhou says that Shanghai has offered 168 key programs for
overseas investors for the next 3 years, in automobile spare
parts, micro-electronics, digital communications, and
environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad Saturday said it will continue to engage the
international community, particularly the U.S., for a just
settlement of the Kashmir issue despite New Delhi's negative
attitude toward such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad told journalists at a news briefing here that Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif during his meeting with President Clinton on
December 2 will emphasize "Pakistan's earnest desire for a just
settlement of Jammu and Kashmir dispute on the basis of U.N.
resolutions."
</P>

particularly the U.S., in efforts for a just settlement of Jammu
and Kashmir dispute consistent with the wishes of the people of
Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif, he said, will brief President Clinton
"on all aspects of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute which is the core
problem that has engendered conflicts between India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He stated that "Pakistan's principled and firm position on the
Kashmir issue remains unchanged."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to insist on a solution of this long
outstanding problem on the basis of the U.N. Security Council

<P>
Replying to a question about New Delhi's opposition to the
international involvement in resolving the Kashmir dispute he

TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy, two straight champion,
edged Bracelona Olympic champion Brazil 3-2 on Saturday to set up
a final match against Yugoslavia at the Men's World Volleyball
Championship.
</P>
<P>
The Italians fought off a tough battle for a 15-10, 13-15,
15-11, 10-15, 15-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Italy earned a re-match Sunday against

semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
It will be a fourth final in the world championships for the
Italians, who finished second in the 1978 final. They also won

<HEADLINE> Nepal Focuses on Road Construction in Remote Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- For the government of Nepal,
the main focus is to give some access to people living in the
remote and mountainous areas to reduce poverty, a chief road
official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Department of Roads Niranjan P. Chalise
said that of the 75 districts in the country, 18 district
headquarters are not connected by roads with 14 having no road at
all.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, 47 percent of the total population are still living
under the poverty line despite the efforts in the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
A study based on statistics of 32 districts found that some
districts have more than 70 percent of the population living below
the poverty line, and such districts are remote due mainly to lack
of road.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has only a 52-kilometre-long railway
operating in the southern Terai plain area.
</P>
<P>
Director General Chalise said that the government plans to
connect 7-10 district headquarters by roads during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1997-2002).
</P>
<P>
"By the 10th Five-Year Plan period (2002-2007), all the
district headquarters shall be connected by roads or some
alternative means of transportation, maybe by cable car," he told
Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the government has given emphasis in the
20-year Agricultural Perspective Plan on road development for
poverty reduction as well as in the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
It is recognized in Nepal that development and expansion of the
transport facilities is the basic prerequisite for the development
of the country which is mountainous and village-dominated, while
road transport stands as the most important sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
As of mid-April this year, total road facility in Nepal reached
11,867 kilometres, an Economic Survey by the Finance Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Blacktopped roads accounted for 30.8 percent at 3,660
kilometres, graveled roads accounted for 26.1 percent at 3,098
kilometres while fair weather roads shared 43.1 percent at 5,109
kilometres, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-kilometre-long Mahendra Highway, which joins the east
and west of the country and is considered the major infrastructure
for overall national development, will be completed next month
with the completion of 22 bridges, Director General Chalise said.
</P>
<P>
There are roads linking the south and north in all the five
development regions in Nepal, but except in the central
development region, roads in other development regions are not
completed.
</P>
<P>
The government announced in July that it would accord priority
to the construction of north-south roads and roads connecting
district headquarters.
</P>
<P>
It is discussing with the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank and other donors over the connection of different mountainous
district headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the major hurdles for road construction in
Nepal is lack of resources or money because the difficult terrain
makes it very, very expensive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it costs about 2.5 million rupees (37,000
U.S. dollars) to build one kilometer of fair weather road in the
plain area, but it doubles in the mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Another bottleneck is to keep balance between maintenance and
new constructions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that though the government had decided to create a Road
Maintenance Fund, it may not be materialized until the next fiscal
year which begins in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
So far, the road sector has got no private and foreign
investment, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has begun the release of credit to Pakistan under the
Financial Sector Intermediation Loan arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has so far extended 100 million U.S. dollars to 9 local
participating financial institutions, the official Associated
Press of Pakistan reported Saturday quoting official sources.
</P>
<P>
This loan is meant for onward lending to augment industrial
investment in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time after Pakistan conducted nuclear blasts in
May that any international donor agency has made funds available
to the private sector of the country.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of sanctions by the United States early this month
gave green signals to donor agencies like the World Bank and the
ADB.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government had also reached an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last Wednesday and hoped that
the final approval of the loan package will be granted by the IMF
after the preliminary meeting of the Paris Club on December 10.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Pakistan began to receive foreign economic assistance,
which had been growing steadily in volume. By the end of June
1998, total commitments of public and publicly guaranteed medium-
and long-term external loans, including grants, stood at 60.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the ADB had disbursed 4.742
billion dollars of medium- and long-term loans to Pakistan till
the end of June 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet to Face Justice at Home, Chile's FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet will face justice if he is returned home, Chile's foreign
minister said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Miguel Insulza, who is in Britain to seek the release of
Pinochet, told BBC radio that so far 14 cases had been brought
against the 83-year-old general under consideration by the Chilean
judicial authorities and "I fully expect that they will result in
justice."
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom Highest Court ruled on Wednesday that
Pinochet was not immune from prosecution. The ruling opened up the
prospect that he could be extradited to Spain to face charges of
murder, torture and genocide.
</P>
<P>
"There are 14 trials pending against him... I cannot say that
an 83-year-old man will be going to jail but if you ask me whether
there are (legal) processes open against him in Chile I can tell
you that there are," Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
But Insulza noted that Pinochet had not yet been formally
accused of any crimes and that the decision on whether he would
actually put under trial would be up to the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that if he goes to Chile we will have a legal
process...Proceedings have started. The first of the accusations
was presented in March of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held on Friday afternoon, just hours after Insulza
flew to London from Madrid, the Spanish capital, where he tried
to persuade Spain not to extradite Pinochet but faied, Britain's
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told Insulza that his government
could not interfere in the decision on whether to extradite
Pinochet to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Home Secretary (interior minister) Jack Straw has
until December 11 to decide whether to go ahead with extradition
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was kept under police guard in a London clinic on
October 16. A Spanish judge accused him of being responsible for
the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said he understood the concerns of human rights
activists over the abuses and disappearances that marked
Pinochet's 17-year rule. But he insisted that Chile should be
allowed to sort out its problems itself.
</P>
<P>
He said no foreign court or nation should have sovereignty
over Chilean affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide
how it is going to deal with its past," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British government has repeatedly said that the Pinochet
case will be decided on legal grounds, not on political
considerations.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in Plane Crash in Southwest UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A pilot and a navigator were
killed on Saturday when a passenger aircraft they were flying
crashed in a field in Devon, southwest Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to BBC report, the Dash 7 turboprop came down close
to the A38 road at Bickington near Ashburton.
</P>
<P>
The 40-seater passenger aircraft was believed to be on a test
flight to the Channel Isles with just the pilot and one crew
member on board.
</P>
<P>
Fire engines had to be dragged across fields by tractors to get
to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Eye witness Roderick Williams said it appeared that the plane
had experienced engine trouble in the moments before the crash.
</P>
<P>
"I could hear the plane coming across and its engine seemed to
be stuttering," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The engine then raced to a very high pitch, cut out completely
and then within seconds I heard this explosion," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks Revival of Strategic Ties with US: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad said on Saturday his country seeks revival of
"strategic partnership" with Washington and urged the United
States to remove its Pakistan-specific laws to put the bilateral
relationship back "on an even keel."
</P>
<P>
"We seek revival of our strategic partnership (with the U.S.)
on the basis of new realities," Shamshad told journalists at a
press conference Saturday afternoon while announcing that Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif is leaving on Monday for Oslo en route to
Washington for an official working visit.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the Prime Minister's visit will contribute
significantly to the revitalization of our relations," he said.
"We wish to develop a mutually beneficial partnership for peace
and development."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the interests of Pakistan and the United States as
well as of the peoples of our region can only be served in an
environment of cooperation and not coercion."
</P>
<P>
Despite ups and downs, the US-Pakistan relationship has
remained "fundamentally strong", he said, adding that the U.S. is
the largest trading partner of Pakistan and an important investor.
</P>
<P>
This relationship has, however, gone through a difficult phase
ever since the U.S. applied its "uni-dimensional approach," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. non-proliferation laws were directed against
Pakistan. We have always regarded these laws and resultant
sanctions as unjust and unfair. We have been urging for their
removal to put our relationship back on an even keel," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Prime Minister Sharif will
therefore urge the removal of all Pakistan-specific sanctions
which over the years have had an "adverse impact on our security"
and "seriously eroded our conventional capability," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who is scheduled to meet Clinton in the White House on
December 2, will brief the U.S. president on "all aspects of the
Jammu and Kashmir dispute which is the core problem that has
engendered conflicts between Pakistan and India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the security and nuclear problems of South Asia, the
situation in Afghanistan and other global and regional issues are
also likely figure in the forthcoming talks between the two
leaders, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Cooperation In Stopping Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- She Mengxiao, the executive
vice-president of the China Law Society, said that China hopes to
further cooperate with Russia to contain organized crime.
</P>
<P>
He told a Sino-Russian seminar on organized crime today that
stopping the development of organized crime has become a major
issue to be addressed by legal scholars and lawyers in China,
Russia and elsewhere and that the development of regional and
international cooperation will be a way of dealing with organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the China Law Society and Russia's
Jurists Union and was attended by Chinese jurists and scholars,
and A. Trebkov, chairman of Russia's Jurists Union, A. Muranov,
Russia's Deputy Minister of Justice, and I. Kozhevnikov, Russia's
Deputy Minister of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
They discussed their respective efforts at cracking down on
organized crime and on increasing exchanges and coordination.
</P>
<P>
Organized crime has developed in both developed and developing
countries and is posing a severe threat to public order and safety
in all countries and has held economic growth and international
trade.
</P>
<P>
So, China and Russia are improving legislation and reinforcing
international cooperation to prevent organized crime from
developing.
</P>
<P>
The two countries issued a joint statement recently making it
clear that they will continue to cooperate in this regard.

<HEADLINE> DR Congo Manoeuver Delays Chirac's Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A press conference by
French President Jacques Chirac scheduled at noon Saturday
has been delayed for almost an hour, amid heavy diplomatic
manoeuver to seek a ceasefire in the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has
been working hard to arrange a meeting between DR Congo
President Laurent Kabila, President Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda and President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, who are
here attending the French-African summit.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no sign that the three heads of state
will enter the same room and sign a U.N. auspiced
ceasefire with the backing of France and the Organization
of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
But a long delay like that means that heavy bargainings
are going on among the parties involved in the DR Congo ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila, who is due to be received by President
Chirac Saturday afternoon, said that he did not oppose
``meeting the aggressors.''

BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, member of the
Politbureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and
director of the Central Commission for Politics and Law of the CPC
said here today that rural courts that handle half the nation's
judicial disputes are important for the law and order in China.
</P>
<P>
Luo told a national conference on courts, which opened here
today, that they should provide powerful backing for rural
reforms, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Rural courts must try to improve relations between local
officials and citizens, while maintaining rural stability and
promoting economic and social progress, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the professional level of grass-roots judges has
improved considerably in the past years and they can still see
that justice is done as the number of cases increases.
</P>
<P>
Justice is still the starting point and final goal of all
courts, he said, adding cases in rural areas embody contradictions
that could easily explode, so just decisions are especially
important.
</P>
<P>
He said he will strengthen the leadership of the CPC over
courts, improve both the political and professional quality of
judges, and help courts handle their logistics.
</P>
<P>
This was the first national conference on courts since
New China was founded in 1949. Xiao Yang, president of the
Supreme People's Court, and 200 other court officials from across
the country were present.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Predicts 7 percent contraction in GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
forecast Friday a seven percent contraction in growth of Gross
Domestic Product for the third quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
This showed a further drop as against a very strong growth in
the same quarter last year, said economist K Y Tang in the
government's third quarter economic report 1998.
</P>
<P>
But according to Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's
economic fundamentals remained strong and there were signs of
increased market activity.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that local consumer spending fell further,
investment spending on machinery and equipment eased off and
private and public sector building activity was reduced.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods were down due to slackening exports to the
United States, the Chinese mainland as well as to the rest of East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The labor market continued to readjust to the economic downturn
through layoffs and wage cuts. The seasonally readjusted
unemployment rate and the underemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent
and 2.7 percent in this year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
GDP for 1998 as a whole is now forecast to contract by five
percent in real terms, down from the forecast four percent decline
in the August update.
</P>
<P>
But liquidity improved from the earlier tight situation, local
interest rates have eased and share prices have rebounded. And
flat prices which tend to stabilize were among the positive signs
so far, although it takes some time to turn them into solid
pick-ups.
</P>
<P>
With wages softening, rentals markedly lower, and the
prevalence of price discounts, consumer price inflation eased
distinctly. Consumer price inflation for 1998 as a whole is
forecast to average at three percent, down from the 3.5 percent
forecast in the August update.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Being Relocated In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Related departments of east
China's Anhui Province have planned to relocate some 76,000 people
who were affected by this summer's floods before the Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The damaging summer floods on the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers
caused losses of 20 billion yuan to Anhui and seriously affected
the lives of 23.9 million people.
</P>
<P>
After the Central Government allocated funds for flood-stricken
provinces this month, Anhui set aside funds for the relocation
program.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, the first project of the
relocation program is designed to build new houses for 75,738
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The official said that it is going smoothly and about 80
percent of the flood victims will live in new houses before the
Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Some 11.4 million pieces of winter clothing and cotton-padded
quilts donated by 17 provinces and cities have been sent to the
flood-damaged areas in Anhui, and some 121 million yuan in
donations will be used to help the local economic growth.

the people."
</P>
<P>
The government should also focus on developing the real
production sector, Primakov said at a meeting with the
Legislative Assembly of Belgorod.
</P>
<P>
He came to the city, 575 kilometers southwest of Moscow, to
attend a session of the inter-regional Black Soil Association.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the government would focus on the agricultural
sector, the textile industry and sectors that will fetch quick
returns.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the International Monetary Fund, he
said: "We should comply with their conditions, but not because we
are overly obedient.
</P>
<P>
"I find myself irritated when young boys come (to Moscow) and
start imposing their conditions. They have read many books but
they don't know life as it is or the actual situation in Russia,"
Interfax quoted Primakov as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has to fulfill the conditions set by
the IMF because Russia is interested in receiving the promised
payment of 8 billion U.S. dollars, Primakov said. "This money will
also help us to clear some foreign debts and to inject 85 billion
rubles (4.87 billion dollars) into the economy. This is a lot of
money."
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus is scheduled to arrive
in Moscow next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov reiterated his government's commitment to a
"controlled emission" of rubles.
</P>
<P>
"If we switch on the money-printing presses, and this is
something we cannot avoid, we should do our best to keep the money
emission under control," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, uncontrolled money-printing will lead to a serious
rise in inflation," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Botswana police are
still hunting down former Zimbabwean president Canaan Banana, who
was convicted in absentia by Zimbabwean high court on 11 counts
of sexual abuses.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Broadcasting Association reported Saturday
quoted Botswana's Deputy Police Commissioner Edwin Batshu as
saying that the law-enforcement agents have not found a lead yet
of where Banana, also a former priest, had gone.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's high court has issued a warrant of arrest for
Banana after prosecutors said he was asking for political asylum
in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Banana was found guilty of 11 charges of sodomy, attempted
sodomy and indecent assault after a sensational trial.
</P>
<P>
Botswana authorities have refuted Zimbabwean media reports,
which claimed that Banana was being sheltered by Anglican
Archbishop Walter Makhulu near Gaborone, the capital of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Banana, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987, may face a
charge of entering Botswana illegally. Homosexual acts are also a
criminal offense in Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Imports 90 Ukrainian Tanks via Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM#,November 28 (Xinhua) - A total of 90 Ukrainian
tanks are at the Dar es Salaam port waiting for being transported
to Uganda, press reports here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The press quoted a senior official from the Ugandan Embassy
here as saying that his country has imported these tanks to boost
its armed forces which have been fighting on both home and abroad
fronts.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the tanks, with the value of the total
consignment and shipping costs at over 35 million U.S. Dollars,
will soon be moved to a military base in the southern Ugandan
town of Masaka.
</P>
<P>
Facing two separate rebellions at home in the north and west,
Kampala has been allegedly backing a rebel army in the
neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo attempting to oust
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam port officials have confirmed the new tanks,
which arrived here on November 20 aboard a Bulgarian ship, mv
Lady Juliet, and are now covered with sheeting and loaded onto
open rail cars ready for more than 1,000-kilometer journey to
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A land-locked Uganda imports goods mainly through Tanzania or
Kenya and its military supplies are mainly escorted by the
Tanzanian military forces.
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Ugandan officials said, the Tanzanian
government has not yet offered logistical support for moving the
tanks.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be neutral in Congo (K) conflict, Tanzania
recalled its military advisors from Congo almost immediately
after the conflict broke out while other neighboring countries
rushed their troops to either side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Chad, Libya,
Sudan and Zimbabwe on Congolese President Laurent Kabila's side
while the Tutsi-led rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Saturday China and Japan have got a
full and clear guiding principle in handling the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a news conference at the Japan
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said Japan made serious promises
concerning the Taiwan issue in the Sino-Japanese joint statement,
adding that Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi also took a
clearcut stand on the issue during their summit talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China, which concerns
China's sovereignty and reunification, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Properly handling the issue is a political basis for the
development of Sino-Japanese ties," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed the wish that Japan would
abide by its commitment to the issue.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between President Jiang and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday, Obuchi said Japan's stand of not
supporting Taiwan independence was made clear in the past and it
would not be changed in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister reiterated that Japan would stick
to principles set in the joint statement and the Japan-China Peace
and Friendship Treaty.

<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
urged Japan here Saturday to educate its youth with the true
historic facts in a bid to further Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Japan National Press
Club, Jiang said that correct historic education will not only
benefit the long-term bilateral ties, but also will be good for Japan
itself.
</P>
<P>
"Lessons learned from the past can guide one in the future,"
Jiang said, adding that Japan should face up to its past
aggressions, which have inflicted heavy sufferings upon peoples of
many countries.
</P>
<P>
But there are still many people in Japan, including some
high-ranking officials, always trying to distort history, or even
prettify aggressions, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This has hurt the feelings of Chinese people and peoples in
many Asian countries, which suffered from Japan's militarism in
the earlier half of the century, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Japan should assume an more responsible attitude in this
respect, said the Chinese President.

Fund.
</P>
<P>
The government has pushed for the construction of low- and

<HEADLINE> Interview: Taliban Rule Out Power-Sharing With Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban on
Saturday again ruled out the possibility of power-sharing with
their rival factions, saying they had already given "substantial"
representation to ethnic communities in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of broad-based government, as being floated by the
world community, including the six-plus-two group, has
shortcomings and no worth for us," Maulvi Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil,
advisor to Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar, told Xinhua
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil, also the senior spokesman for the Pashtoon-dominated
militia, is in Islamabad for talks with Uzbek Foreign Minister
Abdulaziz Kamilov. The Taliban official also met U.N. officials
and Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil said the Taliban, now controlling more than 90
percent of the Afghan territory, had accepted several items of the
"Points of Understanding" reached by the six immediate neighbors
of Afghanistan plus the United States and Russia at their
September's meeting in New York. But he said the point of
broad-based government has faults.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with the Uzbek foreign minister as
successful, Mutawakil said the two sides stressed the need for
more contacts in the future.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that if invited as the government of Afghanistan,
the Taliban would attend the forthcoming meeting of the
"six-plus-two" in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
"But if the invitation is extended as a group, then the leaders
will decide whether to attend or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil also said "there has been no progress" in the
investigation into the killing of nine Iranian diplomats by the
militia forces in August when they overran the Afghan northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the opposition northern
alliance.
</P>
<P>
An investigating team, led by Taliban's interior minister
Khairulla Khirkhwa, is probing the case but has so far failed to
apprehend the culprits, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said a team of Iranian diplomats recently had visited
Afghanistan and held low-level talks with Taliban authorities to
improve bilateral ties between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Economy Contracts 8.6 Pct in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's real gross
domestic product (GDP) declined by 8.6 percent in the third
quarter this year on an annual basis against the high base in the
same quarter last year, it was officially announced here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the preceding quarter when the economy
contracted by 6.8 percent, GDP in the third quarter grew by 2.3
percent, Bank Negara (State Bank or Central Bank) Malaysia
Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
While the real GDP in the third quarter shows a significant
decline on an annual basis, the economy has shown an improved
performance compared with the preceding quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, output declined marginally by 1.2
percent from the second quarter this year when a growth of
negative 8.9 percent was registered. But compared with the third
quarter last year, output contracted further by 14.3 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector expanded significantly by 16 percent
when compared with the preceding quarter when a decline of 9.6
percent was recorded. On an annual basis, the sector also recorded
a smaller decline of 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector continued to undergo the most severe
adjustment with growth deteriorating further by 28.2 percent from
a year earlier and 2.6 percent compared with the preceding
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The services sector grew by 2.6 percent over the preceding
quarter and compared with a year ago, services output growth
moderated to 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the Malaysian economy contracted in the first half of 1998
at a faster pace than anticipated, measures were put in place to
boost domestic consumer and investor confidence while minimizing
the deflationary impact of the crisis on the economy and
expediting economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul said the improvement in the economy since September
1998 indicated that "the contraction in the economy has bottomed
out in the third quarter and latest indicators point towards
gradual improvement in economic conditions."
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, the consumer sentiment remained cautious in
the third quarter amidst concerns over the economic outlook.
However, there were signs of an improvement in consumer spending,
which included higher sales of passenger cars, increased loan
approvals and lower retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
Inflation stabilized at 5.7 percent in the third quarter and
moderated to 5.2 percent in October against 6.2 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Labor market conditions showed some signs of improvement during
the third quarter when the unemployment rate stood at 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade accounts strengthened further in the third quarter
with the surplus surging to a record level of 16.6 billion ringgit
(4.1 billion U.S. dollars), which led to a larger cumulative trade
surplus of 38.7 billion ringgit (10.184 billion U.S. dollars) for
the first three quarters 1998, exceeding the 35 billion ringgit
(9.21 billion U.S. dollars) forecast for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves held by Bank Negara increased by 964
million U.S. dollars to 21.4 billion U.S. dollars at
end-September, sufficient to finance 4 months of retained imports,
and further rose to 23.6 billion U.S. dollars in mid-September,
adequate to finance 4.5 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
The external debt position improved in the quarter with total
external debt declining by 12.7 percent to 150.4 billion ringgit
(39.578 billion U.S. dollars) at end-September. The short-term
external debt declined by 28.5 percent to 26.6 billion ringgit (7
billion U.S. dollars) and consequently the share of short-term
external debt to total external debt fell from 22 percent at
end-June to 18 percent at end-September.
</P>
<P>
The overall financial position of the federal government
remained favorable with both the current and overall accounts
recording small surpluses of 4.8 billion ringgit (1.263 billion
U.S. dollars) and 1.3 billion ringgit (342.1 million U.S. dollars)
respectively in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Based on current development, Malaysia can expect to see
improvement in the economy from the fourth quarter onwards, and
the government will continue to be vigilant and will ensure
continued progress in effecting structural changes in the
financial sector to facilitate and sustain economic recovery, the
governor said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Former PM Appeals for Ocalan's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's former prime minister
Tansu Ciller called on Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan to
Turkey in her letters to foreign leaders, local newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in Ciller's letters to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and former British prime ministers
John Major and Margaret Thatcher on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also Chairwoman of Turkey's True Path Party (DYP),
said that Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), must bear the responsibility for the killing of over
30,000 innocent people including children.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Italy, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), must abide by the rules to fight terrorism
and put terrorists on trial, said Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained by Italian police upon his arrival in Rome
on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of
Ocalan under the Italian law barring extradition to countries
where suspects may face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has launched embargos on Italian goods and destroyed
or set fire to Italian goods in protest against Italy's
refusal. Italy is one of Turkey's biggest trading partners in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed at least
37,000 lives in conflicts since August 1984.

NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans wishing to invest in
the broadcasting industry will have to fulfil tough conditions
before they can secure a licence if a report on new media rules

The 34-page report prepared by the Task Force on Press Law was

Commission as an independent body from both state and media

</P>
<P>
The task force has set conditions for licensing those
encroaching on the broadcasting industry. They must be Kenyan
citizens, and only companies in which 51 percent of shareholding
is by kenyans that will be considered.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Top Brass Named Over Kenyan Banks' Bad Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A son of Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, several cabinet ministers and other big shots in
Kenya owe billions of Shillings to the banks which have collapsed
in recent years or are in liquidation.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) Friday, Raymond Kipruto Moi and a Sanjivan Ruprah
through their company, Simba Airlines, owe Heritage Bank 52 million
Shillings (866,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank has taken them to court in an attempt to recover the
debt and the case is still pending, press reports said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Biwott, the Minister for Regional Cooperation, owes
Trade Bank 235 million Shillings (about four million U.S.
Dollars) and his case is also in court, said the CBK report.
</P>
<P>
His cabinet counterparts Gideon Ndambuki and Joseph Nyagah owe
Post Bank Credit 17 million Shillings (283,000 Dollars) and Trade
Bank Ltd. 29 million Shillings (483,000 Dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister William Ole Ntimama and Musiara Ltd. owe 31
million Shillings (516,600 Dollars) to Kenya Finance Bank.
</P>
<P>
Other big shots named by the CBK who owe millions of Shillings
include Principle Immigration Officer Frank Kwinga, Lady Justice
Effie Owuor, former minister Arthur Magugu and businessman
Kamlesh Pattni with his Goldenburg International company.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list is Cyrus Jirongo, a member of parliament, and
his Sololo Outlets Group, who owe 7.3 billion Shillings (120
million Dollars) to Post Bank Credit Ltd., which has since
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the level of bad debt carried by a
number of small banks was a possible cause for their collapse.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Saturday's Daily Nation,
Attorney-General Amos Wako has ordered the police to act promptly
on any complaints of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Zaccheaus Chesoni, however, was quoted as saying
that it would not be in the interest of the judiciary to issue
general directions on how courts should proceed on any cases
involving commercial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Both men were responding to a plea for help by Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae, following the disclosure that 87 debtors
owed the cash-strapped National Bank of Kenya more than 8.4
billion Shillings (140 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government last week injected two billion Shillings
(33.3 million Dollars) to save the National Bank of Kenya, the
fourth biggest in the country, from collapse following panic
withdrawals by depositors of 1.6 billion Shillings (26.6 million
Dollars) from the bank in one week.
</P>
<P>
The deceptive calm in the small banks sector was broken two
weeks ago with the closure of City Finance and Prudential banks
by CBK due to a persistent run by depositors.
</P>
<P>
In late September, the central bank also shut down Trust Bank,
the country's seventh largest bank as well as Reliance and
Bullion banks.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks in Kenya, 33 of which are classified as
small.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The two-week-long military
exercise held by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
jointly with its partnership states ended in Slovenia Friday.
</P>
<P>
The war game, dubbed "Cooperative Adventure Exchange '98," was
the first one held outside the territory of NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conclusion ceremony, Wesley Clark, supreme allied
commander in Europe, hailed the exercise as "having
achieved the desired results."
</P>
<P>
The exercise, involving 5,500 troops from the alliance and its
partnership states, was aimed at testing their ability to react to
ethnic groups' conflicts in a Slav nation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to wiping out the hardliners in the imaginary
nation, the forces were also required to help establish local
political regime and maintain peace and order.
</P>
<P>
Commander Gioseppe Ardito of the allied forces in southern
Europe said the exercise sent a signal that the partnership states
including those in the Central and Eastern Europe could see a
"completely new era of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Although Slovenian President Milan Kucan claimed at the
ceremony that the exercise was "not directed against any nation,"
neighboring Croatia was reportedly feeling uneasy
during the exercise for a certain kind of "military pressure."

<HEADLINE> China To Fully Tap Geothermal Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China is making an effort to
tap geothermal energy resources and plans to build a group of
medium-sized geothermal stations in the southwest areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the State Development
Planning Commission, these geothermal power stations will be built
in Tibet and the western parts of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces,
respectively, by year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The official said the country will give priority to developing
geothermal resources with reservoir temperatures over 200 degrees
centigrade in Yangbajing of Tibet. By 2000, the largest unit
capacity in Yangbajing will reach 10 MWe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country will build power stations with a
capacity of 3-5 MWe in Ruili in the western part of Yunnan
province and explore the geothermal resources in Tengchong of
Yunnan and the western part of Sichuan by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China has so far discovered 3,000 hot
spring sites, about 2,200 of which recording temperatures above 25
degrees centigrade. The country has by now developed geothermal

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Delivers Speech at Waseda University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Saturday morning that a stable, long-term relationship
of friendship and cooperation between China and Japan had both
geographic advantages and historical origins.
</P>
<P>
The friendship and cooperation between China and Japan
"complies not only with the wishes and fundamental interests of
the people of both countries, but is also beneficial to the great
cause of world peace and development," Jiang told the students and
faculty staff at the Waseda University.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived at the university at 9:00 a.m. local time and was
greeted by Japanese Culture Minister Akito Arima and President of
the university T. Okushuma. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was also
present at the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that over 2,000 years, the
relationship between China and Japan had proved an important
historic truth: only in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere and
according to the will of the people could the relationship between
different nationalities and countries produce motivative forces
for their common development and the progressive cause of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Any armed aggression, enslavement of another people or
imposition of one culture and way of life on other nationalities
would bring about calamity and disaster, and were doomed to fail,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, Jiang
stressed that it was important for China and Japan to cherish and
maintain with great care the neighborly friendship that had taken
the two peoples two thousand years of hard work to establish.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that Japan should perceive the unfortunate
history in Sino-Japanese relationship correctly and draw lessons
from it so as to push forward the bilateral ties as time goes
forward.
</P>
<P>
Okushuma said in his welcoming speech that it has been a widely
acknowledged fact that Jiang, since becoming president of China,
has played an important role not only in China's politics but also
in the world politics as well.
</P>
<P>
Within the 50 years after the war, there has often occurred the
problem in Japan of how to understand the history, which is
largely because that it has not fully realized its responsibility
of its aggression and colonial rule of Asian countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Okushuma hoped that students of his university will listen
attentively to Jiang's speech.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 students and faculty staff members were present
at the 30-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, Jiang also talked with 50 student
representatives at the university, which was established in
1882. It now has some 50,000 students and 2,000 faculty
members. It also has more than 300 Chinese students.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Build Coastal Green Belt Against Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will build a green
belt along the vast coast of the Bay of Bengal to minimize cyclone
devastation and save life and property from the natural disasters,
an English daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study for the coastal green belt project was
already completed about one year ago, and an interim report on the
feasibility study has already been submitted to the Ministry of
Forest and Environment, said The Bangladesh Observer.
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the Asian Development Bank was conducted
by a British firm with the help of the local consultants.
</P>
<P>
The planned green belt, with a length of about 644 kilometers,
will stretch from Teknaf in the southeast district of Cox's Bazar
to eastern end of the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in
the world, which is situated in most southwest part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The high-risk areas in the coastal regions, which have already
been identified, will get priority, but the entire coastal belt
will come under the ambit of the project, a forest official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, suitable palm varieties such as coconut,
betelnut and date trees and some mangroves will be planted on the
slopes of the coastal embankments, he stated.
</P>
<P>
These plantations will not only strengthen the soil of the
embankment, but will also set an extra barrier against the tidal
surges, and the green belt will help weaken the cyclone storm.
</P>
<P>
The coastal green belt will be the second line of defense
against cyclone storms and tidal surges, and besides, a massive
coastal afforestation project on accreted land at shore is already
under implementation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation project, which aims to bring 120,000 hectares
of accreted land under afforestation, was initiated in 1976. Under
the project, mangroves of different varieties have been already
planted on 80,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The planned coastal green belt will surely help to further
strengthen the protective measures against the devastation to be
wrought by the natural calamities, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Mass Job Actions Temporarily Banned in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's trade unions and
employer organisations have been temporarily banned from inciting
or participating in collective job action to resist laws or put
pressure on the government to change laws.
</P>
<P>
This effectively makes illegal the mass stay-aways called by
the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions to change government
policy, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe Friday used his powers under the
Presidential Powers (temporary measures) Act to amend the Labor
Relations Act and the regulations governing commuter omnibuses.
</P>
<P>
He has added to the list of unlawful collective
action already in the Labor Relations Act the purpose of applying
pressure on the government to change laws or lawful measures.
</P>
<P>
He also imposed new stiff penalties on those who organize,
incite or facilitate any illegal collective action.
</P>
<P>
In addition, employers who recommend their staff to join such
illegal action, help their employees do so, facilitate such
action or even organize it, shall be guilty of an offence and
fined up to 100,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (about 2,800 U.S.
Dollars), jailed for up to three years or given both fine and
jail term.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the same punishments are available for anyone else
who induces employers and employees to indulge in unlawful
collective action, threatens or intimidates any employer or
employee to do so, facilitates such action or organizes it.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Saturday afternoon that important achievements in
Sino-Japanese ties had been scored through the two nations' joint
efforts.
</P>
<P>
These achievements would be beneficial to promoting the
relationship, said Jiang at a press conference at the Japan

</P>
<P>
"We have been warmly entertained by Emperor Akihito and the

talks with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and communicated widely
with the Japanese government and the public alike."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the two sides had fully reviewed and summarized

<HEADLINE> Military Option in Congo (K) Serves as Catalyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Zimbabwe believe
that military option in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is
not an end in itself but a catalyst for dialog to solve the
on-going conflict there.
</P>
<P>
To this end, all the belligerents in the DRC should commit
themselves more meaningfully to finding a peaceful solution to
the conflict, said a communique released Friday by the
Zambia-Zimbabwe Joint Permanent Commission on Defense and
Security which met in Lusaka from Wednesday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the joint commission requested Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba to continue with his efforts in
consultation with the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) members and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) for
the eventual finalization of a ceasefire agreement in the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the SADC states to mediate
the DRC crisis, was also requested to strive for a follow-up
implementation and monitoring mechanism of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commission justified the decision to deploy the
SADC allied troops to the DRC, saying it was based on the basic
principles of the state sovereignty, integrity and recourse to
collective security mechanisms which are enshrined in the
charters of both the United Nations and the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send the SADC allied troops including those
from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola to the DRC to help the
government there quell the rebellion which started in early
August was taken by the Inter-State Defense and Security
Committee of SADC at a meeting held in Harare, Zimbabwe in
mid-August and chaired by Zambia, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
It also commended the timely intervention by SADC members and
their continuing efforts to repulse the "invaders" which were not
clarified.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Wine Exports Rising Rapidly </HEADLINE>

WELLINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's wine exports
have passed the 100 million NZ dollar (54 million U.S. dollar)
mark for the first time in a 12 month period, surpassing an
earlier prediction of the target by two years, the New Zealand
Press Association (NZPA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"In 1992 we forecast this milestone would be passed in the year
2000, but consistently strong growth has seen this projection met
two years early," NZ Wine Institute Chief Executive Philip Gregan
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wine exports for the year to September were 16.2 million
liters, valued at 109.4 million NZ dollars (59 million U.S.
dollars), registering a 20.5 percent increase in volume and 35.7
percent increase in value on the previous year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Responds to House Panel's Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday brushed aside impeachment charges in responding to 81
questions from House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee in
relation to its impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
He admitted misleading the public and top aides, but insisted
that his August 17 grand jury testimony "was not false and
misleading".
</P>
<P>
The White House turned over to the Judiciary Committee
Clinton's answers to 81 questions central to the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, had sent the
questions on November 5.
</P>
<P>
Hyde, in a written statement, acknowledged receipt of Clinton's
responses and said the committee would "carefully review" them.
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Representative Bob Barr, accused the
president of using "tortured legal reasoning and convenient memory
lapses" to deny "a clear case of perjury and obstruction of
justice". He said Clinton's response offered no exculpatory
evidence and did not challenge the accuracy of the evidence before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he hoped the answers would contribute to a "speedy
and fair" end to the matter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's attorney David Kendall wrote, "The president has
responded to the chairman's questions in good faith."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's answers largely drew on previous testimony in
responding to questions about the allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering that are being
considered by the Judiciary Committee in its impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
But he did admit he was wrong to make a finger-wagging denial
on January 26 of having sexual relations with "that woman, Miss
Lewinsky", shortly after the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
"In referring to 'sexual relations,' I was referring to sexual
intercourse.... Answers like this misled people about this
relationship, for which I have apologized," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I never asked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie in her
affidavit, as Ms. Lewinsky herself has confirmed," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the questions dealt with allegations Clinton tried to
cover up the relationship by lying to aides about it and
concealing details.
</P>
<P>
Clinton denied he asked his personal secretary, Betty Currie,
to retrieve from Lewinsky a box of gifts he had given her.
Lewinsky testified it was her understanding that Currie was acting
on behalf of the president.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr charged the gifts were
retrieved to obstruct his probe of the affair.
</P>
<P>
"I never told Ms. Currie to take possession of gifts I had
given Ms. Lewinsky. I understand Ms. Currie has stated that Ms.
Lewinsky called Ms. Currie to ask her to hold a box," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not suggest that the former White House intern
move to New York to avoid Jones' attorneys and said he did not
believe he suggested to Lewinsky that his friend Vernon Jordan
might be able to help her get a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
The questions did not directly challenge Clinton's testimony in
the Jones lawsuit regarding his sexual affair with Lewinsky, but
several questions referred to public denials of the affair or his
statements to aides.

<HEADLINE> Memory Loss in Old Age Not Linked to Brain Cell Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Cognitive decline in old
age is due less to neuro-degeneration than commonly thought,
Michela Gallagher, psychological professor at Johns Hopkins
University, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said her research team came to the conclusion after
studying the behavior of rats and comparing the data with that of
humans.
</P>
<P>
By tracing the neurological pathways of more than 800 healthy
rats through their lifetime, Gallagher discovered that the loss of
brain cells, which many people believed to be a natural result of
growing old, actually occurred throughout a person's lifetime.
Neuron numbers declines slowly over decades.
</P>
<P>
However, the brain shows a remarkable ability to compensate for
those losses and forestall any noticeable effect until the losses
become too heavy.
</P>
<P>
Scientists removed specific neurons from the rats' brains and
assessed the effects on memory and neural communication with
neurophysioligical, anatomical, and molecular-biological methods.
It appeared that neuron losses were confined to those cells that
did not play any significant role in memory.
</P>
<P>
Gallagher attributed the memory decline, which is normally
associated with aging, to the functional changes in existing
neurons, and said that a careful analysis of functional properties
in aged brains might hold the key to understanding memory loss in
old age.

the budget deficit this year would exceed 31 billion koruny (1.03
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zeman told an economic forum here that the slump in the
economy, which was the worst in Central Europe, could be seen from
the plunge in the gross domestic product (GDP) and falling
personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
The fragile monetary system, which was failing to operate
efficiently and had become the weakest link in the economy, also
reflected the depression, he added.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for the Czech government was to help the
country shake off the economic crisis and to narrow the gap with
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Czech economy experienced a growth period after
its economic reforms with a 6.4 percent gain in GDP. But since
the second half of 1996, it had suffered a continued economic
slide with GDP rising 3.9 percent in 1996 and only one percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation further deteriorated this year with a
drop of 1.7 percent in GDP and a high unemployment rate of 6.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the slide to the exaggeration of
the market role, undue emphasis on the loosening of macro-economic
control and the lack of auxiliary measures for the newly
established market economy framework.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Saturday that China will spare no effort in
creating a prosperous, democratic and civilized modern socialist
country.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at Waseda University, Jiang said that in a
bid to improve living standards, China would step up efforts in
building a sound socialist market economy while trying to achieve
industrialization .
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China would further develop socialist democracy and
ensure that people could fully exercise their rights to manage the
country and social matters, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president said China had adopted a strategy of revitalizing
the country through science and education to improve its social,
cultural and educational values.
</P>
<P>
By working on the strategy, China wanted the establishment of a
socialist culture which is geared to the needs of the
modernization, the world and the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China recorded steady social and economic
development this year despite the difficulties posed by the Asian
economic crisis and this summer's catastrophic floods.
</P>
<P>
To pump more energy into the economy, the Chinese government
was pushing forward reforms while readjusting the economic
structure and spurring domestic demand, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China had done its utmost to ease the Asian
financial crisis and stabilize the world economy by keeping its
promise to maintain the value of the Chinese yuan and provide aid
to needy countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president is on a six-day state visit to Japan
which began on November 25.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urged to Tackle Y2K Computer Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine should take urgent action
to address the year 2000 computer problem (Y2K) in a bid to avert
the potential chaos it could cause, a senior Ukrainian
info-technology expert warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Parashen, director of the Ukrainian International Center
of Power Industry and Info-technology of the 21st Century, said
Ukraine had taken no steps yet to deal with the problem, reported
the Day newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Unless Ukraine altered its computer programs by January 1,
2000, the nation would suffer social turmoil caused by power
outages, water cut-offs, transportation foul-ups and banking
close-downs.
</P>
<P>
Since most computer software programs recognized only the last
two digits of a year, the year 2000 would cause many to
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
Parashen, also a former chief of the Chernobyl Power Station,
said Ukraine would have no time to work on the program revision,
but the government should put it on the list of next year's budget
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
He added that no official estimate had been made on the cost of
the project. But other experts believed that Ukraine would have
to spend 50 million U.S. dollars dealing with the so-called
"Millennium Bug".

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Ties in New Stage of Development, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Saturday called on the peoples and politicians of China and Japan
to cherish and carefully foster the friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the prestigious Waseda University, Jiang said
that during a "frank and in-depth exchange of views" with Japanese
leaders, they had agreed to establish a friendly and cooperative
partnership dedicated to peace and development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"This marks a new stage in the development of Sino-Japanese
relations," said the Chinese president, who arrived here on
Wednesday on a first-ever state visit to Japan by a Chinese head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the past development of Sino-Japanese ties, he said
that a stable, long-term relationship of friendship and
cooperation between China and Japan had both geographic advantages
and historical origins.
</P>
<P>
"This complies not only with the wishes and fundamental
interests of the people of both countries, but is also beneficial
to the great cause of world peace and development," Jiang told the
students and the faculty staff at the university, which was
established in 1882.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that over 2,000 years, the
relationship between China and Japan had proved an important
historic truth: only in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere and
according to the will of the people could the relationship between
different nationalities and countries produce motivative forces
for their common development and the progressive cause of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Any armed aggression, enslavement of another people or
imposition of one culture and way of life on other nationalities
would bring about calamity and disaster, and were doomed to fail,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, Jiang
stressed that it was important for China and Japan to cherish and
maintain with great care the neighborly friendship that has taken
the two peoples two thousand years of hard work to establish.
</P>
<P>
"Now and in the future, the peoples and politicians of our two
countries should continue to make efforts to foster and push
forward this friendship -- going all out to do everything that is
good for the friendship, and never doing anything harmful to it,"
he urged.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Japan's invasion of China from 1937 to 1945, the
president also emphasized the necessity of facing squarely this
unfortunate episode in the history of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that history had proven militarism would not only bring
terrible disasters to the neighboring nations and endanger world
peace and stability, but also harm people in its home country and
plunge it into serious recession.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Japan's development as an economic power today
was very much a result of the peaceful development route that
Japan had taken on after World War II and its peaceful
co-existence with the neighboring countries ever since.
</P>
<P>
Now, either for the national interest of Japan, or for the
benefit of promoting peace and development in Asia and the world,
Japan should stick to the road of peaceful development and teach
its nationals and young people in particular with a correct view
of history, and never allow the resurrection of militaristic ideas
and groups in any form, urged the Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Only by so doing could the Sino-Japanese friendship be
strengthened and Japan win trust and respect from Asian countries
and the world, and thus play its due part in international
affairs, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has

beds throughout the country to ensure navigability.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Shipping Minister A.S.M. Abdur Rab while

</P>
<P>
The design and lay-out of a bridge with a total cost of 22
billion taka (454 million U.S. dollars) has been finalized at a

SAN JOSE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Five Central American
countries will sign a free trade agreement with the Dominican
Republic on Saturday in Miami, the United States, said the Costa
Rican Foreign Trade Ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The six countries reached an agreement after long prolonged
talks because of the Dominican Republic's desire to include a long
list of products with high customs tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations of this treaty concluded last November 5 in
San Salvador, after the parties reached an agreement about the
list of products excluded and the list of tariff reductions," said
a ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The five Central american countries are Honduras, Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is expecting a big increase in Dominican Republic
exports after signing the accord.
</P>
<P>
The level of Costa Rica's exports to the Dominican Republic are
low. While Costa Rica imported 20 million dollars worth of
Dominican goods last year, it imported 28 million dollars during
the first seven months of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's agricultural
production will drop by 3.06 percent compared to 1997, the
Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This year's total cereals, legumes and oil-bearing seeds output
would reach 75.14 million tons, down from 77.52 million tons in
1997, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute attributed the drop in agricultural output to
uninterrupted rains in the southern region, Brazil's main wheat
and sweet potato producing area.
</P>
<P>
The area for agricultural production in Brazil would be 27.11
million hectares in 1999, against 27.36 million hectares this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the area for rice cultivation would increase by 4.5
percent next year, due to recent price rises in world markets.

<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang

stability in both Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at Waseda University, Jiang said that
China's reunification was the common wish and determination of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the "one country, two systems" policy, China had
successfully resumed its sovereignty over Hong Kong, and Macao
would return to the homeland next year. The Chinese government

he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed opposition to the concepts of "two
Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan", or "an independent Taiwan", in
any form, saying it would only cause tension in the region and
threaten peace and stability in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed China's independent foreign policy, saying that
China, serving as a firm protector of regional and world peace,
would endeavor to establish long-term peace and international
stability in an environment of good relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Even when China became prosperous and powerful in the future,
it would never seek hegemony and China wished to promote friendly
cooperation with all its neighbors and around the world on the
basis of peaceful co-existence, Jiang said.

Jiang is here for a six-day state visit which started on

HEFEI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
invest 15 billion yuan (US$ 1.81 billion) in road construction in
the next three years to form a fast and convenient road network,
today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The fund will come from foreign loans, the Anhui
Communication Project Construction Fund, Chinese banking loans and
other sources, Wang Shui, general manager of the Anhui Expressway
Holding Corporation said last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank has agreed to lend 7.6 billion yuan
to Anhui in the next three or four years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Anhui plans to inject 5.7 billion yuan this year
to improve road conditions, up 83.8 percent from the original plan.
</P>
<P>
The 152-kilometer Hefei-Anqing and the 110-kilometer Anqing

expressway artery running from Shanghai to Sichuan province, will
be opened next month and next January, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 270-kilometer Anhui section of a north-south
artery running between North China's Hebei and Nanchang in Jiangxi
province is under construction.
</P>
<P>
"The completion of the expressway will shorten the travel time
by one or two hours," Wang said.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- An operation to upgrade the
quality of drinking water and to purify polluted rivers won a
passport early this week from the provincial authority in
Shenyang, the capital of Northeast China's Liaoning Province,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The "purified water project" was initiated in 1993 by the city
at a cost of more than one billion yuan (120 million US dollars)
to protect water resources, improve water environment and save
water supplies around the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, a heavy-industrial pioneer in China, has over 240
large and medium-sized enterprises involved in metallurgy,
machinery and paper-making, and was once listed as one of "the
worst polluted cities in the world."
</P>
<P>
The pollution resulted in serious contamination of the city's
water system.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Shenyang has invested heavily to move out 12 key
pollutant enterprises to avoid industrial waste water from
flooding grain fields.
</P>
<P>
Two rivers encircling the urban area were cleaned with the help
of a large sewerage treatment plant with a daily capacity of
400,000 tons.

<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will become a leader
in the field of foreign investment and will focus on specific
industries such as motor parts, microelectronics devices,
medicine, new materials, environmental protection and agriculture,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To support it, Shanghai has drawn more than 110 local laws and
regulations in order to provide a good investment surrounding, the
paper cited Jiang Yiren, vice-mayor of Shanghai, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Investment Working Committee of Shanghai was set up
in 1988 to standardize foreign funds injected into Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Up the September 1998, some 18,586 projects valued at 34.2
billion US dollars have been approved and established in Shanghai.

About 200 enterprises among the world's top 500 transnational
corporations and half of the world's largest 50 banks have
invested or set branches here, according to statistics from the
local government.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's industrial bases, Shanghai has formed several
high-tech development zones, such as Zhangjiang and Caohejing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, foreign funds have been major forces
driving the rapid economic development of Shanghai, whose industrial
output achieved by joint ventures topped 211.9 billion yuan (25.5
billion US dollars) last year, 37.5 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area, a key economic and technology development
region set up in 1990, has attracted 5,404 projects worth 27
billion US dollars financed by foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai General Motors (SGM), with a total investment of 1.5
billion US dollars, is the largest Sino-US industrial joint
venture in China.
</P>
<P>
With an annual capacity of 100,000 units, SGM is expected to
enrich China's auto market.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven both in Shanghai and in the country: Only
by using foreign funds properly can we reach a more prosperous
future," said the vice-mayor.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Should Keep Out of Politics: Chilean FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua)-- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet should leave politics when he returns to his home
country, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"After what happened two days ago, he (Pinochet) has to leave
it (politics), to go back home and stay there in peace," Insulza
said after talks with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Foreign Minister, who arrived London on Friday
especially for Pinochet's case, said he had asked Cook for the
release of the 83-year-old general on compassionate grounds
because of his poor state of health.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, a permanent senator in Chile, came to London with a
diplomatic passport. He was arrested on October 16 at a hospital
in north London, where he was recovering from a back operation.
</P>
<P>
Britain's highest court, the Law Lords, ruled on Wednesday that
Pinochet was not immune from prosecution on alleged crimes of
murder, torture and genocide.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw, the interior minister, now
must decide by December 11 whether Pinochet can be extradited to
face the charges in a Spanish court.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had raised with Cook the possibility that Pinochet
could be released on compassionate grounds, Insulza said: "Yes,
that was one of our arguments -- his old age and his state of
health."

SANTIAGO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- An extra 1,000 policemen have
been deployed around the Chilean capital of Santiago in the wake
of the British court decision on the fate of former dictator
General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The additional police were deployed at public buildings,
political party offices and embassies, particularly those of Great
Britain and Spain, after the announcement Wednesday of the British
Law Lords decision to revoke Pinochet's immunity.
</P>

More than one hundred people were detained after the lords'
decision was announced, Deputy Interior Minister Belisario Velasco
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Velasco called on Chileans "to be very careful and moderate of
their behavior" in this kind of situation and warned that the
government would act against those who committed acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
He criticized people who burned the flags of Spain and Great
Britain, describing it as "unacceptable" and bordering on
illegality.
</P>
<P>
"Flags and national anthems are symbols which must be respected
and never used for things for which they were not created," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's House of Lords ruled by a majority vote that the
former commander-in-chief of Chile's army was not protected by
immunity from a Spanish judge's attempt to bring him to trial.

The London ruling provoked outrage among pro-Pinochet
supporters, but was a cause for jubilation among anti-Pinochet

<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Saturday morning that a stable, long-term relationship
of friendship and cooperation between China and Japan had both
geographic advantages and historical origins.
</P>
<P>
"This complies not only with the wishes and fundamental
interests of the people of both countries, but is also beneficial
to the great cause of world peace and development," Jiang said in
a speech delivered at Waseda University.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that over 2,000 years the
relationship had proved a very important historic truth: only in
peaceful and friendly atmosphere and according to the will of the
people can the relationship between different nationalities and
countries produce motivative forces to their common development
and the progressive cause of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Any armed aggression, enslavement of another people or
imposition of one culture and way of life on other nationalities
would bring about calamity and disaster, and were doomed to fail.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Extracts 1.5 Million Tons of Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities announced
Friday that the island has extracted 1.5 million tons of oil so
far this year, breaking the 1996 record of 1.46 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Basic industry ministry specialist Manuel Marrero told Radio
Reloj that the island's oil extraction would reach 1.6 million
tons by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Marrero said more than 100 million cubic meters of natural gas
would be supplied to several neighborhoods in the Cuban capital
and to a thermoelectrical plant in the east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 small and medium oil fields have been found here,
which raise the island's reserves to more than 10 billion cubic
meters, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
Cuban oil has been considered as very heavy and with a high
sulphur content. It can be used by some industries like the
cement industry.
</P>
<P>
The island imports each year more than six million tons of oil
and byproducts, at a cost of more than one billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Minority Youth Turning Away From Folk Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Folk songs have a long
tradition in the ethnic minority groups of soutwestern China, but
not for today's young people.
</P>
<P>
Some members of ethnic minority groups used to serenade a lover
or get in touch with other people by singing folk songs. But these
days, at gatherings held every three days by the Gelao ethnic
group in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, those present are
mostly above the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
Liang Huasheng, 78, who won a fame as the "Song King" of the
Gelao, says that folk songs are very complicated and it is
difficult for young people to understand them. And, the few young
people who can sing folk songs no longer regard them as part of
their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Hong Dou, a 19-year-old Li minority girl, says that she only
sings folk songs to visitors and works as a tourist guide in
Yizhou.
</P>
<P>
Gan Yutao, of the Zhuang minority, says that she only heard
people singing folk songs when she was about 7 years old. She prefers
more modern ways of looking for a boyfriend than singing folk
songs.
</P>
<P>
So, popular songs like "Too Soft", which has done well on the
populous eastern seaboard of China, are also favorites among young
ethnic minority people. Most of them like to visit Karaoke centers
and dance halls, which are very popular in Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces and in Guangxi. The increasing availability of
television and video equipment has meant other forms of enjoyment
for young people.
</P>
<P>
Tan Shengmin, the deputy director of the Zhuang Ethnic Minority
Research Institute of Guangxi, regards these changes as natural,
but says that folk songs are also an important treasure and a
history of soul of a minority group that tells folk stories and
legends.

BONN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- French Open finalist Alex
Corretja beat fellow Spaniard Albert Costa 6-2, 6-4 at the ATP
Tour world championship in Hanover, Germany, on Friday to set up
a semifinal showdown with world number one Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Tim Henman, beaten in straight sets by fellow Britain Greg
Rusedski, plays Spaniard Carlos Moya in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
World number five Moya showed more composure when it mattered
most to record a 7-5, 7-5 victory over Russian Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, who beat him in the semifinals in the meet last year.
</P>
<P>
Henman had made sure of a place in the last four before
meeting Rusedski, who relied on his trademark artillery to cruise
home 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, who stepped in as an alternate after American Andre

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will devalue its
currency, the real, by approximately six percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Pedro Malan was quoted Friday by a newspaper
as saying that the devaluation could be made by expanding the band
between the minimum and maximum quotation on the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Malan said his country would not change its monetary policy and
rates of interest would be reduced gradually in coming months.
</P>
<P>
International investors are recovering their confidence in
Brazil's economic outlook, with direct investment amounting to 23
billion U.S. dollars in the past 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Goetschl Wins Opening Women's Downhill of the Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Austria's Renate Goetschl
cashed in on German superstar Katja Seizinger's absence by
winning the first women's downhill race of the season in Lake
Louise, Alberta, Canada, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Goetschl clocked one minute 36.12 seconds for the win,
followed by Italy's Isolde Kostner in 1:36.43 and Austrian
compatriot Alexandra Meissnitzer in 1:36.64.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger made World Cup history a year ago by winning all
three races at Lake Louise. She went on to capture two golds --
in downhill and combined -- plus a Giant Slalom bronze at the
Olympics in Nagano, Japan. But a leg injury will keep the
26-year-old off the World Cup circuit in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Both Goetschl and Kostner were medal winners at Lake Louise
last year, but neither could match Seizinger's blistering speed.
Goetschl was third in the first downhill, while Kostner won
back-to-back bronze medals in the second downhill and the lone
Super-Giant slalom event.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Experts Say Wine Boosts Memory, Reduces Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Moderate wine drinking can aid
memory, boost the brain's ability to learn, and might also reduce
the risk of cancer, experts at the first International Conference on
Wine and Health revealed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two doctors from the University of Milan discovered that moderate
wine drinking led the brain to produce the right amount of a
chemical substance that triggers a key enzyme in memory-related
nervous-tissue growth, boosting it six to seven times.
</P>
<P>
The doctors concluded that drinking one to one-and-half glasses of
wine a day with meals strengthens memory and learning abilities.
</P>
<P>
A doctor from the University of Chicago presented findings that
moderate wine drinking can reduce cancerous growth, while one
researcher made the case that people on weight-loss diets should
drink a maximum of two glasses of wine, preferably red, to keep
their spirits up.

<HEADLINE> Batty Stands by for Leeds Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The England midfielder submitted his request to manager Ruud
Gullit on Friday morning, as Leeds prepared to make their move.
</P>
<P>
On a day of intense speculation, Newcastle manager Gullit
admitted Batty's days at St James' Park were numbered.
</P>
<P>
"David Batty has asked for a transfer," he said. "I knew that
it was in the air before I came here."
</P>
<P>
Gullit confirmed there had been talks with Leeds, but added:
"I have not accepted an offer."
</P>
<P>
Batty has recently lost his place in the Magpies' line-up, but
his agent Hayden Evans dismissed reports that there had been a
breakdown in relations with the manager.
</P>
<P>
"We deny that David has had any fall-out with Ruud Gullit,"
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that initial discussions have been held this
week regarding David's future at Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
"For Ruud Gullit to say at a press conference that a move is
imminent, then that is fine by me."
</P>
<P>
Evans said Batty was keen to go back to Elland Road, where he
spent six seasons before moving to Blackburn in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"David has played the best football of his career at Newcastle
and he is a much improved player than when he was at Leeds,"
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want to leave Leeds in the first place, but it has
worked for the best.
</P>
<P>
"He has always said he wanted to return to Leeds. But he
didn't want to go back as a 33-year-old taking a pay-day -- it
had to be at a time when he could contribute in a big way, " he
added.

<P>
BONN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja
joined Pete Sampras and Tim Henman in the semifinals of the ATP
Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moya, the French Open champion who was still wait for his
first indoor match of the year, reached the semifinals by beating
Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5 while Corretja reached the last four
by beating fellow Spaniard Albert Costa 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive year for Moya to reach the
semifinals of the elite season-ending event althogh he is usually
not much of a threat on indoor courts.
</P>
<P>
By avenging his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last year, he
ousted the Russian from the 3.5 million US dollars tournament
that brings the top eight players of the year.
</P>
<P>
"I was perhaps luckier in important moments," Moya said. "I
was mentally stronger than last year."
</P>
<P>
The fourth-ranked Moya will face Henman on Saturday as the
latter becomes the first Briton to reach the semifinals in this
event.
</P>
<P>
Greg Rusedski, an alternate who replaced injuried Andre
Agassi, crushed his fellow British teammate Henman 6-2, 6-4, but
failed to make the semifinals after Corretja cruised past Costa.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was assured finishing 1998 as No. 1 and breaking the
record he shared with Jimmy Connors when Marcelo Rios pulled out
of the event with a back injury. Rios was replaced by Costa.
</P>
<P>
If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he will pu
ll even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the
event in 1991, 1994 and the last two years.

<HEADLINE> British Government Propose Stricter Anti-Hooligan Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- British government announced
Friday controversial new proposals aimed at tackling football
hooligans.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown comes amid police warnings that the problem is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Home Office proposals published on Friday include giving
senior police officers the power to ban suspected hooligans from
travelling abroad to matches even if they have no previous
convictions.
</P>
<P>
The consultation paper contains nearly 30 measures ranging
from re-defining what constitutes a football-related offence to
localised alcohol bans.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes to close a loophole which makes it an offence
for groups of supporters, but not individuals, to chant racial
abuse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch at Arsenal's home ground in Highbury,
north London, Home Office minister Kate Hoey said "The government
is determined to do its bit to create football culture that
simply does not tolerate hooliganism."
</P>
<P>
The British government also wants to extend the time limit
within which incidents could be considered football-related.
</P>
<P>
Currently, they must happen two hours before a match or one
hour after.
</P>
<P>
The government wants that extended to 24 hours before or after
domestic matches, and 72 hours for matches abroad.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks welcomed the proposals, saying:
"Like most football supporters, I have been depressed in the past
by the way a small number of thugs have been able to besmirch the
reputation of the true fans."
</P>
<P>
But the Football Supporters' Association said innocent fans
could be banned.
</P>
<P>
Shiela Spiers of the Football Supporters' Association said:
"We welcome convicted people being banned from travelling, but we
are extremely concerned about suspected hooligans being banned."
</P>
<P>
The proposals were published the day after the Football
Association (FA) announced its own crackdown on troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
The FA says 35,000 members of the official England supporters
club will be asked to disclose convictions for violence or public
order offences committed anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The new assault on hooliganism follows a warning from the
police's National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) that the
problem is on the increase in the UK's domestic game.
</P>
<P>
It says there has been an alarming number of incidents
reported since the start of this season, and arrests for
football-related violence have showed a "marked increase".
</P>
<P>
Consultation on the government's proposals will go on until
the end of February.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Progress over Drugs Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Olympic Committee needed a display of unity from the
International Sports Federations to show the world of its
determination to stamp out drugs in sport.
</P>
<P>
The majority of federations did support its proposals for the
creation of a central drugs agency for out-of-competition testing
and for a medical code with common rules, testing procedures and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged those penalties will be a minimum two-year
suspension for a first offence, rising to a maximum life ban for
a second offence.
</P>
<P>
But three international federations -- cycling, football and
tennis -- expressed reservations. The acting secretary-general
of FIFA said the bans may be legally difficult to apply.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch expressed confidence that all three federations
would drop their objections before next year's major drugs summit.
</P>
<P>
But it was these three powerful groups that scuppered the
IOC's attempts nearly five years ago to find common ground in the
fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
On other key points, the federations endorsed the creation of
an independent anti-doping agency to co-ordinate the fight
against drugs around the world; called for co-operation on doping
issues between sports bodies and government authorities; pledged
to intensify doping prevention policies through educational and
promotional campaigns and agreed to refer doping disputes to the
Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport once internal
appeals procedures had been exhausted.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Welsh international is no stranger to Benfica boss Graeme
Souness, who made him Liverpool's record signing in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an interest shown by Benfica. But, as yet,
there has been no bid," a Bramall Lane spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But the Blades might be put off by previous dealings with the
Portuguese giants, who are struggling with crippling financial w
orries.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of Brian Deane from Benfica to Middlesbrough
earlier this year was held up as United demanded money still

Saunders is the club's top goalscorer this season with 10
League and Cup strikes.

<HEADLINE> (repeat)Clinton Asserts Testimony Not False </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Responding to questions by
the House Judiciary Committee, President Bill Clinton asserted
Friday that his grand jury testimony on Monica Lewinsky was "not
false and misleading."
</P>
<P>
Writing to the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
Clinton said the furor over his attempt to conceal his
relationship with the former White House intern "long ago ceased
to be primarily a legal or political issue."
</P>
<P>
"I hope these answers will contribute to a speedy and fair
resolution to this matter," the president said in his response to
the 81 questions put to him by Hyde on November 5.
</P>
<P>
Hyde asked the president to admit or deny giving false
testimony under oath on his relationship with Lewinsky before his
committee decides if he should be impeached on charges of perjury,
possibly also of temper with witnesses, obstruct justice or abuse
power.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton repeated several times throughout the
response that that testimony "was not false and misleading."
</P>
<P>
He asserted that he had never asked his personal secretary,
Betty Currie, to hide evidence in the Paula Jones case, including
the gifts Clinton had given Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
On vouching under oath for the truthfulness of Lewinsky's sworn
denials of a sexual relationship, the president said he had an
advance look at Lewinsky's affidavit and that he verified its
truthfulness because they were both using a definition of "sexual
relations" that included only intercourse.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton admitted:"I misled people about this
relationship. I have repeatedly apologized for doing so."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's lawyer David Kendall also wrote to Hyde, emphasizing
that the president "did not commit or suborn perjury, tamper with
witnesses, obstruct justice or abuse power."
</P>
<P>
"The president has responded to the chairman's questions in
good faith," Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton finalized the response and sent it to Capitol Hill
three weeks after Hyde put the questions to him. The House
Judiciary Committee has held a hearing on possible impeachment
against Clinton and Hyde has promised to try to close the case by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hyde wrote to Clinton Wednesday demanding the president to
respond by Monday or face a subpoena. The president or his counsel
could appear as a witness as early as December 8, and could call
other defense witnesses, the committee chairman said.
</P>
<P>
No immediate comment was made public so far from the House
Judiciary Committee on the president's response.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on Wall Street
stocks closed higher on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial
average up 18.80 points to 9333.08 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index up 31.23 to 2016.44.
</P>
<P>
The surge was attributed to the news of merger talks by oil
giants Exxon and Mobil which would form the world's largest energy
company if the talks succeed.
</P>
<P>
The two biggest U.S. oil and gas companies confirmed on Friday
that their negotiations are continuing as there has been no
definitive agreement reached yet.
</P>
<P>
The two will create a company with a market value of some 240
billion U.S. dollars, surpassing the Dutch/ Shell Group and could
save them about 7 billion dollars in costs. Oil shares gained
following the confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The Internet-related shares also gained as the shopping season
is coming.
</P>
<P>
The Dow ended the four session week with a gain of 173 points,
thanks to a strong jump of 214 points on Monday, which sent the
blue-chip indicator to a new record of 9374.27.
</P>
<P>
It is now about 40 points below the record and up 1425 points
or 18 percent from the starting point of the year.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancers led decliners 11-9
with trading volume finishing at 257 million shares at 4 p. m.
against 358 million at the same point on Wednesday. The market
closed on Thursday, a Thanksgiving holiday.

<HEADLINE> Rivals in DRCongo War Could Meet in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Three major rivals in the
on-going war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) --
President Laurent Kabila of DRCongo, President Yoweri Museveni and
President Pasteur Bizimungu, could meet in Paris for the first
time since the war broke out five months ago.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the chief of cabinet of Kabila,
Yerodia Ndombasi, as saying that ``things are moving in the
direction to put together the men who should accomplish their
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
Kabila, Museveni and Bizimungu are in Paris attending the 20th
African-French summit which opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ndombasi said that the DRCongo no longer regards the withdrawal
of the troops of Uganda and Rwanda from its territory as a
precondition for talks, but as the objective of talks.
</P>
<P>
This change of tone by the DRCongo raised the hope that a
diplomatic solution could be found soon to the five-month war in
the DRCongo, which broke out after Kabila broke up with his former
allies in his war with President Mobutu Sese Seko -- Uganda and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have openly declared involvement in the war
by supporting the Tutsi rebels engaging government forces loyal to
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of hope for political solution to the conflict,
President Bizimungu said Friday that there is no problem for him
to meet with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The French delegate-minister in charge of cooperations, Charles
Josselin, said that he is hopeful that a political solution will
be found to the DRCongo war soon.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is also in
Paris, is making great effort to arrange a meeting between the
three presidents, said his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac will meet the three presidents
on Saturday and he promised that he would ``propose to them the
way of reason.''

<HEADLINE> Over 1,100 Ethiopian Refugees Return Home from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,100 long-time
Ethiopian refugees have flown home from their camps in
northeastern Kenya since the repatriation operation began two
weeks ago, the U.N. refugee agency said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation flights, under which the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expects to send more than 5,000
Ethiopian refugees, began on November 16 with a DHC-5 "Buffalo"
aircraft flying refugees from Dadaab to Moyale.
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees have been outside Ethiopia since the
Ogaden War erupted in 1977.
</P>
<P>
"These refugees are excited to see their native land after 21
years, and UNHCR is happy to help them return home," said UNHCR
Representative for Kenya and Somalia Yvette Stevens.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR expects to fly up to an additional 2,000 refugees to
their homeland over the next three weeks and then the operation
will be interrupted over the Ramadhan period.
</P>
<P>
With the end of Ramadhan in January, another 2,500 Ethiopians
will be flown back to Gode and Jijiga on the edge of the Ogaden
desert.
</P>
<P>
Each Ethiopian refugee gets the equivalent of 60 U.S. Dollars
and nine months of food aid upon returning home.
</P>
<P>
The refugees first fled their homeland in 1977 for Somalia,
where many lived in U.N. refugee camps in the Shabella Valley.
When civil war broke out in Somalia in 1991, the Ethiopians again
fled for safety to Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Joint Efforts Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt called on the world
community to work collectively against terrorism and organized
crimes, Interior Minister Habib el-Adli said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after inspecting the Egyptian Police
Academy, el-Adli said that President Hosni Mubarak has reiterated
his call for international efforts to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has called for an international summit under the
auspices of the United Nations to work out an agreement to crack
down on international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been hit heavily since 1992 when Islamic extremists
began a violent campaign in an attempt to topple its secular
government and install a strict Islamic rule. More than 1,200
people have been killed in the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has accused a number of western countries of harboring
militants masterminding terrorist acts on its territory and
refusing to extradite them to it.
</P>
<P>
After the blasts hitting Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in August,
Mubarak has seized every opportunity to stress his belief that
terrorism should be countered internationally.
</P>
<P>
Two powerful bombings targeted against the embassies of the
United States in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania killed
hundreds of civilians and wounded thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
Egypt tightened security measures after Islamic militants
killed 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians in the southern
resort of Luxor, a town 520 kilometers south of Cairo, in November
last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- British scientists will
collaborate with their Kenyan partners to develop a novel AIDS
vaccine, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, which aims at developing a DNA vaccine
combining a small part of the gene for HIV with a modified virus
vaccine, is part of a new international bid for an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The UK-Kenyan team is funded by the the International Aids
Vaccine Initiative, which has pumped more than 9 million U.S.
dollars into two major international AIDS vaccine initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The other project is an American-South African cooperation
which will work on a separate approach.
</P>
<P>
The two initiatives are heralding "the first serious attempt to
develop vaccines against strains rife in the developing world,"
said The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the initiatives is not only to ensure the
development of an AIDS vaccine as soon as possible, but also to
make certain it is available in Africa and to anybody in the world
who needs it.

<HEADLINE> EU Officials: Launch of Euro, Sure Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite a less favorable
economic outlook, conditions for a successful launch of the euro
are in place, Willem Duisenburg, president of the European Central
Bank, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on "European Economic and Monetary
Union," Duisenburg said, "Although the economic outlook may be
less favorable than expected -- let us say -- half a year ago, I
believe that the conditions for a successful launch of the euro
are in place. You can be sure that the ESCB (European System of
Central Banks) will do its utmost to make the euro a stable
currency."
</P>
<P>
The global environment has deteriorated, "but this has not so
far had an observable impact on growth (in the euro area) which
has, in any event, been increasingly led by domestic demand," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
While inflation in the euro area will rise moderately in 1999,
he said, it will remain below 2 percent, and "I do not consider
deflation to be a serious risk for price stability" which he
reasserted will be maintained over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Despite the worsening global environment, the euro area-wide
economy has continued to expand at a stable rate, around 3
percent, he said, adding that growth should remain high enough to
support continued employment creation and, with a recovery in the
world economy in general, "there should be a pick-up in growth in
the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
Yves Thibault de Silguy, member responsible for economic,
monetary and financial affairs of the European Commission, also
spoke at the conference which is organized by Britain's Royal
Institute of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the launch of euro on January 1, he said, "This
historic event is the next step in a long process of economic and
political integration in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a reality, "already with
us," and "it is contributing to the strength of the European
economy," he said. "All the necessary legal and political
decisions are in place, and preparations in the private sector are
accelerating."
</P>
<P>
"The challenge now is how to make the most of the euro," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Towards that, he called for efforts to "maintain confidence in
our economic policies among investors and consumers," which he
said is particularly important when export demand is weak and
domestic factors are the main driving force of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he added, it's imperative to ensure that Europe gets
the full benefits of euro as a major international currency, thus
creating new opportunities of greater influence for Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The key to greater exchange rate stability is therefore
working together to reduce the economic divergences which can
provoke markets to react," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, it is important to ensure a genuine single
market for financial services, create large and liquid euro
financial markets, and further stimulate financial innovation,
thus easing financing constraints on business and increase
investment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Mobil Confirm Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 27 (xinhua) -- Two top U.S. oil and gas
companies, Exxon and Mobil, confirmed here Friday that they are
negotiating a merger deal which could lead to the creation of the
world's largest energy company.
</P>
<P>
In a brief joint statement, the two companies said their talks
are continuing without definitive agreement reached.
</P>
<P>
Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company with a market value of 177
billion U.S. dollars, is said to acquire Mobil, number two U.S.
oil company with a capitalization of 60 billion dollars in a deal
of no less than 49 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merger would create the world's largest energy company
surpassing Royal Dutch-Shell Group and would replace General
Motors as the largest U.S. firm in terms of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The news of merger talks has surfaced recently in the U.S. and
Europe, boosting prices of oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies intend to cut costs to offset losses due to world
oil price declines. The combination of Exxon and Mobil is expected
to save them 7 billion dollars, sources close to the companies
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Ministry of Defense
has put right the record on reports that have been appearing in
the press about importation of some 90 tanks through Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Friday by the State Minister of Defense
Steven Kavuma said whatever is being imported was budgeted for
and it was done before war broke out in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC). Therefore the equipment could not have been
destined for DRC as reported.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of the army as outlined to the Parliament is to
modernize the army by reducing the personnel, increasing the
equipment and intensifying training.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said Uganda has imported a total of 90 tanks
through Tanzania and there is difficulty in shipment of the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The reports alleged that the tanks are to be sent to Goma in
eastern DRC to bolster the Ugandan military presence there.
</P>
<P>
On the allegations of Ugandan army in Sudan, the minister said
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) has not carried out any
operations beyond the border with Sudan. UPDF is only guarding
the border to prevent any further incursions by the rebels of
Lord's Resistance Army.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho High Court
Friday ordered that the alleged rebel soldiers held in connection
with a mutiny in September should be charged within eight days or
be released, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Justice Winston Maqutu gave the ruling following an
application by the wives of three of the 32 detained members of
the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) held in connection with the
alleged mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Upholding the application, Maqutu said he had come to the
conclusion that the commander of the Lesotho army "inadvertently
abused the reasonable and fair powers of investigation to deny
the detained soldiers their rights."
</P>
<P>
Maqutu ordered the commander of the army to allow the detained
soldiers to consult their attorneys immediately, to enable them
to prepare their defense.
</P>
<P>
The alleged rebels were arrested on October 10 in connection
with a mutiny on September 11 when junior officers forced the
commander of the LDF, Lieutenant-General Makhula Mosakeng, to
resign.
</P>
<P>
The junior officers also ordered Mosakeng to dismiss 36 senior
officers in a broadcast on Radio Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Mosakeng and the deposed senior officers were reinstated after
military intervention by the forces of South Africa and Botswana.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Emergency Aid to Vulnerable Population in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Friday issued an appeal for 70.37 million U.S. dollars to provide
emergency humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable
populations of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The appeal aims at increasing food security and ensuring the
availability of basic health, water and psycho-social services to
conflict-affected communities, and to the large number of people
seeking refuge in towns and internally camps as a result of
continued insecurity, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Persistent fighting between rebel movements and the government
in the northern and western parts of the country has led to the
disruption of essential social services and economic livelihoods,
as well as significant population movements.
</P>
<P>
At present, United Nations agencies and other humanitarian
organizations are providing assistance to communities in
conflict-affected areas and about 400,000 internally displaced
persons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 182,000 refugees from neighboring countries,
most of whom live in the north, also require assistance, the U.N.
office said.
</P>
<P>
The response of the international community will be based on
the common humanitarian action plan defined by the United Nations,
international organizations, non-governmental organizations and
donors, in close collaboration with the government and outlined in
the 1999 Consolidated Appeal, the office said.

JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's voter
registration for next year's general election got off to a rocky
start Friday, with technical and logistical problems reported at
many registration points.
</P>
<P>
One common problem was that people were not told where to
register. Another big problem was malfunctioning bar code
scanning machines, which, in some cases, kept voters waiting for
hours.
</P>
<P>
Some registration points were not operational because
registration officials were either deployed late or not
available.
</P>
<P>
A three-day voter registration drive started Friday in five
northern provinces. Registration in the other four provinces has
been postponed until next weekend.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Democratic Party and National Party said Friday
that they would press ahead with court challenges to the
exclusive use of bar-coded ID books in registration for next
year's election.
</P>
<P>
The South African Home Affairs Department said Thursday that
about 1.8 million of the 25 million eligible voters had made no
effort to obtain the required ID books.

<P>
On his part, Clerides said that the aim of both Athens and
Nicosia was to reduce tension and resolve Cyprus' political

<P>
BONN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Italy agreed Friday
that the leader of the kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) Abdullah
Ocalan be tried by an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema during more than two hours of talks in Bonn that
Germany would definitely not be seeking Ocalan's extradition.
</P>
<P>
But it was not immediately clear which court would be
responsible,they said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and D'Alema told journalists after their meeting that
experts would be meeting immediately to examine the basis under
international law for a trial.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the government had taken the decision to protect
the public peace in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"I asked my colleague for understanding for the fact that
Germany will not for now be making an extradition request," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the extradition to Germany of the leader of PKK
- which is outlawed in Germany as well as Turkey - could lead to
the conflict between Turks and Kurds being played out on German
soil.
</P>
<P>
Both Schroeder and D'Alema said the Ocalan case was a European
problem not solely one for Italy or Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome on November 12 under international
arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey after he arrived on a
flight from Moscow. He was later released by a court on condition
he remain in the Italian capital.
</P>
<P>
It said, meanwhile thousands of Kurds gathered in Bonn and the
northern German port city of Hamburg to stage demonstrations in a
show of solidarity with Ocalan.

responded Friday afternoon to 81 questions put to him by the House
Judiciary Committee, asserting that his grand jury testimony on
Monica Lewinsky was "not false and misleading."
</P>
<P>
The allegation that he had attempted to conceal his
relationship with the former White House intern "long ago ceased
to be primarily a legal or political issue," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that his answers would help speed up the process for a
fair resolution to this matter.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Criticizes U.S. Policy toward Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday indirectly criticized the U.S. policy toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the leaders of 49 African countries, including 33
heads of state, at the 20th African-French summit, Chirac said
that France, instead of "rediscovering Africa"during one trip, is
the long time partner of Africa.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the trip to Africa by U.S.
President Bill Clinton to Africa this year.
</P>
<P>
He also indirectly criticized the U.S. stand that Africa should
replace trade with aid, and the U.S. refusal to support an
international intervention in the wars in Rwanda in 1994 and in
former Zaire in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Africa needs trade and investment. But aid remains
indispensable for financing the economic and social
infrastructures necessary and building these strong states which
are the guarantees of stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chirac also mentioned the fiasco of U.S.-led
U.N. intervention in Somalia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Help Solve Great Lakes Crisis: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Friday that France is ready to help solve the crisis going
on the Great Lakes region in Africa, in particular the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DR Congo).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio France Internationale, Chirac said
that the fightings in the DR Congo were ``absurd and murderous.''
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet with the leaders of all the countries
involved in the conflict on Saturday to ``propose to them the way
of reason.''
</P>
<P>
Except that Angola, the leaders of eight African countries
involved in the conflict -- DR Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Namibia,
Chad, Zimbabwe and Burundi -- are attending the 20th
African-French summit which opened Friday here.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi support the rebels in DR Congo,
while Chad, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola support the DR Congo
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion by Tutsi-led soldiers broke out five months ago
in DR Congo, after Kabila broke up with his former allies in his
war with President Mubutu -- Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The war in DR Congo, which is threatening to destabilize the
whole African continent, has in fact become the number one topic
in this African-French summit.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Human Rights Group Refuses Money Offered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Human Rights
Organization Friday announced its decision to refuse a
25,703-dollar check offered by the British Embassy in Cairo,
confirming a press report about the issue.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the organization's panel of trustees in
the day said the group has decided to return the check to the
British embassy.
</P>
<P>
A report carried recently by the private Al Usbou weekly
newspaper has accused the organization of receiving a check of
that sum of money from a foreign embassy in Cairo after it issued
a statement alleging that Christian Copts in southern Egypt were
persecuted by the police.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the human rights organization said that it
will, from now on, stop accepting any kind of financing from
foreign governments or their embassies, adding that it will
re-examine financing from other foreign groups.
</P>
<P>
The panel also turned down a proposal put forward by one of its
members to sue Al Usbou weekly.
</P>
<P>
Al Usbou editor-in-chief Mustafa Bakri, who wrote the report,
testified Wednesday against the human rights organization before
the chief of Egypt's Higher State Security Prosecution, Hisham
Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Bakri displayed a copy of the check and another copy of the
organization's statement on the incident in Suhag Governorate's
Kosheh village, where 70 percent of its 35,000 inhabitants are
Christians.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper has reported that the Egyptian
Human Rights Organization issued a statement last month claiming
that more than 1,000 Copts were rounded up by the security forces
who were investigating the killing of two Copts.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegations, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
said that "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have
denounced the story of the British newspaper as a fabrication
aimed at defaming Egypt where Muslims and Christians have been
co-existing in peace for more than 14 centuries.
