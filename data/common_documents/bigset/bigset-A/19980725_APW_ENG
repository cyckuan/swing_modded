Forestry officers find tiger, bear in taxi trunk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Forestry officers checking the trunk of a
taxi found a tiger and a bear that apparently were being smuggled
out of the Phong Dien forests in central Vietnam, a local official
said Saturday.
	   Both had been wounded when they were trapped. The bear died an
hour later, while the tiger was being treated and was to be
released back into the forest, said Ho Van Phuoc, deputy chief of
the Phong Dien forest control bureau in Thua Thien Hue province.
	   Phuoc said the taxi was heading to Hue city from the Phong Dien
district when forestry officials pulled it over. The four
passengers fled in the dark when they were asked to open the trunk.
	   Inside, the officers found the 20-kilogram (44-pound) tiger and
65-kilogram (143-pound) bear in two iron baskets.
	   Phuoc said the Phong Dien forests are home to many precious wild
animals. Hunting and trading of such animals is common in Vietnam,
where some are served at restaurants and others used in traditional
medicine.

United States 93, Australia 85, OT

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Who needs the Dream Team? It just took an extra
five minutes for the United States to reclaim Goodwill Games gold.
	   Andre Miller of Utah took command down the stretch and the
United States, which hadn't won a Goodwill basketball gold medal
since the inaugural games in 1986, beat Australia 93-85 in overtime
Friday night for the championship.
	   It was the first major international men's title for a U.S.
amateur team since the 1986 world championships, which took place
after the Goodwill Games in Moscow.
	   The final victory didn't come easy for this U.S. team, but
nothing did the whole tournament.
	   Miller, who led the Utes to the Final Four in March, scored 10
of his 18 points in the final four minutes of regulation and the
overtime. He tied the game with the final basket of regulation with
1:08 left, and scored the first basket of overtime, 25 seconds in.
	   The United States never gave up that lead.
	   Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio and Elton Brand of Duke each
had 15 points for the United States, while James Posey of Xavier
added 13.
	   Australia was led by its veteran backcourt of Shane Heal, who
had 38 points, and Andrew Gaze, who had 25. Their 3-point shooting
kept Australia in front most of the way, but neither hit from
beyond he arc in the final 6 1/2 minutes of regulation and
overtime. Heal, who played with the Minnesota Timberwolves,
finished with eight 3s, while Gaze, who led Seton Hall to a1989
U.S. collegiate championship game, had three.
	   The United States won the gold medal in the inaugural Goodwill
Games in 1986, but that was followed by a silver in 1990 and a
bronze in 1994. Those were all college teams, with the NBA pros
making up gold-medal Dream Teams for the Olympics and world
championships since 1992.
	   Australia had never done better than its fifth-place finish in
1990.
	   The United States had the last chance at a win in regulation
after a wild final minute.
	   Miller, who scored the United States' last six points of
regulation, stole the ball in the corner and drove the length of
the court for a layup with 1:08 left that made it 79-79.
	   Heal let fly with a 3-point attempt with 37 seconds left on the
game clock and three on the 30-second shot clock. He missed but Sam
MacKinnon of Australia tapped the rebound out to Gaze who then
stood and worked the clock down as the crowd of 9,673 chanted
``U-S-A,'' letting fly a long 3 with seven seconds left. The U.S.
team worked the ball down court and Miller's off-balance jumper at
the buzzer missed.
	   The only loss for the United States came in the opening game
when they blew a 19-point second-half lead to Puerto Rico. Then
came a tougher-than-expected win over China in which the U.S. team
took control with an impressive closing 7 1/2 minutes.
	   The United States finally found its shooting touch during a
31-point win over Brazil in the final preliminary game and kept it
up with an 89-76 semifinal victory over Lithuania.
	   In the bronze medal game, Lithuania beat Puerto Rico 119-75.

Japan worried about ruling party's choice of Obuchi for premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is a nation in doubt after its ruling party
chose an affable but colorless consensus builder to replace
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and lift the economy out
of recession.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo emerged Friday as Japan's future premier
after beating two reform-minded rivals to grab the leadership of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party _ a result seen as a major
victory for the party's old guard.
	   But analysts were divided over whether the choice would also be
good for Japan.
	   ``Obuchi has won points for his good-natured personality and
management skills, but the qualities needed of a leader to guide
Japan out of crisis are speed, decisiveness and the ability to
execute,'' the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said Saturday in an
editorial.
	   Obuchi is expected to come under tremendous pressure in coming
weeks to take actions to encourage growth in the world's second
largest economy and restore trust in a ruling party whose
popularity has sunk to an all-time low.
	   One of Obuchi's first tasks will be to find coalition partners
so the LDP can pass legislation in the upper house of Parliament,
where it holds a minority of seats.
	   Analysts say the future premier will have to draw on all of his
skills of compromise to attract partners among rivals who smell
blood after the ruling party's stunning defeat in July 12 upper
house polls, the event that triggered the LDP's leadership contest.
	   In Friday's ballot for the party presidency, Obuchi won a
majority by a wide margin, receiving 225 votes against 102 for
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and 84 for maverick
Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
	   The lower house of Parliament will vote in the new prime
minister on Thursday, and Obuchi _ who became the ruling party's
candidate by securing the party presidency _ is almost certain to
win because the LDP holds a comfortable majority in the chamber.
	   The LDP's choice drew fire from opposition leaders and rebels
within its own ranks, given the ruling party's insistence that a
departure from factional politics was needed in order to convince
people that the LDP was serious about reforming itself. The
opposition called for immediate lower house elections.
	   Some critics expressed dismay that backroom politicking appeared
to have won the day again.
	   ``I'm beyond disappointment,'' said Yuko Imamura, 28, a trading
house employee in Tokyo. ``All I can hope for is that general
elections will be called soon.''
	   Some analysts said, however, that Obuchi's steady hand and his
ability to forge consensus within his party may be just what Japan
needs to secure agreement on an array of crucial proposals to shore
up the economy and stabilize the banking system.
	   ``Obuchi is the best chance for party unity at a time when party
unity is most needed,'' said Pelham Smithers, a strategist for ING
Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
	   Obuchi's tenure as foreign minister has also won him the respect
of many neighboring Asian countries and is certain to come in handy
in efforts, started by Hashimoto, to normalize ties with Russia by
2000.
	   But the premier-in-waiting seems destined to experience more
turbulence at home than abroad.
	   ``We couldn't see any enthusiasm or willingness on the part of
Obuchi to change LDP politics,'' the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said,
also calling for lower house elections. ``He conveyed no sense of
urgency about the Japanese economy ... and becoming the president
seemed like his primary purpose.''

Fryman's homer lifts Indians past Tigers, 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug line &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Travis Fryman led off the bottom of the 11th
inning with his 21st home run Friday night, giving newcomer Steve
Reed and the Cleveland Indians a 2-1 win over the Detroit Tigers.
	   Fryman hit a 3-1 pitch from Doug Bochtler (0-1) into the
left-field stands for his third hit of the game against his former
team.
	   Reed (1-0) struck out three in two scoreless innings in his AL
debut. Reed, acquired late Thursday in a five-player deal with the
San Francisco Giants, was helped in the 10th by a controversial
double play turned by Omar Vizquel.
	   Joe Randa reached on a one-out infield single and was running
when Paul Bako hit a high chopper over the mound. Vizquel gloved it
on the first-base side of second, lunged to tag Randa and threw to
first for the double play.
	   Tigers manager Buddy Bell protested the out call at second by
umpire Ken Kaiser, claiming Vizquel missed the tag.
 &UR; Blue Jays 10, Red Sox 6 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Juan Guzman finally got some offensive support in
another strong outing as Toronto hit three homers.
	   In his previous six games, Guzman (5-12) had a 2.66 ERA but was
just 1-4. In those four losses, the Blue Jays scored only four
runs.
	   That changed as Ed Sprague, Jose Canseco and Tony Phillips each
homered. The top of Toronto's lineup, Phillips, Shannon Stewart,
Canseco and Carlos Delgado were a combined 10-for-17 with six runs,
nine RBIs and five walks.
	   Guzman gave up three runs, none earned, and four hits in 6 1-3
innings.
	   The Red Sox trailed 10-0 after six innings before rallying.
	   Mo Vaughn hit an RBI single in the Boston ninth that made it
10-6. The Red Sox star was booed for 20 seconds before his first
at-bat, a response to a newspaper story quoting him as saying his
first choice next season was to play for the Blue Jays.
	   Steve Avery (7-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Devil Rays 6, Athletics 0
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Tony Saunders got his first win in
more than three months and Bubba Trammell drove in three runs for
Tampa Bay.
	   Saunders (2-9) ended a 16-start winless streak dating back to
his last win on April 16. It was the longest winless drought in the
majors this season.
	   The left-hander allowed five hits in 6 2-3 innings and survived
seven walks. Jim Mecir pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the
seventh inning and completed the combined five-hitter with perfect
relief.
	   Trammell hit a solo homer in the third inning and had
run-scoring singles in the first and fourth innings.
	   Oakland's Rickey Henderson recorded his AL-leading 40th and 41st
steals, marking the 16th time baseball's career steals leader has
had at least 40 in a season.
	   Tampa Bay chased Mike Oquist (6-7) with a three-run fourth.
 &UR; Orioles 7, Mariners 4 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro hit two homers, including a rare
shot onto Eutaw Street, as Baltimore extended its winning streak to
five games.
	   Rich Becker went 3-for-4 with a homer and four RBIs for the
Orioles, whose 14th win in 15 games lifted them above .500 (52-51)
for the first time since May 14.
	   Baltimore has won 11 straight at home, one short of the team
record set in 1969. The Orioles moved within seven games of Boston
in the wild-card chase, further narrowing a gap that was 15 1/2
games at the All-Star break.
	   John Marzano and Joey Cora homered for the Mariners, who lost
for only the third time in 10 games. Ken Griffey Jr. went 1-for-4
with a double.
	   Mike Mussina (8-5) allowed four runs and seven hits in 7 2-3
innings.
	   With the score 3-3, Jeff Reboulet reached on an infield hit off
Bill Swift (9-6) and Palmeiro hit a 1-2 pitch that scattered the
fans on the food court on Eutaw Street.
 &UR; Yankees 5, White Sox 4 &QC; 
	   In New York, Darryl Strawberry's second homer of the game, a
two-run shot in the sixth, rallied New York to its fourth straight
win.
	   Strawberry's 15th homer off left-handed reliever Bryan Ward
(0-1), helped the Yankees improve baseball's best record to 72-25.
It was Strawberry's second multihomer game this season and the 30th
of his career.
	   Paul O'Neill also homered for New York, which got just six hits.
	   Wil Cordero went 3-for-4 for the White Sox.
	   Andy Pettitte (13-6) allowed four runs _ two earned _ and eight
hits in seven innings. Ramiro Mendoza worked the eighth and Mariano
Rivera pitched the ninth for his 26th save.
	   The White Sox were leading 4-3 in the sixth inning when White
Sox starter John Synder walked Chad Curtis with two outs and
Strawberry followed with his homer to center.
 &UR; Royals 4, Angels 3 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Anaheim ace Chuck Finley sustained a
bruised left elbow when struck by a line drive in the loss.
	   Finley (8-5) left the game immediately after being hit by Jeff
King's drive in the fourth inning. The lefty was taken to a
hospital for X-rays that revealed the injury, and will be
re-evaluated in 48 hours.
	   This was the first meeting between the two teams since their
night of brawls on June 2 in Kansas City. No lingering ill will was
apparent Friday.
	   Hipolito Pichardo (5-7) won for the first time in almost a
month. He gave three runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. Jeff
Montgomery struck out the side in the ninth for his 24th save.
 &UR; Twins 5, Rangers 3
	   In Minneapolis, Dan Serafini shut down the most prolific lineup
in the majors through six innings.
	   Serafini, who had lost his last three decisions and was without
a victory since June 16, allowed nine hits and two runs.
	   The Rangers came into the game leading the majors in runs and
hits, but while Serafini was on the mound they managed only Rusty
Greer's RBI single in the fifth and Mike Simms' solo homer in the
sixth.
	   Filling in for injured starter Bob Tewksbury, Serafini (4-3)
walked one and struck out four. Rick Aguilera got his 23rd save.
	   Juan Gonzalez, whose 114 RBIs lead the majors, was 0-for-3 with
a walk.
	   Esteban Loaiza (0-1) took the loss.

so the LDP can pass legislation in the upper house of Parliament,
where it holds a minority of seats.
	   Analysts say the future premier will have to draw on all of his
skills of compromise to attract partners among rivals who smell
blood after the ruling party's stunning defeat in July 12 upper
house polls, the event that triggered the LDP's leadership contest.
	   In his first major act as party president, Obuchi on Saturday
rewarded the LDP's biggest factions by handing out the three party
executive posts to prominent members of each of the groupings.
	   Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the party's General Council, was named
LDP secretary general, the party's second most powerful leadership
post after party president.
	   Mori belongs to the faction that supported maverick Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi for the LDP presidency.
	   Obuchi also appointed former Post and Telecommunications
Minister Takashi Fukaya as chairman of the party's General Council
and former Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda as chairman of the
Policy Research Council.
	   In Friday's ballot for party president, Obuchi won a majority by
a wide margin, receiving 225 votes against 102 for former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and 84 for Koizumi.
	   The lower house of Parliament will vote in the new prime
minister on Thursday, and Obuchi _ who became the ruling party's
candidate by securing the party presidency _ is almost certain to
win because the LDP holds a comfortable majority in the chamber.
	   The LDP's choice drew fire from opposition leaders and rebels
within its own ranks, given the ruling party's insistence that a
departure from factional politics was needed in order to convince
people that the LDP was serious about reforming itself. The
opposition called for immediate lower house elections.
	   Some critics expressed dismay that backroom politicking appeared
to have won the day again.
	   ``I'm beyond disappointment,'' said Yuko Imamura, 28, a trading
house employee in Tokyo. ``All I can hope for is that general
elections will be called soon.''
	   Some analysts said, however, that Obuchi's steady hand and his
ability to forge consensus within his party may be just what Japan
needs to secure agreement on an array of crucial proposals to shore
up the economy and stabilize the banking system.
	   ``Obuchi is the best chance for party unity at a time when party
unity is most needed,'' said Pelham Smithers, a strategist for ING
Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
	   Obuchi's tenure as foreign minister has also won him the respect
of many neighboring Asian countries and is certain to come in handy
in efforts, started by Hashimoto, to normalize ties with Russia by
2000.
	   But the premier-in-waiting seems destined to experience more
turbulence at home than abroad.
	   ``We couldn't see any enthusiasm or willingness on the part of
Obuchi to change LDP politics,'' the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said,
also calling for lower house elections. ``He conveyed no sense of
urgency about the Japanese economy ... and becoming the president
seemed like his primary purpose.''

Street robberies on the rise in Ho Chi Minh City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Street robberies are on the rise in Ho Chi
Minh City, where gangs use high-speed motorbikes to snatch purses
or force traffic accidents to rob victims, the Thanh Nien newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Police Lt. Col. Nguyen Manh Trung was quoted as blaming
increasingly rampant drug abuse among the young in Vietnam's
commercial hub.
	   Many robbery gangs have been busted, but the situation has not
improved much, he said.
	   He said extra police have been deployed in District One, the
main commercial district, to help prevent robberies of foreigners.
	   More than 30 officers were assigned to track down one 20-member
gang. They arrested 12 of them Wednesday, including three women.
	   The gang has been blamed for 10 robberies since April, the
newspaper said. Their primary trick was to cause traffic accidents
to rob victims of their handbags. One accident was fatal.

U.S. diver wins bronze behind Chinese 1-2 finish; basketball gold

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ It was a day of surprises for U.S.
athletes at the Goodwill Games.
	   From diving to basketball to beach volleyball, they did the
unexpected _ they won and racked up medals.
	   Mark Ruiz thought he was in water over his head against the
dominating Chinese divers. He fell short in the 1-meter
springboard, but not by nearly as much as he expected.
	   Ruiz, already the best U.S. platform diver at 19, made his first
big splash off the springboard winning the bronze medal behind a
pair of Chinese men and ahead of an onrushing German.
	   And there was no bigger surprise than at Madison Square Garden,
where the young U.S. basketball team also won a medal is wasn't
supposed to _ the gold.
	   The squad of college undergraduates beat Australia 93-85 in
overtime.
	   It was the first major international men's basketball title for
a team of U.S. amateurs since a college all-star team won the world
championship in 1986.
	   ``It's unbelievable, to win a gold medal for the USA. It's the
highlight of my life,'' said Wally Szczerbiak of Miami-Ohio.
	   Ruiz, who moved to Orlando, Florida, from Puerto Rico six years
ago, was in third place after all six rounds, but he said he no
clue of his standing.
	   ``I don't ever look at the scoreboard,'' he said. ``I thought I
was fourth. All I do is concentrate on my own dives.''
	   If Ruiz had been paying attention, he would have seen Andreas
Wels of Germany scoring 72.00 and 73.47 points on his last two
dives with a string of 8.0 and 8.5 scores, putting the pressure on
Ruiz.
	   But Ruiz nailed his last dive, a reverse 2 1/2 somersault with a
half-twist, scoring 74.40 points to finish with 395.52, just 2.28
ahead of Wels.
	   Zhou Yilin of China was first after each of the first five
dives, but a superb final dive gave world champion Yu Zhoucheng the
gold with 426.24 points, just ahead of Zhou's 421.86.
	   Ruiz was first in this year's national championships and first
in the World Championships trials in platform last year before
finishing sixth in the world meet. He didn't qualify for either the
1- or 3-meter springboard events.
	   ``I wasn't really a serious springboard diver until this year,''
he said. ``Over the past year, I've done so much better in the
springboard, so that now I'm diving consistently. I plan to
continue training in all three events.''
	   America's other teen-age diving hope, Troy Dumais of Ventura,
California, was fifth after three dives before scores of 31.62 and
31.50 in the fourth and fifth rounds. Dumais, 18, second in the
1-meter at this year's world championships, fell to 10th in the
12-man field.
	   ``I didn't have the confidence in myself to do the dives I
normally do,'' Dumais said. ``I was thinking stupid thoughts,
thinking too much, second-guessing myself.''
	   Dumais said Ruiz was not really far behind the two Chinese men.
	   ``They're dominant because they're consistent,'' he said. ``They
believe they're the best. They are so mentally sound. But if Mark
had hit two dives that he had 6.5s on, he would've won. He was only
25 or 30 points behind.''
	   Brian Gillooly of Kissimmee, Florida, was fifth with 367.77
points.
	   Lithuania, which lost to the United States in the semifinals,
beat Puerto Rico 119-75 for the basketball bronze medal.
	   Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson of the United States will play for
a Goodwill Games beach volleyball medal. They narrowly beat the No.
2 U.S. team of Sinjin Smith and Ricci Luyties 16-14 to finish their
preliminary group 2-1. Johnson had 24 kills, while Luyties had
seven blocks
	   The world's top-rated men's team, Guilherme Marques and Para
Ferreira of Brazil, rallied from a 6-0 deficit to finish the
preliminary rounds unbeaten with a 15-11 victory over Canada's John
Child and Mark Heese Friday. Ferreira had seven blocks.
	   ``After 6-0, we still keep our minds concentrating,'' Marques
said. ``We changed our game. I did some jump serves and para made
some good blocks. After 6-0, if you lose your mind, you will lose
15-0.''
	   Marques and Ferreira won their first two matches by a combined
score of 30-5.
	   Also advancing to Saturday's semifinals were Julien Prosser and
Leo Zahner of Australia, who beat Martin Conde and Esteban Martinez
of Argentina 15-7. A 9-point run gave the Australians a 12-4 lead.
It was the first loss in three matches for the Argentines, and they
reached the semifinals when defending champions Jan Kvalheim and
Bjorn Maaseide of Norway lost to Martin and Paul Laciga of
Switzerland 16-14.
	   Rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabayeva of Russia became the games'
first quadruple-gold medalist, adding titles in the ribbon, clubs
and hoop to her all-around gold. She also took silver in the rope.
	   The figure skating competition doesn't start for another five
days, but it lost a big name Friday when former U.S. national
champion Nicole Bobek withdrew. Bobek said she neeed more time to
recuperate from a nagging injury and to get reacquainted with coach
Richard Callaghan.

Myanmar opposition leader blocked on another trip outside Yangon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS government statement in graf 5

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military and Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi were engaged in a standoff on a
highway Saturday morning, nearly 24 hours after police stopped the
democracy campaigner's car as she tried to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi, an aide and two drivers spent the night inside her
white sedan surrounded by barbed wire barricades, sand bags and a
contingent of soldiers about 32 miles (51 kilometers) west of the
capital.
	   This is the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner's third attempt this
month to travel outside Yangon to meet members of her political
party, the National League for Democracy.
	   The military government has stopped her every time. It denies
she is under house arrest or other unlawful restrictions.
	   The military issued a statement Saturday that said Suu Kyi was
``bullheaded'' and lacked a ``humanitarian vision.'' It accused her
of conspiring to ``portray Myanmar as a lawless and unstable
country where the democratic forces are being suppressed.''
	   During an earlier attempt to travel freely outside the capital,
more than 30 soldiers lifted the Nobel laureate's white sedan with
her inside it, and turned it around to face Yangon.
	   On the previous two trips on July 7 and 20, a compromise was
reached where the military brought the party member Suu Kyi was
attempting to meet to her car.
	   Suu Kyi's intention this time was to travel to Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta where
local authorities are more repressive than in some other parts of
Myanmar.
	   She was stopped near Anyarsu village at about 10:15 a.m. Friday
by local police who called the military authorities.
	   Her goal, as in previous journeys, was to meet with members of
her party voted into parliament in a 1990 election the military
refused to honor despite pledging before the poll it would hand
over power to the winners.
	   That was before the NLD captured 82 percent of the seats.
	   She has been telling them not to obey a military order that the
	   lawmakers report to the authorities twice a day. The military
ordered them to report under the ``Habitual Offenders Act'' a law
reserved for those considered heinous criminals by the government.
	   She also hoped to give encouragement to families of party
members who have been jailed by the military government.
	   Suu Kyi's party has sent an official letter of protest about
using the Habitual Offenders Act against her party's
representatives to Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the military
government.
	   He has not replied.
	   Of the 392 NLD members of parliament 181 are either in jail,
exile, been disqualified by the military-run election commission,
been forced under pressure to resign from the party or have died.
	   The NLD has said the rest are living under constant harassment
by the military.
	   The military denies the charges of harassment and says it never
intended to hand over power to the election winners.

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ With information learned from
villagers accounting for relatives, officials Saturday increased
the official death toll from the tsunami that struck northwest
Papua New Guinea to 1,500 and lowered the number of missing to
2,000.
	   The government had earlier feared that up to 6,000 were missing.
But Chris Hawkins, press secretary to Prime Minister Bill Skate,
said Saturday they were initially unable to get an accurate picture
of those who survived due to confusion in the days following the
tsunami.
	   Many villagers fled from the coastline and into the rugged
interior, making accurate counts of those killed or missing
difficult until officials had a chance to interview the survivors.
	   Hawkins said that more than 550 persons were in critical
condition in hospital.
	   More than 4,500 have been left homeless by the three massive
waves that struck villages along a 35-kilometer (22-mile) stretch
of coastline following a 7-magnitude earthquake on July 17.
	   More than 8,000 people live in the area around the Sissano
lagoon that has been sealed off by rescue workers, allowing bodies
to decompose. Survivors were also evacuated from the lagoon area to
prevent the spread of disease.
	   Australian military doctors who planned to be in the area for up
to 10 days were expecting to have to stay up to two weeks or longer
to help stem the infection rate.
	   Doctors say the biggest danger to the injured is infection _
coral sand ground into open wounds contains bacteria that thrive in
the tropical climate.
	   Heat, the high number of injured and cramped working conditions
continue to present the medical staff with difficult working
conditions.
	   On Saturday, a third air force Hercules left Auckland as part of
the New Zealand relief effort for the victims and a French military
team arrived into the area. Both teams were carrying additional
medical supplies.
	   Col. Takam Kanene, a disaster relief official with the Papua New
Guinean government, said Friday that no survivors had been found
since Tuesday.
	   ``In normal circumstances, someone would survive for about four,
five, six days without food, but after that they would die of
starvation,'' Kanene said.
	   New aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the tsunami
Friday further added to the worries of residents of the northwest
coast. Seismologists warned Friday and again Saturday that there is
a 50 percent chance of more tremor activity.
	   At least 35 bodies were found Thursday washed up on a beach in
the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40
kilometers) west of the disaster zone, local police said.
	   Those victims were believed to have been sucked out to sea by
the back surge from the waves and dragged along the coast.

Report: new bankruptcy law to be enacted soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie is expected to
enact a new bankruptcy law next month in a bid to lure frightened
foreign investors back to Indonesia's shattered economy, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Jakarta Post said the proposed law, unanimously passed by
Indonesia's Parliament on Friday, is scheduled to go into effect on
Aug. 20.
	   Many Indonesian companies, burdened with huge debt, have become
technically insolvent because of the country's deep economic
crisis. Foreign capital has left amid the uncertainty.
	   The new law, hurriedly drafted to counter the crisis, replaces
old bankruptcy provisions that date back to 1905 when Indonesia was
still a Dutch colony.
	   The paper quoted Justice Minister Muladi as saying that under
the new law, 45 judges would work in a new commercial court to
operate in Jakarta and several other major cities.
	   Muladi said the enactment of the law would bolster investor
confidence ``so that our economy can grow robustly in the future.''
	   The new law, to give a legal basis for companies to be
dissolved, will to be replaced later by a more comprehensive
bankruptcy code.
	   The handling of bankruptcies and Indonesia's corporate debt
mountain is a key element of a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout
plan for Indonesia put together by the International Monetary Fund.

Springboks beat All Blacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A late try by winger Pieter
Rossouw on Saturday lifted South Africa to its first rugby union
test victory in New Zealand in 17 years.
	   The 13-3 win over the All Blacks has almost guaranteed South
Africa this year's Tri Nations title after it won its away match in
Australia last week.
	   The Springboks have only their home matches to play against New
Zealand and Australia in the home-and-away series.
	   Rossouw's try nine minutes from the end came from a superbly
angled run close to a scrum 15 meters from the All Blacks' line.
	   The New Zealand defense was left flat-footed as the left winger
cut through untouched to stretch the 6-3 lead Percy Montgomery had
given them with a penalty goal in each half.
	   New Zealand's only points came from a penalty goal by Andrew
Mehrtens, who replaced Carlos Spencer at standoff just after
halftime. Spencer missed five shots at goal before going off.
	   The Springboks led 3-0 at halftime through Montgomery's
24th-minute penalty goal.
	   Scores:
	   SOUTH AFRICA 13 (Pieter Rossouw try; Percy Montgomery 2
penalties, conversion) def. NEW ZEALAND 3 (Andrew Mehrtens
penalty). (djp)

Mexican official: rebel group largely dismantled by arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ Authorities have shattered a leftist
guerrilla group that killed a dozen people in the southern state of
Oaxaca two years ago, Mexico's senior law enforcement official said
Friday.
	   On another insurgent front, the country's defense secretary said
the government had no intention of withdrawing its troops from
southern Chiapas.
	   Most members of the Popular Revolutionary Army, known as the
EPR, are now in jail, Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa
said in Mexico City. Recent arrests have left the group, which was
active in Oaxaca, with ``much less than half'' the strength it had
in 1996, he said.
	   In its effort to achieve political and social change, the EPR
killed 12 people in an attack on the Pacific resort of Huatulco,
Oaxaca, on Aug. 28, 1996.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo did not mention the rebels Friday
during a tour he made to Oaxaca to inaugurate roads repaired after
Hurricane Pauline battered the state in October 1997. Zedillo also
inaugurated a national park in Huatulco.
	   Defense Secretary Enrique Cervantes, who accompanied the
president on his tour, told reporters that the army will not yield
to calls for a withdrawal of troops from southern Chiapas state,
where the largely Indian Zapatista Liberation Army led a separate
rebel uprising beginning in 1994.
	   ``We are where we should be, and we will continue there as long
as needed,'' Cervantes said.

Four Khmer Rouge to be tried for Vietnamese killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Cambodian government will put four
Khmer Rouge arrested for their role in the killings of 12
Vietnamese immigrants on trial, Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper
Nhan Dan reported Saturday.
	   It said the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation sent a diplomatic note to the Vietnamese
Embassy in Phnom Penh, saying the Interior Ministry has arrested
four of the 37 remnants of Khmer Rouge Division 785.
	   The division allegedly took part in the killing of 21 civilians,
including 12 ethnic Vietnamese, in Kompong Chnang province in
April.
	   The note said the four will be put on trial and that the
Cambodian government was committed to ensuring security for foreign
nationals living in Cambodia, including Vietnamese.
	   The Thanh Nien newspaper, in an editorial Saturday, said some
opposition candidates for Sunday's elections were inciting a
bilateral feud by verbally attacking Vietnamese immigrants living
in Cambodia and fabricating a Vietnamese threat to Cambodia.
	   ``They have placed their personal interests and political
ambitions above the interests of the Cambodians and people of
neighboring countries,'' the paper said.

Former Jets player visits injured Chinese gymnast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Byrd's visit. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Dennis Byrd knows exactly what
paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan is going through.
	   ``It is an emotional time anytime you visit people who have
undergone something so traumatic. I try to help out however I
can,'' said the former New York Jets defensive lineman, who was
temporarily paralyzed with a fractured vertebra nearly six years
ago after colliding with a teammate.
	   While he has made a recovery that was termed ``miraculous'' by
many standards, Byrd never played football again. But at least he
can walk and fish and hunt and play with his children.
	   Doctors say Sang, 17, scheduled to undergo surgery Saturday at
Nassau County Medical Center to stabilize her spine, is unlikely to
walk again. She was injured Tuesday night during a practice vault
at the Goodwill Games.
	   Byrd spent 90 minutes with Sang on Friday, speaking to her
through an interpreter. Sang is being treated with SYGEN, an
experimental drug that helped Byrd recover so well.
	   ``I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to take GM1,'' Byrd
said, referring to another name for SYGEN, which helps regenerate
the nerve endings in the spinal column. ``It is very encouraging. I
had a very severe injury and certainly think SYGEN played a role in
my recovery.''
	   Sang's parents were expected to arrive from China late Saturday.
Dr. Brock Schnebel said Friday night that all final consent forms
had been arranged for the gymnast through the Chinese team.
	   Schnebel said Sang's condition was unchanged from when she was
brought to the hospital following Tuesday night's accident. The
1997 Chinese national vault champion struck the mat with her head,
fracturing and dislocating two neck vertebrae and leaving her with
no movement in her legs.
	   ``She's gaining in her understanding of what is happening, and
is maintaining a good attitude,'' Schnebel said. ``As you can
imagine, this would be very difficult for anyone _ especially a
teenager.''

Observers lower standards for Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Conceding that a campaign laden with
violence and fear won't enable fully free and fair elections,
foreign countries and independent watchdog groups conceded Saturday
that they will judge Cambodia's polls by a lower standard.
	   Cambodian election officials meanwhile said that they would bar
two groups with close links to strongman Hun Sen from deploying an
estimated 40,000 observers at polling stations, which many feared
would influence the result.
	   Campaigning for the parliamentary elections ended Friday,
followed by a one-day cooling off period before the 5.4 million
registered voters can cast ballots Sunday for the first time since
the United Nations organized polls in 1993 under the protection of
20,000 peacekeepers.
	   This time, Cambodia is organizing the polls and the U.N. has
been invited only to coordinate 678 foreign observers from 40
countries and regional groupings. They will be unable to monitor
all the 11,600 polling stations.
	   The vote had been called by strongman Hun Sen, who is seeking to
restore international legitimacy and aid after deposing his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last year
that shattered the coalition established after the U.N.-sponsored
balloting.
	   Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Rainsy are the main
challengers. They believe Hun Sen will rig the vote or the counting
in favor of his Cambodian People's Party. Many Cambodians fear Hun
Sen will call out the army to retain power.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party claimed that violence continued Saturday,
saying a grenade was thrown at the home of a local party leader in
the southern province of Koh Kong. He was uninjured.
	   The opposition, watchdog groups and some countries have accused
Hun Sen of intimidating voters and of killing, kidnapping and
beating their political opponents.
	   They have pushed the international community to refuse to
endorse the election unless it is free in fair, but the U.N.
coordinating body, which will have a decisive voice, decided Friday
that a more vague standard of ``broadly representative'' would be
acceptable.
	   Others fell in line Saturday. An internationally recognized
local watchdog, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, which will be an important observer of the balloting,
said that if things go smoothly for voting and ballot counting the
elections could be deemed ``reasonably credible.''
	   COMFREL President Thun Saray acknowledged that the killings and
intimidation meant the vote cannot be considered ``free.'' Nor
could they be seen as fair, since the opposition had almost no
broadcast media access.
	   The U.N. group _ officially known as the Joint International
Observers Group _ said it should be able to certify the election as
``broadly representative of the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   The group indicated that it would not hold Cambodia _ where the
political culture has been traumatized by three decades of civil
war and the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s _ to as rigorous
standards as more developed democracies.
	   ``We have to take into account the Cambodian reality,'' said
Thun Saray. ``What is the alternative? If you think this electoral
process will not provide continuity of democracy, I don't see any
other alternative but more fighting.''
	   The election for 122 National Assembly seats Sunday may not be
perfect, but Thun Saray said it was the only hope that the
democratic process in Cambodia will not die.
	   The Asian Network for Free Elections, an umbrella of
non-governmental organizations, echoed COMFREL and said Saturday it
did not want to attach ``catch words'' to its assessment.
	   ``It is possible for the process to have flaws and serious
problems, but for the result to still be valid,'' said Christian
Monsod, former election commission chairman in the Philippines.

Future prime minister rewards factions with important party posts

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's premier-in-waiting gave key leadership
posts to prominent figures in three major ruling party factions
Saturday, in an apparent attempt to heal rifts caused by a bruising
internal struggle to find a new leader.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was elected president of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Friday, named veteran policy
maker Yoshiro Mori as the party's new Secretary General _ the LDP's
second most powerful executive post after party president.
	   Mori belongs to the faction that had backed maverick Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi in the turbulent LDP race to find a
replacement for outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The
contest split the party, pitting a raucous band of young reformists
against party elders who supported Obuchi.
	   Obuchi also appointed former Post and Telecommunications
Minister Takashi Fukaya as chairman of the party's General Council
and former Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda as chairman of the
Policy Research Council.
	   The LDP's old guard powerbrokers scored a major victory with the
election of their favorite as the party's new president, but it is
now up to Obuchi to unite the party and prevent disgruntled
legislators from bolting.
	   Obuchi has other pressing difficulties to contend with. Japan's
populace and its media have reacted with skepticism at the election
of Obuchi as president of the LDP, a party already suffering from
record low approval ratings.
	   ``Obuchi has won points for his good-natured personality and
management skills, but the qualities needed of a leader to guide
Japan out of crisis are speed, decisiveness and the ability to
execute,'' the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said Saturday in an
editorial.
	   Obuchi is expected to come under tremendous pressure in coming
weeks to take actions to encourage growth in the world's second
largest economy and restore trust in a ruling party.
	   One of Obuchi's first tasks will be to find coalition partners
so the LDP can pass legislation in the upper house of Parliament,
where it holds a minority of seats.
	   Analysts say the future premier will have to draw on all of his
skills of compromise to attract partners among rivals who smell
blood after the ruling party's stunning defeat in July 12 upper
house polls, the event that triggered the LDP's leadership contest.
	   In Friday's ballot for party president, Obuchi won a majority by
a wide margin, receiving 225 votes against 102 for former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and 84 for Koizumi.
	   The lower house of Parliament will vote in the new prime
minister on Thursday, and Obuchi _ who became the ruling party's
candidate by securing the party presidency _ is almost certain to
win because the LDP holds a comfortable majority in the chamber.
	   The LDP's choice drew fire from opposition leaders and rebels
within its own ranks, given the ruling party's insistence that a
departure from factional politics was needed in order to convince
people that the LDP was serious about reforming itself. The
opposition called for immediate lower house elections.
	   Some critics expressed dismay that backroom politicking appeared
to have won the day again.
	   ``I'm beyond disappointment,'' said Yuko Imamura, 28, a trading
house employee in Tokyo. ``All I can hope for is that general
elections will be called soon.''
	   Some analysts said, however, that Obuchi's steady hand and his
ability to forge consensus within his party may be just what Japan
needs to secure agreement on an array of crucial proposals to shore
up the economy and stabilize the banking system.
	   ``Obuchi is the best chance for party unity at a time when party
unity is most needed,'' said Pelham Smithers, a strategist for ING
Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
	   Obuchi's tenure as foreign minister has also won him the respect
of many neighboring Asian countries and is certain to come in handy
in efforts, started by Hashimoto, to normalize ties with Russia by
2000.
	   But the premier-in-waiting seems destined to experience more
turbulence at home than abroad.
	   ``We couldn't see any enthusiasm or willingness on the part of
Obuchi to change LDP politics,'' the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said,
also calling for lower house elections. ``He conveyed no sense of
urgency about the Japanese economy ... and becoming the president
seemed like his primary purpose.''

ASEAN to ask Western countries for economic aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries will ask
their Western allies and Japan for more investment, a rescheduling
of debts and other help to revitalize the region's economies,
officials said Saturday.
	   The requests will be made when foreign ministers of the
nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations meet next
Tuesday and Wednesday in Manila with their 10 ``dialogue
partners.''
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told reporters that ASEAN
is seeking ``a more active effort to revitalize the economies in
ASEAN.''
	   ``Our liquidity squeeze is very serious,'' he said. ``We need
some help on the restructuring, the rollover of our debts.''
	   He said the allies should increase investment in the region and
cooperate in efforts to reduce the damage of speculation and
``uncontrolled movement of capital'' in emerging economies whose
defenses are not as strong as those of mature economies.
	   Also needed, Surin said, is more access to credit for ASEAN
exports and for imports of parts used in production of goods for
re-export.
	   An official of another ASEAN country, Indonesia, said ASEAN is
seeking more outside investment in various projects in which two or
more ASEAN members are developing adjoining areas. Many of these
projects are designed for exports, which is one means of getting
out of the economic turmoil, said the official, who asked that he
not be named.
	   ASEAN economies have been battered since Thailand devalued its
currency in July 1997, setting off a wave of devaluations
regionwide.
	   ASEAN groups Thailand and Indonesia with Malaysia, the
Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.
	   Its dialogue partners include the United States, Japan, China,
Russia and the European Union.

U.S. diver wins bronze behind Chinese 1-2 finish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Mark Ruiz dives with blinders on, at
least when it comes to the scoreboard.
	   Ruiz, already the best U.S. platform diver at 19, made his first
big splash off the 1-meter springboard Friday, winning the Goodwill
Games bronze medal behind a pair of Chinese men.
	   Ruiz, whose family moved to Orlando, Florida, from Puerto Rico
six years ago, was in third place after all six rounds, but he said
he no clue of his standing.
	   ``I don't ever look at the scoreboard,'' he said. ``I thought I
was fourth. All I do is concentrate on my own dives.''
	   Andreas Wels of Germany scored 72.00 and 73.47 points on his
last two dives with a string of 8.0 and 8.5 scores, putting the
pressure on Ruiz.
	   But Ruiz nailed his last dive, a reverse 2 1/2 somersault with a
half-twist, scoring 74.40 points to finish with 395.52, just 2.28
ahead of Wels.
	   Zhou Yilin of China was first after each of the first five
dives, but 79.56 points on his final dive gave world champion Yu
Zhoucheng the gold with 426.24 points, just ahead of Zhou's 421.86.
	   America's other teen-age diving hope, Troy Dumais of Ventura,
California, was fifth after three dives before scores of 31.62 and
31.50 in the fourth and fifth rounds. Dumais, 18, second in the
1-meter in this year's world championships, fell to 10th in the
12-man field.
	   ``I didn't have the confidence in myself to do the dives I
normally do,'' Dumais said. ``I was thinking stupid thoughts,
thinking too much, second-guessing myself.''
	   Ruiz was first in this year's national championships and first
in the World Championships trials in platform last year before
finishing sixth in the world meet. He didn't qualify for either the
1- or 3-meter springboard events.
	   ``I wasn't really a serious springboard diver until this year,''
he said. ``Over the past year, I've done so much better in the
springboard, so that now I'm diving consistently. I plan to
continue training in all three events.''
	   Brian Gillooly of Kissimmee, Florida, was fifth with 367.77
points.

ASEAN steps up nuclear criticism, enhances economic surveillance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-102
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian foreign ministers on
Friday intensified their criticism of Indian and Pakistani nuclear
tests, agreed to a wider fight against drug trafficking and
supported a regional early warning system to check economic
problems.
	   ``The foreign ministers deplored the series of nuclear tests
conducted recently in South Asia that exacerbated tension in the
region and raised the specter of a nuclear arms race,'' according
to a draft communique prepared for the end of the two-day
Association of Southeast Asian Nations ministerial meeting.
	   The word ``deplore,'' stronger than an earlier version that
expressed ``grave concern,'' was put in at the insistence of
Malaysia, according to officials quoted by Japan's Kyodo news
agency.
	   The nine-member ASEAN seeks to make Southeast Asia a nuclear
weapons free zone, including a ban on nuclear arms on ships
traversing international waters in the region.
	   The Southeast Asian foreign ministers will meet this coming week
with counterparts from the United States, China, Russia, Britain
and India to discuss security issues. It is likely that ASEAN's
dissatisfaction with the slow pace of nuclear disarmament will be
part of those talks.
	   In the draft communique obtained by The Associated Press, the
ASEAN foreign ministers ``called on all countries which have not
done so to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in recognition of the overwhelming
interest to establish a nuclear free world.''
	   The foreign ministers broke no new ground in dealing with their
serious economic problems, mainly supporting actions already taken
by ASEAN's finance ministers. In fact, a separate economic
statement prepared by the Philippines, which is hosting the
meeting, was laid aside as unnecessary.
	   The draft communique strongly endorsed the finance ministers'
earlier decision to establish an ASEAN surveillance mechanism to
monitor regional economic and financial indicators so that future
crises can be nipped in the bud.
	   They also welcomed proposals to use regional currencies in trade
among ASEAN countries to reduce their dependence on dollars.
Despite the economic crisis, the ministers said ASEAN is committed
to pressing ahead with creation of a regional free trade area.
	   Perhaps the most far-reaching change the ministers agreed to was
one they never announced publicly _ an informal agreement reached
behind closed doors to allow more forthright comment on events in
member states that affect the region as a whole. That, combined,
with the regional economic monitoring, could help head off crises,
or exacerbate them, depending upon how government leaders react.
	   The foreign ministers' language on the drug fight was mild,
focused on finding new ways to cooperate with the rest of the world
in fighting crime. They concurred with a commitment made last year
by ASEAN countries ``to expand the scope of cooperation and explore
ways by which the member countries can work closer with relevant
agencies and organizations, including the United Nations.''
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

United States 93, Australia 85 OT
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even though it wasn't one of the Dream Teams, it
was still the United States wearing the gold medals.
	   A team of 12 college players _ a far cry from the rosters
crammed with NBA superstars that have represented the United States
in other major international competitions _ reclaimed Goodwill
Games gold Friday night with a 93-85 overtime victory over
Australia.
	   ``Coming into this we had to be the third or four pick at best
because of our lack of experience,'' United States coach Clem
Haskins of Minnesota said. ``It's not easy for kids 18 to 21 to go
against a team of players 22 to 35. This team came together. They
all put away the I's and became a team.''
	   Andre Miller of Utah took command down the stretch for the
United States, which hadn't won a Goodwill basketball gold medal
since the inaugural games in 1986. It was the first major
international men's title for a U.S. amateur team since that year,
when the world championships and Goodwill Games were held
simultaneously.
	   The final victory didn't come easy for this U.S. team, but
nothing did the whole tournament.
	   ``When we first got here it was really difficult to adapt to
coach Haskins' system,'' Miller said. ``We weren't prepared at
first for the way we would be attacked by these teams and it was a
lack of preparation for us. All we can do is sit here and smile.''
	   Miller, who led the Utes to the Final Four in March, scored 10
of his 18 points in the final four minutes of regulation and the
overtime. He tied the game with the final basket of regulation with
1:08 left, and scored the first basket of overtime, 25 seconds in.
	   The United States never gave up that lead.
	   ``All I could think of was that gold medal,'' Miller said. ``I
picked up my defense, they made some turnovers and missed some 3s
and we were able to capitalize on it.''
	   Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio and Elton Brand of Duke each
had 15 points for the United States and James Posey of Xavier added
13.
	   Australia was led by its veteran backcourt of Shane Heal, who
had 38 points, and Andrew Gaze, who had 25. Their 3-point shooting
kept Australia in front most of the way, but neither hit from
beyond the arc in the final 6 1/2 minutes of regulation and
overtime. Heal, who played with the Minnesota Timberwolves,
finished with eight 3s, while Gaze, who led Seton Hall to the 1989
collegiate championship game, had three.
	   ``You can't shoot from 26 feet at an 80 percent for a whole
game; that's basketball,'' said Heal, who had all but two of his
points in the opening 33 minutes. ``For us to win Andrew and I had
to step up and make big shots. I started out warm. It felt good to
play well but to lose is hard and pretty disappointing.''
	   Haskins credited his team with the late shooting problems of
Gaze and Heal.
	   ``I told these guys we had to keep the pressure on them for 40
minutes,'' Haskins said. ``We kind of outlasted them.''
	   The United States won the gold medal in the inaugural Goodwill
Games in 1986, but that was followed by a silver in 1990 and a
bronze in 1994. Those were all college teams, with the NBA pros
making up gold-medal Dream Teams for the Olympics and world
championships since 1992.
	   Australia had never done better than its fifth-place finish in
1990.
	   The United States had the last chance at a win in regulation
after a wild final minute.
	   Miller, who scored the United States' last six points of
regulation, stole the ball in the corner and drove the length of
the court for a layup with 1:08 left that made it 79-79.
	   Heal let fly with a 3-point attempt with 37 seconds left on the
game clock and three on the 30-second shot clock. He missed but Sam
MacKinnon of Australia tapped the rebound out to Gaze who then
stood and worked the clock down as the crowd of 9,673 chanted
``U-S-A,'' letting fly a long 3 with seven seconds left. The U.S.
team worked the ball downcourt and Miller's off-balance jumper at
the buzzer missed.
	   The only loss for the United States came in the opening game
when it blew a 19-point second-half lead to Puerto Rico. Then came
a tougher-than-expected win over China in which the U.S. team took
control with an impressive closing 7 1/2 minutes.
	   The United States finally found its shooting touch during a
31-point win over Brazil in the final preliminary game and kept it
up with an 89-76 semifinal victory over Lithuania.
	   ``Sometimes you have to take that step back to go forward,''
Haskins said, referring to the opening loss. ``It wasn't that
everybody didn't want to win that game, it was that everbody tried
to win it themself. They regrouped, refocused and that's why
they're wearing those gold medals.''
	   In the bronze medal game, Lithuania beat Puerto Rico 119-75.

United States beats Canada in title game in overtime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Mark Millon and Darren Lowe scored overtime
goals and Sal LoCasio made a big save with six seconds left as the
United States beat Canada 15-14 in the International Lacrosse
Federation World Championship title game Friday night.
	   The United States rebounded after blowing a 10-goal
third-quarter lead to edge the Canadians for their fifth straight
title. The team now has won seven of the eight World Games played,
with Canada winning the 1978 final.
	   The game appeared to be over when Millon (four goals, one
assist) scored to give the Americans a 13-4 lead with 16:53 left.
	   But Canada reeled off nine straight goals to tie, keyed by Paul
Gait (three goals, two assists) and Gary Gait (three goals, one
assist), Tom Marechek (two goals, three assists) and John Tavares
(two goals, two assists).
	   Chris Gill sliced the lead to 13-12 with 35 seconds left, and
Paul Gait took Jim Veltman's feed and scored 12 seconds later to
force overtime.
	   But the Americans bounced back in overtime, which consisted of
two four-minute non-sudden-death periods. Millon gave the United
States the lead for good with a low 10-yard shot with 1:12 left in
the first period.
	   Ryan Wade (two goals, two assists) won the next faceoff for the
Americans and raced downfield to feed Lowe (one goal, two assists),
who scored from the edge of the crease just 10 seconds later.
	   Marechek scored with 2:24 left in the second overtime to make it
15-14. The Canadians had several good shots in that period, but
LoCasio, who tied a World Games record with 32 saves, stopped four.
	   LoCasio's biggest save came when he stopped Tavares' bounce shot
with six seconds remaining to give the Americans the victory.
	   After a slow start, the Americans tightened their close defense
and completely shut down the high-powered Canadian attack. The
United States scored 11 straight goals and blanked Canada for
exactly 49 minutes while taking an 11-1 lead.
	   In other games Friday, Australia routed the Iroquois Nationals
17-5 for third place. England claimed fifth place with a 21-6
victory over Germany. Scotland took seventh with a 10-9 overtime
decision over Japan, and the Czech Republic finished ninth after a
12-8 win against Sweden.

Passengers planes begin flying freight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Passenger planes were allowed to fly cargo
Saturday for the first time since a ban was imposed on
non-essential freight through Hong Kong's new 20-billion dollar
airport, newspapers reported.
	   As part of their plan to resume cargo operations gradually, the
airport's main air cargo handler Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd.
announced that one pallet of general cargo would now be allowed on
each passenger plane, the South China Morning Post said.
	   ``We anticipate that...(this) will mean an addition of
approximately 300 tons of cargo per day,'' the Post quoted the
company's managing director Anthony Charter as saying.
	   Shortly after the opening of Chek Lap Kok airport on July 6,
Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. began suffering from mechanical
and computer glitches in its cargo terminal at the new airport.
	   They imposed a ban on all cargo except perishable goods and
lifesaving material until July 19.
	   The company said it could operate at full speed only by the end
of August. At present, the company is handling slightly more than
50 percent of the 5,000 tons of cargo that were handled daily
before the ban.
	   The government has estimated that the protracted cargo delay
would result in a loss of about 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 589 million), or 0.35 percent of Hong Kong's Gross Domestic
Product this year.

Pioneering dissident writer Vladimir Dudintsev dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vladimir Dudintsev, a dissident writer best known
for the novel ``Not by Bread Alone,'' died last week, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported Saturday. He was one week short of his 80th
birthday.
	   Dudintsev's ``bold and uncompromising work'' laid the foundation
for a generation of dissident writers, including Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The agency said Dudintsev died Thursday, but did not say how or
where.
	   Although Dudintsev flourished during the relative liberalization
fostered by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, his work was later
suppressed as part of a general crackdown on dissent by Leonid
Brezhnev.
	   ``Not by Bread Alone'' was the story of an inventor's struggle
with the Soviet bureaucracy to have his metallurgical invention
accepted. Dudintsev also wrote the novel ``White Garb,'' which was
turned into a multi-part television film.
	   President Boris Yeltsin sent a note of condolence to Dudintsev's
family, ITAR-Tass said. Funeral services were to have been held
Saturday at a cemetery just outside Moscow.

Colombia restores home of South American Liberator Simon Bolivar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENNIFER ABRAHAMSON &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The Bogota estate where Simon Bolivar
hid from assassins and rested while presiding over the nations he
liberated had fallen into disrepair. The red tiles on the roof were
in pieces and the wooden columns chipped away.
	   After the South American Liberator's death in 1830, the house
was used at times as a girls school and a brewery.
	   Now, with a dlrs 1.1 million spruce-up, it has been turned into
a museum that Bolivar devotees hope will heighten interest in his
life.
	   ``This house sums up the moments of glory, joy and delight that
Bolivar had for his triumphs and also of sadness and deception for
the betrayals by his friends,'' said Elvira Cuervo de Jaramillo,
president of Bogota's historical restoration society, which helped
refurbish the 19th-century residence known as the Quinta de
Bolivar.
	   Colombia also hopes the home will strengthen the country's claim
_ hotly disputed by Venezuela _ as the place where the Liberator's
heart really was.
	   ``Bolivar was born in Venezuela, but I believe that Colombia was
his fundamental home in terms of his political and military
career,'' said the estate's museum director, Diana Torres de
Ospina. ``This house is proof of that.''
	   Since its July reopening after a seven-year restoration,
visitors have been streaming through the cobblestone courtyards and
flourishing gardens of the estate. Fountains and cannons flank the
simply furnished, cream-and-red stucco home, which contains the
Liberator's desk, trunk, watch, cape, saddle and many of his
letters and medals.
	   The Liberator sought refuge at the Quinta after supporters of
his vice-president, Francisco de Paula Santander, tried to
assassinate him in 1828.
	   The attack was foiled when Bolivar's mistress, Manuelita Saenz,
signaled for him to leap to safety from a balcony at the National
Palace. Traces of Bolivar's and Saenz's life together decorate the
walls and the airy rooms of the hacienda-style home.
	   Their portraits gaze down at visitors from Saenz's pink study,
adjacent to that of Bolivar, where he is said to have written death
sentences for the conspirators who tried to kill him.
	   Bolivar fans may be surprised by the compact bed in which the
legend slept. He may have been a towering figure in Latin American
history, but he stood just over 5 feet (1.5 meters).
	   Born in 1773 and inspired by the French revolution, Bolivar led
separatist armies into hundreds of battles in a campaign to free
more than half of South America from Spanish rule.
	   With the liberation of Peru and Bolivia, and the establishment
of Gran Colombia _ comprised of today's Panama, Colombia, Venezuela
and Ecuador _ the ideal became a reality from 1821 to 1830.
	   But his dream was pulled apart by power struggles within the
federation, and Venezuela and Ecuador broke away amid complaints
that Bolivar ruled as a despot.
	   A dejected Bolivar resigned the presidency of the disintegrating
republic in 1830 and died the same year of tuberculosis in
Colombia.
	   ``There have been three great fools in history: Jesus, Don
Quixote and I,'' he is said to have uttered before his death.
	   Despite his miserable end, Bolivar's heroic feats are
memorialized across the continent where they still move Latin
Americans to action.
	   Colombia's M-19 leftist guerrilla group, now demobilized, first
appeared in the early 1980s by stealing Bolivar's sword from a
national museum and vowing to continue his fight.
	   Hugo Chavez, the former coup leader now leading presidential
polls in Venezuela, has based his political movement on what he
calls ``Bolivarian'' ideals.
	   ``I consider Bolivar's campaign as greater than that of George
Washington of the United States or of Napoleon,'' said Mario Plaza,
a visitor to the Quinta. ``He is one of the great heroes of
humanity.''

Finance minister calls on Japan to boost economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PULAU PINANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's deputy prime minister
on Saturday demanded the new Japanese government attempt to
stimulate its economy, which he said would lead to the
strengthening of the region's economic health.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who is also finance minister, made his comments
while laying a stone in the foundation of the Japan Malaysia
Technical Institute on this island off northeast Malaysia, the
domestic news agency Bernama reported.
	   On Friday, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party selected Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi as its new leader, paving the way for him to
become the new Japanese prime minister.
	   Obuchi is expected to come under tremendous pressure in coming
weeks to take actions to encourage growth in the world's second
largest economy.
	   Struggling Asian countries have been pleading with Japan to
revive its recession-plagued economy and help them by importing
more from the region. In a sign of the regional economic troubles,
Japan's trade surplus with Asia dropped 36.3 percent in June to
374.3 billion yen (dlrs 2.7 billion).
	   Anwar called on Japanese factories in Pulau Pinang to endorse
and support the 118 million ringgit (dlrs 30 million) institute by
fully utilizing it. The institute, constructed with Japanese aid,
is scheduled to be completed in two years.
	   Japanese Ambassador to Malaysia Eissei Nomura told reporters
that Malaysia's ``Look East'' policy had been successfully
implemented and should now evolve by adapting itself to the
country's new needs and constraints.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad launched the ``Look East''
policy in 1981 in an attempt to get Malaysians to imitate the work
ethic of the Japanese and foster closer economic ties.
	   Since the policy was launched, about 5,000 Malaysian students
have gone to Japan for studies.
	   In this context, Nomura said the JMTI could play an important
role by creating more opportunities for Malaysian students who,
after graduating from the institute, could continue their studies
in Japan.
	   Nomura said the institute would receive experts and equipment
worth 540 million yen (dlrs 3.9 million) from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency.

Pledging closer ties, Turkey ships water to northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The first shipment of fresh water from a
Turkish river arrived in thirsty northern Cyprus on Saturday, and
Turkey vowed to integrate its economy even more closely with that
of the breakaway state.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel landed in the self-declared
republic for a ceremony inaugurating the supply project. His visit
followed Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's trip Monday that marked the
24th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of the island.
	   ``The water project is a historic one that will render the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus green and prosperous and is
also an indication that Turkey attaches as much importance to the
welfare of the inhabitants of Cyprus as to their security,''
Demirel said upon arrival.
	   The display of Turkish solidarity comes at a time of increased
tension on the island over Greek-Cypriot plans to deploy
Russian-made missiles and a European Union decision to start
membership talks with the Greek Cypriots.
	   Turkey says Cyprus' membership in the union would amount to the
island's integration with EU-member Greece and that Ankara must
therefore strengthen economic ties with northern Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish sectors since
1974, when Turkey sent armed forces in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
	   The Turkish Cypriot state, established on the northern third of
the island in 1983, is recognized only by Turkey, which stations
some 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkey has already threatened to launch military strikes to
prevent Greek-Cypriot deployment of Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles. Greece, in turn, has warned it would come
to Cyprus' aid, raising fears of a military clash between the two
NATO countries.
	   Demirel said northern Cyprus would be treated like any other
Turkish province from an economic point of view, raising protests
from Greek Cypriots.
	   ``If you touch northern Cyprus, you touch Turkey. It's as simple
as that. And you'll be taught the necessary lesson,'' Demirel was
quoted as saying in an interview published Friday in Turkish daily
Milliyet.
	   Saturday's water shipment was the first to arrive under a deal
to transport 7 million cubic meters (245 million cubic feet) of
drinkable water each year to northern Cyprus, which suffers a
severe water shortage. The water came from Turkey's Soguksu river,
was placed in a large bag and towed behind a boat 65 sea miles (100
kilometers) from the Turkish coast to the town of Kumkoy.
	   The water is meant for about half of northern Cyprus' estimated
200,000 residents. The shipment was organized by Turkey's Akdeniz
Su Tasima Co. and Norway's NWT company.
	   Turkey has also launched a feasibility study to construct a
water pipeline to the island.

Observers lower standards for Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, deletes extraneous word, 5th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Conceding that a campaign laden with
violence and fear won't enable fully free and fair elections,
watchdog groups fell in line behind foreign countries Saturday and
said they will judge Cambodia's polls by a lower standard.
	   Cambodian election officials meanwhile said that they would bar
two groups with close links to strongman Hun Sen from deploying an
estimated 40,000 observers at polling stations, which many feared
would influence the result.
	   Campaigning for the parliamentary elections ended Friday,
followed by a one-day cooling off period before the 5.4 million
registered voters can cast ballots Sunday for the first time since
the United Nations organized polls in 1993 under the protection of
20,000 peacekeepers.
	   This time, Cambodia is organizing the polls and the U.N. has
been invited only to coordinate 678 foreign observers from 40
countries and regional groupings. They will be unable to monitor
all the 11,600 polling stations.
	   The vote had been called by Hun Sen, who is seeking to restore
international legitimacy and aid after deposing his co-premier,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last year that shattered
the coalition established after the U.N.-sponsored balloting.
	   Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Rainsy are the main
challengers. They believe Hun Sen will rig the vote or the counting
in favor of his Cambodian People's Party. Many Cambodians fear Hun
Sen will call out the army to retain power.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party claimed that violence continued Saturday,
saying a grenade was thrown at the home of a local party leader in
the southern province of Koh Kong. He was uninjured.
	   The opposition, watchdog groups and some countries have accused
Hun Sen of intimidating voters and of killing, kidnapping and
beating their political opponents.
	   They have pushed the international community to refuse to
endorse the election unless it is free in fair, but the U.N.
coordinating body, which will have a decisive voice, decided Friday
that a more vague standard of ``broadly representative'' would be
acceptable.
	   Others fell in line Saturday. An internationally recognized
local watchdog, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, which will be an important observer of the balloting,
said that if things go smoothly for voting and ballot counting the
elections could be deemed ``reasonably credible.''
	   COMFREL President Thun Saray acknowledged that the killings and
intimidation meant the vote cannot be considered ``free.'' Nor
could they be seen as fair, since the opposition had almost no
broadcast media access.
	   The U.N. group _ officially known as the Joint International
Observers Group _ said it should be able to certify the election as
``broadly representative of the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   The group indicated that it would not hold Cambodia _ where the
political culture has been traumatized by three decades of civil
war and the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s _ to as rigorous
standards as more developed democracies.
	   ``We have to take into account the Cambodian reality,'' said
Thun Saray. ``What is the alternative? If you think this electoral
process will not provide continuity of democracy, I don't see any
other alternative but more fighting.''
	   The election for 122 National Assembly seats Sunday may not be
perfect, but Thun Saray said it was the only hope that the
democratic process in Cambodia will not die.
	   The Asian Network for Free Elections, an umbrella of
non-governmental organizations, echoed COMFREL and said Saturday it
did not want to attach ``catch words'' to its assessment.
	   ``It is possible for the process to have flaws and serious
problems, but for the result to still be valid,'' said Christian
Monsod, former election commission chairman in the Philippines.

Japan's first calf cloned from cow fetus dies 16 hours after birth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A calf cloned from cells taken from a cow fetus
died early Saturday just 16 hours after its birth to become the
nation's first using the method.
	   The calf, a male Holstein, died of bleeding from the naval area,
said Norio Tabara, chief of cloning technology at the Kagoshima
Prefectural Cattle Breeding Development institute in southern
Japan.
	   ``It was very unfortunate,'' Tabara said. But he denied any link
between the calf's death and the cloning.
	   ``The cause was something rather common,'' he said. ``Next time
we have to be more careful.''
	   The calf was the latest clone born in recent weeks in Japan
under the nation's ambitious program to seek ways to consistently
reproduce cows that give more milk or higher quality beef.
	   Scientists in the United States succeeded in cloning a cow from
fetal cells earlier this year.
	   Two adult-clone calves using cells taken from ova were born
earlier this month at an institute in central Japan. Some 40 more
cow cloning experiments using cells taken from cow fetuses, ears,
buttocks and other parts from adults are under way.
	   On Friday, the male Holstein was born by caesarean section and
was larger than average at 57.2 kilograms (125.8 lbs).
	   The calf seemed in good condition initially, but later developed
anemia from the bleeding and became very week, Tabara said.
	   It was treated intensively with anti-bleeding agents, blood
transfusions and intravenous injections, but could not be saved, he
said.
	   The institute used a similar technique to that used to produce
Dolly, the sheep that made history by becoming the world's first
adult-animal clone.
	   Researchers removed cells from a Holstein fetus, which was about
13 centimeters (5.2 inches) long, then placed them in unfertilized
eggs which had their nuclei removed.
	   The artificially cultivated embryos were placed into the
surrogate cow's womb last October.
	   On Feb. 16, scientists in the United States produced a clone
calf _ a Holstein named Gene _ with cells from a 30-day-old fetus.
	   The Kagoshima institute is expecting clone calves using cells
taken from a cow's ear to be born as early as mid-August.

Cambodians ready to vote, but fear remains for after elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ When they had elections five years
ago under the protection of 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers, Cambodians
defied threats from genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and came out
in droves to vote, showing a hankering for peace and democracy
after decades of civil war and bloodshed.
	   As they wait to cast ballots again Sunday, they have the same
desire.
	   And despite all the pressure put on them by strongman Hun Sen to
vote for his formerly communist Cambodian People's Party, no one
can be quite sure what the verdict of the urns will be.
	   ``I don't wish for anything else but peace,'' said In Sok, 53, a
farmer near the port town of Sihanoukville, where principal
opposition candidate Prince Norodom Ranariddh took a swim as the
campaign period officially closed Friday.
	   The 1993 elections were won by Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC.
The result was a surprise, since Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985
under the harsh Vietnamese military occupation that followed the
murderous Khmer Rouge regime, was more organized and more ruthless
in intimidating his opponents.
	   Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership with Ranariddh by
threatening civil war, then deposed him after four tense years last
July in fighting that devastated parts of Phnom Penh with tanks,
mortars and rockets. He has called the new election in a bid to
regain international legitimacy and aid.
	   This time, with the U.N. only coordinating foreign observers,
Hun Sen has resorted to a wide range of tactics _ alleged murders
of opponents, intimidation, bribery, denial of media access,
packing the electoral machinery with his supporters _ to make sure
he wins.
	   But if Cambodians think they can vote secretly, without fear of
retribution _ about the only condition verbalized by the European
Union's observation mission chief, Glenys Kinnock, for polls to get
her endorsement _ Hun Sen may still have a surprise.
	   ``Cambodians really liked the election in 1993,'' Sydney
Schanberg, the journalist whose experiences in the Khmer Rouge
takeover in 1975 were told in the Academy Award-winning film ``The
Killing Fields,'' told Associated Press Television in a Washington
interview.
	   ``I have a suspicion that they're going to show their interest
in democracy by voting in great numbers this time,'' Schanberg
said. ``They may surprise us. They may not respond to the
intimidation of the present ruler, who doesn't have a very charming
approach.''
	   Some 5.4 million Cambodians, more than 90 percent of the
eligible voters, have registered to cast ballots for the 122
National Assembly seats at stake.
	   Rith Ly, 43, a motorcycle taxi driver in the capital, remains
haunted by the fighting Hun Sen unleashed last July. For two days
the capital was a war zone between rival armed forces, and the
third day Hun Sen's victorious troops went on a looting spree.
	   Rith Ly's house was located in a village opposite Pochentong
airport, caught in the crossfire of some of the heaviest fighting.
	   ``The people are still panicked,'' Rith Ly said. ``I don't think
they care so much for who will win, but they want stability.''
	   Few Cambodians want to say on the record who they'll vote for.
But most say they plan to cast ballots. Rith Ly, whose earnings
have halved to about 5,000 riels (dlrs 1.25) since the coup, a
reflection a general economic downturn, says he wants ``a good
leader capable of managing the country.''
	   Mom, 40, a clothes vendor, also complained about the current
business climate. She said fears have kept buyers from the market
and she has begun dipping into her savings to support her family.
She said she will vote to have the situation return to normal.
	   ``I'll go to vote, because it is only once in five years,'' Mom
said. She likes the Cambodian People's Party ``because Hun Sen has
built a lot of roads.''
	   Siyon Sophearith, 24, an art school student, described election
day as only a ``transition into an uncertainty. I'm concerned that
what happened in 1993 may repeat itself. If the CPP wins, there may
be no problem, but what if it loses? I don't know if anyone else
has an army to fight it.''
	   Hun Sen has repeatedly promised to turn over power peacefully if
he loses.
	   Saturday was a cooling off day. Party convoys of trucks and
motorcycle that filled the capital in recent days were gone. But
strung between trees planted along boulevards during the French
colonial-era remained banners hung by a Buddhist organization with
slogans most could agree on:
	   ``We want a non-violent election.''

<TEXT>
	   GUANICA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With its melancholy, two-story
concrete cubicles fronting a placid Caribbean bay, this harbor
hamlet betrays little sign of its immense importance in Puerto
Rican history.
	   Tens of thousands of people were expected for a gathering
Saturday to mark the day, exactly 100 years ago, when a U.S.
battleship steamed into the harbor and launched an embarrassingly
swift end to 400 years of Spanish colonial rule.
	   Right from the beginning, Puerto Ricans debated the nature of
their ties to the United States. That debate is reaching its
crescendo now, with Gov. Pedro Rossello's effort to turn the U.S.
``commonwealth'' _ whose 3.8 million residents are U.S. citizens
but cannot vote for president _ into the 51st American state.
	   ``We've been for 100 years a colony of the United States,'' said
Carlos Romero Barcelo, the island's non-voting representative in
Congress and a major proponent of statehood. ``We have a
resentment, because we're very proud. But I can assure you that the
minute that flag is changed and they have 51 stars instead of 50
... there will be a completely different attitude.''
	   Opponents of statehood _ both Puerto Ricans and mainlanders _
note the militancy with which the 3.8 million islanders have stuck
to the language and culture that Spain left behind. Statehood, they
contend, will dilute those vestiges.
	   American influences are evident here. Basketball and baseball
predominate over soccer, and U.S. restaurant chains _ from KFC to
Ponderosa _ have aggressively penetrated the island.
	   But the feel and flavor in Puerto Rico is undoubtedly Spanish.
Only a quarter of Puerto Ricans speak English well. Most of the
signs and every commonwealth radio station but one are
Spanish-language.
	   But in 1898, Spain's corrupt and inefficient empire was
decomposing. Many islanders welcomed the Americans, who set their
sights on this strategic gateway to the Caribbean as a last spoil
of the Spanish-American War.
	   Guanica, on the southwest corner of the island, was chosen as a
landing point because the capital, San Juan, was well-defended, and
the waters off Ponce, the second-largest town, were too shallow to
approach. From here, troops would reach Ponce by rail and then use
a military road to approach San Juan from the south, winning
control of the island in days.
	   ``The Spaniards were completely taken by surprise,'' The
Associated Press reported on July 25, 1898, the day the Americans
took Guanica. ``Almost the first they knew of (the invasion) was
the firing of a gun from the (warship) Gloucester.''
	   The ship, its actions witnessed from an AP dispatch boat in the
bay, pounded the surrounding hills, avoiding the small town itself
``lest the projectiles hurt women and children.'' A launch was sent
carrying 30 men and a Colt rapid-fire gun. Four Spanish soldiers
were killed in the skirmish that ensued.
	   ``Guanica is the most delightful spot yet occupied by our
force,'' a victorious Gen. Nelson Miles observed afterward,
according to the AP report. ``It is a center for the coffee and
sugar industry and large herds of cattle are pasturing in the
meadows, which are bordered by coconut palms.''
	   Near the site where Miles landed, Rossello planned a
pro-statehood rally for Saturday he hopes will nudge the U.S.
Senate into passing a bill allowing for a Puerto Rican referendum
on the island's political status.
	   The bill was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in
March, and Romero Barcelo said in an interview with the AP that
intense lobbying of Republican opponents will push it through the
Senate in the next several months.
	   The statehood camp wants the economic advantages and political
prestige that a firmer alliance with the United States would offer.
Advocates say their current status is humiliating, likening it to
being a servant who is not invited to sit at the table.
	   Romero Barcelo said he was confident of a solid majority for
statehood even though current polls show Puerto Ricans evenly
divided between statehood and continued commonwealth.
	   Meanwhile, the independence movement _ supported by only one in
20 Puerto Ricans but highly militant _ plans a counter-rally to
deliver the opposite message: that wedding this island to the
United States would be an invitation to mayhem.

	   GUANICA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ When Angie Noya looks out from her
porch she sees the exact spot where American troops landed a
century ago, establishing a bridgehead from which they swiftly took
Puerto Rico from the Spanish.
	   Her normally sleepy little town is transformed this weekend by
thousands of Puerto Ricans streaming in to mark the anniversary.
	   Some are here to celebrate and demand that Puerto Rico finally
become a full-fledged U.S. state _ the pet project of Gov. Pedro
Rossello and a goal with which Noya agrees.
	   Others _ ``independentistas'' _ are protesting the American
presence in ``la patria,'' their Spanish-speaking homeland.
	   In the Noya home, a debate raged Friday night as
pro-independence songs blared from a bandstand at the harbor side.
	   ``I want my country to be free,'' said her friend Heydee Monge,
a buyer for Bacardi rum, a proud Puerto Rican company.
	   She said she would happily give up her U.S. citizenship.
	   Noya disagreed: ``We're not ready for independence. We gained
much from being part of the United States. We should be a state.''
	   Rummaging through photograph albums, the 43-year-old gym teacher
produced a yellowing newspaper clipping showing that the first U.S.
flag to reach the island was given to her great-grandfather Agustin
Darren Echea, then mayor of Guanica.
	   Anita Garrido, who made the 100-mile (150-kilometer) trip from
the capital San Juan disagreed with both. She wants to preserve the
commonwealth, even though it means Puerto Ricans cannot vote for
president.
	   This way, she said, she can be an American and have her own
country.
	   ``She's totally confused!'' exploded Antonio Delgado, a
white-haired pediatrician.
	   Then the group retired to a dinner of traditional beans and rice
with grilled chicken.

Myanmar opposition leader blocked on another trip outside Yangon

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military and Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi were engaged in a standoff on a
highway Saturday morning, nearly 24 hours after police stopped the
democracy campaigner's car as she tried to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi, an aide and two drivers spent the night inside her
white sedan surrounded by barbed wire barricades, sand bags and a
contingent of soldiers about 32 miles (51 kilometers) west of the
capital.
	   This is the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner's third attempt this
month to travel outside Yangon to meet members of her political
party, the National League for Democracy.
	   The military government has stopped her every time. It denies
she is under house arrest or other unlawful restrictions.
	   The military issued a statement Saturday that said Suu Kyi was
``bullheaded'' and lacked a ``humanitarian vision.'' It accused her
of conspiring to ``portray Myanmar as a lawless and unstable
country where the democratic forces are being suppressed.''
	   During an earlier attempt to travel freely outside the capital,
more than 30 soldiers lifted the Nobel laureate's white sedan with
her inside it, and turned it around to face Yangon.
	   On the previous two trips on July 7 and 20, a compromise was
reached where the military brought the party member Suu Kyi was
attempting to meet to her car.
	   Suu Kyi's intention this time was to travel to Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta where
local authorities are more repressive than in some other parts of
Myanmar.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   She was stopped near Anyarsu village at about 10:15 a.m. Friday
by local police who called the military authorities.
	   Her goal, as in previous journeys, was to meet with members of
her party voted into parliament in a 1990 election the military
refused to honor despite pledging before the poll it would hand
over power to the winners.
	   That was before the NLD captured 82 percent of the seats.
	   She has been telling them not to obey a military order that the
lawmakers report to the authorities twice a day. The military
ordered them to report under the ``Habitual Offenders Act'' a law
reserved for those considered heinous criminals by the government.
	   She also hoped to give encouragement to families of party
members who have been jailed by the military government.
	   Suu Kyi's party has sent an official letter of protest about
using the Habitual Offenders Act against her party's
representatives to Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the military
government.
	   He has not replied.
	   Of the 392 NLD members of parliament 181 are either in jail,
exile, been disqualified by the military-run election commission,
been forced under pressure to resign from the party or have died.
	   The NLD has said the rest are living under constant harassment
by the military.
	   The military denies the charges of harassment and says it never
intended to hand over power to the election winners.

Bhutto won't be arrested, told to appear in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Responding to appeals from her lawyers,
Pakistan's Supreme Court said Saturday that former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto would not face arrest upon her return to the
country. She was told to appear voluntarily before a special
corruption court.
	   Supreme Court Justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddique asked Ms. Bhutto's
lawyers to ensure she showed up in a Lahore court on Monday, the
day after she is expected to return to Pakistan from Dubai where
she has been visiting her three children. Ms. Bhutto moved her
children to Dubai last year, saying they weren't safe in Pakistan.
	   The corruption court issued an arrest warrant on July 16 after
Ms. Bhutto missed a previous court appearance on charges of failing
to declare some of her assets when she filed election papers last
year.
	   Earlier this month, a Swiss Court indicted Ms. Bhutto's husband
Asif Zardari on charges of money laundering and said it was
clearing up details before charging Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   Zardari has been in jail since his wife's government was
dismissed in November 1996 on charges of corruption and ineptitude.
Zardari faces Pakistani charges of corruption as well as murder in
connection with the 1996 shooting death of Ms. Bhutto's estranged
brother, Murtaza. Zardari has denied the charges.
	   Ms. Bhutto has accused her rival Nawaz Sharif, who succeeded her
as prime minister, of conducting a witch hunt against her and her
family.
	   Sharif swept to power in elections last year after an
anti-corruption campaign. Once in office, he set out to prove Ms.
Bhutto and her husband took millions of dollars in kickbacks and
bribes and deposited the spoils in Swiss bank accounts.

Braves down Pirates, 3-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ John Smoltz pitched a three-hitter for his
first shutout in nearly a year, and Andres Galarraga hit a two-run
homer to power the Atlanta Braves past the Pirates 3-0 Friday
night.
	   The Braves' 68-35 record is the best in club history through 103
games and includes a 6-1 record against the Pirates, who had won
six of seven. The Braves have outscored the Pirates 37-11 and have
outhomered them 12-4.
	   Galarraga's two-run shot in the fifth off Chris Peters (4-8) was
his 33rd of the season and his 30th against the Pirates, including
three this season. He had a two-homer game in Pittsburgh on April
8.
	   Galarraga drove in all three Braves' runs, putting them ahead
1-0 in the first with a force-play grounder following Tony
Graffanino's one-out double and Chipper Jones' single. Graffanino
went 2-for-4 while batting second in the Braves' order for only the
fourth time this season.
	   Smoltz (9-2) didn't need much offense after that, striking out a
season-high 10 and walking none in his most dominating start and
first complete game of the season. He is 5-1 with a 2.52 ERA since
coming off the disabled list June 20.
 &UR; Mets 5, Cubs 0, 1st game &QC; 
 &UR; Mets 7, Cubs 3, 2nd game &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Carlos Baerga drove in four runs as New York swept a
doubleheader for the second time in three days.
	   The Mets, who swept Milwaukee on Wednesday, have won six
straight games and moved within 1 1/2 games of the Cubs for the
wild card.
	   In the first game, Armando Reynoso pitched eight shutout innings
to win his first appearance in a year and Brian McRae had three
hits for the Mets. Reynoso had been sidelined with a shoulder
injury.
	   New York pitchers have combined for 13 shutouts, four in the
club's last six games.
	   New York trailed 3-2 in the eighth inning of the second game
before scoring five runs in the last two innings. The Mets took the
lead in the eighth on RBI singles by Mike Piazza and Lenny Harris
off Terry Adams (7-6).
	   Dennis Cook (6-3) got one out for the victory.
	   Cubs starter Jeremi Gonzalez (7-7) lost the opener.
 &UR; Brewers 10, Expos 7, 1st game
 &UR; Expos 11, Brewers 2, 2nd game
	   In Milwaukee, Vladimir Guererro had a career-high five RBIs and
homered for the fourth straight game as Montreal split the
doubleheader.
	   Mike Thurman (1-0) pitched six-hitter in his first start this
season as the Expos snapped an eight-game losing streak.
	   In the opener, Mark Loretta hit a three-run homer, Dave Nilsson
had a two-run shot, and Jose Valentin added a solo shot as the
Brewers won despite losing starting pitcher Jeff Juden.
	   Juden was ejected by plate umpire Jim Quick for arguing moments
after surrendering a home run to Shane Andrews.
	   The Expos gave Thurman a 6-0 cushion in the second game with
four runs in the third off Paul Wagner (1-5), who was activated off
the 15-day disabled list before the game.
 &UR; Phillies 6, Marlins 4, 12 innings, 1st game
 &UR; Phillies 7, Marlins 6, 12 innings, 2nd game
	   In Philadelphia, the Phillies rallied four times in the final
four innings, getting an RBI single from Rico Brogna in the 12th to
beat the Florida Marlins and sweep their doubleheader.
	   The Phillies also won the opener in 12 innings on Scott Rolen's
two-run homer.
	   In the second game, Philadelphia overcame a 3-1 deficit in the
ninth on a two-run homer by pinch-hitter Mark Lewis.
	   Florida, which has lost seven in a row, took a one-run lead in
the 10th, 11th and 12th only to have the Phillies rally each time.
	   Ruben Amaro's leadoff homer in the 12th off Vic Darensbourg
(0-7) tied it 6-6. Doug Glanville then singled and Desi Relaford
sacrificed. Darensbourg walked Rolen intentionally before Brogna
singled.
	   Mark Leiter (4-2) gave up Cliff Floyd's RBI single in the 12th
but got the win.
	   Rolen's homer in the first game came against Antonio Alfonseca
(2-2). Wayne Gomes (9-3) pitched the 12th to earn his major
league-leading ninth relief victory.
 &UR; Giants 12, Reds 2
	   In San Francisco, Jeff Kent hit two homers, including a grand
slam, and drove in a career-high seven runs, leading the San
Francisco Giants over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   The Reds lost their eighth in a row following a 10-game winning
streak.
	   Kent, breaking out in a big way after hitting just .098 since
his July 10 return from a 24-game stay on the disabled list because
of a knee sprain, hit his sixth career grand slam as part of the
Giants' eight-run fourth.
	   Charlie Hayes drove in three runs in the same inning with a
two-run homer and an RBI single as the Giants won for just the
third time in 14 games since the All-Star break.
	   Joe Carter, acquired a day earlier in a trade with Baltimore,
doubled and scored during the Giants' big fourth. Jose Mesa,
obtained from Cleveland in another trade Thursday, pitched a
scoreless ninth for San Francisco.
	   Mark Gardner (8-4) scattered five hits in eight innings. Scott
Winchester (3-6) was the loser.
 &UR; Dodgers 3, Diamondbacks 1
	   In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park pitched two-hit ball for eight
innings and tied a career-high with 11 strikeouts, leading the Los
Angeles Dodgers over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Park (9-5) has won 11 straight decisions in a span of 16 starts
at Dodger Stadium. Orel Hershiser holds the record at the ballpark
with 12 consecutive wins.
	   Park, who has not lost at home since July 10, 1997, held the
Diamondbacks hitless until Yamil Benitez homered with two outs in
the fifth inning.
	   Jeff Shaw pitched a scoreless ninth for his 29th save and sixth
with the Dodgers. Shaw gave up one hit.
	   Los Angeles did all its scoring in the third against Amaury
Telemaco (3-4).
 &UR; Astros 2, Padres 1
	   In San Diego, Pete Schourek pitched seven strong innings to
match his longest stint of the season and the Houston Astros
defeated the San Diego Padres in a meeting of NL division leaders.
	   Schourek (6-6) gave up one run and five hits, walking none and
striking out six. He exceeded his victory total of 1997, when he
went 5-8 for Cincinnati in a season riddled by elbow problems.
	   Mike Magnante pitched the ninth for his second save.
	   The loss snapped a three-game winning streak for the Padres, who
had also won 10 of their previous 12 games. The Central-leading
Astros are 5-2 against the NL West-leading counterparts.
	   Sterling Hitchcock (4-4) allowed two runs and six hits in six
innings.
 &UR; Rockies 12, Cardinals 3
	   In Denver, Vinny Castilla upstaged Mark McGwire by homering
twice and Ellis Burks had a three-run shot among his four hits as
the Colorado Rockies won their fourth straight, beating the St.
Louis Cardinals.
	   McGwire, a career .400 hitter with four homers at Coors Field,
went 0-for-4 and remained stuck at 43 homers in his pursuit of
Roger Maris. He is hitless in his last 13 at-bats and homerless in
his last 14.
	   St. Louis third baseman Gary Gaetti made his second career
pitching appearance, working a scoreless eighth inning. He gave up
two hits, but got two fly balls and a groundout.
	   The support was plenty for Darryl Kile (7-12), who came back
after a 2-hour, 47-minute rain delay to pitch six innings. Todd
Stottlemyre (9-9) took the loss.

American converts to Judaism struggle for citizenship in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIT SHEMESH, Israel (AP) _ Sarah and Elazar Yaisrael, converts
to Judaism, were given a festive sendoff by their Chicago synagogue
in May when they packed up their belongings to immigrate to Israel.
	   But when the seamstress and the truck driver landed at Tel Aviv
airport with their four children and two grandchildren, they were
detained and interrogated for hours. Yaisrael had already obtained
Israeli citizenship in 1996, but the other members of the family
were told curtly they would be given only 30-day tourist visas.
	   Dan Evron, a lawyer for the movement of Conservative Judaism in
Israel, says he believes bureaucrats are giving the Yaisraels a
hard time because they don't fit the mold of Jewish immigrants. His
clients are black, were raised as Christians and were converted by
a non-Orthodox rabbi.
	   More than two months after arriving, the Yaisraels still live in
limbo. They are too broke to return to the United States, and the
Interior Ministry has not explained why it has not granted the
Yaisraels the citizenship that Israeli law offers automatically to
Jews.
	   ``I came here to give my children a right way of life, to save
them from the streets of America and to embrace Judaism and its
people,'' said Mrs. Yaisrael, 47, her brow furrowing.
	   Bobby Brown, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said neither the Yaisraels' conversion process nor their
race is an issue. He noted Israel has allowed hundreds of
non-Jewish blacks to come from Ethiopia to be united with Jewish
relatives. However, he would not explain the ministry's actions
concerning the Yaisraels.
	   The Yaisraels' case touches on basic immigration issues,
including the thorny dispute over who is a Jew and dilemmas arising
from Israel's relatively new status as a prosperous country
attracting those seeking a better economic future.
	   ``It used to be that you had to be a little crazy to come
here,'' said Brown. ``But ... it is becoming a more attractive
place for people to come.''
	   The government fears large numbers of non-Jews may try to obtain
easy conversions abroad and immigrate, with Israel unable to stem
the flow.
	   Israel is still struggling to absorb nearly 800,000 immigrants
from the former Soviet Union who arrived over the past decade.
About 30 percent were non-Jews who came under a provision of the
Law of Return that grants citizenship to people with a Jewish
grandparent.
	   The Yaisraels have also stumbled into a bitter fight over
conversions being waged between Israel's Orthodox religious
establishment and Judaism's liberal Reform and Conservative
streams, which are predominant in the United States but have only a
small following in Israel.
	   Reform and Conservative leaders have gone to court to win the
right to perform conversions not only abroad, but also in Israel.
	   In response, key Orthodox political parties in Netanyahu's
coalition have begun pushing through parliament legislation that
would codify the Orthodox monopoly on conversions in Israel.
	   Leaders of the Conservative movement contend the Interior
Ministry, which is controlled by the Orthodox Shas Party, is
needlessly holding up a growing number of citizenship applications
by Conservative converts.
	   ``What was once automatic, you now need lawyer for in almost
every case,'' said Rabbi Ehud Bandel, head of the Conservative
movement in Israel.
	   The Yaisraels converted 10 years ago at the University of
Judaism in Los Angeles. They later moved to Harvey, Illinois, a
suburb of Chicago where they joined a Conservative congregation.
	   For their first two months here, the Yaisraels lived without
furniture in an apartment in Beit Shemesh, a quiet working-class
town with a view of the Jerusalem hills. Until their shipment of
household goods arrived in mid-July, they slept on mattresses and
bought food daily because there was no refrigerator.
	   The couple's 17-year-old daughter, Yahudeth, contracted a
bacterial infection from eating spoiled food. Without the health
insurance provided for new immigrants, the Yaisraels had to pay the
hospital bills.
	   The family has depleted most of its dlrs 10,000 in savings.
Officially a tourist, Mrs. Yaisrael is not allowed to work, and her
husband is reluctant to go ahead with plans to open a small
business because of the uncertain future.
	   The walls of the apartment are bare, but most of the furniture
has been unpacked and put in place. Jewish ritual objects including
a shofar, the ram's horn used for calling to prayer, are displayed
along with an open copy of the Old Testament.
	   ``We've always lived a Jewish way of life,'' Mrs. Yaisrael said.
``We always thought our aspiration was to come and live here. We
dealt with everything enthusiastically until we arrived at the
gate.''

Three killed in south Lebanon bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Three men believed to be Hezbollah
guerrillas were killed in southern Lebanon, apparently while
preparing a bomb, security officials said Saturday.
	   They said the men were killed Friday night in a deserted house
in the village of Arnoun on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border
enclave in south Lebanon.
	   Arnoun, some eight kilometers (five miles) southeast of the
market town of Nabatiyeh, lies near the Crusader-built Beaufort
Castle, which is controlled by Israeli troops.
	   The three men were believed to belong to the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group and were apparently preparing for an
attack against Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen,
the officials said. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A Hezbollah official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to comment on whether the victims belonged to the guerrilla
group.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes struck suspected Hezbollah
positions in southern Lebanon. No casualties were reported in the
raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 members of
the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied
zone.
	   The zone was established by Israel in 1985 to shield its
northern towns against cross-border guerrilla incursions.

Chinese negotiator calls for political talks with Taipei
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A senior Chinese negotiator on Saturday
urged Taiwan to agree to hold political talks with Beijing, saying
it will be a precondition for the resumption of dialogue frozen
three years ago.
	   The comments by Li Yafei, deputy secretary general of the
Association of Relations across the Taiwan Strait, again
underscored the differences between Taiwan and China over how to
improve ties.
	   Li, who arrived Friday for an eight-day visit, told reporters he
will meet his Taiwanese counterpart, Jan Jyh-horng, on Sunday to
arrange the visit to China by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation.
	   The two semi-official groups handle exchanges in the absence of
official ties.
	   But Li said China hopes the visit could ``foster a good
atmosphere that will create the conditions for starting procedural
talks on opening political dialogue.''
	   Taiwan, on the other hand, hopes Koo could meet with his
counterpart, Wang Daohan, during his visit scheduled for September
to plan for a second summit between the two.
	   The two men last met in Singapore in 1993 in the first open
dialogue between Taiwan and China since they split politically in
1949.
	   Regular dialogue has been suspended since 1995 because of
China's anger over a Taiwanese campaign to raise its international
profile. China considers Taiwan a rebel province with no right to
its own foreign relations.
	   Taiwan wants the dialogue to pick up where it was left off by
focusing on practical matters such as trade and fishing disputes.
	   Early this week, Chang King-yuh, chairman of the government
Mainland Affairs Council, indicated Taiwan is prepared for
gradually moving toward political dialogue.
	   But Li said China wants a written reply from Taiwan.
	   Li is visiting Taiwan as a member of a delegation of high school
tutors from Beijing, an apparent effort to downgrade his visit
before an agreement is reached on resuming dialogue.

Four family members gunned down in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen burst into a home in the
state of Kashmir on Saturday and fatally shot four members of a
family suspected to have links with separatist militants, police
said.
	   Three of the victims were women. Another family member is
reported missing after the attack and could have been kidnapped,
police said.
	   The killings took place in Doda, the same area in the northern
territory where Islamic militants gunned down 25 Hindus last month.
Doda is 170 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Kashmir's summer
capital, Jammu. More than half a million people live in Doda, a
majority of them Muslims.
	   Worried residents said Hindus seeking revenge for the June
killings could have been responsible for Saturday's shootings. The
victims were Muslims, and one family member is believed to be a
separatist rebel.
	   Police refused to say who could have been behind Saturdays'
attack.
	   Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, has been wracked by
a separatist movement since 1989. Militants say they want
independence or unification with Islamic Pakistan. More than 15,000
people have died in nine years of fighting.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The election authority overseeing
Sunday's parliamentary vote has banned some 40,000 observers from
two organizations believed to be linked to strongman Hun Sen from
monitoring the polls.
	   Im Soursdei, chairman of the National Election Committee, said
that two hitherto obscure groups that had suddenly attempted to
dominate the observeration process last week, applying for 40,000
accreditations, would not be allowed to monitor the polls.
	   But it was unclear how the word would reach all of the 11,600
polling stations, scattered across 21 provinces and Phnom Penh, in
time to stop any observers from the two groups from gaining access
to polling stations if they try.
	   ``We are very worried,'' Im Soursdei said at a press briefing.
``We have only today, and tomorrow is election day.''
	   The NEC has also been packed with Hun Sen supporters but has
nonetheless tried to distance itself from the observers dispute.
Leaders of international observers invited to monitor the polls
have said the apparent attempt to rig the process had to be
stopped.
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, one of
three independent, recognized watchdog groups that the NEC and
foreign observers have approved to observe the polls, said that
pre-election violence and intimidation and the lack of opposition
access to the media meant the elections could not be viewed as free
and fair.
	   But COMFREL said that a ``reasonably credible'' result could
still be had if voters can cast their ballots secretly and the
counting process is not turned into a farce.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back legitimacy and aid
following his bloody coup against Prince Norodom Ranariddh, his
co-prime minister. The prince won U.N-organized polls in 1993, but
was forced to share power when Hun Sen threatened civil war.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ South Africa won for the first
time in New Zealand in 17 years and handed the All Blacks a rare
second consecutive defeat in a Tri Nations rugby union match
Saturday at Athletic Park.
	   The Springboks took a firm grip on the Tri Nations competition
with its 13-3 win. A try by left winger Pieter Rossouw sealed the
South African victory, their first in New Zealand since 1981 in the
50th match between the two countries.
	   New Zealand lost its opening Tri Nations match to Australia
24-16 two weeks ago and the South Africans beat Australia 14-13
last week.
	   South Africa must only win one of its home games against either
New Zealand or Australia to give them the Tri Nations title won the
last two years by New Zealand.
	   ``Superb, magnificent,'' said Springboks captain Gary Teichmann,
whose team silenced the 45,000 capacity crowd. ``To beat them at
home is an achievement in itself. I'm very proud of the whole
squad.
	   ``We knew New Zealand were going through rebuilding and lost a
few players like Sean Fitzpatrick and Zinzan Brooke. We were the
same after the 1995 World Cup. I think every team goes through that
phase.''
	   Teichmann, who led a strong defensive effort by his team, felt
the South Africans could now start building confidently to defend
next year's World Cup.
	   For coach Nick Mallett, Saturday's win was his 12th straight win
since he took over the job last year.
	   ``I think it was a great test match,'' said Mallett. ``Sure,
there were a few mistakes, but both teams tried to score tries.
Both teams could have scored a few times had been up against
another side.''
	   Halfback Joost van der Westhuizen said the victory would sink in
later but he ranked the win as only second to their World Cup
victory in Johannesburg.
	   John Hart, who experienced his first consecutive defeats as All
Blacks coach, didn't think his backline functioned.
	   ``I thought our forwards were outstanding but the backline
didn't use the options well,'' he said. ``We had enough ball to win
the game but didn't put them away.''
	   Worse still for Hart was that his two key players, halfback
Justin Marshall and openside flanker Josh Kronfeld, are now likely
to miss next Saturday's match against Australia in Christchurch.
	   Kronfeld took a knock on the head and was helped off the field
with suspected concussion and Marshall was replaced by Ofisa Tonu'u
after injuring his hip.
	   ``They don't look good for next week,'' Hart said.
	   It was the first time in the recent years the All Blacks went
tryless.
	   They looked like scoring just once in the game _ seconds before
halftime when they pinned the Springboks close to the line with a
series of scrums.
	   But they opted to kick for goal when English referee Eddie
Morrison eventually awarded them a penalty, but Carlos Spencer
missed.
	   The standoff couldn't convert any of the five penalties he
attempted and was replaced by Andrew Mehrtens nine minutes into the
second half. Mehrtens kicked a penalty for the All Blacks' only
points.
	   In a finely balanced first half, the Springboks led just 3-0
through Percy Montgomery's penalty goal.
	   Scores:
	   SOUTH AFRICA 13 (Pieter Rossouw try; Percy Montgomery 2
penalties, conversion) def. NEW ZEALAND 3 (Andrew Mehrtens
penalty). (djp)

Three killed in Lebanese bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Three men believed to be Hezbollah
guerrillas were killed in southern Lebanon, apparently while
preparing a bomb, security officials said Saturday.
	   They said the men were killed Friday night in a deserted house
in the village of Arnoun on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border
enclave in southern Lebanon.
	   Arnoun, some eight kilometers (five miles) southeast of the
market town of Nabatiyeh, lies near the Crusader-built Beaufort
Castle, which is controlled by Israeli troops.
	   The three men were believed to belong to the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group and were apparently preparing for an
attack against Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen,
the officials said. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A Hezbollah official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to comment on whether the victims belonged to the guerrilla
group.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes struck suspected Hezbollah
positions in southern Lebanon. No casualties were reported in the
raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel established the zone in 1985 to shield its northern towns
against cross-border guerrilla incursions.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia took a 2-0 lead in the Fed
Cup tennis qualifying match against Argentina on Saturday with
straight-set wins to first-timers Jelena Dokic and Nicole Pratt.
	   Team captain Lesley Bowrey's gamble paid off when both players
took just over an hour to easily beat their opponents and put
Australia in a strong position for the remaining three matches on
Sunday.
	   Dokic, 15, ranked No. 1 in world junior tennis for a month after
making the finals of the French Open juniors and winning the
doubles, showed no sign of nerves as she took her match 6-2, 6-2
after forcing Mariana Diaz-Oliva into playing a baseline game.
	   Pratt, ranked 100th in the world, beat world No. 236 Celeste
Contin 6-2, 6-4.
	   The wins give Australia the advantage in the world group 2
regional qualifying playoff following a first-round loss to Russia.

ASEAN foreign ministers sign accord to make region drug-free
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Drug trafficking in Southeast Asia,
already linked to crimes such as arms smuggling, could worsen and
cause political and security threats in the region, officials said
in an anti-drug accord signed Saturday.
	   The declaration, which sets the goal of a drug-free region by
the year 2020, was signed by the foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations at the end of their two-day
annual meeting in Manila.
	   ASEAN's campaign to eradicate illegal drugs has been boosted by
the admission into the group last year of Myanmar and Laos, which
together with Thailand form the ``Golden Triangle,'' the source of
60 percent of the heroin reaching the United States.
	   ``It's getting worse,'' Philippine Foreign Assistant Secretary
Ernesto Llamas said of the region's drug problem. The Philippines,
itself burdened by serious drug abuse, initiated the declaration.
	   In the statement, ASEAN's nine member countries said they would
try their utmost to eradicate drug production, processing,
trafficking and use.
	   They agreed to strengthen links with international narcotics
agencies, toughen anti-narcotics laws and share information on drug
trade.
	   The ministers also agreed to cooperate in investigating,
prosecuting and seizing the properties of drug traffickers.
	   The statement also proposes the promotion of alternative
livelihoods for people who currently depend on the drug trade.
	   Llamas said almost all ASEAN countries have growing drug
problems except for Singapore, which has been able to keep drug use
under control.
	   In the Philippines, drug use has risen rapidly in recent years
despite a law that calls for the death penalty for possession of
more than 200 grams (7 ounces) of methamphetamine hydrochloride or
40 grams (1.4 ounces) of cocaine, heroin, opium or morphine.
	   There are an estimated 1.7 million illegal drug users in the
Philippines. The yearly trade in drugs is estimated at 300 billion
pesos (dlrs 7.5 billion).

Pythons missing from a Bangladesh zoo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Snake charmers are helping to look for
20 baby pythons that slithered out of a zoo in the northern town of
Rangpur, its caretaker said Saturday.
	   Residents reportedly panicked after authorities at the zoo
announced that the serpents had been missing since July 16 when
they were just 1-week-old.
	   Two of the reptiles were found near a rain-swollen pond three
blocks from the zoo on Thursday, caretaker Nazrul Islam said.
	   At least six snake charmers are helping zoo workers try to find
the others.
	   Since their birth, the baby pythons were kept inside an iron
cage along with their mother who is still in the zoo.
	   ``I'm deeply worried. I want the the authorities to catch the
pythons live or dead,'' said Mujibur Rahman, a school teacher
living near the zoo.
	   Rangpur is 155 miles (250 kilometers) north of Dhaka,
Bangladeshi capital.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Responding to appeals from her lawyers,
Pakistan's Supreme Court said Saturday that former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto would not face arrest upon her return to the
country. She was told to appear voluntarily before a special
corruption court.
	   Supreme Court Justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddique asked Ms. Bhutto's
lawyers to ensure she showed up in a Lahore court on Monday, the
day after she is expected to return to Pakistan from Dubai where
she has been visiting her three children. Ms. Bhutto moved her
children to Dubai last year, saying they weren't safe in Pakistan.
	   The corruption court issued an arrest warrant on July 16 after
Ms. Bhutto missed a previous court appearance on charges of failing
to declare some of her assets when she filed election papers last
year.
	   Her lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan told The Associated Press Ms. Bhutto
would plead innocent at her court appearance Monday. Ahsan said the
charges against her were politically inspired.

Condom maker says Southeast Asian sales slumping with economies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Condom sales in Southeast Asia are
shrinking because the region's economic crisis means less people
can afford to patronize the sex industry, a condom maker was
reported as saying.
	   Jon Gray, commercial director for London Royal Consumer Products
which makes Durex condoms, said a survey by his company shows Sales
are already slumping in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia,
according to Saturday's The Nation newspaper.
	   Thailand and Indonesia are battling through their worst economic
crises in 30 years. Singapore is in better shape, but its economy
has been affected by the regional problems and slowed.
	   During the last five years, Thailand, with its once-booming
economy and rampant commercial sex industry, was among the fastest
growing markets in the world, registering 10 to 15 percent
increases each year.
	   Gray was quoted as saying sales should increase by only 2 to 3
percent this year. He blamed the economic crisis, which he said
would cause the country's commercial sex industry to shrink by over
50 percent this year.
	   London Royal has about 70 percent of the Thai market.
	   He said Indonesia's economic problems would make it impossible
for his company to reach is sales target of 38 million.
	   Sales will also suffer in Singapore, increasing only somewhere
between zero and five percent, he was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Palma Bucarelli, who during four decades of
directing Italy's main modern art museum helped enrich the
country's collection of paintings, died Saturday.
	   Bucarelli, 88, died in a Rome hospital. Her illness was not
disclosed.
	   She directed Rome's Ngs, to the gallery's collection.
	   ``She was an important witness for modern art,'' said Italian
art critic Vittorio Sgarbi after hearing of her death.
	   Bucarelli organized exhibits of artists little seen by the
public in Italy, including a Picasso show in 1953; one of Piet
Mondrian works in 1956, and another of Jackson Pollock's paintings,
in 1958.
	   She successfully battled for parliamentary allocation of funds
to greatly expand the gallery, adding exhibit rooms, laboratories
and archive space.
	   The patron and friend of contemporary artists and close to
leftist intellectuals, Bucarelli, with her steel-blue eyes, was a
popular subject for portraits, including ones by Carlo Levi and
Alberto Savinio.
	   In an interview two months ago with Rome daily Il Messaggero,
Bucarelli boasted that during her tenure at the gallery, there were
no thefts. That was two days after bandits had made off with three
masterpieces from the gallery, including Italy's only two publicly
displayed van Goghs. One of them was ``The Woman from Arles,''
whose purchase Bucarelli had arranged in 1962.
	   The paintings were recovered earlier this month.
	   Bucarelli was the widow of Paolo Monelli, an Italian journalist.
Her survivors include a sister, Anna.
	   Funeral services were expected to be held in a Rome church, but
the exact date was unknown.

Opposition leaders announce protest for Italy in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The center-right opposition led by former Premier
Silvio Berlusconi said Saturday that it will organize protests in
September to push for lower business taxes in hopes of boosting
employment.
	   The Freedom Alliance, which includes Berlusconi's conservative
Forza Italia movement, the right-wing National Alliance and former
Christian Democrats, did not say just when or where a national
rally would be held.
	   Unemployment is running at 12.5 percent nationwide and nearly
double that in the underdeveloped south. Also assailing Premier
Romano Prodi's center-left government as not doing enough to create
jobs are his hardline Communist allies.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad launched a bank
project Saturday that will finance black-owned businesses and
facilitate trade between South Africa and Southeast Asia.
	   The Southern Bank of Africa, capitalized at 100 million million
rand (dlrs 16.1 million), is a joint project of the Malaysian
Killinghall Berhard and a local black empowerment group, the
National Empowerment Trust Investment Fund.
	   NETIF chairman Don Mkhwanazi said the bank represented a
``marriage between the Asian Tiger and the African Lion'' despite
current economic difficulties.
	   Mohamad ended his two-day visit on Saturday.

Governor announces statehood vote as thousands mark U.S. invasion

<TEXT>
	   GUANICA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ To screams of approval at a rally
Saturday marking 100 years since U.S. troops invaded, Gov. Pedro
Rossello announced a local referendum on Puerto Rico becoming the
51st U.S. state.
	   His announcement of a December vote comes as a bill for a
plebiscite approved by the U.S. House of Representatives has
stalled before opposition in the Senate.
	   ``If after 100 years, the U.S. Senate does not possess the will
to put an end to a century of colonialism, Puerto Rico does,''
Rossello told tens of thousands of cheering supporters waving the
U.S. flag and Puerto Rico's single-star and stripes.
	   Then the governor dramatically unfurled a massive flag with 51
stars.
	   ``I trust in God that, presented with this decisive opportunity,
our people will issue a clarion call for the validation of our
claim to freedom, equality, dignity,'' he said.
	   Even before Rossello's announcement, his opponents predicted
failure. Despite the governor's intense campaigning, polls over the
past five years show islanders evenly divided, with about 40
percent each supporting statehood or the current commonwealth.
	   ``If he holds a creole (local) plebiscite, he will lose it,''
Lolita Lebron, the unrepentant militant who led a 1954 armed attack
in the U.S. Capitol that wounded five lawmakers, said at a nearby
independence rally.
	   Fernando Martin, vice president of the Puerto Rico Independence
Party, said the Senate's stalling showed ``tremendous opposition to
statehood in the United States.''
	   Opposition legislators have questioned the wisdom of granting
statehood to the mainly Spanish-speaking island, where two-thirds
of the 3.8 million people receive federal aid yet pay no federal
taxes. Statehooders point out that islanders cannot vote for
president and have no vote in Congress.
	   In a non-binding referendum in 1993, similar to what Rossello
proposes this year, commonwealth edged out statehood by 2
percentage points. Rossello would need at least 50 percent of votes
if his aim is to put pressure on the Senate.
	   Even if senators approved a plebiscite and most Puerto Ricans
voted for statehood, the final decision still would rest with a
very divided Congress. The March vote on a plebiscite passed by
just one vote in the House of Representatives.
	   Statehooders have tried to shame congressmen, arguing that their
status is humiliating, like being a servant not invited to sit at
the table.
	   ``Estados Unidos!'' statehooders jeered at ``independentistas''
earlier Saturday as they went their separate ways to the rallies at
Guanica, the southwestern town where 100 years ago, the U.S.
battleship Gloucester launched an embarrassingly swift end to 400
years of Spanish colonial rule.
	   ``The Fatherland or Death!'' declared a poster carried by one
``independentista'' among the less than 5 percent of islanders that
polls show support independence.
	   In the capital San Juan, thousands gathered at El Morro fort to
celebrate the 46th anniversary of the agreement making Puerto Rico
a commonwealth, an ``Estado Libre Asociado'' or free associated
state of the union.
	   There, retired cashier Alberto Melendez Velazquez railed that
both Rossello and the U.S. Congress were trying to force the issue.
	   ``Don't tell us that we're free to choose and have to get off
the fence,'' he said. ``Do you think that if we chose independence
the Navy would ever leave Roosevelt Roads? No!'' He referred to the
biggest U.S. Navy base outside the mainland.
	   Independence proponents, environmentalists, fishermen and others
object to the regular bombings and other military training that the
Navy carries out on the islands.
	   When U.S. troops invaded, many Puerto Ricans welcomed them,
thinking Washington would give them independence. Instead, the
United States turned the island into a strategic gateway to the
Caribbean and Latin America.
	   Puerto Ricans gained one of the highest living standards in the
region, even though its dlrs 8,000 a year per capita income is half
that of the poorest U.S. state.
	   At the rallies, they ate hot dogs and hamburgers and Puerto
Rican pinchos and other fritters, dancing to blaring merengue and
salsa bands.
	   ``We're here to celebrate being part of America, man. We're
Hispanic-Americans and proud of it,'' said Roberto Garcia, a
municipal worker in his 20s.
	   Hundreds of police presented strong security at rallies marking
the anniversary, which comes amid heightened tensions over
Rossello's privatization of the state telephone company.
	   Protesters have planted bombs, slashed telephone cables and shot
at a local bank that is part of a U.S. consortium buying the Puerto
Rico Telephone Co.
	   Independence proponents, meanwhile, got a boost from the
Permanent Conference of (social democratic) Parties of Latin
America, which announced ``a crusade'' to show Americans and their
Congress why independence was ``the only way'' to decolonize Puerto
Rico.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Floodlight failure forced a temporary
suspension in play during the Federation Cup match Saturday between
Spain and the United States as the host team led 1-0.
	   Match organizers ordered a 10-minute break during the match
between Spain's Conchita Martinez and Monica Seles shortly after 9
p.m. (1900 gmt) when the tennis club floodlights stopped working.
	   The two were drawing 2-2 in the first set at the time.
	   Spain had taken the lead in the semifinal earlier when Roland

Captive rebel leader arrives to face charges in Sierra Leone

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Returning home in handcuffs, the
rebel leader who triggered Sierra Leone's descent into civil war in
1991 urged his fighters Saturday to stop terrorizing civilians and
lay down their weapons.
	   Foday Sankoh made the plea in a state-controlled television
broadcast just hours after being flown into Sierra Leone's capital
from Nigeria, where he spent more than a year behind bars on
gun-running charges.
	   Sankoh faces charges of treason and ``crimes against humanity''
committed by his Revolutionary United Front, a rebel group fighting
a West African intervention force loyal to Sierra Leone's
government.
	   If found guilty, the warlord faces death by firing squad.
	   Appearing on television with Sierra Leone's Broadcasting
Minister Julius Spencer, a handcuff-bound Sankoh said he was
sickened by revelations that some of his renegade fighters had
apparently killed and maimed defenseless civilians.
	   He asked the government to fly him into rebel-held territory in
Sierra Leone's interior to convince his followers to end the
bloodshed.
	   ``I do not support the cutting off of peoples' hands and feet
and when I heard about this, I felt sick,'' he said. ``Sankoh is
not here for war. We have to stop the fighting and talk peace.''
	   Earlier, presidential spokesman Septimus Kai Kai said the rebel
leader would be prosecuted for the rebel atrocities.
	   ``I am sure that he will have to appear in court for crimes he
has committed against humanity,'' presidential spokesman Septimus
Kai Kai told The Associated Press. ``This is what the public
expects.''
	   Peace has not fully returned to the small West African country
since Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front sparked fighting in 1991.
	   Although the rebel leader signed a cease-fire agreement with
Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in November 1996, his
troops were accused of breaking that agreement. The rebels later
allied themselves with the junta forces that ousted Kabbah in a May
1997 coup.
	   Kabbah was restored to power in an armed offensive launched by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force nearly 10 months
later.
	   Rebel and junta troops continue to terrorize communities in
Sierra Leone's interior, hacking off arms and legs in a grisly bid
to seek revenge for their ouster.
	   Sankoh expressed regret for suffering caused by his rebel
uprising, which plunged the diamond-rich country into extreme
poverty.
	   ``I want the people to understand that we did not bring war to
kill them. My people were always accusing me of loving the
civilians.''
	   Citing the return of Sankoh to Sierra Leone, the government
urged rebel fighters Saturday to throw down their arms within two
weeks or face trial or court martial.
	   A group of 38 soldiers appeared in court Thursday after their
courts martial for involvement in the 1997 coup. Among those
charged was Col. F.Y. Koroma, the brother of junta leader Lt. Col.
Johnny Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding with other members of
his forces.
	   The military court trials are separate from a hunt for junta
collaborators that led to at least 58 treason charges earlier this
year against government officials, journalists and some prominent
Freetown citizens.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Australia became the first squad to clinch a
quarterfinal berth at the Baseball World Championships by rallying
to defeat South Korea 7-2 Saturday.
	   Down 2-0, Australia took the lead by scoring a run in the sixth
inning and four in the seventh, highlighted by Grant McDonald's RBI
single and Ron Johnson's three-run double.
	   The United States stayed in the hunt for the quarterfinals by
blasting Russia 10-0 for a second straight win.
	   Ryan Mottl went the distance for the U.S. team (2-2), giving up
just three hits while striking out nine.
	   Ryan Ludwick went 4-for-5 with two doubles and three RBIs,
Joshua Bard had three hits and John Gall added a home run for the
Americans. Russia is last in Pool B at 0-4.
	   Taiwan picked up its first win of the week by blasting the
Netherlands 12-6. Outfielder Chen Chih-Yuan led a 17-hit attack
with two two-run home runs against the Dutch (2-2).
	   Australia (4-0) is the only unbeaten team in Pool B, while South
Korea _ runner-up at the 1994 worlds _ saw its record drop to 2-2.
	   It represents Australia's best-ever start at the tournament. The
country has participated four times in the past, never finishing
higher than seventh.
	   The top four teams from each of the two eight-country pools
advance to next week's quarterfinals.

Palestinians pin hopes on American efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with meeting between lawmaker and Arafat's deputy, grafs
10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials expressed hopes that the
United States would step in to break a deadlock with Israel, even
though the Clinton administration has told the two sides to work
out their disagreements for themselves.
	   ``We are still hoping the United States will continue pushing
its initiative,'' said Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath
following the Palestinians' weekly Cabinet meeting in the West Bank
town of Ramallah late Friday.
	   The American initiative, widely reported but never formally
unveiled, calls for Israel to withdraw from another 13.1 percent of
the West Bank and the Palestinian Authority, headed by Yasser
Arafat, to fulfill a series of Israeli security demands.
	   The initiative was presented to the two parties in January. The
Palestinians accepted it but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
balked, saying such a handover would leave Israel too vulnerable.
	   ``This Israeli government either does not want to take a
decision or can't take a decision'' on a withdrawal, chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, but the talks concluded with both sides asking the United
States to step in again.
	   In Washington, Marwan Kanafani, an aide to Arafat, said U.S.
officials have told visiting Palestinian legislators that while the
United States is still committed to the peace process, it is taking
``one step back'' from active participation for the moment.
	   ``There is a decision at the highest level in America that there
should be a kind of slowdown, timeout, pause,'' said Kanafani. ``We
don't take this decision as a belligerent step against the
Palestinians.''
	   Erekat added that the Americans ``want the two sides to continue
resolving matters between themselves.''
	   Lower level contacts continued Saturday as Yehuda Harel of the
Third Way centrist party met with Arafat's Deputy Mahmoud Abbas in
the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli media reported.
	   Harel told reporters after the meeting that the Palestinians
were anxious to reach an agreement on the troop withdrawal and that
hopes of a deal being finalized now rested with Netanyahu.
	   Abbas was scheduled to meet with Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani early this week and the two were to
discuss small scale, day-to-day problems rather than the troop
pullback terms.
	   Shaath said that the Palestinians were adamant about sticking
with the original American initiative and will refuse to discuss
alternative ideas for territorial concessions.
	   ``President Arafat does not want to go back to the negotiations
track unless there are some positive steps that will bring the
Israelis closer to the American initiative and therefore closer to
the signed agreements,'' Shaath said.
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen for 16 months.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In their largest coordinated
operation in months, Serb forces launched attacks Saturday on at
least three fronts, pressing Albanian rebels along Kosovo's major
transport links and the guerrillas' main rural strongholds.
	   Albanian politicians called on the United States and the
European Union to intervene with the Yugoslav government to halt
the offensive.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting along the main
road from Pristina to Kosovo's second-largest city Pec, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of here, and the route between Pristina
and Prizren, 65 kilometers (40 miles) to the south.
	   The Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb police were
also attacking in western Kosovo along the highway running parallel
to the border with Albania from which the rebels smuggle weapons.
	   According to the Albanians, police were also trying to advance
on Malisevo, main stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The Albanians reported at least one Albanian was killed and
another wounded in the Malisevo fighting along with ``at least'' 10
Serb policemen. The Albanians said at least seven other Albanians
were wounded in the fighting elsewhere in the province.
	   There was no casualty count from the Serbs, and the Albanian
claim could not be independently confirmed.
	   Although the scale of the fighting could not be determined, it
appeared to be the most widespread, coordinated series of attacks
since April, when government forces attacked rebel positions on
several fronts.
	   Sources close to the military, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the latest operations were designed to secure major
communications and transport links and to contain the KLA within
their rural strongholds.
	   If true, the operations could be designed in part to make the
KLA, which is fighting for independence for Kosovo, more amenable
to allowing moderate Albanian politicians to begin talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the province's future.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he withdrew in
1989, but opposes independence _ the goal of the KLA and the
moderate Albanian politicians.
	   The United States and the Europeans also oppose independence,
but hope a compromise can be worked out once the fighting stops.
Albanians form 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a province
of Serbia.
	   Serbia and Montenegro together form the Yugoslav federation.
	   Although the Americans and Europeans have urged an end to the
fighting, the sources said the government believed the foreign
powers would tacitly accept the latest offensive if it would bring
the rebels to the bargaining table.
	   The latest attacks began as the United States stepped up its
diplomatic efforts to arrange peace talks. U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill met Friday with moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   In a statement Saturday, Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo
said the Serb offensive would aggravate an ``already explosive
situation.''
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' the party said.
``Otherwise, the danger of total and bloody war in Kosovo will
increase.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are promoting Rugova as a leader of
the Albanian side in future talks because he opposes violence.
	   Hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands of others
have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted into
violent clashes five months ago, following a crackdown by Serb-led
security forces.
	   In its account, the Serb Media Center said fighting started
after KLA rebls attacked a Yugoslav army unit some 30 kilometers
(20 miles) west of Pristina late Friday.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials expressed hopes that the
United States would step in to break a deadlock with Israel, even
though the Clinton administration has told the two sides to work
out their disagreements themselves.
	   ``We are still hoping the United States will continue pushing
its initiative,'' said Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath
following the Palestinians' weekly Cabinet meeting in the West Bank
town of Ramallah late Friday.
	   The American initiative, widely reported but never formally
unveiled, calls for Israel to withdraw from another 13.1 percent of
the West Bank and the Palestinian Authority, headed by Yasser
Arafat, to fulfill a series of Israeli security demands.
	   The initiative was presented to the two parties in January. The
Palestinians accepted it but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
balked, saying such a handover would leave Israel too vulnerable.
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen for 16 months.
	   ``This Israeli government either does not want to take a
decision or can't take a decision'' on a withdrawal, chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after the Cabinet meeting.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, but the talks concluded with both sides asking
the United States to step in again.
	   In Washington, Marwan Kanafani, an aide to Arafat, said U.S.
officials have told visiting Palestinian legislators that while the
United States is still committed to the peace process, it is taking
``one step back'' from active participation for the moment.
	   ``There is a decision at the highest level in America that there
should be a kind of slowdown, timeout, pause,'' said Kanafani. ``We
don't take this decision as a belligerent step against the
Palestinians.''
	   Erekat added that the Americans ``want the two sides to continue
resolving matters between themselves.''
	   Lower level contacts continued Saturday as Yehuda Harel of the
Third Way centrist party met with Arafat's Deputy Mahmoud Abbas in
the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli media reported.
	   Harel told reporters after the meeting that the Palestinians
were anxious to reach an agreement on the troop withdrawal and that
hopes of a deal being finalized now rested with Netanyahu.
	   Abbas was scheduled to meet Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Sunday, but the two were to discuss smaller,
day-to-day problems rather than the troop pullback terms.
	   Shaath said the, 10th graf pvs.

Yemen accuses Saudi Arabia of giving refuge to dissidents

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's interior minister Saturday accused
Saudi Arabia of involvement in an attempt on his life and said the
kingdom's troops violated Yemen's border 73 times in one month.
	   The minister, Hussein Mohammed Arab, said some of the tribesmen
who took part in an armed attack on his convoy on Tuesday have
taken refuge in Najran in southern Saudi Arabia.
	   Other Yemeni dissidents ``involved in bombing and unrest receive
monthly payments from the kingdom, and we have the documents to
prove this,'' he told a news conference.
	   He said Saudi troops entered Yemeni territory 73 times between
June 15 and July 15.
	   He did not elaborate or provide evidence to back his claim.
Saudi Arabia's government did not immediately respond.
	   Arab escaped unhurt but a provincial governor traveling with him
was injured in the attack outside the Jawf province, which the
officials were planning to visit to survey the aftermath of riots
by Yemeni tribesmen protesting a hike in fuel prices.
	   While the government grappled with the riots, Yemeni border
guards on the disputed Red Sea island of Duwaima fought a gun
battle with Saudi naval forces on Sunday.
	   Three Yemeni soldiers who were killed in the clash were buried
in the capital San`a Saturday in a simple ceremony attended by
senior military officials and several hundred people.
	   Arab also accused Saudi Arabia of violating a border agreement
by setting up new military posts in the disputed area and said
Saudi border guards fired repeatedly at Yemeni forces and
civilians.
	   Although border incursions between the two countries are common,
officials rarely air this problem publicly, and Arab's outright
accusations indicate that tensions run deep despite a peace meeting
Saturday between Foreign Minister Abdul Qader Bajamal and Saudi
leaders.
	   After the meeting, Bajamal told reporters: ``We have agreed to
avoid anything that would renew the incidents ... we have agreed
that what happened should not be repeated.''
	   Bajamal met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, Defense
Minister Prince Sultan and Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in the
Saudi city of Jiddah.
	   Both sides have in the past made similar statements calling for
a diplomatic solution but have done little else to ease tensions.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
border region of Empty Quarter, a vast desert with potentially
lucrative oil fields. Fighting has occasionally erupted along their
2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier.
	   Besides, the two nations have yet to demarcate a mountainous
border in the east.
	   In 1995, Saudi Arabia sent 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks
across the border before Syrian mediation secured a cease-fire and
an eventual withdrawal.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In their largest coordinated
operation in months, Serb forces launched attacks Saturday on at
least three fronts, pressing Albanian rebels along Kosovo's major
transport links and the guerrillas' main rural strongholds.
	   Albanian politicians called on the United States and the
European Union to intervene with the Yugoslav government to halt
the offensive.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting along the main
road from the capital Pristina to Kosovo's second-largest city Pec,
75 kilometers (45 miles) west, and the route between Pristina and
Prizren, 65 kilometers (40 miles) to the south.

Regional leaders disappointed with Nevis secession vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Caribbean Community government
expressed disappointment Saturday over plans for a vote next month
by Nevis residents on breaking away from sister island St. Kitts.
	   The regional organization, based in Georgetown, issued a
statement calling the referendum ``untimely'' and cause for
concern.
	   ``The heads of government of CARICOM therefore strongly urge the
people of Nevis to give careful consideration to all possible
options with a view to preserving the historical ties that bind
them to the people of St Kitts and indeed to the people of the
entire Community,'' said the statement.
	   The 6,000 residents of the small eastern Caribbean island of
Nevis will vote August 10 on the secession from St. Kitts. The
two-island federation of former British colonies is already one of
the world's least populous independent countries, and Nevis would
be even smaller by itself.
	   Nevis has long felt neglected by the central government based on
the larger island of St. Kitts.
	   The statment said the Caribbean Community ``is particularly
aggrieved and disappointed'' that Nevis officials were unreceptive
to two efforts by the regional organization to come up with options
other than secession.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain took a 1-0 lead against the United
States in the Federation Cup semifinal Saturday with a convincing
win by Roland Garros champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario over Lisa
Raymond.
	   Sanchez Vicario, ranked No. 4 in the world, defeated Raymond 6-7
(4-7), 6-3, 6-0 before an adoring home country crowd.
	   Both players weathered a brutal sun that had temperatures at
courtside well over 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit)
when play got underway in the late afternoon at Madrid's Club de
Campo clay court.
	   The win set Spain on its way toward a taste of revenge against
the United States which won 5-0 when the two countries last met in
the Fed Cup in 1996 in Atlanta City.
	   Raymond won the first set even though she _ and Sanchez Vicario
_ struggled to hold service. Neither managed to do so until the
Spaniard held in the fourth game.
	   Playing her first Fed Cup singles, Raymond got as far as 2-0 in
the second set. But in the third game she failed to capitalize when
Sanchez Vicario was down 15-40.
	   Raymond dropped that game and the rest, bar one, to lose the set
6-3.
	   She said she lost her nerve after that crucial game.
	   ``I felt like I let the team down after being in a position to
win,'' she said.
	   Of the boisterous Spanish crowd, Raymond said it was wonderful
to hear so much enthusiasm for tennis, even if the fans were
against her.
	   Sanchez Vicario described the match as difficult and agreed that
both started of weak and returned better than they served.
	   ``I made a lot of mistakes at the beginning,'' she said. ``But
in the second set I got my confidence back.''
	   Floodlight failure forced a 15-minute suspension in play during
the day's second match between Conchita Martinez and Roland Garros
finalist Monica Seles as the two were drawing 2-2 in the first set.
	   Some 20 minutes later play was again interrupted for five
minutes when Seles and U.S. team captain Billie Jean King
complained that the court lines were wet.

Team USA edges Italy 80-75
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The United States struggled in its last tuneup ahead
of the Basketball World Championships, using a late surge to beat
Italy 80-75 Saturday night.
	   With no solution for streaky Italian guard Carleton Myers, who
finished with a game-high 29 points, the Americans relied on a
balanced attack to hold on for the win in front of 6,200 at the
Palaeur Arena.
	   A spray-painted banner hanging from the rafters asked, ``Where's
the Dream Team?''
	   At home, of course.
	   The labor dispute between the NBA and its players kept the
collection of All-Stars on the sidelines and led to the selection
of a mixed bag of American players _ drawing from the college
ranks, the CBA and European leagues _ for the worlds, which open
Wednesday in Athens, Greece.
	   Jimmy Oliver, a guard with Spanish team Ciuda De Huelva, led the
U.S. team with 13 points, while Jason Sasser (most recently with
the CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce) and Wendell Alexis (of German team
Alba Berlin) chipped in with 11 apiece.
	   The two teams traded the lead throughout, and Italy held its
last advantage at 68-66 with 3:40 left, after Alessandro Abbio's
free throw.
	   But sparked by a David Wood 3-pointer, the U.S. team scored off
six straight possessions and pulled away.
	   Myers, who lifted Italy to second place at the 1997 European
Championships, carried his teammates, hitting four 3-pointers down
the stretch.
	   U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who guided the Houston Rockets to
two NBA titles while Michael Jordan was trying to hit curveballs
earlier this decade, substituted freely. All but two players played
at least 12 minutes.
	   One who didn't was backup point guard Mateen Cleaves.
	   The Michigan State junior-to-be had to be carried off the court
in the second half with what appeared to be a left ankle injury.
Cleaves got tangled with Alexis after trying an off-balance,
no-look pass near the baseline with 12:17 remaining in the game.

Chinese gymnast paralyzed at Goodwill Games undergoes surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed after a
fall at the Goodwill Games underwent a seven-hour surgery Saturday
that might help her regain mobility.
	   Sang Lan, 17, was in critical but stable condition Saturday
afternoon after doctors fused two fractured and dislocated
vertebrae in her neck.
	   ``The operation was completed and successful,'' said Nassau
County Medical Center spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg. ``The doctors
accomplished what they wanted to accomplish.''
	   Doctors began operating on Sang about 8 a.m. No other details
were immediately available.
	   Chinese authorities on Sunday will hold a press conference at
which doctors will give details of the operation, said the
spokeswoman.
	   Sang's parents were scheduled to arrive at Kennedy Airport on
Saturday night from their home in Ningbo, a remote area of China.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, fell on her head
Tuesday night during a training routine, injuring the neck
vertebrae and leaving her unable to move her legs. It was unlikely
she would walk again, doctors had said before the surgery.
	   In addition to the surgery, Sang is being treated with an
experimental tissue-regenerating drug. Chinese authorities said
they also would perform acupuncture on Sang to stimulate her nerves
after the operation.
	   An outpouring of support for the injured gymnast flooded the
Long Island hospital this week.
	   Letters, cards and stuffed toys sent from people all over the
world covered Sang's small room in the pediatric intensive care
unit.

Chinese gymnast paralyzed at Goodwill Games undergoes surgery

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed after a
fall at the Goodwill Games underwent a seven-hour surgery Saturday
that might help her regain mobility.
	   Sang Lan, 17, was in critical but stable condition Saturday
afternoon after doctors fused two fractured and dislocated
vertebrae in her neck.
	   ``The operation was completed and successful,'' said Nassau
County Medical Center spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg. ``The doctors
accomplished what they wanted to accomplish.''
	   Doctors began operating on Sang about 8 a.m. No other details
were immediately available.
	   Chinese authorities on Sunday will hold a press conference at
which doctors will give details of the operation, said the
spokeswoman.
	   Sang's parents were scheduled to arrive at Kennedy Airport on
Saturday night from their home in Ningbo, a remote area of China.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, fell on her head
Tuesday night during a training routine, injuring the neck
vertebrae and leaving her unable to move her legs. It was unlikely
she would walk again, doctors had said before the surgery.
	   In addition to the surgery, Sang is being treated with an
experimental tissue-regenerating drug. Chinese authorities said
they also would perform acupuncture on Sang to stimulate her nerves
after the operation.
	   An outpouring of support for the injured gymnast flooded the
Long Island hospital this week.
	   Letters, cards and stuffed toys sent from people all over the
world covered Sang's small room in the pediatric intensive care
unit.
	   Former New York Jets defensive lineman Dennis Byrd, who in 1992
suffered career-ending injuries similar to Sang's but regained the
use of his legs, visited the gymnast Friday.
	   Sang also is being treated with SYGEN, an experimental drug that
helped Byrd.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on triathlon, bike near-miss, beach
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ All week, Barb Lindquist had been running in
Central Park and saying how ``super excited'' about the scenery and
the feel of New York.
	   But on Saturday, a run in the park did Lindquist in, costing her
the women's triathlon championship at the Goodwill Games.
	   Loretta Harrop of Australia won the gold in a total time of 1
hour, 59.43 seconds, .98 seconds ahead of teammate Michelle Jones.
	   Lindquist, the top-rated U.S. woman triathlete and No. 7 in the
world, led after the 1-kilometer swim in New York harbor and 40K
bike race from Battery Park to Central Park.
	   But the four-time Pan American games swimming champion but faded
to fourth behind Hungary's Erika Molnar in the final 10-kilometer
run through the park's hilly trails. Her 37:54 10K was 19th fastest
in the 25-woman field.
	   ``Sometimes I have a good day and sometimes Barb has a good
day,'' Harrop said. ``Today was mine, I guess.''
	   In the men's race, Simon Lessing of Britain successfully
defended his crown, turning in the second-fastest times in each of
the three legs and finishing in 1:46.33, .91 seconds ahead of
Australia's Craig Walton.
	   Laurent Jeanselme of France, the leader after the first two
stages, was eighth in the 10K and finished third, in 1:47.40.
	   The best U.S. men's finish was sixth place for Nick Radkewich in
1:49.37.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SEE SPOT RUN: Just about anything can happen on the streets of
New York and the Goodwill triathlon was no exception.
	   Take Simon Lessing's gold-medal race, for instant. It was almost
ended by someone's pet.
	   ``We nearly ran over a dog on the bike course. That was quite
exciting,'' Lessing said.
	   The pooch, described by Lessing as ``a little dog with a little
soccer ball in its mouth,'' was out for a stroll when the bikes
raced through on their way from Battery Park up the East Side and
then through midtown.
	   Although the bike course was shifted one block east to get
around the site of a fatal construction accident, and there was
some confusion at the start of the run, Lessing said it was ``quite
a good race and there were basically no problems whatsoever.''
	   ``It's always difficult to run a race in the middle of a city,
in the middle of new York,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SENIOR GAMES: Two of beach volleyball's old dudes from Southern
California will play for the Goodwill Games' gold medal.
	   Karch Kiraly, who turns 38 in November, and Adam Johnson, a
relative kid of 33, beat Australians Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner
12-2, 12-10 to reach Sunday's championship match.
	   They will play for the title against the winner of Saturday's
second semifinal between the world's No. 1 pair, Guilherme Marques
and Para Ferreria of Brazil, and Argentina's Martin Conde and
Esteban Martinez.
	   Kiraly, one of the sport's pioneers from San Clemente, Calif.,
and Johnson, from Laguna Beach, Calif., have won almost $4 million
in prize money in their careers, and their experience showed
against twentysomethings Prosser, whose nickname is ``Thunder,''
and Zahner, who hails from the Queensland town of Kangaroo Point.
	   In he first game, Kiraly, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and
Johnson ran off nine straight points for a 11-1 lead. In the second
game, Australia tied it 9-9 and 10-10 before Kiraly hit a pair of
kills on his serve to win the match.
	   Kiraly and Johnson led in every statistical category, including
digs (20-14) and blocks (7-3). Johnson also served the only four
aces in the match.

U.S. hits five homers in 13-6 win; Cuba routs Italy 20-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The silent U.S. bats finally came to life at the
Baseball World Championships Friday, as a five-homer barrage lifted
the team to its first win, 13-6 over Taiwan.
	   Five-time defending champion Cuba put on an even more impressive
display, crushing Italy 20-0. Cuba amassed 22 hits, including six
home runs, as it won its 34th straight championships game, a streak
that dates to 1986.
	   After totaling just two runs in its first two games at the
tournament, the United States knocked around six different pitchers
and kept alive hopes of a quarterfinal berth.
	   Eric Munson hit two home runs and John Gall, Ryan Ludwick and
Bobby Hill had one apiece in the game at Messina, Sicily, which
pushed the Americans out of last place in Pool A. Gall also added a
single and a double.
	   Chan Chin Fen clubbed two homers for Taiwan (0-3).
	   At Bologna, Omar Linares had two round-trippers for Cuba, which
has won its three games here by a total margin of 48-3 and is tied
atop Pool B with Japan and the Dominican Republic, also with 3-0
records. The hosts are 1-2.
	   Japan beat South Africa 9-2 at Vicenza, while the Dominican
Republic edged Spain 8-7 at Modena. The other Pool B game saw
Panama blank China 7-0 at Rimini.
	   In games played at Palermo, Sicily, Australia (3-0) moved into
sole possession of first place in Pool A by beating Russia 6-2,
Canada surprised South Korea 4-1, and Nicaragua routed the
previously unbeaten Dutch 13-2.
	   Australia rocked Russian starter Andrei Bogatyev for 11 hits in
seven innings. Russia, making its debut at the championships,
dropped to 0-3.
	   David Ruhr sparked Canada (2-1) with a run-scoring triple as the
North Americans handed South Korea its first loss of the
tournament. South Korea was runner-up to Cuba in 1994.

Agassi rolls into Legg Mason final

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Second-seeded Andre Agassi needed just 43
minutes Saturday to blow by third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South
Africa 6-1, 6-0 in the semifinals of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.
	   Agassi's opponent in Sunday's title match will be the winner of
Saturday night's semifinal between top-seeded Michael Chang and
14th-seeded Scott Draper.
	   ``The score said more about the way he was playing than the way
I was playing,'' Agassi said.
	   While Ferreira looked sluggish, Agassi continued to play his
best tennis since he was the world's top-ranked player in 1995.
	   ``I'm much stronger now mentally than I've ever been,'' Agassi
said. ``I don't even think in '95 I moved as well as I'm moving
now.''
	   Agassi, 28, finished out of the top 100 last year for the first
time since turning pro in 1986.
	   His ranking sank as low as No. 141, but Agassi has climbed back
to No. 18 with tour victories in San Jose and Scottsdale this year.
	   Agassi is 30-6 on hardcourts this season and 37-9 overall.
	   Saturday's romp was no surprise since Agassi is 7-0 lifetime
against Ferreira and has won 15 of the last 16 sets played.
	   ``Agassi played well, but I really didn't make it that hard for
him,'' Ferreira said. ``The points went quick. The games went
quick.''
	   Agassi, looking to become the first four-time winner of the Legg
Mason, hasn't had to work up much of a sweat this week. His four
victories have taken an average 62 minutes and he has been broken
just once in 34 service games.
	   The winner here in 1990-91 and 1995, Agassi said he didn't feel
sorry for the fans who paid to see such a short match.
	   ``They got their bagels,'' Agassi said, referring to a promotion
that promised the fans discount bagels if a 6-0 score was posted.

	   ROME (AP) _ Australia became the first country to clinch a
quarterfinal berth at the Baseball World Championships by rallying
to defeat South Korea 7-2 Saturday.
	   Down 2-0, Australia took the lead by scoring a run in the sixth
inning and four in the seventh, highlighted by Grant McDonald's RBI
single and Ron Johnson's three-run double.
	   The United States stayed in the hunt for the quarterfinals by
blasting Russia 10-0 for a second straight win.
	   Starting pitcher Ryan Mottl went the distance for the U.S. team
(2-2), giving up just three hits while striking out nine.
	   Ryan Ludwick went 4-for-5 with two doubles and three RBIs,
Joshua Bard had three hits and John Gall added a home run for the
Americans. Russia is last in Pool B at 0-4.
	   Taiwan picked up its first win of the week by blasting the
Netherlands 12-6. Outfielder Chen Chih-Yuan led a 17-hit attack
with two two-run home runs against the Dutch (2-2).
	   Australia (4-0) is the only unbeaten team in Pool B, while South
Korea _ runner-up at the 1994 worlds _ saw its record drop to 2-2.
	   It represents Australia's best-ever start at the tournament. The
country has participated four times in the past, never finishing
higher than seventh.
	   Nicaragua (3-1) is second in Pool B after an 8-3 win over Canada
(2-2).
	   Cuba and the Dominican Republic share the Pool A lead with
matching 4-0 records. Five-time defending champion Cuba continued
to roll, handing previously unbeaten Japan a 9-0 loss at Rimini,
while the Dominican Republic defeated China 5-3 at Vicenza.
	   In other games, Italy rebounded from a 20-0 rout against Cuba on
Friday to edge South Africa 2-0 at Modena, and Panama routed Spain
14-4 at Bologna.
	   The top four teams from each of the two eight-country pools
advance to next week's quarterfinals.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Monica Seles downed Conchita Martinez to
tie the United States 1-1 with Spain after two matches in the
semifinal of the Federation Cup here Saturday.
	   In a match marked by interruptions, Seles took the first set
6-3, lost the second by the same score and then rebounded with a
6-1 third set winner.
	   Spain had taken the lead earlier in the day when Roland Garros
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario downed Lisa Raymond 6-7 (4-7),
6-3, 6-0 before an adoring home country crowd.
	   In the reverse singles Sunday, Sanchez Vicario plays Seles in a
rematch of the French Open final in June. Martinez faces Raymond
and in doubles Sanchez Vicario and Martinez are scheduled to face
Fernandez and Raymond.
	   The winner will go on to play either defending champion France
or Switzerland who play their World Group I semifinal also this
weekend.
	   The Seles-Martinez game was suspended for 15 minutes because of
floodlight failure during the first set and then for another five
because of complaints from the U.S. team that the clay court's
whitewash lines were wet.
	   In the second set, the game was again halted when a spectator
had to be carried out after fainting.
	   Earlier, Sanchez Vicario and Raymond weathered a brutal sun that
had temperatures at courtside well over 38 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) when play got underway in the late afternoon at
Madrid's Club de Campo court.
	   Raymond won the first set even though she and Sanchez Vicario
struggled to hold service. Neither managed to do so until the
Spaniard held in the fourth game.
	   Playing her first Fed Cup singles, Raymond got as far as 2-0 in
the second set. But in the third game she failed to capitalize when
Sanchez Vicario was down 15-40.
	   Raymond dropped that game and the rest, bar one, to lose the set
6-3.
	   ``I felt like I let the team down after being in a position to
win,'' she said.
	   Sanchez Vicario said the match was difficult and agreed that
both started of weak and returned better than they served.
	   ``I made a lot of mistakes at the beginning,'' she said. ``But
in the second set I got my confidence back.''
	   The United States thrashed Spain 5-0 when the two countries last
met in the Fed Cup in 1996 in Atlanta City.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The United States struggled in its last tuneup ahead
of the Basketball World Championships, needing a late surge to beat
Italy 80-75 Saturday night.
	   With no solution for streaky Italian guard Carlton Myers, who
finished with a game-high 29 points, the Americans relied on a
balanced attack to hold on for the win in front of 6,200 at the
Palaeur Arena.
	   Jimmy Oliver, a guard with Spanish team Ciudad De Huelva, led
the U.S. team with 13 points, while Jason Sasser (most recently
with the CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce) and Wendell Alexis (of German
team Alba Berlin) chipped in with 11 apiece.
	   ``That was the type of game we needed. They didn't let us have
our way,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We needed to execute
late.''
	   A spray-painted banner hanging from the rafters asked, ``Where's
the Dream Team?''
	   At home, of course.
	   The labor dispute between the NBA and its players kept the
collection of All-Stars on the sidelines and led to the selection
of a mixed bag of American players _ drawing from the college
ranks, the CBA and European leagues _ for the worlds, which open
Wednesday in Athens, Greece.
	   The U.S. squad had no trouble routing France and Spain last week
in warmup games, but Italy gave it fits.
	   Alexis added seven rebounds as the United States held a
surprising 41-25 edge on the boards against the much taller
Italians.
	   The two teams traded the lead throughout, and Italy held its
last advantage at 68-66 with 3:40 left, after Alessandro Abbio's
free throw.
	   But sparked by a David Wood 3-pointer, the U.S. team scored off
six straight possessions and pulled away. Michael Hawkins, who saw
limited action with the Boston Celtics two years ago and was with
Olympiakos in the Greek League last season, had five of his eight
points in the closing 14-7 run.
	   ``I'm usually not the one hitting the late shots,'' Hawkins
acknowledged.
	   Myers lifted Italy to second place at the 1997 European
Championships and carried his teammates Saturday, hitting four
3-pointers down the stretch.
	   Tomjanovich, who guided the Houston Rockets to two NBA titles
while Michael Jordan was trying to hit curveballs earlier this
decade, substituted freely. All but two players played at least 12
minutes.
	   One who didn't was backup point guard Mateen Cleaves.
	   The Michigan State junior-to-be had to be carried off the court
in the second half with a left ankle injury. Cleaves became
entangled with Alexis after trying an off-balance, no-look pass
near the baseline with 12:17 remaining in the game.
	   X-rays on the ankle were negative, team spokesman Craig Miller
said. Cleaves will be examined again Sunday and a decision will be
made whether to replace him on the world championships roster.

Pepper's 64 gives her two-shot lead at Giant Eagle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) _ Veteran Dottie Pepper stole the thunder of
rookie Se Ri Pak, matching the course record with an 8-under-par 64
Saturday to take a two-stroke lead heading into the final round of
the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic.
	   Pepper, who has won 14 tournaments in 11 years on tour but none
in the last two years, started hot and never let up after starting
the day two shots back of Pak and three others who shared the lead.
	   ``My goal was 15-under,'' Pepper said. ``After I picked up four
or five birdies early, I came up short. I didn't know what I shot _
I didn't even care.''
	   The 64, after an opening 67, left Pepper at 13-under 131 in the
54-hole event at Avalon Lakes Golf Course.
	   ``I want to keep going lower and lower instead of letting the
leaderboard dictate how I play,'' Pepper said.
	   Kate Golden shot a 65 and was at 11-under, with Pak going
without a bogey for the second day in a row while shooting a 69 to
finish at 10-under 134. Also at 10-under was another Korean native,
Pearl Sinn, who had a 65 in the second round.
	   Posting birdies in spurts, Pepper opened with back-to-back
birdies, then strung together three in a row starting at the fifth
hole. After starting the back side with two more birdies, she
blasted out of the greenside bunker to 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) on
the par-5 closing hole and hit the birdie putt.
	   Her score matched the course record previously reached by
eventual champion Tammie Green and Anna Acker-Macosko in last
year's first round and eventual winner Michelle McGann in 1996.
	   Pepper's iron play fueled her scoring on the front side. She
tapped in for a birdie at No. 5 after almost holing a sand wedge,
then hit a pitching wedge to four feet at No. 6 and a 6-iron to
eight feet (2 1/2 meters) at the seventh hole.
	   Pepper, the 1992 tour player of the year, hasn't won since
finishing first in four tournaments in 1996.
	   She had 27 putts and hit 17 greens in regulation while missing
just two fairways.
	   Golden hasn't finished higher than 20th in 15 starts this year,
but she birdied five out of six holes in the middle of her round to
climb into contention. Birdies at the fifth and sixth holes were
followed by a bogey at No. 7 before she put together birdies on the
next three holes.
	   Six of her eight birdies came on putts of at least 10 feet (3
meters).
	   ``It feels smooth right now,'' Golden said. ``Everything is
working out for me. I'm having a ball.''
	   Pak said she had difficulty reading putts as the course dried
after heavy rain earlier in the week.
	   ``I didn't practice that much on this course, so I cannot read
(putts) very well,'' she said. ``I hit my putts very right, very
left, too fast, too slow.''
	   Winner of two majors already heading into next week's du Maurier
Classic, the 20-year-old Pak started with a birdie but then went
cold with the putter.
	   She parred the next 13 holes despite several iron shots that
left her with birdie putts inside 15 feet (4 1/2 meters). Pak broke
that streak by hitting a 7-iron to three feet for a birdie at No.
15, then hit a sand wedge to six feet (2 meters) for a birdie on
the 18th.
	   ``Today I missed five or six birdie putts from seven feet,'' she
said. ``Ball go left or right, but not to the hole.''
	   Sinn, winless in eight years on the LPGA tour, shot 65 despite
two bogeys. She collected seven birdies and closed her round with
an eagle, chipping in from eight yards (meter) short of the green.
	   Wendy Ward came next at 9-under after a 67, while the group at
8-under included defending champion Tammie Green and leading
money-winner Annika Sorenstam.

Spain, United States draw level at 1-1 in Fed Cup semifinal

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Monica Seles defeated Conchita Martinez to
tie the United States 1-1 with Spain after two matches of the
Federation Cup semifinal Saturday.
	   In a match marked by interruptions, Seles took the first set
6-3, lost the second by the same score and then bounced back with a
6-1 third set winner.
	   Spain had taken the lead earlier in the day when Roland Garros
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario downed Lisa Raymond 6-7 (4-7),
6-3, 6-0 before an adoring home country crowd.
	   The 1-1 draw set the stage for a perfect showdown in the reverse
singles Sunday when Sanchez Vicario plays Seles for a rematch of
the Roland Garros final in June.
	   Both players insisted there would be nothing personal about the
game.
	   ``It is always great to play Monica but this is a team
competition,'' siad Sanchez Vicario.
	   Martinez faces Raymond and, in doubles, Sanchez Vicario and
Martinez are scheduled to face Fernandez and Raymond.
	   Spain won four Fed Cup titles between 1991-995 until losing 5-0
to the United States the last time they met in 1996.
	   Sunday's winner will go on to play either defending champion
France or Switzerland.
	   The Seles-Martinez game was suspended for 15 minutes because of
floodlight failure during the first set and then for another five
minutes because of complaints from the U.S. team that the clay
court's whitewash lines were wet.
	   In the second set, the game was again halted when a spectator
had to be carried out after fainting.
	   ``It was a very strange evening,'' said Seles.
	   Martinez twice saved triple break points, the second time
winning a set for Spain. But she had trouble holding her serve,
dropping it twice in the decisive third set.
	   Of her play , she said ``It got away from me a bit.''
	   Earlier, Sanchez Vicario and Raymond weathered a brutal sun that
had temperatures at courtside well over 38 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) when play got underway in the late afternoon at
Madrid's Club de Campo court.
	   Raymond won the first set even though she and Sanchez Vicario
struggled to hold service. Neither managed to do so until the
Spaniard held in the fourth game.
	   Playing her first Fed Cup singles, Raymond got as far as 2-0 in
the second set. But in the third game she failed to capitalize when
Sanchez Vicario was down 15-40.
	   Raymond dropped that game and the rest, bar one, to lose the set
6-3.
	   ``I felt like I let the team down after being in a position to
win,'' she said.
	   Sanchez Vicario agreed that both started of weak and returned
better than they served.
	   ``I made a lot of mistakes at the beginning,'' she said. ``But
in the second set I got my confidence back.''

Three main festivals begin in Grenada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenada geared up for three
important festivals Saturday including the annual carnival that
injects millions of dollars into the island's economy.
	   In this capital city, streets were blocked off and stages were
erected for calypso performances that will precede the main party
to come later.
	   ``This helps people become more acquainted with our music and it
helps to whip up the carnival fever as we get closer to the
celebrations,'' said calypso musician Edson Ajamul Mitchell of the
early musical performances.
	   A controversy over the calypso competition that is the heart of
the carnival was defused this week when the event's organizing
committee and an association of musicians agreed to share control
of the competition on alternating years.
	   In recent years, the popular competition has been threatened as
the government tried to muzzle some of the singers. Calypso lyrics
are traditionally spiked with political commentary.
	   The 13-square-mile (34-square-kilometer) island of Carriacou is
the center of activity this weekend as the first of Grenada's
festivals begins. The Carriacou regatta, which offers activities on
both land and sea, began Saturday.
	   The other event on the summer calendar is the Rainbow City
Festival in August, which is held in the rural St. Andrews Parish,
the largest of Grenada's seven parishes.

Donovan Bailey inches ahead to win 100m in Barcelona
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA Spain (AP) _ World record holder Donovan Bailey inched
out ahead of Davidson Ezinwa of Nigeria to win the 100m Saturday at
the Barcelona international track meeting.
	   The Canadian sprinter, who was looking to erase sour memories of
his Goodwill games defeat by Maurice Greene last week, covered the
Barcelona race in 10.27, way over his Atlanta 96 record of 9.84.
	   Ezinwa finished in 10.23 while Jamaica's Michael Green was third
with 10.43.
	   Steve Lewis, of the United States, won the 400 meters in a time
of 45:38, ahead of Ken Harnden of Zimbabwe with 45:49.
	   In the women's category, 1993 world champion Maria Mutola of
Mozambique came first in the 800m with a time of 1:58.27 while
Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia ran in at 2:00.17.
	   The meet was robbed of one of its star attractions when
Jamaica's 100m athlete Marlene Ottey notified the organizers hours
beforehand that she was pulling out owing to an unspecified injury.
	   The meet, which had an IAAF Permit status, was held to
commemorate the sixth anniversary ofthe staging of the Barcleona
1992 Summer Olympics at the Montjuic Stadium.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Immigration
authorities on Saturday deported a California teacher who was
building a school in a village sympathetic to leftist rebels.
	   A statement from the Interior Secretariat said government
institutions and the National Education System had not authorized
the project by Peter Brown to build a privately funded technical
junior high school in Oventic, a highlands rebel center 25
kilometers (15 miles) north of San Cristobal de las Casas.
	   Brown was in Mexico on a tourist visa, which allows only
recreation, health, sports and cultural activities, it said.
	   ``Building a school is the type of thing that Mexican officials
would consider outside activities authorized by a tourist visa,''
U.S. Embassy duty officer Dennis Offutt said.
	   Immigration agents seized Brown late Friday at a police-military
roadblock near the Chiapas town of San Andres Larrainzar as he was
returning from the school construction site, according to a Mexican
citizen with him at the time.
	   Authorities took Brown to Mexico City's international airport
Saturday, said Salvador Tinajero, a lawyer with the independent
Mexican Commission for Human Rights. The Interior Secretariat said
Brown left Mexico City at 1:30 p.m.
	   Brown, head of the private group San Diegans for Peace, has led
the effort to build the Oventic school and raised more than dlrs
60,000 for the project.
	   Although Mexico's constitution guarantees all Mexicans the right
to education, government-funded schooling in the highlands and
indigenous areas in general is poor. In Chiapas, Indians on average
complete just 2.5 years of study, according to the Chiapas Center
for Humanistic Research.
	   Brown, a San Diego elementary school teacher and outspoken
critic of the Mexican government, and a masked rebel leader
identified only as Comandante Ezequiel inaugurated the school July
13. The public ceremony was unusual because the government in
recent months has waged a firm campaign against foreign involvement
in the 4 1/2-year-old Chiapas rebellion.
	   More than 150 foreigners have been expelled this year for
alleged political activity, which is barred by the Mexican
Constitution.
	   For more than a year, Brown has been leading groups of U.S. and
Mexican supporters to Oventic for weeks at a time to mix cement and
set bricks side-by-side with Indian villagers.
	   So far, volunteers have completed four classrooms, two
dormitories, a computer center, workshops, an auditorium and a
dining hall. Organizers hope to open the school in September and
offer courses in carpentry, electricity, handicrafts marketing, and
Spanish and foreign languages as well as the native Tzotzil Indian
language.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army took up arms on Jan. 1,
1994, to demand an end to poverty and discrimination suffered by
Indians. A cease-fire was declared soon after. Peace talks with the
government broke off in 1996.

Oldtimers give U.S. boost on Goodwill's busiest day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was oldtimers day for the United States at
the Goodwill Games Saturday.
	   Karch Kiraly, who celebrates his 38th birthday this fall, and
Adam Johnson, a relative kid at 33, advanced to the gold-medal
match in beach volleyball with a straight-set win over a pair of
Australians in their 20s.
	   ``You'd probably have to open his brain to find that out,''
Johnson said when asked what keep Karch kicking. ``I think his
drive for success is so much greater than a lot of people's. He
raises your level of play.''
	   Wrestler Melvin Douglas, who turns 36 next month, raised his own
level of competition and helped pace a big American victory over
Turkey.
	   Douglas, the 1993 world champion at 213 pounds (96 kilos) from
Mesa, Arizona, scored a 3-0 overtime decision over Kasif Sakiroglu,
one of six U.S. victories in eight matches.
	   Les Gutches, of Corvallis, Oregon, scored the biggest victory of
the contest, a technical-superiority defeat of Ali Ozen.
	   Gutches led 11-0 when the referee stopped the bout at 4:49,
earning four points for the United States.
	   Other U.S. winners were Sam Henson at 119 pounds, Lincoln
McIlvary (152), Steve Marianetti, in overtime (168) and Kerry McCoy
(286).
	   Russia beat Iran, 17-12, in the tournament opener.
	   As the competition continued on a glorious summer day, a Chinese
gymnast paralyzed in a practice accident underwent surgery in hopes
of someday walking again.
	   Doctors at Nassau County Medical Center fused two fractured and
dislocated vertebrae in the neck of 17-year-old Sang Lan during a
seven-hour operation.
	   Sang was in critical but stable condition. Her parents were due
to arrive from China late Saturday.
	   In Central Park, Kiraly and Johnson dominated the Aussie pair of
Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner, 12-2, 12-10, for a spot in Sunday's
championship match.
	   In the first game, Kiraly, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and
Johnson ran off nine straight points for a 11-1 lead. In the second
game, Australia tied it 9-9 and 10-10 before Kiraly hit a pair of
kills on his serve to win the match.
	   ``I love playing beach volleyball and trying to be part of the
best team,'' Kiraly said.
	   Johnson said that when Kiraly steps on court, `it's like _ `Oh,
the aura is coming over into me and I gotta raise the level of my
play.' I sure did when I first started with him.''
	   ``He's just a machine,'' Zahner, 24, said of Kiraly. ``He
doesn't make many errors. He's almost boring to watch sometimes
because he just doesn't make many errors. He's the ultimate
volleyball player, ever. You just have to give him credit. He's a
fantastic athlete. I hope I'm like that at 37.''
	   In soccer, China upset women's world champion Norway 4-2 in a
shootout and will play the winner of Saturday night's United
States-denmark match.
	   The men's triathlon title was won for the second straight time
by Simon Lessing of Britain, while Australia's Loretta Harrop
rallied to win the women's race.
	   Cycling, in an unusual team format, found the United States in
front after the first of two days. Mike McCarthy won the men's
elimination and scratch race, and the U.S. trio of Paul Swift and
brothers Jonas and James Carney took the Magic Mile. Olympic
speedskating medalist Chris Witty was second in the women's sprint.

Floyd increases lead in U.S. Senior Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Raymond Floyd slipped a bit in the third
round of the U.S. Senior Open.
	   However, so did many of his opponents at the Riviera Country
Club, giving him the opportunity to increase his lead entering
Sunday's final round of the 72-hole tournament.
	   Attempting to become the third player in the 19-year history of
the event to lead from start to finish, Floyd carded a 2-over-par
73 on Saturday, giving him a 54-hole score of even-par 213 and a
three-shot advantage.
	   Tied at 216 were Hale Irwin, who overcame three bogeys on the
first five holes for a 71; and Dave Stockton and Isao Aoki, who
each had 73s.
	   Irwin, the senior tour earnings leader who rebounded from a 77
in the first round to shoot a 3-under-par 68 in the second, got
close by chipping in from off the green on the final hole for a
birdie-3.
	   Floyd would have been the only player under par through three
rounds on the rugged 6,906-yard par 71 Riviera course and its
barbed wire-like kikuyu grass, but he three-putted on No. 18 for a
bogey-5.
	   Earlier, the 55-year-old Floyd had to do some scrambling, saving
par on several holes with long putts, including one of over 30 feet
(9 meters) on the fourth hole, and fine approach shots like one out
of the bunker to within tap-in range on No. 12.
	   Floyd, who had 1-under-par 70s in each of the first two rounds
for a two-shot lead, bogeyed the second hole, parred the third, and
bogeyed the 14th and 18th.
	   ``I actually blew shots on the greens,'' he said. ``I would have
been under par if I handled the greens at all.''
	   As far as the final round is concerned, Floyd said he isn't
concerned about the other players.
	   ``I've got to go play the golf course and handle me,'' he said.
``My chore will be Raymond Floyd and Riviera. If Hale has a fine
round, he'll be hard to beat.''
	   In his senior career, when leading or tied for the lead entering
the final round, Floyd has won seven of 10 tournaments.
	   Irwin appeared out of contention after a 38 on the front nine,
but he had three birdies and six pars on the back side for a
3-under-par 33.
	   ``I've really got my hands full with my game. I can't control
what Raymond does or Gil (Morgan) does,'' Irwin said. ``I'm really
fighting it right now. I just need to get that good frame of mind,
that good mental image, if you wish. That should help.''
	   Three players enter the final round four shots off the pace at
217 _ Tom Jenkins, who had a 71 in the third round; Hugh Baiocchi,
who had a 73, and club pro Roy Vucinich, who had a 75.
	   Next at 218 were Ed Dougherty, who had a 70; Morgan, who had a
73, and Vicente Fernandez, who had a 74.
	   Five players, including Jim Colbert and Bruce Summerhays, were
at 219, and four, including Frank Conner and John Mahaffey, were at
220.
	   Conner's 68 was the low round on Saturday and tied Irwin's
second-round score as the best in the tournament so far.
	   Jack Nicklaus, six strokes back at the beginning of the third
round, shot himself out of contention with a 79 _ his worst round
as a senior, and his highest in an official tournament on tour
since he had an 81 in the second round of the 1995 U.S. Open.
	   That gave the 58-year-old Nicklaus a 225 total.
	   Nicklaus suffered a disastrous stretch early in his round,
getting a triple-bogey 7 on the third hole and bogeys on each of
the next three.
	   ``I made a 7, I missed a short putt for a 6, just made 7,''
Nicklaus said when asked about the third hole. ``I hit it in the
rough _ don't think I've ever had that bad a lie.
	   ``Obviously, I shot myself out of the tournament in the first
six holes. It's disappointing, of course it is. It was just one of
those days. I've played poorly before; we'll survive it. It's only
a game.''
	   Asked about his arthritic left hip, which has been causing him
pain, Nicklaus replied, ``It's all right.''
 &UR; Divots: &LR;  Floyd, in search of his first tournament victory since the
1996 Ford Senior Players Championship, is trying to become the
seventh golfer to win both the U.S. Open and U.S. Senior Open.
Accomplishing that feat previously were Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer,
Orville Moody, Billy Casper, Gary Player and Lee Trevino. ... Floyd
is also trying to join Nicklaus as the only players to win all four
senior majors. ... Irwin is also trying to become a winner of both
Opens. He has won three U.S. Opens, but has come up empty in three
previous Senior Opens, tying for fifth twice along with a
second-place finish two years ago. ... The Senior Open winner will
earn $267,500 from a purse of $1.5 million. ... If two or more
players tie for first place Sunday, an 18-hole playoff will be held
Monday. ... Larry Ziegler was disqualified after completing his
third round for purposely signing an incorrect scorecard. He scored
nine on the final hole, but signed for a 12. Ziegler had carded a
17-over-par 88 before his disqualification, giving him a 54-hole
score of 242. ... Arnold Palmer, who won the second Senior Open in
1981, carded a 75 on Saturday to put him at 229.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela paid
60 cows for Graca Machel's hand in marriage, a Johannesburg
newspaper reported.
	   ``Even if (the president) had paid a million cows for Graca, she
is worth every bristle of hair and hoof,'' the Saturday Star quoted
King Buyelekhaya Zwelibanzi, a senior member of Mandela's Tembu
clan, as saying.
	   The king began negotiations in April.
	   The couple was married in a secret ceremony on July 18,
Mandela's 80th birthday.
	   Mandela sent the cattle to Machel's home country, Mozambique, to
seal kinship between the two families.
	   Machel, 51, has been Mandela's close companion for the past two
years. As the widow of the late Mozambique President Samora Machel,
she is one of few women who have ever been married to two
presidents.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Luciano Szafir, one of Brazil's
top fashion models, announced he has ended his relationship with
Xuxa Meneghel, the hostess of a popular children's television
program, Folha de Estado reported Saturday.
	   The two have been the subject of debate since Christmas, when
Xuxa, as the television hostess is known, announced on national TV
that she was pregnant.
	   Xuxa's unwed pregnancy and her cool treatment of Szafir set
tongues wagging in this Roman Catholic country.
	   Many questioned whether she was the best person to host a
television show for children after she announced that she would
raise Sasha, as they plan to name their daughter, without marrying
Szafir.
	   Despite their separation, Szafir said he intends to be present
when his daughter is born. She is expected on Aug. 10.
	   ___
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy
Smith received Ireland's highest accolade Saturday for her
``distinguished service to the nation'' _ Irish citizenship.
	   President Mary McAleese signed the certificate of citizenship at
a ceremony attended by the ambassador's brother, U.S. Sen. Edward
Kennedy, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, Irish politicians and members
of the diplomatic corps.
	   Presenting the certificate to the ambassador at her official
residence in Dublin, McAleese recalled remarks made by her brother,
the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy, during his 1963 visit to
Ireland, when he spoke of the ``enduring links which have bound the
Irish and the Americans since the earliest days.''
	   She has been ambassador for five years and will leave her post
later this year.
	   ___
	   ASHEVILLE, North Carolina (AP) _ Thomas Wolfe's boyhood home,
the setting for his classic novel ``Look Homeward, Angel,'' was
heavily damaged by fire that shot flames through the roof.
	   The blaze destroyed most of the roof and burned one side of the
house Friday before dawn.
	   Officials hope to salvage the sprawling Queen Anne-style
Victorian house, a historic landmark and repository for many of the
author's papers. Most of the home's furniture and contents were
original, and the house had all of its original stained glass
windows.
	   The house, built in 1883, became a historic landmark in 1949.
The state acquired it in 1974.
	   The house became the model for the boarding house depicted in
Wolfe's 1929 autobiographical coming-of-age novel ``Look Homeward,
Angel.''
	   The fire's cause wasn't known.

Kohl fights for election comeback, looks to eastern Germans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BER106 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl may be off on his usual summer
vacation in the Austrian Alps, but it's not a peaceful one this
year. The German chancellor is too busy fighting for his political
life.
	   Two months before national elections, opposition candidate
Gerhard Schroeder solidly leads in opinion polls, as he has all
year. He's already claiming credit for Germany's current economic
upswing, which Kohl hopes to ride to a fifth term.
	   The ``unity chancellor'' can't count anymore on loyal east
Germans to save him, as they did in the last two elections. The
gratitude many felt toward Kohl for championing the switch from
communism to capitalism eight years ago has died, a casualty of the
high unemployment still blighting the region.
	   The 68-year-old chancellor, who's famous for coming from behind
to win has never trailed so badly this late in the game. So, Kohl's
out pounding the campaign trail, even if it means interrupting his
vacation.
	   On Saturday, Kohl was jetting in from his idyllic lakeside
retreat for the second time this week to try to recapture eastern
votes that could swing the Sept. 27 parliamentary election.
	   At a ceremony near the Polish border, he honored rescuers who
fought floods there last summer and said Germany will spend
millions of dollars to reclaim flood plains and help prevent a
repeat of the devastation.
	   That cameo follows a swing of Baltic Sea resorts Wednesday that
showcased him against a backdrop of eastern tourist towns thriving
under capitalism.
	   Still, his biggest challenge is overcoming the widespread view _
in the east and west _ that Kohl and his center-right government
are spent after 16 years in power.
	   ``A lot has been achieved in east Germany in recent years, but
Kohl and his Christian Democrats don't seem to have the answers for
continued success,'' said electrician Guenter Torn, 60, at one of
Wednesday's rallies.
	   One of Kohl's stabs at a winning answer has been government
largess in make-work and training programs for the east, which
helped get 40,000 people get off the jobless rolls there in June.
	   Eastern unemployment still stood at 17.2 percent compared to 8.9
percent in the west, but most of the month's improvement was in the
east.
	   Another campaign tailored to the east involved a mass mailing
this month of glossy Kohl-boosting literature, modeled on a gossip
magazine popular in communist times. It features Kohl on the cover
with a former Miss Germany from the east and the headline,
``Together we are strong.''
	   Part of the idea was reaching out to young, disgruntled east
Germans who may look to the former communists or the extreme right
in September.
	   Kohl is also counting on a strong economy, which posted its
fastest growth since unification in 1990 in the first quarter.
	   He already is claiming a turnaround in the fight against
unemployment, predicting that the number of people out of work
nationwide will fall below 4 million by late fall.
	   But opposition leaders and even the chairman of Kohl's council
of economic advisers, Herbert Hax, say the government is overly
optimistic.
	   Klaus-Peter Schoeppner of the EMNID polling organization says he
doesn't expect economic recovery to help Kohl as it did in 1994.
	   ``This time around people are asking: Is it because of Kohl or
in spite of him?'' he said.
	   Schroeder, who routs Kohl in personal popularity polls, is
trying to stay above the fray. But he couldn't resist a cocky claim
about the economy.
	   ``The upswing we have now is my upswing,'' he told a television
interviewer this month, claiming that the prospect of a Social
Democrat election victory had boosted business confidence.
	   To make sure his message is heard, Kohl recently hired a more
aggressive spokesman to trumpet the government's version of the
news.
	   He also stepped up his attacks on Schroeder, calling him ``a
danger to the republic'' during a campaign stop last week.
	   And, perhaps as a last resort, Kohl is giving humor a shot: The
latest campaign poster portrays him as an elephant rising from the
blue waters of the Wolfgangsee, with a caption sending holiday
greetings to the nation.
	   It's a play on the ample girth, thick skin and political staying
power of Germany's longest-serving chancellor this century.

Reeling from unrest, Yemen's democracy may be in trouble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAI101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's nascent democracy, a rare experiment
in an authoritarian Arab world, is facing its biggest threat since
a brief but bloody civil war in 1994 almost brought it to an end.
	   In the span of a week, a decades-old border dispute with Saudi
Arabia turned violent, corruption accusations mounted and restive
tribes renewed their insurgency across a desert hinterland that
often has given rise to revolts.
	   The government itself may not be in danger, and its officials
insist that is the case, but many fear the fallout from the tension
on a remarkably free country in a neighborhood of kings and sheiks.
	   ``The trouble could be a pretext,'' said Mohammed al-Saqqaf, a
law professor at San`a University. ``The small margin of democracy
is not something the government necessarily wants to keep.''
	   Yemen's democratic reforms came out of the union in 1990 of two
distinctly undemocratic regimes _ conservative North Yemen and
socialist South Yemen. To keep the union intact, its leaders had to
loosen their grip, making room for a lively civic life.
	   Despite a two-month civil war that ended with the north's
victory, the government has stuck to its tentative reforms,
organizing fairly clean parliamentary elections in 1997. Women
voted and stood as candidates, a right not shared by other women in
the fiercely traditional Arabian Peninsula.
	   Debates in parliament _ along with sharp criticism of the
government, its leaders and its policies _ are aired in their
entirety. In the city's main square, crowds browse through displays
of books that stretch the length of a football field. A history of
communism might sit next to a study of political Islam.
	   The country's 15 official political parties organize relatively
unfettered, and the newspapers may be the Arab world's freest.
	   But already there are signs the government has become uneasy
with the wide license to criticize, particularly at a time of
mounting tension inside Yemen and on its border with Saudi Arabia.
	   ``Democracy is not based on the mistaken understanding that
someone can say anything,'' President Ali Abdullah Saleh warned
Monday. ``Democracy is well behaved, and we will uphold that.''
	   Ask any Yemeni about the cause of today's tension and a finger
likely will be pointed at Saudi Arabia. Yemenis see its hand in the
resurgence of last week's clashes between the army and tribes and
they suspect it of dishonest dealing in settling their border
dispute, which led to a clash July 19 on a contested island. The
three Yemeni soldiers killed in the border clash were buried
Saturday in San`a, the capital.
	   Yemeni dissidents involved in unrest have been paid by Saudi
Arabia, Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab told reporters
Saturday, though he did not produce evidence. Saudi troops, he
added, violated Yemen's border 73 times between June 15 and July
15.
	   Saudi Arabia has denied trying to undermine its smaller, poorer
neighbor, but the Saudi monarchy long has feared the example a
united and democratic Yemen might set for its own dissidents.
	   Yet, some consider growing lawlessness across much of Yemen and
corruption as even bigger threats to the country's democracy.
	   Tribes armed with everything from rifles to artillery
traditionally have had the power to make or break the government.
	   Fearful of their strength, officials have sought to placate more
unruly tribesmen with cars, army ranks and even monthly salaries.
In one province, a tribal leader who helped kidnap foreigners was
appointed last year as the police commander.
	   ``When the government gives money to one man, it encourages
others to do the same thing,'' admits Sheik Nasr Bin Ali al-Hiyal,
head of the Beni Jabr tribe in northern Yemen.
	   Anger has grown toward a government still largely controlled by
Saleh and the military since a June 19 decision to remove subsidies
on wheat and flour and raise fuel prices by as much as 40 percent.
Particularly hard hit were the third of Yemenis who are unemployed,
and often heard are complaints that those in power have not had to
share the burden.
	   Abdelaziz al-Saqqaf, publisher of the weekly Yemen Times, said
many compare the president to Ali Baba and the 40 thieves.
``Unfortunately, he has more than 40,'' al-Saqqaf said.
	   Saleh acknowledges corruption, but blames it on ``backwardness''
in a country still in the Middle Ages just a generation ago.
	   But anger about corruption coupled with the price hikes sent
thousands into the streets. Opposition parties and newspapers
capitalized on the discontent and launched withering attacks on the
government _ actions some fear could prompt a backlash.
	   ``The government thought it could handle democracy easily. But
then people went into the streets, newspapers started writing and
human rights groups started talking,'' said Ali Saif Hassan, an
opposition party activist and journalist.
	   ``Some in the government think they can stop that and have their
power and strength back,'' he said.

	   ASTRAZUB, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The stories spread like a fire,
hotter and stronger in the telling and retelling.
	   Serb forces gouged eyes, burned Albanian civilians alive, beat
them, shot them, slit their throats, and with bloody knives cut the
Serbian cross into their victim's flesh. The bodies were taken to
mass graves.
	   These are survivor tales of last week's battle for Orahovac, one
of the nastiest fights yet in the five-month war over Serb-ruled
Kosovo province, where the ethnic Albanian majority wants
independence. But how many people actually died in Orahovac isn't
clear. And it may never be.
	   Serbs deny targeting Albanian civilians. Albanian politicans put
the civilian death toll at about 120. Witness accounts would make
it many times that.
	   It's a messy stew of information typical for Kosovo, where
centuries of ethnic hatred and Balkan traditions of oral history
make the ``truth'' a confusing blend of fact, secrecy and
hyperbole.
	   Serbs speak of Kosovo Liberation Army atrocities against their
people _ murder, kidnapping, rape. Albanians say the reverse. And
facts become irrelevant, giving way to what each community believes
is true. Stories of barbarity and butchery only fuel mutual
recriminations and drive the Serbs and Albanians farther apart.
	   In the case of Orahovac, two things are indisputable: The Serbs
won, driving the Kosovo Liberation Army into the surrounding hills.
And the fight created some 20,000 refugees, many of them living
with illness and filth in villages without medicine or electricity.
	   Here in Astrazub, a doctor worked by candlelight in an abandoned
school, rushing around his tiny office to treat a stream of
patients. He swabbed a wailing, feverish baby with alcohol, wrapped
a toddler in water-soaked gauze, took the blood pressure of an
elderly woman.
	   ``The Red Cross hasn't been here and we have nothing. We have an
epidemic of diarrhea, and children are going to die,'' the doctor
said Friday night, adding that refugees had more than tripled the
village population of 3,000.
	   A refugee from Orahovac himself, the doctor refused to give his
name for fear of Serb retribution.
	   Outside, dozens of exhausted people milled around, some dazed,
others speaking of atrocities they saw _ or heard about _ during
the five days of fighting that ended last Tuesday.
	   One man sobbed, pressing his palm over his eyes. After a few
minutes, he said he survived by darting through the town's narrow
streets.
	   He said he peeked around a building amd saw police stab his
neighbor 66-year-old Ali Spahiju in the head and carve the Serb
symbol on his face. He said the man's wife tried to hide in a
cellar but Serbs broke in and opened fire, wounding her with
bullets that ricocheted off the walls.
	   The man, who refused to give his name out of fear, said the
Serbs burned his house and robbed women of gold jewelry, tucking it
as trophies into their black head scarves. He and others described
Serbs attacking the mosque, where 500 people had sought refuge.
	   ``The Serbs cut out the eyes and slit throats,'' Zumici Gani,
60, claimed, though she had only heard about the attack. She said
that before journalists arrived, Serbs came in and washed the
streets of blood.
	   The streets were mostly clean, with a wide blood stain near the
mosque. And by noon Saturday the town looked deserted, except for
police and looters. A charred horse carcass lay in an empty lot and
the bloated body of a man was still under a wagon, both rotting in
the heat.
	   But some Albanians had stayed behind, hiding in their cellars
until the fighting stopped. Now they are stuck, terrified to leave
because of snipers in the hills and Serb police blocking the roads
out of town.
	   One red-brick house shelters dozens of people. Sharing with
neighbors, they survive on bread and vegetables. No aid
organizations have reached them. They say they are are among 3,000
people left. The elderly go from house to house at night, spreading
accounts of slaughter and counting survivors.
	   One man, 26, said he heard the Serbs bound people's hands,
forced them to lie on the ground and set them on fire. Just hours
before journalists arrived Wednesday, he said he looked out the
window and saw hundreds of Serbs cleaning up blood.
	   Others who stayed behind say they saw 10 trucks collecting
bodies.
	   Later Saturday, a garbage wagon pulled into town and _ under
Serb police guard _ collected the last, rotting body. As the wagon
pulled away, police let it through a checkpoint but stopped
journalists. There's no body inside, just some animals, a policeman
said, adding, ``Don't even think about following that truck.''

Feature directors lending talents to TV commercials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTH PASADENA, California (AP) _ There's only so much a
director can do with a garbage truck, a lawn gnome and 45 seconds
of film.
	   No wonder quirky perfectionist Tim Burton is sweating his next
shot, pacing the sidewalk, running a hand through his tangle of
dark hair.
	   It's almost 11 p.m. on Oxley Street in this leafy Los Angeles
suburb, one of the shooting locations for Burton's next production.
It's a bold new challenge for the man who made ``Batman,''
``Beetlejuice'' and ``Edward Scissorhands.''
	   The project? Burton's first television commercial.
	   And the product? Chewing gum.
	   Moonlighting in the product-pitching business is all the rage
now for big-time directors, as they race through the door opened by
Spike Lee, the accomplished feature director who made it
respectable to direct TV spots with his slick Nike ads.
	   Top directors can pull down as much as dlrs 500,000 for a couple
day's work, though they insist they're guided by other forces.
	   ``In a commercial, you can try to do a lot of new experimental
techniques. It's no limit. It's a crazy thing, but very, very
creative,'' says famed Hong Kong action director John Woo, who shot
a series of commercials for Nike featuring Brazilian soccer stars
dribbling balls through an airport.
	   Woo suffered no pangs of guilt, no sense of shame, no lingering
feelings that he sold out.
	   ``This commercial is like a John Woo movie,'' he says. ``All
they wanted was a good commercial. They never asked me, 'John, how
about give me an extreme close-up for the shoes or for the
trademark.' They never, ever say those things.''
	   On the Burton set, the ad agency reps keep their distance.
There's no question of who the star is. And the star looks like a
nervous wreck helming this 45-second production to sell Hollywood
Gum, which is sold in Europe.
	   The scene is a tricky one.
	   It calls for a gnome, with a long, white beard and red pointy
hat, to leap into the back of a green trash truck, sending shreds
of salad flying. It's a tough shot because the little guy's moves
will be computer generated and inserted later.
	   All Burton has is a ``reference gnome'' to line up the camera
angle. This 76-centimeter-tall (2.5-foot-tall) statue with flowing
beard and cathedral hat is propped up on the back of the trash
truck. The shot is lined up. Burton takes the gnome away and hands
it to the first assistant director, who holds it for a while before
handing it off to another crew member.
	   ``This guy is truly focused,'' Michael Bodnarchek, the
commercial's producer, says. Bodnarchek is with the Los
Angeles-based production house A Band Apart, which weds feature
directors to commercial work.
	   ``You will see visuals that will have that Tim Burton look,''
Bodnarchek says. ``It has a grand scale to it for a 45-second
spot.''
	   Which, of course, is the whole idea. Otherwise, the agency would
hire someone much cheaper. But although these directors are given
some creative control, they don't run the whole show; this is,
after all, advertising, not art.
	   It all depends on the project. Burton had a say in the chewing
gum ad story-line (something about a gnome who leaps from one scene
to another through various portals) and lent the commercial its
creepy, dark look.
	   Other times, the director is brought in primarily for the polish
and style. The rest is usually scripted, meticulously, by the ad
agency and the client company.
	   ``Everything is micromanaged. The ad agency was the first one to
tell me that, and I understand it,'' says Steve Buscemi, a busy
actor (``Armageddon,'' ``Fargo'') and an up-and-coming filmmaker
who directed commercials for the WNBA. ``You've got 30 seconds to
get something across. Every second counts.''
	   Still, Buscemi says, ``That at times got kind of trying for me.
I guess I just wasn't used to have that much input. ... It was
definitely one of the hardest things I've done. But when it was
over, I was really proud of it.''
	   Buscemi's spot has a guy hanging out at a pool with a group of
basketball players _ all cardboard cutouts _ though the deluded man
doesn't seem to realize this.
	   Hollywood seems to agree that commercials are something to
behold. Why else would the town keep trusting commercial and video
directors with motion pictures. Michael Bay, who directed
``Armageddon,'' is one of many who made the leap from the
commercial side to the feature world.
	   ``It's a greater challenge,'' director Brett Ratner (``Money
Talks'') says of commercial-making. That's where he got his start,
and he doesn't mind going back. ``It's not a lesser thing to do a
commercial. Telling a story in 10 shots is harder than telling a
story in an hour and a half.''
	   As Burton is just discovering.
	   He takes his seat in the director's chair, eye on the video
monitor. The assistant director barks into a walkie-talkie, calling
for action. The garbage truck pulls away down the street, hosed
down for that noir look, dragging behind it a couple of metal trash
cans attached by fishing line. Chopped salad flies.
	   Cut!
	   The assistant director shoots a glance at Burton. The director
wants to try it again. ``The timing is generally right. It's just a
matter of getting it together,'' Burton tells the crew.
	   On to take four.

Five questions with Brad Rowe: an economics major discovers acting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 'Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss' opened July 24 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY343 &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHLEEN SAMPEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Brad Rowe doesn't consider it a risk to be
playing a gay man in his first feature film, ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss.'' Why, it's small potatoes compared with his other
cutting-edge adventures: sky diving, bungee jumping and cliff
diving.
	   Playing a long, tense bedroom scene with another actor? Hah. In
1992, Rowe ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. Don't tell him
about tense.
	   ``I saw some pretty gruesome stuff, like a guy had his skull
crushed in front of me by the hoof of a bull,'' Rowe recalls. ``He
didn't die. Nobody died the year I ran.''
	   At 28, the only trepidation the actor admits feeling about his
role in the film was what his strait-laced Midwestern parents might
think when they saw it at the Sundance Film Festival last winter.
	   ``My mom's like super-miss-artsy-liberal person,'' he says
laughing. ``But my dad's a little more conservative. He actually
loved it. Afterward he had his picture taken with all the drag
queens who were in the film.''
	   He says that such parental encouragement enabled him to leave
the University of Wisconsin after two years and study abroad in the
early 1990s. He settled in Seville, Spain, and liked it so much, he
stayed an extra year before returning to Wisconsin to finish his
degree in economics in 1993.
	   Rowe describes his overseas experience as ``an epiphany.''
	   While there, he worked as a goodwill ambassador for the State
Department, learned flamenco, sang in a blues band and became
fluent in Spanish.
	   Rowe, a native of Milwaukee, now resides in Los Angeles.
	   He doesn't mind that the industry touts him as ``the next Brad
Pitt'' even though in high school, everyone told him he looked like
Rob Lowe.
	   Fans of the NBC sitcom ``NewsRadio'' may recognize Rowe's
occasional appearances playing a dimwitted intern.
	   1. What's your favorite word in Spanish?
	   Rowe: I'd have to say 'ole.' (laughs) It's such a great word, a
climactic expression of emotion that we haven't really been able to
capture in the English language. It's used anytime you see a thing
of grace or beauty. If you see someone doing an amazing dance or if
you're at a bullfight and something's incredible. Or when someone
hits a home run at a baseball game.
	   2. Is this a big risk for you to play a gay character so early
in your career?
	   Rowe: I have to admit I was a little bit tentative about it. I
think career choices are a little bit different from whimsical ways
that we entertain ourselves. I was a little worried about the bed
scene, where we were lying together. Since I've done that role and
since it took its turn at Sundance, a ton of doors have opened up
for me. I've done some projects that have all been straight roles.
I just finished up a TNT original Western where I was riding horses
and shooting guns and all that kind of stuff. I don't think you can
get more hetero than that. (laughs)
	   3. Has your economics degree helped you at all in the movie
business?
	   Rowe: Actually, I think, yeah. It has helped me. It's helped me
more with the business side out here, that's for sure.
	   3 1-2 : When did you decide you wanted to be an actor?
	   Rowe: I was singing in a blues band over in Spain and I really
got such a rush out of entertaining people. That whole energy was
just absolutely amazing. Doing film and television you don't get
that immediate reciprocity because it doesn't come until maybe a
year later when someone sees the film. When I came out to L.A., I
had notions of acting and wanted to get a writing career going. I
started taking acting classes and working in a talent agency and
they sent me out on auditions. I threw out some of the most
miserable auditions that you've ever seen. They were so awful.
After some time I started to get better and things started to work
out.
	   4. Do your looks ever get in the way?
	   Rowe: Yeah. For as many doors that have been opened to leading
man roles, there are a lot of studio pictures where they have set
people like Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio or Johnny Depp. They
say, you know, you're just too good-looking to be playing across
from this person as their sidekick. Which is fine. You don't want
your film to look like an episode of 'Falcon Crest.' So I totally
understand that. That's the business. I'll eventually have my turn
to be playing leading men.
	   5. What happens if acting doesn't work out for you as a career?
	   Rowe: I'd stick with writing. I'd love to direct or produce.
There are a lot of aspects to the business. With my financial
background I think I'd be able to jump in and do the production
thing really well. I really enjoy the industry. Later on when I'm
older I might like to try my hand at politics.

Queen Latifah: Her royal title suits her just fine

 &UR; AP Newsfeatures Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Queen Latifah started rapping when she was 17.
Not immodestly, ``All Hail the Queen'' was the title of her debut
album, released in 1989.
	   Her mother thought her stage name was pretentious and said,
``Give me a break.'' But Latifah, now 28, recalls, ``I stuck to my
guns and it proved to be good.''
	   The Grammy-winning rapper, who was born Dana Owens, said she
picked Latifah from a book of Muslim names when she was 8. She was
visiting relatives in Newark, New Jersey, and the book belonged to
a cousin. ``It meant delicate and sensitive. So I decided that
would be my nickname.''
	   When music caught her interest, she started making demos with
the help of friends she met in the rap industry and finally scored
with ``Princess of the Posse,'' which was shown on ``Yo! MTV Raps''
and led to a contract with Tommy Boy Records. She won a Grammy for
best rap solo performance in the song ``U.N.I.T.Y.'' in 1995.
	   Rapping hasn't been her only gig. She starred in ``Living
Single,'' a sitcom that ran for five seasons on the Fox network,
and has starred in several films including ``Set It Off'' and
``Sphere,'' with Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman.
	   ``Set It Off'' came after a difficult period for Latifah. She
was coping with the death of her brother, a car-jacking in which a
friend was wounded, and her arrest during a traffic stop for gun
and marijuana possession.
	   Her newest project, ``Order in the Court,'' is a CD on her own
label, Flavor Unit, distributed by Motown.
	   She prefers the melodic cuts to the ones where phrases are
delivered rapid-fire.
	   Listeners understand most of the quick raps right away, she
says. ``But everybody has to rewind on some of them. The clue to
rap is you got to play it again and again, certain things you
weren't sure you heard right.''
	   Although ``Order in the Court'' isn't a ``message-y'' album _
``it's about making good, individual music, music that's a little
different from everyone else out there'' _ several tracks do have a
message.
	   She says ``What You Gonna Do'' is a song that means ``at the end
of the day, no matter what goes on ... all you have to do is pray
on it. Find the light of God inside of you, because it is there.''
	   ``I am Christian,'' says Latifah, who describes herself as more
spiritual than religious. ``I don't go to church every Sunday. I do
pray on a daily basis. I have cool conversations with God and my
ancestors who are up in heaven.''
	   Although Latifah is known for her pro-woman stance, she says
``What You Gonna Do'' is not just for women. ``A positive attitude
is very important. It lets you know good things are possible. If
you don't have a positive attitude, you get jaded on life, not
caring about yourself or anybody else. I wasn't raised like that.
We had rough times, but I was raised with a lot of joy around me.
	   ``Everybody is going to go through slumps. You can lay the load
on God, put it in his hands and ask him to work things out for you.
Things do turn around and do pick up.''
	   In ``Black on Black Love,'' another cut from the CD, Latifah
talks about a dream: ``As a people, we lived right.''
	   ``I've thought about that a lot,'' she says. ``Maybe it's
idealism. If we all get together, take care of one another and
respect and love one another more _ what could happen if we did do
things like that.''
	   ``From the Heart of a Queen'' is a book she's writing about
self-esteem and self-respect. While not an autobiography, the book
will draw on her experiences growing up in East Orange, New Jersey.
	   Latifah, whose build is generous on her 5-foot-10-inch
(1.8-meter) frame, is quick to say she never starved herself, even
in high school. ``I was a good healthy eater. I also played
basketball so I got exercise. Now I'm a little bit lazier than I
used to be. I'm not exercising as much as I should right now. I'm
trying to get back on track.''
	   Women probably agonize about their looks more than men, she
says. ``Every woman is not a model. That's what you see on TV,
perfect figures. My thing is, a perfect figure is what you have.
Love the reality of what it looks like. Sometimes self-hate causes
you to do so many things like starve yourself or overeat, things
like that.''
	   For her role as a deep-sea diver in ``Sphere,'' Latifah had to
learn how to scuba. ``My agent told them I could scuba. He had to
get the gig,'' she says. ``I knew I would pick it up pretty
quickly. When I was 10, I was on a swim team in Newark for a little
while. I've always been a good swimmer.''
	   For her role as a lounge singer in the upcoming film, ``Living
Out Loud,'' Latifah sings jazz.
	   Singing jazz professionally for the first time, Latifah says,
``took a little rehearsal. I enjoyed it.'' She listened to several
versions of ``Lush Life'' before she sang it and most liked Sarah
Vaughan's version. She also liked Ruth Brown's ``Be Anything (But
Be Mine).''
	   Future plans include a movie about legendary blues singer Bessie
Smith. ``I'll have a lot of fun dancing and singing,'' she says.
	   Oh, yes, Smith, known as the queen of the blues, definitely was
not skinny.

25 years after his death, fans honor king of Kung Fu

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ German civil servant Wolfgang Miesen traveled
half-way around the world so he could feel closer to his hero Bruce
Lee on the 25th anniversary of his death.
	   Miesen achieved his goal when he had a vision of the martial
arts actor in a Hong Kong cemetery. But it was not because he had
found Lee's grave, rather, Miesen thinks he found the cemetery
where a fight scene was filmed for Lee's classic ``Enter the
Dragon.''
	   ``I'm standing at this place,'' the 31-year-old said later.
``And there was ... Bruce standing here, and there was a camera.
It's fascinating.''
	   Miessen was among hundreds of fans from around the world who
converged at the Bruce Lee Cafe to mark the July 20 anniversary of
the Kung Fu master's death.
	   Another acolyte, Robert Wu, stood transfixed in front of a small
TV as Lee took on a group of large Western men in ``Enter the
Dragon.''
	   Wu, a Chinese-American businessman, delivered a short punch into
the air, then broke into a mischievous smile.
	   ``We may be smaller physically, but we can beat up other guys,''
Wu said. ``He not only gives all Chinese males self-respect, he
gets the white males to respect them.''
	   Kung Fu aficionados idolize Lee for opening up the ancient
Chinese martial art to the world. Asians living in the West thank
him for breaking the stereotype of the weak, inferior Chinese male.
	   Lee starred in only five films in the early 1970s, including the
first-ever U.S.-Hong Kong joint production, ``Enter the Dragon,''
but this was enough to achieve lasting fame.
	   While Lee has become a household name in much of the world, the
hype has bypassed Hong Kong. His sudden death at the age of 33,
apparently from swelling of the brain, was quietly remembered here
with a small exhibition and a gathering of about 150 tourists and a
few locals.
	   ``Everywhere else he's an idol. In Hong Kong, he's not
considered to be anything,'' said Jon Benn, a 62-year-old American
actor who played the bad guy, Big Boss, opposite Lee in ``Way of
the Dragon,'' Lee's only effort at directing.
	   Born in San Francisco in 1940, Lee spent his childhood in Hong
Kong. He was sent by his father to the United States as a teen-ager
after he got into too many street fights. He later studied
philosophy at the University of Seattle while perfecting his own
school of martial arts called Jeet Kune Do.
	   Lee was quickly replaced in the Hong Kong film market by other
local stars, including contemporary action star Jackie Chan. But no
other Kung Fu star has achieved Lee's impact in Hollywood.
	   With tourism responsible for 1 out of 8 jobs here, efforts are
being made to promote Hong Kong as the place where Bruce Lee
learned to fight and did most of his filming.
	   ``Thousands of people come, asking where they can see a Bruce
Lee statue,'' said Benn, who opened the Bruce Lee Cafe this year.
The bar features two life-sized Lee cutouts, dozens of original
movie posters and memorabilia, including the one-piece yellow
jumpsuit Lee wore in ``Game of Death.''
	   Local tour operator Li Kin-wa, 38, said about 100 tourists this
year, mostly Japanese, have walked the Bruce Lee Trail tracking his
former homes, schools and filming locations.
	   The 600-member local fan club is planning a permanent museum,
and the tourist board plans a section devoted to Lee in a proposed
movie-theme park modeled after Universal Studios.

 &UR; With AP Graphic Illo FISHBURNE &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In the spotlight: Laurence Fishburne
	    &UR; Born: Laurence Fishburne was born on July 30, 1961, in Augusta,
Georgia. He attended New York High School for the Performing Arts
and studied acting at Lincoln Square Academy in New York.
	    &UR; Image: Fishburne is known for brooding-yet-charismatic,
intense-yet-affable, low-down nasty and shamefully desirable roles
in films such as ``Boyz N the Hood'' and ``What's Love Got to Do
With It.''
	   ``Boyz N the Hood'' was the debut film for director John
Singleton, who had been a production assistant on television's
``Pee-wee's Playhouse'' when Fishburne was playing Cowboy Curtis.
When ``Boyz'' appeared at the Cannes Film Festival, Singleton told
a press conference, ``If Larry Fishburne were white, he'd be Robert
De Niro.''
	   For ``What's Love Got to Do With It,'' Fishburne said he tried
to give a dash of humanity to his role as the abusive, womanizing
Ike Turner. ``Part of being an actor means dealing with rejection
and being frustrated sometimes. I think Ike was frustrated by a lot
of things. My major concern was that you could, in some way,
empathize with him.''
	    &UR; Major film roles: Fishburne played an undercover cop in ``Deep
Cover''; a college professor in ``Higher Learning''; a former CIA
operative in ``Bad Company''; and a power-hungry, small-town
homicide detective in ``Just Cause.''
	    &UR; Career start: He started acting professionally at 10, appearing
regularly on daytime's ``One Life to Live.'' At 14, he was chosen
by Francis Coppola to play Clean, a teen-age soldier high on grass
in ``Apocalypse Now.''
	   Fishburne snagged early supporting roles in ``Rumble Fish,''
``The Cotton Club,'' ``School Daze'' and ``The Color Purple.'' He
won critical kudos for playing a hired killer in Abel Ferrara's
``King of New York.'' A veteran of the New York stage, he won a
Tony Award for best featured actor in August Wilson's ``Two Trains
Running.''
	    &UR; What colleagues think: ``He's magnetic. You put him on-screen
and you want to find out what is happening in his head. He brings a
vigor, a whole new dimension and a sexuality which is very
strong,'' says director Oliver Parker, who directed the 1995 film,
``Othello,'' which starred Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh.

At the Movies: 'Saving Private Ryan'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By HILLEL ITALIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ More than 20 years after terrorizing teen-agers
with ``Jaws,'' Steven Spielberg bloodies the waters for adults with
``Saving Private Ryan,'' a World War II epic of savage,
near-surreal reality.
	   Set over a 10-day period that begins with the D-Day invasion at
Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, ``Saving Private Ryan'' features
two long battle scenes that confirm Spielberg as the most
technically gifted director of his time. They're as graphic, and as
disturbing, as anything put on screen, so disturbing even Spielberg
backs off from what they reveal.
	   Tom Hanks stars as Capt. John Miller, the frightened leader of
an eight-man squad that has survived D-Day and has been given the
unwanted mission of tracking down a missing soldier, Pvt. James
Ryan (Matt Damon). His three older brothers were killed in action
and Miller's job is to tell him he's going home.
	   The battles happen near the beginning and near the end of the
movie, taking up about an hour. They're filmed in documentary
style: real time, handheld camera, no music. Then again, Spielberg
doesn't need music. He arranges the sounds of war into his own
symphony, of bullets pinging off metal and severing flesh, of
soldiers vomiting and screaming, of blood pouring out of helmets
and dirt exploding into the sky.
	   The scenes are everything the director could have wanted, and
more, because the movie would have worked better without them.
Having argued that war is insanity, devastating both for conquerors
and conquered, Spielberg follows with a conventional story of
heroism and sacrifice. The master of illusion doesn't know what to
make of disillusion.
	   With a running time of 170 minutes, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is
structured like war itself, long periods of boredom between moments
of the most horrifying excitement. The film has the look and the
feel of greatness, but something is missing. Hanks' role is
underwritten, and so is everyone else's. Despite some talented
actors, including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies, the
GIs remain character types rather than characters: a Jew, an
Italian, a pencil pusher, a wisecracking New Yorker, a
Bible-quoting Southerner. War may be a faceless affair, but war
movies shouldn't be.
	   According to the production notes, Spielberg's intention was to
find ``decency in the hell of warfare,'' a search he pursued more
thoughtfully in ``Schindler's List.'' Battle footage aside, there's
something naive about ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The screenwriter,
Robert Rodat, is best known for the children's film ``Fly Away
Home.'' John Williams' bland, hymnlike score feels as out of place
as the casting of Ted Danson as an Army captain.
	   Hanks, like Spielberg a symbol of innocence and idealism, makes
his first appearance in one of the director's films. Why did they
wait so long? They were meant for each other, like Frank Capra and
James Stewart. But ``Saving Private Ryan'' was the wrong project
for them. Capra and Stewart, in ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' did a
better job of taking us to the abyss and back. Then again, they had
just returned from the war.
	   An Amblin Entertainment production, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a
joint-presentation of Paramount Pictures and Spielberg's DreamWorks
Pictures.

	   ``The Dirty Boogie'' (Interscope) _ The Brian Setzer Orchestra
	   Even before the current swing music boomlet, ex-Stray Cat Brian
Setzer had gone in an intriguing direction by taking a 16-piece
orchestra on the road. The Brian Setzer Orchestra essentially
combines the Stray Cats' rockabilly with big band boogie and jive
music.
	   It's a good idea, and undoubtedly great fun in a club, where
Setzer is a charismatic front man. It's a little tougher to carry
off on disc. ``This Cat's on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ``You're the
Boss,'' a duet with No Doubt's Gwen Stefani, are exhilarating, but
the standard ``Since I Don't Have You'' and superfluous remake of
``Rock This Town'' suffer from overly busy arrangements. Remember
the title ``Rock This Town,'' Brian, and don't try to model the
song after a James Bond soundtrack.
	   Rock fans who want to move gingerly into other musical worlds
will find this a comfortable first step. Setzer has the makings of
a Buster Poindexter for the late 1990s _ a great lounge act and
tour guide through styles, but not much of a force as a creator of
lasting new music.
	   __ By David Bauder, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Mezzanine'' (Virgin) _ Massive Attack
	   When Massive Attack first came on the music scene in the early
1990s, there was no name for the trio's funky digital beats.
	   Hailing from Bristol, England, the unique sound soon became
known as trip hop, a fusion of hip hop and electronica that quickly
spread in popularity from Britain to the United States.
	   Liz Fraser of the Cocteau Twins was recruited for three tracks
on ``Mezzanine,'' Massive Attack's first album since 1995. And it's
her ethereal vocals that set the album apart, especially the
mesmerizing ``Black Milk.''
	   Overall, ``Mezzanine'' sounds like ground already covered, but
that may be because Massive Attack has produced plenty of
imitators, notably Bjork, Portishead and Tricky.
	   _ By David Kligman, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Lonesomers'' (Razor and Tie) _ Mare Winningham
	   Mare Winningham is best known for her surprise Academy Award
supporting actress nomination a few years ago for playing a
successful songwriter in the film ``Georgia.''
	   It turns out the singing role wasn't much of a stretch for
Winningham, who performs regularly at clubs in the San Francisco
Bay area. ``Lonesomers,'' her debut album for the small label Razor
and Tie, includes 10 original songs and a version of the Rolling
Stones' ``The Last Time.''
	   The folk twang, a bit reminiscent of early Natalie Merchant,
works on the pained ``Leave It Alone'' and ``Quietly Tonight.'' But
too much of the material sounds like average coffeehouse strains _
even if the singing guitarist sitting on the stool is a Hollywood
actress.
	   _ By David Kligman, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Pounding Nails in the Floor With My Forehead'' (Blackbird) _
Eric Bogosian
	   Playwright and actor Eric Bogosian runs through a series of
rants and observations in several characters in this new CD, a
recording of one of his one-man shows.
	   There's the bum on the subway who revels in the idea of the
germs he spreads to commuting yuppies. And a motivational self-help
speaker who suggests nurturing our inner babies, even if we have to
wet ourselves. Plus a grizzled drug dealer who extols his favorite
pastimes, sex and drugs: ``I mean, how can you compare that with
skiing?''
	   Bogosian says ``Pounding Nails'' is about frustration and
explosion, but it's also about the inanity of pop culture and the
struggle to make life meaningful amid the banalities of daily
existence.
	   Bogosian, 45, who wrote the screenplay for ``subUrbia'' and
starred in Oliver Stone's ``Talk Radio,'' is a very talented actor
whose abilities come through best in person, where he deftly uses
subtle mannerisms and facial movements to bring out his characters
fully.
	   But if you can't see him live, check out this disc.

<TEXT>
	   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) _ An inner voice guides Se Ri Pak on the golf
course, calmly reciting orders. She is a dynamo with a 5-iron,
tense and serene at the same time. The contradiction produces
graceful results.
	   ``Keep thinking, keep pushing.''
	   She first noticed it while practicing bunker shots for hours on
a beach under the tutelage of her father, who also made her hit
balls in a dark cemetery and watch pit bulls fight to strengthen
her mind.
	   The voice seems to make the ball do what she wants, bouncing to
the center of the fairway or breaking toward the cup. She is
ruthless on the golf course, and she doesn't spend much time away
from one.
	   ``I am just 20 years old. I have to do many things, right? Not
just golf,'' said Pak, the South Korean rookie whose skill and
mystique are giving women's golf the kind of lift Tiger Woods
provided for the men's game. ``I'd like to just go out shopping or
dancing. ... But there is no time.''
	   Pak has won three tournaments, including the McDonald's LPGA
Championship and U.S. Women's Open, shattering some impressive tour
records.
	   At the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic two weeks ago, her 261 was the
lowest score in a 72-hole event in the LPGA's 48-year history. In
thousands of tournaments spanning decades, only three players have
had as many as 10 birdies in a round. Pak did it twice in two days.
	   After a disappointing 43rd at the JAL Big Apple Classic last
week, Pak tried to regain her precision and poise at the Giant
Eagle Classic. In the first round Friday, she recovered from a
shaky front nine to tie for the lead with a 7-under 65 _ with two
birdies and an eagle on the last three holes.
	   The galleries love her. People are drawn to her the way they are
drawn to Woods. Did you see that shot? What will she do next?
	   ``They are swept up with the drama that was occurring, with
whatever the magical intangibles are in this young player,'' LPGA
commissioner Jim Ritts said. ``As a result, we've probably gone
through the greatest period of visibility and interest in some
time. You'd have to go back to Nancy Lopez's rookie year of 1978.''
	   Pak's story, chronicled in the South Korean press, is much more
complicated than her calm face reveals. She has been driven to
excel in golf since the day she picked up a club at 12. Her father
abandoned his gang background to devote countless hours to
training.
	   ``I made her play golf because I vaguely thought that golf would
bring her money,'' her father, Pak Jun-chul, told the Seoul daily
Joong Ang Ilbo.
	   Pak says she has practiced six to seven hours a day nearly every
day since her dad let her take that first swing. Her other waking
hours are consumed by thoughts of majestic drives and sand-spitting
bunker shots.
	   Pak showed natural talent from that first time she gripped a
club, felt its power and possibilities in her strong hands.
	   ``He gave me a club and said, `Just hit it,' '' Pak said of her
father. ``So no matter what happened, I just hit it.''
	   The training regimen started in middle school with Pak running
up and down 15 flights of stairs at the family's apartment building
in Taejeon in central South Korea. Then came the nights on the
beaches and in cemeteries, and the pit bull fights.
	   ``The fighting dogs are not whimperers,'' Pak's father said.
	   After living in Hawaii for two years, the family returned to
South Korea when Pak was 12. According to reports in Joong Ang
Ilbo, her father was stabbed by a rival gang member.
	   ``Yes, I was a hoodlum,'' he said. ``I led a rough life. I was
once a well-known thug in town.''
	   Despite her father's eccentric methods and checkered past, Pak
credits him for her success _ although it is clear that the first
dark night hitting balls among tombstones struck fear in her.
	   ``The first time I did that I was really scared, because it is
dark there, nobody there, it is quiet,'' she said. ``But I got
stronger and kept thinking about my game. ... I could tell myself
everything like, `Keep thinking, keep thinking.'''
	   Perhaps memories of that dark solitude pushes her now, even on
the idyllic fairways of a country nearly 100 times larger than
hers. Ohio is slightly larger than South Korea.
	   In the first round of the Giant Eagle, Pak was paired with two
established stars of the tour, Annika Sorenstam and Karrie Webb.
While her partners smiled and chatted occasionally with caddies and
fans, Pak walked steadfastly between holes, lips pursed tightly.
	   On this day, Sorenstam still had the larger following. Pak was
not having one of the precise, tenacious performances that helped
her break records.
	   Despite her 5-foot-6 (1.6-meter) frame, she takes long, loping
strides. She almost looks like a mope until the ball is in front of
her, the grip is in her hands and her front arm stiffens before she
uncoils with a WHACK!
	   On every tour stop, she faces a course she has never seen
before, so she studies the greens from every conceivable angle.
	   ``Every time, everything new,'' Pak said. ``That is why I
surprise myself.''
	   How good can Pak be? Lopez, her idol, says the kid will be fine
if she's given some room. South Korean reporters follow her
everywhere, and millions stayed up all night to watch her televised
playoff round in the Women's Open.
	   ``I've tried to boost her a little and tell her to take time for
herself,'' Lopez said. ``She has a lot of pressure to be the next
superstar, and she could be if you let her.''
	   To become a superstar, Pak realizes that she won't have much
time away from golf.
	   ``In Korea, I would think I'm not normal, because many people,
they know me, I cannot do anything,'' she said. ``My age is 20, so
I would like to play 20 more years or more _ double my age.
	   ``Besides golf, maybe later I would like to go shopping in
Miami, New York, Las Vegas. Just fun. Just vacation. In wintertime,
I go skiing somewhere. I just want to be first golf, then fun.
Golf, then fun.''

hour, 59.43 seconds, .98 seconds ahead of teammate Michelle Jones.
	   Lindquist, the top-rated U.S. woman triathlete and No. 7 in the
world, led after the 1-kilometer swim in New York harbor and 40K
bike race from Battery Park to Central Park.
	   But the four-time Pan American games swimming champion but faded
to fourth behind Hungary's Erika Molnar in the final 10-kilometer
run through the park's hilly trails. Her 37:54 10K was 19th fastest
in the 25-woman field.
	   ``Sometimes I have a good day and sometimes Barb has a good
day,'' Harrop said. ``Today was mine, I guess.''
	   In the men's race, Simon Lessing of Britain successfully
defended his crown, turning in the second-fastest times in each of
the three legs and finishing in 1:46.33, .91 seconds ahead of
Australia's Craig Walton.
	   Laurent Jeanselme of France, the leader after the first two
stages, was eighth in the 10K and finished third, in 1:47.40.
	   The best U.S. men's finish was sixth place for Nick Radkewich in
1:49.37.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SEE SPOT RUN: Just about anything can happen on the streets of
New York and the Goodwill triathlon was no exception.
	   Take Simon Lessing's gold-medal race, for instant. It was almost
ended by someone's pet.
	   ``We nearly ran over a dog on the bike course. That was quite
exciting,'' Lessing said.
	   The pooch, described by Lessing as ``a little dog with a little
soccer ball in its mouth,'' was out for a stroll when the bikes
raced through on their way from Battery Park up the East Side and
then through midtown.
	   Although the bike course was shifted one block east to get
around the site of a fatal construction accident, and there was
some confusion at the start of the run, Lessing said it was ``quite
a good race and there were basically no problems whatsoever.''
	   ``It's always difficult to run a race in the middle of a city,
in the middle of new York,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SENIOR GAMES: Two of beach volleyball's old dudes from Southern
California will play for the Goodwill Games' gold medal.
	   Karch Kiraly, who turns 38 in November, and Adam Johnson, a
relative kid of 33, beat Australians Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner
12-2, 12-10 to reach Sunday's championship match.
	   ``I love playing beach volleyball and trying to be part of the
best team,'' Kiraly said.
	   Johnson said that when Kiraly steps on court, `it's like _ `Oh,
the aura is coming over into me and I gotta raise the level of my
play.' I sure did when I first started with him.''
	   They will play for the title against the world's No. 1 pair,
Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreria of Brazil, who beat Argentina's
Martin Conde and Esteban Martinez, 12-5, 12-10.
	   Kiraly, one of the sport's pioneers from San Clemente, Calif.,
and Johnson, from Laguna Beach, California, have won almost dlrs 4
million in prize money in their careers, and their experience
showed against twentysomethings Prosser, whose nickname is
``Thunder,'' and Zahner, who hails from the Queensland town of
Kangaroo Point.
	   In the first game, Kiraly, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and
Johnson ran off nine straight points for a 11-1 lead. In the second
game, Australia tied it 9-9 and 10-10 before Kiraly hit a pair of
kills on his serve to win the match.
	   ``He's just a machine,'' Zahner, 24, said of Kiraly. ``He
doesn't make many errors. He's almost boring to watch sometimes
because he just doesn't make many errors. He's the ultimate
volleyball player, ever. You just have to give him credit. He's a
fantastic athlete. I hope I'm like that at 37.''
	   Kiraly and Johnson led in every statistical category, including
digs (20-14) and blocks (7-3). Johnson also served the only four
aces in the match.

White Sox 6, Yankees 2

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Greg Norton and Magglio Ordonez each drove in
two runs and the Chicago White Sox stopped New York's four-game
winning streak with a 6-2 victory Saturday on Old-Timers Day at
Yankee Stadium.
	   A crowd of 55,638 that included Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio,
Whitey Ford and Phil Rizzuto saw the Yankees (72-26) fall two games
behind the record pace set by the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates through
98 games.
	   Former Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton, whose book ``Ball Four'' led
to an unofficial ban from Yankee Stadium, returned to the ballpark
for the first time since his playing days.
	   But Reggie Jackson was a no-show, reportedly having resigned his
advisory job with the Yankees a few days ago in the latest turn of
his running feud with owner George Steinbrenner.
	   The White Sox ended an eight-game losing streak at Yankee
Stadium.
	   Norton had an RBI single and Ordonez had a sacrifice fly in the
fifth inning to give the White Sox a 2-1 lead. They both
contributed RBI singles in a four-run seventh off Hideki Irabu
(9-4).
	   Mike Sirotka (10-9) allowed eight hits and two runs in six
innings. Bill Simas got four outs for his ninth save.
 &UR; Red Sox 5, Blue Jays 3
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra's two-run homer broke an
eighth-inning tie and gave the Boston Red Sox a victory over the
Toronto Blue Jays.
	   Mo Vaughn, who singled to tie it 3-all in the sixth, walked with
two outs in the eighth and Garciaparra followed with his 18th home
run of the season.
	   Derek Lowe (1-7) earned his first victory since June 23, 1997,
pitching one inning of perfect relief. Tom Gordon pitched the ninth
for his 28th save.
	   Woody Williams (9-5) allowed five runs on nine hits and three
walks.
 &UR; Mariners 4, Orioles 2
	   In Baltimore, Jeff Fassero put a clamp on Baltimore's torrid
offense and Joey Cora drove in two runs as the Seattle Mariners
ended the Orioles' five-game winning streak.
	   Baltimore reliever Jesse Orosco pitched in his 1,000th game,
becoming only one of six players in major league history to reach
that milestone. Orosco, 41, retired the Mariners in order in the
ninth inning.
	   Fassero (10-6) scattered 11 hits, striking out seven and walking
three over eight innings, against a team that had won 14 of 15 and
was averaging 7.6 runs in its last 10 games.
	   Mike Timlin pitched the ninth for his fifth save.
	   Edgar Martinez went 4-for-4 and scored twice to help the
Mariners snap the Orioles' 11-game home winning streak. Seattle has
won eight of 11 and is 10-5 since the All-Star break.
	   Scott Kamieniecki (2-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Indians 6, Tigers 5
	   In Cleveland, Manny Ramirez homered, doubled and drove in three
runs to help Bartolo Colon get his 11th victory as the Cleveland
Indians beat the Detroit Tigers.
	   Colon (11-5) lost his grip on the AL ERA lead, allowing four
earned runs and seven hits in six innings with four walks and four
strikeouts. The 22-year-old's ERA rose from 2.60 to 2.74. Boston's
Pedro Martinez now leads the league at 2.71.
	   Tony Clark was 4-for-5 with two doubles for Detroit. Seth
Greisinger (1-5) was the losing pitcher.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Trevor Hoffman tied the major league record by
converting his 41st straight save opportunity and Greg Vaughn hit
his 37th home runs as the San Diego Padres beat the Houston Astros.
	   Hoffman pitched a hitless ninth to match the mark of 41 in a row
set by San Francisco's Rod Beck from 1993-95. Hoffman, whose streak
began last year, has been successful on 33 straight chances this
season.
	   Vaughn homered for the seventh time in nine games. It was also
the 11th victory in 14 games for the West-leading Padres.
	   The victory before a sellout of 54,176 fans _ attracted by a
meeting of NL division leaders and a floppy hat giveaway _ improved
the Padres' record to 8-0 before crowds of 50,000 or more at
Qualcomm Stadium this season.
	   Mark Langston (4-3) was the winner. Shane Reynolds (12-6) had
won five straight decisions.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Cardinals 2
	   In Denver, Neifi Perez hit for the cycle, completing it with a
tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning that lifted the Colorado
Rockies over slumping Mark McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   Perez doubled in the first, tripled in the third, singled in the
fifth and capped it with his eighth homer of the year. His hitting
led the Rockies to their season-high fifth straight win.
	   Perez became the first player to hit for the cycle in the majors
since teammate Dante Bichette did it on June 10 against Texas. The
Rockies are the first team to have a pair of players hit for the
cycle in the same season since George Brett and Frank White did it
for the 1979 Kansas City Royals.
	   McGwire went 0-for-2 to extend his hitless streak to 15 at-bats.
He leads the majors with 43 home runs.
	   Chuck McElroy (4-2) got two outs in the seventh. Mike DeJean got
six outs for his first save. Matt Morris (1-1) took the loss.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Phillies 4
	   In Philadelphia, pinch-hitter Cliff Floyd doubled to cap a
two-run rally in the eighth inning and the Florida Marlins stopped
a seven-game losing streak with a win over the Philadelphia
Phillies.
	   The Marlins bounced back after the Phillies rallied for a pair
of 12-inning wins to sweep Friday's doubleheader.
	   Livan Hernandez (8-7) pitched seven innings for the win. Matt
Mantei got four outs for his fourth save.
	   Curt Schilling (10-10), who struck out 11, took a 4-3 lead into
the eighth, but gave up an RBI grounder to Mike Redmond. Floyd
doubled off Yorkis Perez.
 &UR; Reds 9, Giants 8
	   In San Francisco, Willie Greene hit a three-run homer and Bret
Boone added a two-run shot as the Cincinnati Reds rallied to defeat
San Francisco to end an eight-game losing streak.
	   Cincinnati overcame J.T. Snow's first-inning grand slam and Jeff
Kent's two-run homer in the ninth. Kent homered twice and drove in
seven runs Friday night in the Giants' 12-2 win over the Reds.
	   Kent homered off Gabe White in the ninth and pinch-hitter Barry
Bonds doubled with two outs. Danny Graves got his second save,
striking out Charlie Hayes.
	   Stan Belinda (4-6) pitched one inning for the victory. Russ
Ortiz (0-1) lost in second major league start.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Mets 2
	   In Chicago, pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill's two-run homer in the
eighth inning led the Chicago Cubs over New York, snapping the
Mets' six-game winning streak.
	   With one out in the Cubs eighth, Kevin Orie drew a walk that
finished Mets starter Masato Yoshii.
	   Hill swung away on a 3-0 pitch from John Franco (0-5) and hit it
over the center-field wall for his fifth career pinch-hit homer. It
was Hill's third lifetime home run off Franco.
	   Kevin Tapani (12-6) won his fourth straight decision. He gave up
seven hits and struck out seven in eight innings. Rod Beck pitched
the ninth for his 30th save.

Chang pulls out of Legg Mason; Agassi advances in semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Updates with other semifinal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Top-seed Michael Chang pulled out of his Legg
Mason Tennis Classic semifinal Saturday night after reinjuring his
left wrist.
	   Chang, the two-time Legg Mason defending champion, couldn't make
his match against 14th-seed Scott Draper of Australia because
tendonitis in his wrist flared up Saturday morning.
	   ``It felt a little stiff when I woke up. I went out and hit some
balls and it was just really bad. I had quite a bit of pain in my
left wrist,'' Chang said.
	   The injury ruined a potential final between Chang and
second-seeded Andre Agassi, who rolled over third-seeded Wayne
Ferreira of South Africa 6-1, 6-0 on Saturday.
	   Agassi will be looking for a record fourth Legg Mason title when
he faces Draper on Sunday in the finals of the dlrs 700,000
tournament.
	   Chang originally injured his wrist in a third-round victory over
Pete Sampras in the Italian Open on May 14.
	   The right-handed Chang said the wrist hurt on his two-handed
backhands.
	   Before injuring his wrist, Chang suffered a knee injury in March
that knocked him out of the top 10 for the first time since July
1993.
	   ``This year has been plagued with injuries,'' Chang said.
	   Chang planned to fly to Los Angeles, where a specialist will
examine the wrist.
	   Draper, who captured his first tour event last month at the
Queen's Club in London, wasn't celebrating. ``I'm not going to go
out and party because I'm in the final,'' he said.
	   Agassi earned his spot in the final by blowing past Ferreira in
43 minutes.
	   ``The score said more about the way he was playing than the way
I was playing,'' Agassi said.
	   Agassi has been playing his best tennis since he was the world's
top-ranked player in 1995.
	   ``I'm much stronger now mentally than I've ever been,'' he said.
``I don't even think in '95 I moved as well as I'm moving now.''
	   Agassi, 28, finished out of the top 100 last year for the first
time since turning pro in 1986.
	   His ranking sank as low as No. 141, but Agassi climbed back to
No. 18 with tour victories in San Jose and Scottsdale this year.
	   Draper, 24, has seen both sides of Agassi, losing to him in 1995
in Tokyo and defeating a struggling Agassi last year in Key
Biscayne, Florida.
	   Agassi's romp Saturday was no surprise since he is 7-0 lifetime
against Ferreira and has won 15 of the last 16 sets played.
	   ``Agassi played well, but I really didn't make it that hard for
him,'' Ferreira said. ``The points went quick. The games went
quick.''
	   Agassi hasn't had to work up much of a sweat this week. His four
victories have taken an average 62 minutes and he has been broken
just once in 34 service games.
	   ``If I go 62 minutes in the final, it's like I've done
something,'' Draper said with a chuckle.
	   The winner here in 1990-91 and 1995, Agassi said he didn't feel
sorry for the fans who paid to see such a short match Saturday.
	   ``They got their bagels,'' Agassi said, referring to a promotion
that promised the fans discount bagels if a 6-0 score was posted.

Philippine police use tear gas in raid to remove defiant chief

<TEXT>
	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of police used
tear gas before dawn Sunday in a raid on a Subic Bay Freeport
administrative building in an attempt to forcibly remove a
dismissed chairman of the industrial park.
	   Police fired tear gas and then broke windows on the second and
third floors to enter the headquarters building, which hundreds of
supporters of former freeport chairman Richard Gordon have
barricaded for nearly a month.
	   A former U.S. naval base, the Subic Bay complex has become an
industrial zone which has showcased economic growth in the
Philippines.
	   Police were able to take control of the second and third floors,
but as of dawn were not yet in control of the first floor, where
Gordon's office is located.
	   The ex-chairman's supporters refused to voluntarily leave the
area despite the tear gas. Some received minor injuries while being
taken away from the building, officials said.
	   Telephone lines to the building were cut and it was not
immediately possible to contact those inside.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada, who took office June 30,
fired Gordon and appointed long-time rival Felicito Payumo to take
his place. Payumo has been forced to set up a temporary office at
the local airport.
	   Gordon insists his tenure has not ended. He was reappointed to
the post by former President Fidel Ramos early this year.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appeared to come in retaliation for
efforts by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from making an
anti-bases movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.
	   Gordon won a restraining order against Payumo that lapsed last
week. A local court refused to extend the restraining order but did
not rule on whether Gordon's dismissal by Estrada was legal.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the lower court's decision
not to extend Gordon's stay meant that Estrada's order firing
Gordon and installing Payumo could be implemented immediately.
	   The local chamber of commerce has said companies in the
freeport, which include Federal Express and Acer, suffered losses
totaling dlrs 3.5 million on July 1, when Gordon's supporters
temporarily barricaded all the freeport gates.

Stockton, Wood lead as eagles fly at 18
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD ULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUTTON, Massachusetts (AP) _ On Saturday, the 18th hole gave
hope to golfers trying to get in position to win the CVS Charity
Classic. On Sunday, that same hole may take it away.
	   A very favorable pin placement that helped produce six eagles
among the top 16 players after the third round will change. On
Sunday, they'll have to shoot over a trap just in front of the
green to a cup on the right side.
	   ``You're not going to see that many short putts for an eagle,''
said Willie Wood, who shared the lead with Dave Stockton Jr. at
12-under-par 201. Wood, playing in the last twosome, caught up when
he sank a 27-foot (8-meter) eagle putt on the 578-yard (528- meter)
18th.
	   Stockton had an eagle and three birdies on the front side but
only eight pars on the back nine. Then he reached the 18th, where
he sank a one-foot putt for a birdie.
	   ``It was a good way to end,'' he said.
	   Stockton shot 66 and Wood 68 on the 7,110-yard (6,499-meter)
Pleasant Valley course. Steve Pate didn't eagle the 18th, but did
finish with three consecutive birdies for a 67 that left him a
stroke back at 202.
	   Tied at 203 were Olin Browne (65), Steve Flesch (67) and P.H.
Horgan III (67). Ten other players, including second-round leader
Mike Springer, were at 9-under 204.
	   Browne, who got his first career win three weeks ago in a
playoff at the Canon Greater Hartford Open, thinks that might help
him.
	   ``What I did in Hartford makes me have a little more
confidence,'' said Browne, who had nine birdies Saturday. ``I
played poorly here Thursday, I played better (Friday) and I played
better (Saturday) so I hope that trend continues.''
	   Wood also would like to pick up where he left off.
	   ``I turned a pretty average round into a good one with that
eagle,'' said Wood, who began the day one stroke off the lead.
	   The 18th hole, a slight dogleg to the left, has a large trap in
front of the right side of the green and smaller ones to the left
and rear of the green. Saturday's pin placement, on the front left,
gave players a clear shot without going over the sand.
	   ``We usually don't get very many pins that are looking straight
at you like that,'' said Flesch, who was just 5-under through 10
holes but had three birdies on the next seven holes before hitting
a 30-foot (9-meter) chip shot for an eagle at 18. ``On the back
side I decided to be more aggressive.''
	   There were 36 birdies, 32 pars and just three bogeys at No. 18
under excellent conditions _ sunny with a slight breeze.
	   Wood began the day tied for second with Paul Azinger and Fuzzy
Zoeller at 9-under, one stroke behind Springer. On Saturday,
Springer shot 72 and Azinger 71. They were among 10 players at 203.
Zoeller's 74 put him at 207.
	   Pate said the 18th hole ``has been pretty good to me this week''
with two birdies and an eagle. In fact, as he passed Stockton in
the interview tent, they figured they'd be in the final group
Sunday. Then Wood posted his eagle.
	   Stockton nearly did the same. He's trying to match his father's
accomplishment of winning the tournament at Pleasant Valley in
1971. The elder Stockton used to take his family with him to the
course.
	   ``I remember I was a little kid walking up the hill to see my
dad play,'' said Stockton, who played a bogey-free round. ``To win
(the tournament) with my dad's name on the trophy would be extra
special.''
	   He might even win the same day as his father, who was in
contention at the U.S. Senior Open.
	   Stockton's eagle Saturday at Pleasant Valley came at the
547-yard (500-meter) fourth hole, the only easier hole on the
course than the 18th. He sank a 15-foot (4.5-meter) putt and
followed with another 15-footer (4.5-meter) for a birdie at the
fifth.
	   ``The fourth really jump-started my round,'' he said.
	   He'll have plenty of competition as he seeks his first tour win.
There are 20 players within four strokes of the lead. The PGA Tour,
which began staging a tournament here in 1965, is not returning
next year. Instead, an LPGA event will be held.
	   ``Maybe the winner will get an exemption into the ladies'
tournament,'' Wood joked.
	   The final round ``is going to be a shootout,'' Stockton said.
``I'm going to have to play the way I did today because somebody's
going to come out of the pack.''
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  Joe Durant made two birdies and an eagle on the last three
holes and finished at par 71. He is 2-under for the tournament. ...
Of the 10 eagles Saturday, eight were at the 18th hole. ... Mike
Heinen, who shot 74 the first day, posted his second straight 65
and is tied for seventh at 9-under. ... Only 22 of the 79 players
are over par going into the last round.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed after a
fall at the Goodwill Games underwent a seven-hour operation
Saturday that might help her regain mobility.
	   Sang Lan, 17, was in critical but stable condition Saturday
afternoon after doctors fused two fractured and dislocated
vertebrae in her neck.
	   ``The operation was completed and successful,'' said Nassau
County Medical Center spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg. ``The doctors
accomplished what they wanted to accomplish.''
	   Doctors began operating on Sang about 8 a.m. No other details
were immediately available.
	   Chinese authorities on Sunday will hold a press conference,
where doctors will give details of the operation, said the
spokeswoman.
	   Sang's parents, Sang Shisheng and Chen Xiufeng, arrived Saturday
night at Kennedy Airport from their home in Ningbo, 740 miles
(1,190 kilometers) south of Beijing. They were escorted out a
private door at the airport, eluding waiting journalists.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, fell on her head
Tuesday night during a training routine, injuring the neck
vertebrae and leaving her unable to move her legs. It was unlikely
she would walk again, doctors had said before the surgery.
	   In addition to the surgery, Sang is being treated with an
experimental tissue-regenerating drug. Chinese authorities said
they also would perform acupuncture on Sang to stimulate her nerves
after the operation.
	   An outpouring of support for the injured gymnast flooded the
Long Island hospital this week.
	   Letters, cards and stuffed toys sent from people all over the
world covered Sang's small room in the pediatric intensive care
unit.
	   Former New York Jets defensive lineman Dennis Byrd, who in 1992
suffered career-ending injuries similar to Sang's but regained the
use of his legs, visited the gymnast Friday.
	   Sang also is being treated with SYGEN, an experimental drug that
helped Byrd.

Philippine Airlines reaches settlement with striking ground workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Striking ground personnel at
financially troubled Philippine Airlines agreed to return to work
Sunday after the company said it would reinstate 1,800 union
members laid off during an earlier strike by the airline's pilots.
	   The ground crew union agreed on the need for retrenchments to
save the airline, and both sides accepted guidelines on how it
should be done, officials said.
	   ``We are very pleased,'' PAL executive vice president Manolo
Aquino said. ``This demonstrates the union's support for the
airline's rehabilitation and it will ensure the success of the
rehabilitation plan.''
	   PAL had laid off 5,000 of its nearly 14,000 workers as part of a
massive retrenchment program triggered by the 22-day pilots' strike
last month.
	   All 1,800 returning workers will be members of the ground crew
union, union president Alex Barrientos said. They will also have
the option of early retirement with full benefits, he said.
	   Government labor officials said they have begun mediating with
PAL's third union, which represents flight attendants, about a
similar settlement.
	   The ground crew strike, which began last Wednesday, came as
foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
began arriving in Manila for an annual meeting. They are being
joined on Sunday by Cabinet officials from 10 other countries,
including the United States, Japan, China and Europe.
	   PAL branded the ground crew strike illegal because it was
prohibited by labor authorities who assumed jurisdiction over the
dispute on July 10, five says after the start of the pilots'
strike.
	   The pilots' walkout was a devastating blow to the already
deteriorating financial condition of the 57-year-old airline,
Asia's oldest.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.

<TEXT>
	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of police used
tear gas in a pre-dawn raid Sunday on a Subic Bay Freeport
administrative building and evicted holdout supporters of the
industrial park's former chairman.
	   The tear gas was fired before police broke windows on the second
and third floors to enter the headquarters building, which hundreds
of supporters of dismissed freeport chairman Richard Gordon had
barricaded for nearly a month.
	   Police took control of the building, but Gordon was not found
inside, officials said. Some of Gordon's backers received minor
injuries while being taken away from the building, they said.
	   A former U.S. naval base, the Subic Bay complex has become an
industrial zone which has showcased economic growth in the
Philippines.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada, who took office June 30,
fired Gordon and appointed long-time rival Felicito Payumo to take
his place. Payumo has been forced to set up a temporary office at
the local airport.
	   Gordon insists his tenure has not ended. He was reappointed to
the post by former President Fidel Ramos early this year.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appeared to come in retaliation for
efforts by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from making an
anti-bases movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.
	   Gordon won a restraining order against Payumo that lapsed last
week. A local court refused to extend the restraining order but did
not rule on whether Gordon's dismissal by Estrada was legal.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the lower court's decision
not to extend Gordon's stay meant that Estrada's order firing
Gordon and installing Payumo could be implemented immediately.
	   The local chamber of commerce has said companies in the
freeport, which include Federal Express and Acer, suffered losses
totaling dlrs 3.5 million on July 1, when Gordon's supporters
temporarily barricaded all the freeport gates.

Unions, telephone company reach agreement to end strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The telephone company and the
leaders of two striking unions have reached an agreement to end a
37-day-old walkout.
	   Both unions plan general assemblies for Tuesday to allow the
rank and file to vote on the tentative agreement.
	   The terms of the accord, reached Friday night, were not
revealed.
	   The unions went on strike June 18 to protest a government plan
to sell the state-owned telephone company to a consortium led by
GTE Corp. The stickers feared such a sale would result in
widespread layoffs. However, the sale has proceeded and lacks only
the approval of the Federal Communications Commission.
	   In addition to the strike by the telephone workers, a 48-hour
general strike was organized by a coalition of unions in early July
to protest the privatization plan.
	   Among the final sticking points overcome in nearly 18 hours of
negotiations over Thursday and Friday were the possibilities of
sanctions against the workers for striking and an illegal labor
practices complaint filed by the government against the two unions
with the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Board.

NEW DELHI: for herself.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Appachana's women are complicated _ at once generous and
jealous, loyal and gossipy, powerful and weepy. Her men, she
admits, have few redeeming qualities to offset their selfishness.
She says she never set out to write a balanced study of domestic
relations.
	   ``I'm sure there's a male point of view to all this, so let some
man write about it. He probably already has,'' she said. ``I wanted
to give legitimacy to women's stories, to show in the ordinary all
the pain and guilt and happiness and passion that is normally
assumed to exist only in extraordinary lives.''
	   Sohaila Abdulali's ``Madwoman of Jogare'' is a simpler tale,
told in an engagingly simple style. Abdulali set it in the village
in the Karjat valley of western India where she grew up. She wrote
in Karjat and in nearby Bombay, transferring longhand notes made in
her electricity-deprived village to her computer in the city.
	   Housing developers and family tragedies threaten her beloved
village, but the cycle of nature restores balance.
	   ``I started out writing about land, but it ended up being about
this woman's coming of age,'' Abdulali said. ``People are
interested in people.''
	   She writes of strong-minded men, and women who are their equals.
The wild dance of the madwoman of the title conjures up the monsoon
and all its blessings, year after year.
	   ``In the West, there's the impression that the Western woman is
liberated and the Indian woman is poor and oppressed,'' Abdulali
said. ``I think Indian women are the strongest.''
	   Out of India comes fresh writing on age-old themes _ relations
between men and women, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons; the
power of tradition versus the pull of new ideas. The range of
voices and sensibilities in even just four new novels gives a
glimpse of the country's diversity at a time as exciting for
writers as for readers.
	   ``It's really a vibrant time,'' concluded Desai.

	   A shelf of new novels offer a fresh glimpse of the vastness and
variety of India.
	   ---
	   From Indira Ganesan's ``Inheritance'', published by Alfred A.
Knopf:
	   ``Helen Koenig was a compact woman in her forties, with cropped
red hair, dressed in a chartreuse sweatsuit with an om symbol
painted on the front. She was leading the class through a series of
calisthenics to Muzak based on Leonard Cohen songs (who, it was
rumored, had a summer home on the island.)
	   ```Empty your mind and let the energy flow in,' she said as the
group began to sway. Then the group began to hum.
	   ```C'mon, people, don't hum, om,' said Helen Koenig. `Droning
doesn't get you anywhere. Break through your restraints.'
	   ``The group consisted of about 20 people, mostly foreigners with
a stray Indian or two. Soon, they lay down in a circle and began to
meditate. `No sleeping!,' Helen would cry at intervals, `Meditate!'
Finally, everyone got up and sang `With a Little Help from My
Friends.' Then they applauded and hugged one another.''
	   ---
	   From Kiran Desai's ``Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard'',
published by Faber and Faber:
	   ``Government service! People thought of afternoon siestas. Of
tea boys running up and down with glasses of steaming milky tea all
day long. They thought of free medicines at the dispensary and
pensions. Of ration cards and telephones. Of gas connections that
could be had so easily. They thought of how this was a country of
many festivals and holidays. Of how the government offices closed
for each one. They imagined a job where, even if your boss turned
out to be unpleasant, there were always plenty of people to shout
at, people who you could shout at even louder than your boss had
shouted at you. The sweeper or the messenger boy, for example. You
could say: `Where is your mind? Did it fall out on your way to
work?' Or: `Watch out or I'll give you a good kick that will send
you from Shahkot all the way into the Bay of Bengal.' What pleasure
there was to be had in a job like that! Really, it was a fine thing
to have a son in the government.''
	   ---
	   From Anjana Appachana's ``Listening Now,'' published by Random
House:
	   ``She learnt to hide her book under her sari, put Vikram with
his toys in the bedroom and shut herself inside. She began doing it
every day. She who had never craved solitude in all her life
discovered its pleasures among the toothbrushes, the mugs, the taps
and the buckets; solitude smelt of Phenyle and soap, solitude was
the sound of the dripping tap and the rustle of pages between her
fingers. For a long time Vikram didn't know, and perfunctorily he
would call, `Come out, Mummy, come out,' and she would reply,
`Coming, coming, I'll finish and come,' and he would murmur with
great comprehension, `You finish and then you will come,' and so it
went on for some weeks, quite amicably. There was quite a thrill in
it actually, this whole business of hiding the book and shutting
yourself in the bathroom; when the time came for it every day she
would feel her pulse beating faster, her tummy feeling queasy with
anticipation ... rather like having a quick, no-strings-attached
affair or eating chocolates on the sly, it kept your shoulders
above this daily business of living ....''
	   ---
	   From Sohaila Abdulali's ``The Madwoman of Jogare'', published by
HarperCollins India:
	   ``Beyond beauty, beyond mystery and promise. The day the monsoon
breaks in Maharashtra, when the blistered earth is finally cooled,
when light, color and scent go mad. First the heated stillness
becomes more so, until tendrils of hair cling to your scalp even
stickier than they have been all summer. The weight of the opaque
white sky is even more cruel, and you would gasp if you could. Then
the gold dust, the red dust, the teak trees with their young leaves
ready for this day, and the endless blank sky start to vibrate with
a force that works under your skin and makes you crazy for
something, for what? Evening draws close. Ribbons, boulders,
mountain ranges of cumulonimbus clouds surge over the mountains and
fill the sky. Achingly orange gulmohur flowers against a boiling
metallic grey sky; in that gap of bright and dark is all the hidden
power of light. Then it happens very fast and suddenly summer which
seemed endless now seems impossible.''

with the Japanese interpreter who took part in his brutal
interrogations.
	   Lomax and the man who participated in his torture sessions,
Takashi Nagase _ the man whose face and voice has haunted him for
half-a-century _ are now friends with the common cause of promoting
reconciliation among the veterans of both sides.
	   In atonement for his wartime activities Nagase, 80, of
Kurashiki, Japan, is currently making his 99th visit in 35 years to
the site of the ``Death Railway.'' The Japanese television network
NHK is making a documentary about the visit and Lomax is taking
part.
	   Nagase, a former officer in the kempetei _ military police _
said this past weekend that he had believed he would be hanged as a
war criminal for his role in interrogating Lomax and three other
prisoners.
	   During the torture, two British prisoners accused of having a
radio and a map were beaten to death and their bodies dumped head
first into a latrine.
	   Such was the horror of the gruelling ordeal that Lomax still has
nightmares and flashbacks about it.
	   ``I was worried Eric would have flashbacks here on the river
Kwai with all the Japanese (television film crew) around,'' his
wife Patti said. ``It's happened before. You see, there is no cure
for torture, and the nightmares are just part of the legacy Eric
carries with him.''
	   In 1942-43, 60,000 captured Allied soldiers, together with some
200,000 Asian slave laborers, were mobilized to construct a
415-kilometer (257-mile) railway linking Bangkok and Rangoon for
Japan's war effort.
	   More than 120,000 of them died of starvation, overwork, beatings
and disease.
	   The railway took 17 months to complete. In Feb. 1945 British and
U.S. bombers destroyed its bridge across the River Kwai.
	   The prisoners' ordeal was portrayed by Pierre Boulle's book
``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and the Academy Award-winning
movie of the same name.
	   Both Lomax, 80, of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and Nagase have also
written books about the road to reconciliation which led to their
first meeting in 1995.
	   During their time together for the NHK documentary they visited
the bridge, as well as Hellfire Pass, a stretch of the rail line
where torturous working conditions and malaria claimed a
disproportionate number of lives.
	   Lomax also visited the mobile clinic charity project that Nagase
established to provide free medical treatment for poor Thai
villagers.
	   They also opened another project to house the elderly. Taking
part was the son of Pichai Montri, who during the Japanese
occupation was the local police chief and a secret leader of the
Thai resistance movement, which tried to aid the prisoners.
	   ``Every trip I make to the River Kwai is therapy to help me live
in peace with myself,'' said Lomax. ``Meeting Nagase, the man I
wanted to kill because he tortured me with his voice in so many
nightmares, has enabled me to free myself from the hate and the
horror of the Death Railway,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   ``For Eric Lomax to forgive me for what I did to him means I can
go to the grave with a clear conscience,'' said Nagase.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Mia Hamm scored three goals as the
U.S. women's soccer team beat Denmark 5-0 on Saturday night in the
Goodwill Games to extend its domestic winning streak to 37 games.
	   In the other semifinal, China beat defending World Cup champion
Norway 4-2 in a shootout after a 1-1 tie. The championship game is
Monday night.
	   Hamm scored her 95th international goal in the 75th minute off
an assist from Christie Pearce. Hamm faked a defender from 12 yards
out and shot into an open net for her ninth career hat trick and
third this year.
	   Hamm scored five minutes earlier from 20 yards (18 meters) out.
Her first goal came in the final seconds before the half on an
assist from Kristine Lilly to make it 3-0. Hamm's shot from 12
yards (10 meters) out on the right side deflected off Denmark
goalie Christina Jensen into the upper left corner of the net.
	   Tiffeny Milbrett opened the scoring in the 18th minute with a
10-yard (9-meter) shot in front of the goal on a pass from Hamm.
Hamm shook off two defenders with the pass to a wide-open Milbrett.
	   Michelle Akers got her 97th international goal in the 29th
minute on a 35-yard (32-meter) blast into the left corner.
	   The U.S. team outshot Denmark 14-5. U.S. goalie Briana Scurry
got her eighth shutout in her last 13 starts.
	   The U.S. team, which beat China 2-1 for the gold in the 1996
Olympics, will meet the Chinese for the third time this year. The
teams played to a scoreless tie in January, and Hamm had three
goals in the United States' 4-1 victory in March.

Big band swing makes a comeback in the United States

	   POMPANO BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Pompadours, zoot suits and
crinoline skirts are all the rage, while bands with bizarre names
like the Cherry Poppin' Daddies and the Squirrel Nut Zippers make
you grab a partner and boogie down.
	   As retro movements go, swing dancing is huge.
	   The high-energy jitterbug style first tweaked interest in 1993
when Disney released ``Swing Kids,'' about German youth in the
1930s whose love of American swing made them targets of the Nazis.
The 1996 movie ``Swingers,'' about single life in Los Angeles,
furthered swing's popularity.
	   It became an official phenomenon with The Gap's recent U.S. TV
ad featuring young couples doing a raucous Lindy Hop to Louis
Prima's ``Jump Jive an' Wail.''
	   Big band swing is embraced by all ages, especially _ and most
surprisingly _ by under-30s. Swing kids don't see much romanticism
in a mosh pit.
	   ``Dancing with a partner was such a thing of the past. With
this, you can just go up to anybody. There's no obligation. There's
no pressure. It's like, `Hey, let's just dance,''' said Craig
Lozowick, 25, decked out in pinstripe suit, skinny tie,
slicked-back hair and sideburns.
	   ``Everyone in our generation danced separately until this. It
has so much energy,'' said his dancing partner, Stacy Wyllys,
looking elegant in old-style glasses and a 1940s pink dress bought
at a vintage clothing shop.
	   Soon the duo, moving in triple time, is on the dance floor at
Man Ray's, a South Florida club learning like many other places
that swing pays. Nearly 300 people were dancing on a recent night.
	   Swing is everywhere, from The Masquerade in Atlanta to The
Spanish Ballroom in Washington, D.C., where the 16-piece Tom
Cunningham Orchestra performs. It's at The Supper Club in New York
City, The Derby in Los Angeles, and Cafe du Nord in San Francisco.
	   The West Coast neo-swing movement can be traced to bands like
Royal Crown Revue, which started mixing in swing with its
punk-influenced ska nearly a decade ago. Former rocker Brian Setzer
of the now-defunct Stray Cats is a current swing guitarist who got
his roots in rockabilly.
	   ``What a lot of the swing people are playing right now is jump
blues, like Louis Prima or Louis Jordan,'' said Steve Perry, lead
singer of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. ``Real swing is more like
Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller.
That's what we play.''
	   And, of course, MTV motored the trend when the network put the
Cherry Poppin' Daddies' ``Zoot Suit Riot'' in the rotation and the
song became an alternative hit.
	   ``The zoot suiters were considered the punk rockers of their age
because they were very outrageously dressed,'' said Perry, whose
band came out of the grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest.
	   The eight-piece band isn't the only one making the scene.
There's the jump sound of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the Western bent of
Big Sandy and his Fly-rite Boys or the Dixieland stylings of
Squirrel Nut Zippers, who really scored the first neo-swing hit
with ``Hell.''
	   Many of the big-horn bands dress in natty 1940s attire. Songs
about gambling and alcohol, like the Voodoo Daddy's ``You and Me
and Bottle Makes 3,'' feeds into that day-after-prohibition-ended
feeling of the music.
	   Then there's the dancing.
	   Swing is mainly an American invention, evolving out of ragtime
and jazz dancing in the 1930s and '40s. Unlike a tango or a waltz,
swing is more improvisational and comes in many styles: jive,
jitterbug, Lindy, push, whip, shag, East Coast swing, West Coast
swing, imperial, Jamaican and Bop.
	   ``When soldiers from World War II came with the Service to the
major port cities of New York and Chicago, they would see swing and
take it back home to Oklahoma, Carolina, Los Angeles and it would
mutate,'' said Randy Atlas, president of the South Florida Swing
Dance Association.
	   That's why in California there's West Coast swing. In Texas it's
called push and in the Carolinas it's shag. Each is a slightly
different take on swing, kind of like a regional accent.
	   The 1990s resurgence of swing is grounded in the '30s music of
Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller, and the jump swing of artists like
Louis Prima.
	   ``The Lindy Hop or the jitterbug, that's what the swing kids are
doing now,'' Atlas said.
	   Modern swing bands play all types of old-time swing, but swing
dancing can be done to all types of music _ from '70s disco (the
Hustle was a form of swing) to Sheryl Crow.
	   ``When the dancers hear music in shuffle time, that's 110 to 125
per minute, they are just as happy as hogs in mud,'' Atlas said.
	   Many new converts say they became interested in swing after the
movie ``Swingers,'' in which a guy finally meets a girl thanks to
knowing how to dance to the house band, which happens to be Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy.
	   The Gap ad also piqued interest.
	   ``We've gotten an overwhelming response. We've received phone
calls, letters and e-mails from people saying they were going to go
out and take some swing lessons,'' Gap spokeswoman Rebecca Weill
said from the company's San Francisco headquarters.
	   The ad brought Brian Tindell and Daminica Landimarino to Man
Ray's.
	   She couldn't get over the swing fashion. ``Next week I'm
bringing my skirt. Forget these pants. Wearing skirts and dresses,
you just feel free,'' the 31-year-old nurse said.
	   Tindell, an engineer, said swing is helping him finally
understand his folks.
	   ``This is the first time I understand what my dad was trying to
do when he gets on the dance floor at a wedding reception,'' he
said. ``I've got to bring the parents here. I think they would get
a blast out of this.''

	   Thumbnail sketches of some modern neo-swing bands:
	   _ Cherry Poppin' Daddies: Lead singer Steve Perry says his
eight-piece band's sound goes back to the Glenn Miller-Benny
Goodman era, but he insists on updating the music. The band has
scored the biggest swing hit to date with ``Zoot Suit Riot,'' but
other tunes like ``Ding-Dong Daddy of the D-Car Line'' and ``Here
Comes the Snake'' show this band is on the forefront of the
movement.
	   _ Big Bad Voodoo Daddy: This eight-piece band became the
ambassadors of the new swing with its cameo in the movie
``Swingers.'' Jump blues, with a catchier, more progressive beat,
is popular with songs like ``You and Me and Bottle Makes 3.'' The
band also covers Cab Calloway's ``Minnie the Moocher.''
	   _ Squirrel Nut Zippers: This strangely named band is credited
with opening the door for the new swing on the airwaves with the
1996 hit ``Hell.'' The song is a bit more bossa nova than swing,
but the Zippers sport a variety of sounds and are more
Dixieland-grounded than their contemporaries.
	   _ Dem Brooklyn Bums Big Band: These boys from Long Island are
more camp than anything else with songs like ``Boozin' and a
Cruzin''' and ``Baseball Bat Boogie.'' They are shamelessly
nostalgic, sampling sound bites from such old movies as ``On the
Waterfront'' of 1954.
	   _ Big Sandy and his Fly-Rite Boys: Western swing is popular with
this sextet. Rooted in rockabilly, the California band recalls the
Texas heyday and Buddy Holly and Hank Williams at the Grand Ole
Opry. The band shies away from gangster threads, opting to dress
with a country-western flair.
	   _ The Brian Setzer Orchestra: Guitarist Setzer was the prime
proponent of the 1980s rockabilly movement as leader of the Stray
Cats. He was also a member of the short-lived Honeydrippers band.
His upcoming release, ``The Dirty Boogie,'' is full-fledged swing
with a remake of Louis Prima's ``Jump, Jive an' Wail'' and his own
crowd pleaser, ''Rock This Town.''

Cambodians swarm into polling stations, hope election will bring

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hoping for a fresh start toward
peace and stability, Cambodians swarmed polling stations around the
country Sunday to vote for new leadership and put an end to
festering tension following a bloody power struggle last year.
	   Foreign election observers predicted a high turnout and said the
result could prove to be a surprise for strongman Hun Sen, widely
accused of murdering opponents and intimidating voters to ensure he
wins the country's first election since U.N.-organized polls in
1993.
	   Phnom Penh, the capital, was calm early Sunday. But in the
remote northern jungles, the army was on high alert to prevent
die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas from preventing the
thousands of ex-comrades who have made peace in recent years from
voting for the first time in their lives.
	   Voting at his residence, known as the ``Tiger's Lair,'' Hun Sen
kissed his ballot before putting it in the box. The 47-year-old
leader of the Cambodian People's Party looked fresh and healthy
following an emergency appendectomy July 17.
	   The main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
by Hun Sen as co-prime minister last year in fighting that
devastated parts of Phnom Penh, and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy
were to cast ballots in the central province of Kompong Cham.
	   Millions of their countrymen sought shade from a blazing morning
sun. Some had lined up since daybreak at the 11,600 polling
stations, patiently waiting to cast ballots for 122 National
Assembly seats, from which a new government will be formed.
	   One of the first to vote was Chan Somphon, 51, a farmer who has
been living at a Buddhist pagoda in Phnom Penh since a land-mine
tore off his left leg several years ago. One in every 300
Cambodians has been killed or maimed by the millions of mines lain
in three decades of civil war.
	   Leaning on a crude wooden crutch, Chan Somphon chose from the 39
parties contesting the elections, dropped his ballot into a locked
metal box and had his finger dipped in indelible purple ink, a
precaution to prevent anyone from voting twice.
	   ``I want peace for Cambodia,'' said Chan Somphon who, like most
voters, refused to say which party he favored. ``No more war. I
want peace everywhere. If the vote is honest, we will have peace.''
	   In another Phnom Penh neighborhood, hundreds of people waited in
seven lines snaking through a schoolyard as the process slowly got
underway. The relatively affluent dressed in their best clothes;
the poor shielded their heads from the sun with traditional
checkered scarves.
	   One mother and child arrived in a cyclo-pousse, a hybrid between
a rickshaw and a bicycle, and brought food and water in case the
wait was long. It looked like it would be. The opposition expressed
fear Hun Sen's supporters would arrive early and drag out the
process, keeping opponents from voting before polls closed at 4
p.m. (1000 GMT).
	   Glenys Kinnock, special representative of the European Union
observing the elections, said the enthusiasm to vote could foretell
a high turnout among the 5.4 million registered voters, about 95
percent of those eligible to vote, and might signal trouble for Hun
Sen, who was also favored to win in 1993 but lost.
	   ``I feel the Cambodian people may well surprise everyone
today,'' Kinnock said. `` They're very courageous people.''
	   Despite 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers dispatched in the 1993 vote,
the most democratic in Cambodian history, Hun Sen thwarted the
result and forced the winner, Ranariddh and his royalist FUNCINPEC
party, to share power with him or face civil war.
	   The elections ultimately fell short of ushering a new era of
peace and democracy after years of civil war and the Khmer Rouge
genocide of the late 1970s, which caused the deaths of as many as 2
million people.
	   Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the harsh post-Khmer
Rouge military occupation by Vietnam, shattered the tense coalition
a year ago, ousting the prince in two days of fighting in the
capital with tanks, mortars and rockets.
	   The prince has been allowed to return as Hun Sen strives to win
back international legitimacy and aid. But Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
are both popular, and Kinnock predicted there would be no clear
winner and that coalition negotiations were probably already under
way.
	   The violent campaign and Hun Sen's control of the electoral
machinery has already led the corps of international observers,
dominated by the E.U., to downgrade hopes the result will be ``free
and fair'' to the less rigorous ``broadly representative.''
	   Preliminary results will be announced late Monday.

Political protest disrupts Iran-U.S. Wrestling.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Exile groups protesting the militant Islamic
government in Tehran interrupted Saturday night's Goodwill Games
wrestling match between the United States and Iran.
	   After Behnam Taiebi scored a 5-0 shutout against American Sam
Henson, Tony Purler of the United States entered the ring for his
bout against Mohammad Talaie. But Talaie did not appear and the
Iranians refused to wrestle because of protesting fans in the
stands.
	   After 20 minutes, Talaie entered the ring waving an Iranian flag
and the match continued.
	   Hundreds of Iranian fans were wearing T-shirts bearing the name
and picture of Maryam Rajavi, head of the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, and appeared to be the center of the dispute.
	   When the match resumed, a dozen security guards flooded the area
of the fans, and large banners bearing the portrait of Rajavi
appeared to have been removed. At least one fan with a Rajavi
T-shirt was shown on TV being taken from the hall by city police.
	   ``A group of fans was protesting politically in the stands. The
Iranian team leader took offense and left with his team,'' said
Larry Sciacchetano, president of USA Wrestling. ``What they asked
us to to do was to clear the protesters from the arena. We had a
hard time convincing them that this is a free society.''
	   John Smith, coach of the American team, said something was said
to one of the Iranian wrestlers on the floor that triggered the
protest.
	   ``They disagree with the politics going on in Iran,'' he said.
``This is not the place. This is a sporting event. It should be
about sports.''
	   Many in the capacity crowd of 5,400 at the Theater at Madison
Square Garden waved small green-white-and-red Iranian flags.
American fans favored a raucus ``USA-USA-USA'' chant.
	   As they were introduced, the wrestlers shook hands, with the
Americans handing the Iranians small coins. It was as if old
friends were greeting each other; in fact, these wrestlers know
each other from previous international meets, most recently the
World Cup in April in Stillwater, Oklahoma.
	   A block away from the Garden, Moslem E. Filabi sat in a hotel
lobby, unable to watch his country's team, afraid of the stir his
presence in the arena might create.
	   For 10 years, from 1966-76, Filabi wrestled on the Iranian
national team. He appeared in three Olympics for his country, won
17 gold, silver and bronze medals in international competitions and
was honored as a national hero. He left Iran in 1982, three years
after the revolution.
	   ``Getting out was not a problem,'' he said. ``Inside was a
problem.''
	   Filabi believes that remains the case, that his homeland is
being pillaged by the current regime and that the wrestling team is
being used in an effort to repair his nation's image.
	   ``Once, Iran was a rich country,'' he said. ``Now it is a poor
country.''
	   Filabi is a member of the National Council of Resistance of Iran
which seeks the overthrow of the current government, which he says
is repressive domestically and sponsors terrorism internationally.
	   And, he said, the regime is using the wrestlers for no purpose
other than to improve its image.
	   ``They are playing politics,'' he said. ``They say they are here
for sports. They are here to cover up what is going on in my
country, the people who are executed, the ones who are jailed. If
they are here for sports, why weren't they here five years ago or
10 years ago?''
	   The Goodwill Games match was the second recent sports meeting
between the countries. Iran defeated the United States 2-1 in World
Cup soccer in Lyon, France, last month, setting off huge
celebratiobns nin the streets of Tehran.
	   The Iranian wrestlers have been careful to avoid political
topics on this trip and when an American team traveled to Tehran in
February, the wrestlers were welcomed warmly by the people. Iranian
wrestlers who traveled to a World Cup meet in Oklahoma last spring,
however, complained of being photographed and fingerprinted by
immigration officials when they entered the United States.

	   TREMONTON, Utah (AP) _ Five went to war, four returned in
coffins. Mercifully, the military discharged the surviving brother
and sent him home to his grieving parents.
	   This may sound like the script of the new Steven Spielberg
movie, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' but in this case the story is not
fiction. And this real-life family continued to pay a heavy price
long after war's end.
	   In the film, opening Friday, Pvt. James Ryan is the fourth
sibling in a family that has lost three sons in World War II. The
plot revolves around efforts to remove Ryan from harm's way and
return him to his family.
	   Boyd Borgstrom's true story was eerily parallel to Ryan's. It
has become patriotic lore in this tiny farming and ranching town on
the Utah-Idaho border. But how could anyone in far-off Hollywood
have known?
	   They did not, according to Spielberg's DreamWorks studio, which
made the movie.
	   Still, a co-producer of the film isn't surprised by the
inquiries.
	   ``What I think is going to happen is that the Borgstroms are
among the first in a long line of people who will contact us and
say, `Hey, we had two sons die,' or `We had three sons die,''' said
co-producer Bonnie Curtis. ``The same thing happened with
`Schindler's List.' After the movie, thousands of Holocaust
survivors came to us to tell us these fascinating stories.''
	   The movie's plot more closely resembles the account of a
real-life family named Niland, from Tonawanda, New York, than it
does the Borgstroms' story, Curtis says.
	   World War II historian Stephen Ambrose popularized the story of
the four Niland brothers. Two died on D-Day, another was taken
prisoner in Burma, and the surviving brother was ordered to go
home. Ambrose is a consultant for ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   ``I know what my family went through and my heart goes out to
them,'' Pete Niland said, speaking of the Borgstroms. Niland's
father, Edward, spent 14 months in a Japanese prison camp before
escaping and returning home. Edward Niland died in 1984.
	   Hollywood has previously looked at the loss of brothers in war.
The 1944 film, ``The Sullivans,'' told the story of five brothers
from Waterloo, Iowa, who died when their U.S. Navy ship was sunk by
a Japanese submarine two years earlier.
	   Members of the Borgstrom family cannot imagine their tragedy
happening to others as well.
	   ``It wrecked our family ... . It's always in your mind,'' said
Wilma Hawkes, Boyd's 78-year-old sister and the last of 10 siblings
still alive.
	   While Spielberg's battle scenes of D-Day have been described as
shockingly realistic, no film can depict the trauma a family goes
through when it pays the ultimate price for its country at war.
	   ``People don't know the devastation it can do,'' even affecting
succeeding generations, said Sheila Borgstrom, Boyd's daughter.
``His escape was to drink, and it was hurting the family and we
missed out on a lot because of it.''
	   Boyd Borgstrom was at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in October
1944 when the Marines ordered him home to the family farm in
Thatcher. He was 23 and had been stationed on Johnston Island in
the Pacific, but experienced no combat.
	   In March of that year, a telegram reached the Borgstrom home:
his 28-year-old brother Clyde, also a Marine, had died March 15 at
Guadalcanal, where a tree fell on him while he was clearing debris.
	   In June, another telegram arrived: Roy, 30, an Army medic, had
been shot and killed in Italy while carrying a wounded comrade to
safety.
	   Less than two months after that, 19-year-old Rolon died of
wounds suffered in an Army Air Force bombing raid over Germany. His
twin, Rulon, was among Army troops storming France on D-Day, June
6, 1944, and was reported missing two months later. The headstone
in the cemetery here says he died Aug. 22 in battle at LaDreff,
France.
	   When word of Rulon's fate arrived at the local Western Union
office, the agent refused to deliver the cable, not wanting to see
Mrs. Borgstrom faint in grief again, Mrs. Hawkes recalled. He told
the Mormon bishop he wouldn't go there anymore, she said. Niland
remembered a similar story in his family.
	   President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a letter of condolence,
telling Alben and Gunda Borgstrom that the loss of their sons
``increased the determination of all of us to bring this war to an
early and successful conclusion.''
	   As Boyd Borgstrom awaited his discharge at Camp Lejeune, he told
The Associated Press in 1944 that there was not much to say about
his brothers' deaths. ``Nothing I can say will bring them back,''
he said.
	   When the bodies finally came home, Life magazine reported the
story with photos of the bereaved parents sitting in separate rooms
of their home staring at the floor, and of four flag-draped caskets
at the funeral in the Garland Mormon Tabernacle, where funeral
services were held.
	   ``We used to sit in the evenings and he would talk about his
brothers and how hurt he was,'' Boyd's widow, Melva Borgstrom,
said. ``When you lose four brothers what is there to come home
to?''
	   Besides sorrow, Boyd felt guilt and other emotions because of
his brothers' deaths, and he dealt with these feelings by drinking,
she said.
	   ``He was very depressed,'' she said, crying as she spoke. ``And
after 17 years, I couldn't take it anymore and it was either the
drinking or the family.'' Finally they divorced.
	   They remarried 12 years later, in 1974. A year after that, Boyd
died of a heart attack at age 53, but Melva and their five children
fondly recall the brief second marriage period, describing it as
``heaven.''
	   Will the Borgstroms see ``Saving Private Ryan?''
	   Yes. DreamWorks invited Melva and several relatives to a
veterans' screening in southern California.

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The 9-to-5 songwriters who crank out
formula songs that make up much of what country fans hear on radio
these days should listen hard to Vince Gill's new album.
	   The norm for many country songwriters is catchy, well-crafted
songs that fail to connect on an emotional level. Gill digs a lot
deeper.
	   In songs like ``There's Not Much Love Here Anymore'' from his
new album, ``The Key,'' he approaches country legend Hank Williams
Sr. in expressing the depths of love gone wrong. Williams' frequent
muse was his up-and-down (more often down) relationship with wife
Audrey Williams, which resulted in classics like ``Take These
Chains From My Heart'' and ``Long Gone Lonesome Blues.''
	   Songs on ``The Key'' have the same feeling of legitimacy. It's
hard to imagine a more inspiring mainstream country music album
coming out in 1998, even with the Christmas superstar releases
still ahead.
	   The singer-songwriter from Oklahoma obviously had two topics on
his mind when he wrote ``The Key'': divorce and the death last year
of his father.
	   ``I never hurt this bad before,'' Gill sings on ``There's Not
Much Love Here Anymore,'' a ballad about a crumbling marriage. And
you really don't have to know or care about Gill's divorce from
singer Janis Gill to appreciate the song.
	   Gill won't discuss the specifics of his divorce or how his new
songs relate to it.
	   ``I've never said a word, and I won't,'' he says. ``I think it's
disrespectful not only to myself, but to everybody else involved.''
	   But he does say that he took a nine-month break from touring to
deal with his personal life and write new songs. In the past, he
has come up with classics like ``Go Rest High on That Mountain,'' a
song he wrote when his brother died, and ``I Still Believe in You''
about his struggling marriage.
	   ``The Key'' isn't perfect, though. At its worst, with ``I'll
Take Texas,'' it adds one more disposable Texas-is-great song to
the world.
	   But the album is frank and powerful, thanks in part to lyrics
that at times are as confessional as James Taylor's. For example,
on ``Let Her In,'' a father pleads with his daughter to accept the
new woman in his life _ the Gills have a teen-age daughter, Jenny.
	   Musically, it is Gill's most traditional country album, arriving
after the foray into New Orleans funk on his last album, ``High
Lonesome Sound.'' Several top female country artists sing on ``The
Key,'' including Dawn Sears, Sara Evans, Lee Ann Womack, Shelby
Lynne, Patty Loveless, Faith Hill and Alison Krauss.
	   ``More than anything, I miss it,'' Gill says of the traditional
country sound. ``I really miss singing it and I miss playing it.
And I lost my father and I thought, `Man, think back to those songs
that you learned from him and the records that you used to listen
to ... .
	   ``It's not necessarily what I think is country music today. It's
definitely not what is the top 40 records of country radio, you
know?''
	   The first single, ``If You Ever Have Forever in Mind,'' is a
re-creation of the 1960s Nashville Sound. Gill croons while strings
flutter in the background and backup singers ``oooh'' and ``ahhh.''
The record was inspired by the country music remakes on the classic
1962 album, ``Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music,'' by Ray
Charles.
	   ``The Key to Life,'' the last song on the album, is a tribute to
Gill's father Stan, who died in July 1997.
	   ``That one is really sweet for me, because it really is the
truth,'' Gill says.
	   ``The Key to Life'' tells how Gill's life as a musician was
inspired by his father, a federal judge and amateur banjo picker.
	   Gill, 41, born in Norman, Oklahoma, began playing bluegrass
music to emulate his father. He broke into the pop charts as lead
singer for Pure Prairie League in the early 1980s.
	   RCA Records signed him as a country artist in 1983, and for a
decade he struggled. He was better known as the husband of Janis
Gill, a singer with the then-hot country music duo Sweethearts of
the Rodeo. He wrote a song about it, ``Everybody's Sweetheart.''
	   Gill broke through on his first album for MCA in 1990, ``When I
Call Your Name.'' In recent years, he has been a consistent
million-seller and award-winner.
	   And he has handled stardom with unusual grace, preferring to let
the songs do the talking.
	   ``I made it from the joints to the Opry stage,'' he sings in
``The Key to Life.''
	   ``And he didn't care that everybody knew my name. He said it's
all for nothin' if you don't stay the same.''

	   LEOMINSTER, Massachusetts (AP) _ He's big, he's pink, and he
stands on a wooden leg.
	   Meet the Realmingo!
	   Just when you thought there were enough pink lawn ornaments in
your neighborhood, Don Featherstone, father of the original plastic
pink flamingo, is reaching into the millennium with a life-size and
more lifelike companion to his 41-year-old classic.
	   ``We've lived on our glory all these years,'' the affable
Featherstone says with a smile. ``It's time for something new.''
	   Featherstone, president of Union Products Inc., of Leominster,
unveils the Realmingo this weekend at the International Lawn,
Garden, and Power Equipment Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky.
	   It joins Snomingo, introduced in 1996, as the only real
deviations in four decades. However, there are special runs of
black flamingos, for divorce parties; and blue flamingos, for a
neighborhood that had banned pink plastic yard art.
	   At 30 inches (75 centimeters) from beak to tail, the bird will
be twice the size of the original and will stand on a single wooden
leg with the other leg in plastic and tucked up under the body. The
black marker eyes will be replaced by plastic eye inserts.
	   ``This is a more realistic, more detailed, more upscale
flamingo,'' Featherstone adds.
	   The suggested price is more upscale, too: dlrs 19.95 per bird.
The original pink flamingo is sold in pairs for around dlrs 10.
	   Featherstone was a young art school graduate in 1957 when he
went to work at Union Products. ``I thought, 'Hey, nine years of
art training and I'm going to design a new fly swatter,''' he
recalls with a laugh.
	   With competition from China where two-dimensional plastic art
could be produced at a lower cost, Featherstone was given the task
of taking Union Products into the three-dimensional era of yard
art.
	   He designed six 3-D pieces: dog, fire hydrant, mushroom, helmet
planter, duck and flamingo.
	   A swan planter introduced later became the company's best
seller, but the original pink flamingo developed a cult following.
	   Featherstone and two other longtime employees bought the company
in 1996, and he continues to create designs. The line now includes
more than 200 plastic yard art oddities, from Halloween griffins to
14 renderings of Santa Claus.
	   Lilian Polermo,74, has worked at the company since the early
days of the pink flamingo. ``When you work with them all the time,
you think, they're kinda homely,'' she says as she spray-paints the
beaks. ``But when you see them out in someone's yard, they look
nice. They're kinda sporty.''
	   Featherstone is the first to call his creations ``tacky,'' but
he loves them just the same.
	   ``The flamingo has brought a lot of joy to a lot of people,'' he
says. ``At least I made something that was fun.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Yosi Piamenta is a matchmaker with an electric
guitar, marrying Woodstock to the Wailing Wall.
	   Don't call him the ``Hasidic Hendrix,'' as the Village Voice
once did. It's an honor to be compared to Jimi Hendrix, he recently
told adoring fans at the nightclub Tramps, but he'd rather be
called Yosi Piamenta.
	   Still, there's something about the Brooklyn rocker that
encourages nicknames.
	   ``The rabbi rocks. We call him the 'gefilte Garcia','' Sound
engineer Rob Childs says. ``I wish I had somebody like him when I
was in church.''
	   Piamenta, an Israeli discovered in Tel Aviv by jazzman Stan
Getz, does resemble the Grateful Dead's late guitarist, Jerry
Garcia. He's an Orthodox Jew, but not actually a rabbi. And he's
not Hasidic.
	   For the 22 years he's been in New York, Piamenta's mainly been a
headliner at Jewish weddings. Now, at 46, he's making the crossover
from what some music writers have called Hasid rock to a
hard-driving rock 'n' roll that could win him new listeners.
	   ``Being original is a goal,'' says Piamenta, who has a graying
Brillo-pad orgy of a beard, and wire-rimmed glasses. He wears a
multicolored yarmulke and at his waist hang the traditional fringes
worn by Orthodox men.
	   Expanding his audience beyond Orthodox Jews is another goal for
the man recently crowned ``the greatest ultra-Orthodox rock
guitarist in the world'' by the Jewish Forward newspaper.
	   A father of six, Piamenta not only rocks but plays klezmer,
blues, jazz and fusion.
	   He grew up in a secular home and learned guitar from the radio.
Even today he doesn't read music.
	   ``I grew up on Jimi Hendrix. I grew up on Oriental music. I grew
up on Arabic music from the Bedouin village,'' Piamenta says.
	   ``Hendrix is for me the classiest guitar player in this century.
... If you were not influenced by him, then you're influenced by
people who were influenced by him.''
	   Other influences? Piamenta tosses in Led Zeppelin, The Beatles,
Weather Report and B.B. King.
	   His career leaped beyond his homeland when Getz visited Israel
in 1976 and Piamenta managed to woo him into his home. Since Getz
had only one free night, he wasn't eager to meet strangers. But
Piamenta called his hotel and promised the saxophonist the party of
his life. So Getz went. Yosi played his guitar, brother Avi his
flute.
	   ``After six or seven of my own tunes, Stan Getz asked me to
record with him,'' says Piamenta, raising his arms and almost
lifting his round frame from a black leather sofa. ``I told him
that would be the peak and goal of my dreams.''
	   On Piamenta's 25th birthday, in 1976, he arrived in New York as
a guest of Getz. They cut an album, but it was never released
because of technical and artistic problems.
	   ``My first half year in America was from the top of the American
dream,'' Piamenta says, his eyes lighting like sparklers. ``To an
anonymous poor musician in Israel, this was like in the fairy
tales.''
	   There were sold-out concerts. Along the way, Getz introduced him
to Buddy Rich, Carlos Santana and others. Then Piamenta returned to
Israel in 1977 on tour with Getz.
	   The next year, he came back to New York, toured with Getz and at
the end of the tour Piamenta turned to Orthodoxy. The decadence of
life as a road musician pushed him toward a religious life, he
says.
	   In music, too. He made himself the Guy Lombardo of Jewish
weddings, and recorded five albums of Jewish tunes, some 500 years
old.
	   But always, the rock was rolling around Piamenta's soul.
	   ``The music that gets me closer to God is the best music. If
there's music that calls for hate, that's not the music for God,''
Piamenta says. ``Music that melts the heart is good music.''
	   Piamenta's heart-melting music _ not licks but full-jawed chomps
that he coaxes from his Fender Stratocaster _ hit mainstream New
York City in 1994 in concerts at Wetlands and the Knitting Factory.
	   That, says Piamenta, ``put me on the map of secular New York.''
	   Piamenta has hired a publicist, and he no longer has to paste
posters on light poles with his sons in tow to advertise his
concerts. He's also working on a U.S. tour for 1999 and a world
tour to follow.

Joyner-Kersee loses in her final competition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDWARDSVILLE, Illinois (AP) _ Even though she didn't win, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee went out in style and with grace _ and a bundle of
tears. Losing didn't matter.
	   Considered the world's greatest female athlete, Joyner-Kersee
electrified the fans just with her presence. Of course, it would
have been only fitting had she won.
	   But after an exhausting week which included winning the Goodwill
Games heptathlon, a dinner honoring her retirement and a series of
public appearances to mark the end of a remarkable track and field
career, Joyner-Kersee was too tired to perform up to par.
	   In the U.S. Open, billed as ``Track and Field's Farewell to
JJK,'' Joyner-Kersee could do no better than sixth in the long jump
with a best of 20 feet, 11.75 inches (6.4 meters), nearly 4 feet
(1.22 meters) short of her all-time best.
	   Her series was one of the worst of her illustrious career.
Still, she was the focus of the IAAF Grand Prix meet, and not even
her poor performance could detract from her magnificent
accomplishments throughout the years.
	   Spectators cheered her every move and photographers and
cameramen swarmed all about her, tracking everything she did.
	   ``I hate for it to be over, but I knew that it couldn't go on
forever,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``It's pretty emotional for me.''
	   Just as after her Goodwill triumph, Joyner-Kersee couldn't hold
back tears. She didn't cry after the competition, but during the
post-meet ceremonies honoring her.
	   ``I've got to hold it in,'' she said when the long jump was
over. She didn't hold back for long.
	   She was happy that she would not have to compete again.
	   ``I'm glad,'' she said. ``I have no regrets.''
	   As for losing in her final competition, ``It wasn't meant to
be,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
	   Meanwhile, Kenya's William Tanui led nine men under 3 minutes,
57 seconds in the mile, winning in 3:54.11. Six runners in the
field ran personal bests, including runner-up David Krummenacker
(3:54.23).
	   NCAA and U.S. champion Angie Vaughn ran the second-fastest time
in the world in the women's 100-meter hurdles, clocking 12.63.
	   Regina Jacobs ran the fastest time of the year by an American in
the women's 3,000 with a time of 8:39.56. U.S. women's indoor and
outdoor high jump champion Tisha Waller won at 6-6, the best by an
American this year.
	   Bryan Bronson, the U.S. and Goodwill champion in the men's 400
hurdles, remained undefeated, winning at 48.22, and John Godina,
also the U.S. and Goodwill champion, took the men's shot put at
69-10}.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The telephone company and the
leaders of two striking unions have reached an agreement to end a
37-day-old walkout.
	   Both unions plan general assemblies for Tuesday to allow the
rank and file to vote on the tentative agreement.
	   The terms of the accord, reached Friday night, were not
revealed.
	   The unions went on strike June 18 to protest a government plan
to sell the state-owned telephone company to a consortium led by
GTE Corp. The strikers feared such a sale would result in
widespread layoffs. However, the sale has proceeded and lacks only
the approval of the Federal Communications Commission.

tear gas in a pre-dawn raid Sunday on a Subic Bay Freeport
administrative building to evict holdout supporters of the
industrial park's former chairman.
	   The tear gas was fired before police special forces broke
windows on the second and third floors to enter the headquarters
building, which hundreds of supporters of dismissed freeport
chairman Richard Gordon had barricaded for nearly a month.
	   Hundreds of other backers of the ex-chairman gathered outside
the building and battled police with rocks and bottles. One fire
truck was set on ablaze and two others damaged. Dozens of warning
shots were fired into the air by police in an attempt to disperse
the crowd.
	   Police were able to take control of the building several hours
after the raid began, but Gordon was not found inside, officials
said. At least six pro-Gordan activists were hospitalized, they
said.
	   In a telephone interview with a radio station from an
undisclosed location, Gordon appealed to President Joseph Estrada
to withdraw the police.
	   ``You assaulted people who were sleeping,'' he said. ``You are
the ones with power. Use your power for the people, not against the
people.''
	   President Estrada, who took office June 30, fired Gordon and
appointed long-time rival Felicito Payumo to take his place. Payumo
has been forced to set up a temporary office at the local airport.
	   A former U.S. naval base, the Subic Bay complex has become an
industrial zone showcasing economic growth in the Philippines.
	   An announcer on the SNN television network commented that it was
a sad day for the country as scenes of the fighting in Subic Bay
were broadcast.
	   Gordon insists his tenure has not ended. He was reappointed to
the post by former President Fidel Ramos early this year.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, to replace Gordan appeared to come in
retaliation for efforts by the business executive's followers to
prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.
	   Gordon won a restraining order against Payumo that lapsed last
week. A local court refused to extend the restraining order but did
not rule on whether Gordon's dismissal by Estrada was legal.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the lower court's decision
not to extend Gordon's stay meant that Estrada's order firing
Gordon and installing Payumo could be implemented immediately.
	   The local chamber of commerce has said companies in the
freeport, which include Federal Express and Acer, suffered losses
totaling dlrs 3.5 million on July 1, when Gordon's supporters
temporarily barricaded all the freeport gates.

Political protest disrupts Iran-U.S. Wrestling.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Exile groups protesting the militant Islamic
government in Tehran interrupted Saturday night's Goodwill Games
wrestling match between the United States and Iran.
	   After Behnam Taiebi scored a 5-0 shutout against American Sam
Henson, Tony Purler of the United States entered the ring for his
bout against Mohammad Talaie. But Talaie did not appear and the
Iranians refused to wrestle because of protesting fans in the
stands.
	   After 20 minutes, Talaie entered the ring waving an Iranian flag
and the match went on.
	   Hundreds of Iranian fans were wearing T-shirts bearing the name
and picture of Maryam Rajavi, head of the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, and appeared to be the center of the dispute.
	   When the match resumed, a dozen security guards flooded the area
where the protest was centered, and large banners bearing the
portrait of Rajavi appeared to have been removed. At least eight
fans with either Rajavi T-shirts or banners were taken from the
hall by city police or Garden security.
	   ``A group of fans was protesting politically in the stands. The
Iranian team leader took offense and left with his team,'' said
Larry Sciacchetano, president of USA Wrestling. ``What they asked
us to do was to clear the protesters from the arena. We had a hard
time convincing them that this is a free society.
	   ``We're not about to tell people what they can say or what they
can't say. We've explained that to the Iranians. Certainly, we want
to continue our good relations. It's terrible when politics have to
interfere with sports. This isn't the place for it.''
	   He said officials had asked the protesters to keep their signs
down, ``because they distract the view of other people that have
paid to watch these matches. I think we have that right.''
	   John Smith, coach of the American team, said something was said
to one of the Iranian wrestlers on the floor that triggered the
protest.
	   ``They disagree with the politics going on in Iran,'' he said.
``This is not the place. This is a sporting event. It should be
about sports.''
	   Last month in Lyon, France, there were similar protests during
the U.S.-Iran World Cup match, with exile groups wearing T-shirts
with the pictures of their leader. FIFA rules barred any political
banners or signs from the stadiums. Some fans were ejected by
guards when they waved banners. There was no violence and no
arrests.
	   Tens of thousands of Iranians left after the 1979 Islamic
revolution overthrew the U.S.-supported shah and installed a strict
religious government. Many, who are still opposed to the
government, have never returned even for a visit.
	   The largest of the organized exile groups is the Mujahedeen
Khalq, whose leader is Masoud Rajavi, Maryam's husband and the
exile group's president.
	   Many in the capacity crowd at the Garden waved small
green-white-and-red Iranian flags. American fans favored a raucus
``USA-USA-USA'' chant.
	   As they were introduced, the wrestlers shook hands, with the
Americans handing the Iranians small coins. It was as if old
friends were greeting each other; in fact, these wrestlers know
each other from previous international meets, most recently the
World Cup in April in Stillwater, Oklahoma.
	   A block away from the Garden, Moslem E. Filabi sat in a hotel
lobby, unable to watch the team of the country he once represented
and afraid of the stir his presence in the arena might create.
	   For 10 years, from 1966-76, Filabi wrestled on the Iranian
national team. He appeared in three Olympics for Iran, won 17 gold,
silver and bronze medals in international competitions and was
honored as a national hero. He left Iran in 1982, three years after
the revolution.
	   ``Getting out was not a problem,'' he said. ``Inside was a
problem.''
	   Filabi believes that remains the case, that his homeland is
being pillaged by the current regime and that the wrestling team is
being used in an effort to repair his nation's image.
	   ``Once, Iran was a rich country,'' he said. ``Now it is a poor
country.''
	   Filabi, a member of Rajavi's group, seeks the overthrow of the
current government, which he says is repressive domestically and
sponsors terrorism internationally.
	   And, he said, the regime is using the wrestlers solely to
improve its image.
	   ``They are playing politics,'' he said. ``They say they are here
for sports. They are here to cover up what is going on in my
country, the people who are executed, the ones who are jailed. If
they are here for sports, why weren't they here five years ago or
10 years ago?''
	   Iran defeated the United States 2-1 in World Cup soccer, setting
off huge celebrations in the streets of Tehran.
	   The Iranian wrestlers have been careful to avoid political
topics on this trip. When an American team traveled to Tehran in
February, the wrestlers were welcomed warmly by the people.
	   Iranian wrestlers who traveled to a World Cup meet in Oklahoma
last spring, however, complained of being photographed and
fingerprinted by immigration officials when they entered the United
States,

Report: Japan's future prime minister to set up economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
task force &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's premier-in-waiting has pledged to form a
special economic task force immediately after taking office as
prime minister in a bid to ease mounting concern at home and abroad
over the country's deteriorating economy, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   The council of academics and business executives will serve as a
brain trust to advise the government on economic policy issues,
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted as saying in an interview
with the Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily.
	   Obuchi, who was elected president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party on Friday, is expected to be formally voted into
office as prime minister later this week. He will succeed fellow
LDP member Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced earlier
this month his intention to step down.
	   Hashimoto tendered his resignation after the LDP suffered a
humiliating defeat in July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament as voters vented their anger about the declining
fortunes of the Japanese economy.
	   Obuchi departed early Sunday for a brief visit to the
Philippines where he will hold meetings with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and foreign ministers from China, Russia
and a number of Southeast Asian nations, Kyodo News reported.
	   Japan has faced a steady stream of criticism from Asian
neighbors for failing to stimulate its economy, which would help
the region recover from a slump by increasing demand for imports.

Political protests, oldtimers' wins mark Goodwill's busiest day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with Iranian exile protest at wrestling, more
evening events &QL;

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goodwill gave way to political protest Saturday
as the 20-year standoff between the United States and Iran sparked
a wrestling walkout.
	   Exile groups protesting the militant Islamic government in
Tehran interrupted Saturday night's Goodwill Games wrestling match
between the United States and Iran.
	   After Behnam Taiebi scored a 5-0 shutout against American Sam
Henson, Tony Purler of the United States entered the ring for his
bout against Mohammad Talaie. But Talaie did not appear, and the
Iranians refused to wrestle because of the protesting fans.
	   After 20 minutes, Talaie entered the ring waving an Iranian flag
and the match continued. The United States won the dual meet 19-9,
clinching it on former world champion Melvin Douglas' overtime
victory over Olympic silver medalist Abbas Jadidi.
	   ``A group of fans was protesting politically in the stands. The
Iranian team leader took offense and left with his team,'' said
Larry Sciacchetano, president of USA Wrestling. ``What they asked
us to to do was to clear the protesters from the arena. We had a
hard time convincing them that this is a free society.''
	   Although at least eight protesters were seen being escorted from
the 5,500-seat theater at Madison Square Garden, city police
reported no arrests. There also were no reports of injuries.
	   Hundreds of Iranian fans were wearing T-shirts bearing the name
and picture of Maryam Rajavi, head of the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, and appeared to be the center of the dispute.
	   When the Islamic fundamentalists overthrew the regime of the
Shah of Iran in 1979, the United States and Iran broke diplomatic
relations which remain severed. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians
also fled the country and have mounted protests against the Tehran
regime.
	   The busiest day of the games was a good day for America's
oldtimers.
	   Karch Kiraly, who celebrates his 38th birthday this fall, and
Adam Johnson, a relative kid at 33, advanced to the gold-medal
match in beach volleyball with a straight-set win over a pair of
Australians in their 20s.
	   ``You'd probably have to open his brain to find that out,''
Johnson said when asked what keep Karch kicking. ``I think his
drive for success is so much greater than a lot of people's. He
raises your level of play.''
	   Douglas, who turns 36 next month, raised his own level of
competition and helped pace a big American victory over Turkey
before the Iran match.
	   Douglas, the 1993 world champion at 213 pounds (96.62 kilos)
from Mesa, Arizona, scored a 3-0 overtime decision over Kasif
Sakiroglu, one of six U.S. victories in eight matches.
	   Les Gutches, of Corvallis, Oregon, scored the biggest victory of
the contest, a technical-superiority defeat of Ali Ozen.
	   Gutches led 11-0 when the referee stopped the bout at 4:49,
earning four points for the United States.
	   Russia beat Iran, 17-12, in the tournament opener and later beat
Turkey 20-11,
	   As the competition continued on a glorious summer day, a Chinese
gymnast paralyzed in a practice accident underwent surgery in hopes
of someday walking again.
	   Doctors at Nassau County Medical Center fused two fractured and
dislocated vertebrae in the neck of 17-year-old Sang Lan during a
seven-hour operation.
	   Sang was in critical but stable condition. Her parents arrived
from China late Saturday.
	   In Central Park, Kiraly and Johnson dominated the Aussie pair of
Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner, 12-2, 12-10, for a spot in Sunday's
final.
	   In the first game, Kiraly, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and
Johnson ran off nine straight points for a 11-1 lead. In the second
game, Australia tied it 9-9 and 10-10 before Kiraly hit a pair of
kills on his serve to win the match.
	   ``I love playing beach volleyball and trying to be part of the
best team,'' Kiraly said.
	   Johnson said that when Kiraly steps on court, `it's like _ `Oh,
the aura is coming over into me and I gotta raise the level of my
play.' I sure did when I first started with him.''
	   ``He's just a machine,'' Zahner, 24, said of Kiraly. ``He
doesn't make many errors. He's almost boring to watch sometimes
because he just doesn't make many errors. He's the ultimate
volleyball player, ever. You just have to give him credit. He's a
fantastic athlete. I hope I'm like that at 37.''
	   In soccer, the United States will play Monday for the gold medal
against China. The Americans, with Mia Hamm scoring three goals,
beat Denmark 5-0, after China upset women's world champion Norway
4-2 in a shootout.
	   The men's triathlon title was won for the second straight time
by Simon Lessing of Britain, while Australia's Loretta Harrop
rallied to win the women's race.
	   Cycling, in an unusual team format, found the United States in
front after the first of two days. Mike McCarthy won the men's
elimination and scratch race, and the U.S. trio of Paul Swift and
brothers Jonas and James Carney took the Magic Mile. Olympic
speedskating medalist Chris Witty was second in the women's sprint.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hoping for a fresh start toward
peace and stability, Cambodians swarmed polling stations Sunday to
vote for new leadership and put an end to festering tension
following a bloody power struggle last year.
	   For the first time in history, former Khmer Rouge guerrillas
took part in a democratic vote.
	   Foreign election observers predicted a high turnout and said the
result could surprise strongman Hun Sen, widely accused of
murdering opponents and intimidating voters to ensure he wins the
first parliamentary elections since U.N.-organized polls in 1993.
	   Voting at a school, Hun Sen kissed his ballot and sought to
dispel fears he would call out the army if his Cambodian People's
Party loses, saying he was prepared to hand over power within hours
after results become known.
	   Hun Sen, other leaders and independent analysts have predicted
that no party will win a majority of the 122 National Assembly
seats up for grabs, making a coalition government likely.
	   That could mean either give-and-take power-sharing or,
infighting and turmoil as in the past.
	   ``If my party loses, I'm ready to be a coconut vendor or a
fishermen,'' said Hun Sen, 47, looking healthy after an emergency
appendectomy July 17. ``Today, one can see the Cambodian people
have achieved victory. I also share this victory.''
	   The main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
by Hun Sen as co-prime minister last year in fighting that
devastated parts of Phnom Penh, the capital, and former finance
minister Sam Rainsy cast ballots in the central town of Kompong
Cham.
	   An upbeat Ranariddh said the election represented a ``choice
between democracy and totalitarianism'' and marked ``a great day
for democracy in Cambodia.''
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party has suffered the brunt of pre-election
killings, was more somber.
	   ``It can be a turning point,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I hope it
will, but I have no illusion. At least it shows the Cambodian
people want to vote. We can be disappointed later at the result .''
	   Phnom Penh was calm early Sunday. But in remote northern
jungles, the army was on high alert to prevent die-hard remnants of
the Khmer Rouge guerrillas from preventing the thousands of
ex-comrades who have made peace in recent years from voting.
	   In Pailin, a gem-rich former Khmer Rouge base that led the first
mass defections two years ago, former guerrillas and more recent
arrivals lined up to vote. Their leader, Ieng Sary, threw his
support behind Hun Sen last week.
	   Ieng Sary was foreign minister in the Khmer Rouge regime that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975
and 1979. Widely accused of crimes against humanity, he received a
pardon in exchange for leading his men to peace.
	   ``This is the first time in my life that I've participated in
voting,'' Ieng Sary said. Under the Khmer Rouge regime, belief in
such practices would have meant certain death.
	   Millions of ordinary Cambodians sought shade from a blazing sun,
lining up from daybreak at the 11,600 polling stations to patiently
wait for a chance to cast their ballots.
	   One of the first to vote was Chan Somphon, 51, a farmer living
at a Buddhist pagoda in Phnom Penh since a land-mine tore off his
left leg several years ago. One in every 300 Cambodians has been
killed or maimed by the millions of mines buried during three
decades of civil war.
	   Leaning on a crude wooden crutch, Chan Somphon chose from the 39
parties, dropped his ballot into a locked metal box and had his
finger dipped in purple ink, a precaution to prevent multiple
voting.
	   ``I want peace for Cambodia,'' said Chan Somphon who, like most
voters, refused to state his party preference. ``No more war. I
want peace everywhere. If the vote is honest, we will have peace.''
	   In another neighborhood, hundreds of people waited in lines
snaking through a schoolyard as the process slowly got underway.
The relatively affluent dressed in their best clothes; the poor
shielded their heads from the sun with traditional checkered
scarves.
	   One mother and child arrived in a cyclo-pousse, a hybrid between
a rickshaw and a bicycle, and brought food and water in case the
wait was long. The opposition expressed fear Hun Sen's supporters
would arrive early and drag out the process, keeping opponents from
voting before polls closed at 4 p.m. (1000 GMT).
	   Glenys Kinnock, special representative of the European Union,
forecast high turnout among the 5.4 million registered voters,
about 95 percent of those eligible to vote.
	   ``I feel the Cambodian people may well surprise everyone
today,'' Kinnock said. `` They're very courageous people.''
	   Hun Sen was also favored to win the 1993 vote, but lost. Despite
20,000 U.N. peacekeepers, he thwarted the result and forced the
winner, Ranariddh and his royalist FUNCINPEC party, to share power
under threat of civil war.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Exile groups protesting the militant Islamic
government in Tehran interrupted Saturday night's Goodwill Games
wrestling match between the United States and Iran.
	   After Behnam Taiebi scored a 5-0 shutout against American Sam
Henson in the first match of the night, Tony Purler of the United
States entered the ring for his bout against Mohammad Talaie. But
Talaie did not appear, and the Iranians refused to wrestle because
of protesting fans in the stands.
	   After 20 minutes, Talaie entered the ring waving an small
Iranian flag and the match went on.
	   Hundreds of Iranian fans were wearing T-shirts bearing the name
and picture of Maryam Rajavi, head of the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, and appeared to be the center of the dispute.
	   When the match resumed, a dozen security guards flooded the area
where the protest was centered, and large banners bearing the
portrait of Rajavi appeared to have been removed. At least eight
fans with either Rajavi T-shirts or banners were taken from the
hall by city police or Madison Square Garden security.
	   ``A group of fans was protesting politically in the stands. The
Iranian team leader took offense and left with his team,'' said
Larry Sciacchetano, president of USA Wrestling. ``What they asked
us to do was to clear the protesters from the arena. We had a hard
time convincing them that this is a free society.
	   ``We're not about to tell people what they can say or what they
can't say. We've explained that to the Iranians. Certainly, we want
to continue our good relations. It's terrible when politics have to
interfere with sports. This isn't the place for it.''
	   He said officials had asked the protesters to keep their signs
down, ``because they distract the view of other people that have
paid to watch these matches. I think we have that right.''
	   Sciacchetano aid the Iranian wrestlers ``felt like they were
being insulted. ... We explained to them that we don't control who
comes, and we don't control what they say. But we certainly can
control them interfering with other people watching and enjoying
the match.''
	   John Smith, coach of the American team, said something was said
to one of the Iranian wrestlers on the floor that triggered the
protest.
	   ``They disagree with the politics going on in Iran,'' he said.
``This is not the place. This is a sporting event. It should be
about sports.''
	   Last month in Lyon, France, there were similar protests during
the U.S.-Iran World Cup match, with exile groups wearing T-shirts
with the pictures of their leader. FIFA rules barred any political
banners or signs from the stadiums. Some fans were ejected by
guards when they waved banners. There was no violence and no
arrests.
	   Tens of thousands of Iranians left after the 1979 Islamic
revolution overthrew the U.S.-supported shah and installed a strict
religious government. Many, who are still opposed to the
government, have never returned even for a visit.
	   The largest of the organized exile groups is the Mujahedeen
Khalq, whose leader is Masoud Rajavi, Maryam's husband and the
exile group's president.
	   Many in the near-capacity crowd of 4,854 at the Garden waved
small green-white-and-red Iranian flags. American fans favored a
raucus ``USA-USA-USA'' chant.
	   As they were introduced, the wrestlers shook hands, with the
Americans handing the Iranians small coins. It was as if old
friends were greeting each other; in fact, these wrestlers know
each other from previous international meets, most recently the
World Cup in April in Stillwater, Oklahoma.
	   The United States came from behind to defeat Iran 19-9, winning
the last six bouts of the night.
	   A block away from the Garden, Moslem E. Filabi sat in a hotel
lobby, unable to watch the team of the country he once represented
and afraid of the stir his presence in the arena might create.
	   For 10 years, from 1966-76, Filabi wrestled on the Iranian
national team. He appeared in three Olympics for Iran, won 17 gold,
silver and bronze medals in international competitions and was
honored as a national hero. He left Iran in 1982, three years after
the revolution.
	   ``Getting out was not a problem,'' he said. ``Inside was a
problem.''
	   Filabi believes that remains the case, that his homeland is
being pillaged by the current government and that the wrestling
team is being used in an effort to repair his nation's image.
	   ``Once, Iran was a rich country,'' he said. ``Now it is a poor
country.''
	   Filabi, a member of Rajavi's group, seeks the overthrow of the
current government, which he says is repressive domestically and
sponsors terrorism internationally.
	   And, he said, the regime is using the wrestlers solely to
improve its image.
	   ``They are playing politics,'' he said. ``They say they are here
for sports. They are here to cover up what is going on in my
country, the people who are executed, the ones who are jailed. If
they are here for sports, why weren't they here five years ago or
10 years ago?''
	   Iran defeated the United States 2-1 in World Cup soccer, setting
off huge celebrations in the streets of Tehran.
	   The Iranian wrestlers have been careful to avoid political
topics on this trip. When an American team traveled to Tehran in
February, the wrestlers were welcomed warmly by the people.
	   Iranian wrestlers who traveled to a World Cup meet in Oklahoma
last spring, however, complained of being photographed and
fingerprinted by immigration officials when they entered the United
States,

 &UR; Facts and figures on Cambodia's parliamentary elections:
 &UR; ---(

<TEXT>
	   The Election:
	   _ Voters will choose a 122-member constituent assembly and a new
government will be formed.
	   _ They are the first multi-party elections since 1993, when U.N.
peacekeeping troops were part of a dlrs 3 billion effort to usher
in a new era of peace and democracy after the Khmer Rouge genocide
of the late 1970s, followed by a decade of Vietnamese occupation.
	   _ The Khmer Rouge boycotted the 1993 elections. Then still a
significant guerrilla force, they are today virtually extinct due
to mass defections. Apart from a handful of die-hard rebels,
thousands of ex-guerrillas will cast ballots for the first time in
their lives.
	   _ The elections come a year after Cambodian leader Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whose party won the 1993 polls, as
his co-prime minister. Critics fear that Hun Sen has rigged the
process in his favor.
	   _ The international community hopes that new polls will return
political stability following last year's violence, though critics
have accused them of turning a blind eye to abuses. The United
Nations and donor countries have given dlrs 28 million in aid.
	   _ The Cambodian government is officially organizing the election
for the first time.
 &UR; ---(
	   Voting:
	   _ Balloting takes place at 11,699 polling stations throughout 21
provinces and the capital, Phnom Penh. Initial results are expected
Aug. 1.
	   _ 678 international observers have been deployed to oversee the
voting, along with thousands of national observers. Hun Sen-linked
organizations have been accused of trying to dominate the Cambodian
component.
	   _ Some 5.4 million people _ about 98 percent of all eligible
voters and about half of the total population of 10 million _ are
registered to vote. The chance of disruption is low, despite an
attack on an election convoy last week by die-hard Khmer Rouge
rebels.
 &UR; ---(
	   Parties:
	   _ The three contenders are Hun Sen's formerly communist
Cambodian People's Party, the royalist FUNCINPEC led by Ranariddh,
son of King Norodom Sihanouk, and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy's
party, named after himself.
