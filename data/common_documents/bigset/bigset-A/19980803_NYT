<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Overwhelming? Not quite. Overpowering? On a number
of occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Overjoyed? Actually, the thin man himself wasn't. But his
awestruck new teammates had every reason to be.
</P>
<P>
   Unit-ed stood the Astros behind the most exciting acquisition
made by Houston's long-thwarted baseball franchise since Nolan Ryan
came home. On a glorious Sunday afternoon in Pittsburgh, where our
town's favorite memories had been of epic Oilers-Steelers
confrontations, the Randy Johnson mini-era began exactly as it
should have.
</P>
<P>
   With a called strike, 94 mph, to Kevin Polcovich. A `W' followed
ultimately, with lots of K's and grand promise for _ finally _ a
happy ending in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``A special day,'' Jeff Bagwell called it, admitting he couldn't
fully believe Johnson, the most dominant pitcher in the game as
recently as about this time last year, was a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were so enthralled by the erstwhile Mariner, their
would-be World Series lottery ticket, their hoped-for means to the
end of a nearly four-decade stay in purgatory, they almost forgot
to do what they do best, which is hit.
</P>
<P>
   It's Astros bats, after all, that made going after Johnson, the
scraggly-haired, fierce-eyed 6-10 lefthander who has posted numbers
that are Koufax-esque, well worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the guys might have been trying a little too hard to
impress him,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``Everybody really
wanted to give Randy some support today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, 6-2 winners, scored five of their runs following
Johnson's 116th and last pitch, an 84 mph sinker that Jason Kendall
popped up to Bill Spiers near third base to end the seventh inning.
Kendall wound up being the only Pirate the Big Unit _ Mister Big
Unit to you _ didn't whiff en route to his 12-strikeout, six-hit
victory. It was a masterful debut, considering how his life was
torn asunder over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A towering fixture in Seattle for most of 10 seasons, and maybe
a Mariners lifer if he hadn't scared them by needing spinal surgery
in 1996, he was traded to the Astros right before the waiver
deadline Friday night. Although he knew he was gone _ to somewhere
_ he didn't swallow the news well, and nobody was sure what his
frame of mind would be Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Bagwell said. ``I didn't want to bother him,
because I know most pitchers would rather be left alone before they
pitch. But I thought I should at least go over to shake his hand
and say hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, for his part, kept his distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find Randy,'' he said. ``He must have uncovered a
quiet spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Johnson surfaced in time to warm up, then promptly
showed the Pirates what quaking AL hitters have been suffering
through for years.
</P>
<P>
   He made only one inarguably bad decision all day, leaving an
intended 0-2 sinker in the fifth inning dangerously close to the
plate's fringe. Aramis Ramirez, his eyes as large as small meteors,
poked it over the left-field fence, albeit barely above the glove
of a leaping Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Johnson's strikeouts _ no Astro had fanned more in a
game all season _ were polished off with 97-98 mph heaters,
although his slider also began to baffle the Pirates in the sixth
inning, when he fanned the side after a first-pitch single by
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Three Pittsburgh hits came off first pitches as the young
Pirates, every one of them batting right, gamely dug in on
anticipated fastballs. Guesswork, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give a good effort, and I feel I did,'' Johnson
said with discernible relief afterward, probably talking more in
one postgame gab session than he had over the entire previous month
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He practically couldn't stop talking. Clearly, a burden had been
lifted, now that his fate, short-term at least, had been
determined. First, with glistening eyes, he thanked his new
teammates and his old fans. Then he thanked his old teammates and
his new fans, saying he was eager to pitch in Houston, in domed
surroundings that will hardly feel foreign to him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson next starts against the Phillies either Friday or
Saturday night. Whichever date is agreed upon _ Dierker is leaning
toward using him in the series opener _ he solemnly promised to
pitch better than he did here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have very good command of my sinker,'' he said, ``and
my fastball was just so-so.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Brad Ausmus would admit his hand was no more raw than
when Billy Wagner, the Astros' diminutive flamethrower, is his
batterymate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Randy,'' Ausmus said, ``the ball definitely comes in
from a higher place.''
</P>
<P>
   The catcher was, I assume, referring to the pitcher's physical
stature, not his spiritual presence. Either way, though, Johnson
does seem a godsend.

ON BASEBALL: WARY LOOK AT LIFE WITHOUT PIAZZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza's life should be so much fun right now.
He is living every 11-year-old's dream as a major-league player, he
is being paid $8 million this season and he is healthy. It is
ludicrous to expect anyone who paid $1.50 for a subway token to
sympathize with Piazza when he is verbally trampled by fickle fans
and treated like Mel Rojas in a catcher's mask, as he was again
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza reported for work at Shea Stadium, he had the worn
look of a man who had to mow lawns for the next eight hours. He
never lifted his eyes when some fans behind the dugout screeched
his name. After batting practice, Piazza continued staring at the
dirt while fans pleaded for an autograph, a smile or a wave.
</P>
<P>
   Even General Manager Steve Phillips was basically given the
silent treatment by Piazza before the Mets cruised past the
Dodgers, 9-3. Sitting in the dugout with his two young sons,
Phillips asked Piazza how he had hit. Piazza gritted his teeth and
said ``good'' before vanishing into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Get a close look at Piazza wearing those black Mets jerseys
because there are increasing indications that the marriage between
Piazza and the club will end after this season. Piazza is intent on
becoming a free agent and pursuing a $100 million contract, and
Phillips has expressed his doubt about having Piazza back in black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have options behind the plate,'' Phillips said. ``Whether
we're able to work out Mike's deal or not, we have options.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a revealing statement from the cautious Phillips.
Usually, he is careful to avoid saying anything too substantial.
But there he was in the middle of the chase for a wild-card spot
admitting that Todd Hundley _ who is at least a month away from
placing his surgically repaired right elbow behind the plate _ and
Jorge Fabregas were candidates to replace Piazza in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black sunglasses to fend off some television camera
lights Sunday, Piazza looked perturbed after going 1-for-4 with a
run batted in to finish the three-game series against his former
team with one infield single in 11 at-bats. He also continued in
his unfair role as the Met Most Likely to Be Booed, which will
surely influence his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm not even thinking about that,'' Piazza said. ``I have
a job to do. I'm going to play as hard as I possibly can.
Everything else, I'm not even thinking about next week, never mind
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the berating must have robbed some of baseball's fun from
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they embrace me or not, they're entitled to that,'' Piazza
said. ``They pay for a ticket to get in. They can boo me or cheer
me. Unfortunately, it's part of the territory that we have to deal
with. I just hope that the big picture isn't lost, the fact that
we're playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is too savvy to utter something so intriguing about
Piazza without reason. He could be laying the groundwork for
lessening the sting if and when Piazza relocates to Anaheim, to
Boston, back to Los Angeles _ anywhere but Flushing. Since a person
close to the 29-year-old catcher has said it will not matter how
lavish an offer the Mets may make because Piazza wants to test free
agency, Phillips could say the Mets pushed for the postseason with
Piazza and have no control over his choices. It would be a weak
excuse, and those who booed Piazza will howl to get him back if
Fabregas starts next year. That could happen.
</P>
<P>
   By obtaining the left-handed-hitting Fabregas from Arizona, the
Mets have set up a safety net if Piazza departs and Hundley cannot
catch again. Why else would they want or need a left-handed-hitting
catcher who is signed for 1999 when Hundley, a switch-hitter, is
better from the left side?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Piazza, who rejected a six-year, $84 million contract from the
Dodgers and then was traded to Florida in May, had a forgettable
weekend. He forgot to back up first base in the first inning
Sunday, and Rey Ordonez's wild throw rolled into the dugout,
leading to a run. He had a sacrifice fly in the first, but missed a
meaty 3-1 pitch before grounding out in the third. He swung at ball
four while striking out in the fifth, secured an 80-foot single in
the seventh and was booed after bouncing out to third in the
eighth. The Mets were leading, 9-1, and were poised to win for the
10th time in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips speculated that Piazza was ``trying too hard,'' but
Piazza disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have an excuse for it or anything,'' Piazza
said. ``I'm just going out and playing. I really think the whole
thing has been overdone, a little too much drama for me to worry
about that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   On what should have been a blissful day for Piazza, he did
notice an 8-year-old boy on crutches outside the clubhouse and
asked him, ``Do you want a bat?'' T.J. McGuinness happily accepted
Piazza's bat. About five minutes later, someone told Piazza that he
had made the boy's day and the Met did not even nod. Piazza just
walked away, which might prove to be a fitting metaphor for his
days with the Mets.

WITHOUT JOHNSON, FIVE PITCHERS BEAT CONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Paul Spoljaric drew the unfortunate assignment of
replacing Randy Johnson in the Seattle rotation Sunday night,
circumstances that begged for inevitably unfavorable comparisons.
And Spoljaric had to pitch against the Yankees and David Cone, the
team and the pitcher, respectively, with the major leagues' best
record.
</P>
<P>
   But Spoljaric and four relievers limited the Yankees to nine
hits and won, 6-3, as Cone was done in by a series of bloop hits,
lapses on defense and one very bad pitch. The Yankees (77-28),
having won two of three games against the Mariners, move on to
Oakland to play the final four games of their West Coast road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, trailing by three runs in the fourth inning,
crawled back to trail by 4-3. But Cone allowed a bloop double with
two outs in the seventh, after striking out both Ken Griffey Jr.
and Edgar Martinez. Even as Cone neared 120 pitches, his slider and
curveball were electric, and he had 11 strikeouts _ the sixth time
this season he had had 10 or more strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Jay Buhner, however, Cone hung a slider and Buhner
walloped it; Cone drew both hands up to his head and pulled off his
cap in frustration, turning away as the ball rocketed toward the
left-field stands. Then Cone (15-4) kicked at the dirt. It had not
been a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Yankees were to begin batting practice
Sunday, their hitting coach, Chris Chambliss, strolled purposefully
over to the wall where the lineup was posted, carefully stripped
away the white medical tape holding the cardboard sheet and
replaced the early lineup. Joe Girardi was out at catcher because
of back spasms, and Jorge Posada was in. It would not have been
particularly noteworthy except that Cone was pitching, and Girardi
always catches when Cone pitches. Posada and Cone had not worked
together in a regular-season game since May 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, too, was missing from the lineup, because the
left-handed Paul Spoljaric was Johnson's temporary replacement in
the Seattle rotation, and Martinez had always struggled against
Spoljaric. Shane Spencer, a right-handed-hitting rookie, who has
been an outfielder most of his career, made his major league debut
at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the ball seemed to seek out both Posada and Spencer
in the early innings. With a single and a walk separated by a
strikeout, Seattle rallied in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out Russ Davis on three consecutive sliders for the
second out of the inning. Catcher Joe Oliver, however, bounced a
hit through the left side of the infield. The ball quickly reached
a charging Chad Curtis, who executed his patented throw-and-roll in
an effort to cut down Edgar Martinez at home plate. Curtis' throw
reached the plate area well ahead of Martinez, but on a short hop,
and Posada could not hang on. Martinez's run tied the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Alex Rodriguez poked a one-out double. Cone
threw a high fastball to Griffey, and Posada let it glance off his
glove. Cone _ often angry and animated when he pitches _ got
another baseball and walked back to the mound, mumbling to himself.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Griffey and walked Martinez, filling the bases. David
Segui hammered a low line drive directly at Spencer, who gloved the
ball at his midsection and then dropped it; all the runners were
frozen for an instant, and had Spencer thrown home, he would have
retired Rodriguez easily.
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer rose and threw to second for a forceout. Derek
Jeter's return was too late for a doubleplay, and a run scored.
Buhner hit a run-scoring single and Cone, not accustomed to losing,
was turning a fiery red. The Yankees trailed by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out the first two batters in the fourth inning,
before Joey Cora chopped a weak grounder toward shortstop. Jeter
charged and threw offbalance, the ball sinking in the dirt _ and
Spencer could not come up with the short hop.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez beat out another infield single, Griffey fought off an
inside pitch, looping it over second base, and Seattle had four
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric, who has pitched in middle relief most of this season,
was replaced in the middle of the fifth inning when Mariners
Manager Lou Piniella began mixing and matching against the
right-handed and left-handed batters in the Yankees lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees still came up with a run in the fifth, however, on a
run-scoring double by Scott Brosius. Curtis hit a high and long
home run with one out in the seventh, cutting Seattle's lead to
4-3.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, who officially requested a trade from the Toronto
Blue Jays last week, reportedly said that the Yankees' principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, told his agents he would be willing to
extend Clemens' contract if the pitcher was traded to the Yankees.
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said he was unaware of
any conversations between Steinbrenner and Clemens' agents, but did
say Toronto General Manager Gord Ash did give the Yankees
permission to speak to Clemens' agents before the July 31 trade
deadline. It's now unlikely the Yankees could discuss a trade for
Clemens until after the season, because Clemens would have to clear
waivers. Cashman intends to ask other club officials if there's
reason to have an interest in the free agent reliever Norm
Charlton, recently released by the Baltimore Orioles. ... Second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch had two hits in his last 29 at-bats, and
Yankees Manager Joe Torre, has talked to Knoblauch informally about
the high number of flyouts he has generated recently, since a burst
of home runs last month. Knoblauch's batting average is down to
.246, his lowest since May 17.

 FIRE LEAVES MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE HOMELESS  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 100 people were left at least temporarily
homeless Sunday after a fierce, smoky fire tore through an
apartment building in upper Manhattan, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire marshals labeled the fire suspicious, in part because of
the speed with which it engulfed the top floor of the six-story
building and burned through the roof of the structure. ``It was
deemed suspicious, and the cause is still being investigated,''
said James Spollen, a fire department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the fire had been brought under control at 6:30
a.m., 22 firefighters and five residents had suffered minor
injuries, mostly from smoke inhalation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 128 people _ including 17 children _ were forced from
their apartments by the fire, Robert Wingate, a spokesman for the
Red Cross, said. Many made plans Sunday to stay with relatives and
friends, but two busloads of people were sent to two local hotels
for emergency housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, who visited the scene, said
that battling the blaze was made difficult by the age of the
building and the many layers of renovation that had been added over
the years. ``It was very difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wingate said the Red Cross would work with residents as the city
and the building's landlord decided whether the apartments would be
inhabitable again.

CONTRIBUTORS TO NYC POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS NOW LISTED ON THE
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a milestone in the effort to inform the public
about the political process, the New York City Campaign Finance
Board unveiled a new feature Monday on its Internet site that
allows users to search a list of campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Web site can examine the names of donors and the
amount they gave to the campaigns of more than 175 candidates who
ran in the 1997 city elections, from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to
losing contenders for the city council. The records for candidates
who plan to seek office in the next city election, in 2001, are
also available at the site (www.cfb.nyc.ny.us).
</P>
<P>
   Since it was established in 1988, the board has required most
candidates who take part in the city's voluntary campaign finance
system to submit their disclosure records on computer disk. Members
of the public were then able to obtain copies of the records on
disk or view them at a terminal at the board's offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the board had not put the records on its Internet site. The
new feature includes information on the names, occupations and
employers of contributors, as provided by the campaigns. It also
includes the date when the donations were received.
</P>
<P>
   ``By visiting the board's Web site, the public can now follow
the money that funds New York City campaigns right from their own
homes, 24 hours a day,'' said the board's executive director,
Nicole Gordon. ``No other jurisdiction in the country offers all
the public disclosure resources that the Campaign Finance Board now
provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in the city's campaign finance system obtain money
from the city treasury for their campaigns in return for agreeing
to limits on their fund-raising and spending, as well as increased
disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not disseminate information on computer for the
finances of campaigns for state offices. It plans to change that
after the November elections, when it begins a new disclosure
system that is supposed to be similar to the one in the city, with
information available at an Internet site.

 JOHN R. HOPKINS, 67, WRITER FOR TV, THEATER AND MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John R. Hopkins, a British playwright and screenwriter, author
of the drama ``Find Your Way Home'' and the television adaptation
of ``Smiley's People,'' died July 23 at his home in Woodland Hills,
Calif. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, actress Shirley Knight, said the cause was a head
injury that resulted from a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins' wide range of work included the creation of the popular
police drama ``Z Cars'' for the BBC; the drama ``Hiroshima'' for
Showtime; the four-part 1966 teleplay ``Talking to a Stranger'' for
BBC, and the screenplay for the 1979 film ``Murder by Decree,'' in
which Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigate the Jack the
Ripper murders.
</P>
<P>
   With Richard Maibaum, Hopkins wrote the screenplay for the 1965
James Bond film ``Thunderball,'' and wrote such plays as ``This
Story of Yours,'' produced at the Royal Court Theater in London in
1968, and ``Find Your Way Home,'' which brought stardom to Michael
Moriarty when it was produced at the Brooks Atkinson Theater on
Broadway in 1974. He adapted the 1980 John Le Carre novel
``Smiley's People'' for a BBC production starring Alec Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Z Cars'' won Hopkins a British Screenwriters' Guild Award in
1963; ``Hiroshima,'' an account of the atomic bombing from both the
Japanese and American points of view, won him the 1996 Humanitas
Award and a PEN Center West literary award. ``Talking to a
Stranger,'' a precursor of the miniseries genre, won him a British
Guild of Television, Producers and Directors Award for writing in
1967 and an Emmy in 1968 when it was broadcast in the United States
on ``Masterpiece Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of his plays were evaluating the world in which he
lived and trying to come to terms with both the beauty and the
horror of the world,'' Ms. Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight appeared in his plays ``Absent Forever,'' about the
anguish of a woman whose daughter vanishes after her arrest in a
demonstration at a university, and ``Losing Time,'' a 1979
Manhattan Theater Club production about an abandoned wife's journey
toward self-discovery and positive self-esteem. Hopkins had
recently completed a trilogy called ``The Mary Plays,'' about Mary,
the mother of Jesus, in which Ms. Knight was to play Elizabeth, the
mother of John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, who was born in London on Jan. 27, 1931, studied
literature at St. Catherine's College, Cambridge University, and
after graduation went to work for the BBC as a studio manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight said he got his start as a writer when novelist Nigel
Balchin, then his father-in-law, asked him to try his hand at
adapting one of his novels, ``A Small Back Room,'' for television.
The venture was a success. In the dozen or so years that Hopkins
spent writing for the BBC, he created more than 100 original
teleplays and adaptations, which included 57 episodes of ``Z
Cars.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Knight, Hopkins is survived by three
daughters, Justine Hopkins of Bristol, England, from his first
marriage, to Prudence Balchin; Kaitlin Hopkins Passer of Woodland
Hills, from Ms. Knight's first marriage; and Sophie Hopkins of
Studio City, Calif., from his marriage to Ms. Knight, and by a
brother, Arthur Hopkins of Bognor Regis, England.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight said she and Hopkins met in 1967 when producer David
Susskind bought the rights to remake the interwoven stories of
``Talking to a Stranger'' with an American setting, The central
role, of a feisty young woman estranged from her family, had been
played in England by Judi Dench, and Susskind asked Ms. Knight to
star in the American version. He also asked her to come and meet
the author in his office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date was May 11, 1967, at four o'clock in the afternoon,''
Ms. Knight said. ``That was that, really.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Hopkins were married in 1972.

AGASSI WINS MERCEDES-BENZ CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Los Angeles TV announcer had just offered a
hearty welcome back to Andre Agassi after Sunday's Mercedes-Benz
Cup final, and Agassi responded in kind: ``Thanks, it's nice to be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about playing in L.A. But the world's one-time
No.1 player might just as well have been talking about his
re-emergence as a tennis power.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Agassi won his second consecutive tournament
title _ and fourth of the year _ with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of No.2
seeded Tim Henman of England. After falling to as far as No.141
last November, Agassi is on the verge of breaking the top 10 for
the first time since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win pushed Agassi to No.11. He's won 11 consecutive
matches and 23 sets without a loss. He hasn't faced set point at
any time during the streak.
</P>
<P>
   Nice to be back, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough climb, but Agassi is enjoying the ascent
without saying much about where this storied comeback is supposed
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about getting anywhere,'' he said. ``I get a lot of
fulfillment and satisfaction out of the road back, so I don't want
to minimize the importance I put on just every day....
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy playing well, bringing entertainment, bringing a great
level of tennis to fans. All that is wonderful. But Grand Slam
titles is what you shoot for, what I shoot for. There's no feeling
like it. I want more of that, that's the pinnacle. But there's a
lot in between that's still left for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like breezing through ATP tour stops. Between now and the U.S.
Open, Agassi will continue a nonstop schedule of warm-ups, looking
to extend his streak in Toronto, Cincinnati and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's comeback train ran right through Henman, the
23-year-old Wimbledon semifinalist with a big serve. Clocked at up
to 142 mph this week, Henman's serve can be a killer. But Sunday it
killed only Henman, who committed seven double faults _ twice on
break point _ while chalking up eight aces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played OK. I don't think I played my best tennis,'' said
Henman, who could drop a spot from his No.12 ranking. ``But to beat
someone like Andre, you have to play to the top of your game. And
that never really happened for me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman seemed to lose his concentration at key moments,
including all three break points he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi broke Henman's serve twice in succession in the second
set, both on double faults. The second time was particularly
damaging, coming just after Henman had broken Agassi for the first
time. That gave Agassi a 4-3 edge as he took back the serve.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi also broke Henman in the third game of the first set,
when Henman smashed an Agassi lob into the net. Moments earlier,
Henman was rattled in mid-serve, by a ringing mobile phone in the
crowd of 7,027. That serve also ended in a double fault.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the intensely focused Agassi, who had a serve
interrupted by a baby's loud coo late in the second set. He
promptly re-tossed and won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just felt the pressure of having to make some first
serves today, because I felt like I returned pretty solidly,''
Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   And so Agassi's big-picture return rolls on, gaining momentum
with every match added to a streak that shows no signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every match you win, it starts becoming more important
that it continues,'' Agassi said. ``It has a double impact. It's
like letting it ride on the blackjack table. You know letting it
ride, it's going to get bigger and bigger. That's the way it feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just get out there and let it ride. Every game doubles
your confidence, doubles your focus, your intensity.''

ROBERT COOLEY III, 58, LAWYER WHO SOUGHT LINK TO JEFFERSON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ohio, N.Y., N.C., Md., Mo.)  (lh) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert H. Cooley III, a lawyer who had been leading a campaign
to have his family recognized as descendants of Thomas Jefferson
and his slave Sally Hemings, died July 20 at a hospital near his
home in Midlothian, Va., a Richmond, Va., suburb. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Pending results of an autopsy, his family speculated that the
cause was a blood clot that formed as a result of a freak accident
in New York City three months ago, when his foot was caught under a
steel construction plate that was flipped up, then slammed down by
a passing city bus.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he was a great-great-great-great-great-grandson
of Thomas Jefferson _ and to Cooley and other established
descendants of Sally Hemings' son Thomas Woodson, there has never
been any doubt _ Cooley did well for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prominent civil rights lawyer, he was born in
Richmond and grew up in Petersburg, Va., before receiving a law
degree from Howard University and joining the Army in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In a military career in which he rose from private to major,
Cooley served at bases in Arizona, France and Germany before being
sent to the Army's judge advocate general training academy at the
University of Virginia in 1968, receiving a degree in military law
and later serving as a trial judge in Vietnam before leaving the
Army in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   After serving with a Washington firm, he joined his father's
practice in Petersburg, later established the city's first
integrated law firm and then joined a Richmond firm before becoming
a sole practitioner in Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of his legal accomplishments, which included brief
substitute service as the first black judge for the Petersburg
District Court and as the first black federal magistrate for the
Eastern District of Virginia, what animated Cooley most in recent
years was the quest for a measure of overdue racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   For Cooley the quest began when he was 10, and a grandfather
told him that he was a seventh-generation descendant of Jefferson,
then warned him to keep quiet about it.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor that Jefferson had had a long-term liaison with
Hemings and had fathered several of her children, including a son,
who later settled in Ohio and took the name Thomas Woodson,
surfaced in 1802, during Jefferson's presidency, when it was
published by a disgruntled officeseeker.
</P>
<P>
   The matter has been thoroughly aired in recent years, but
although some initially skeptical historians have come to give the
old rumor some credence, the lack of firm evidence has largely left
the question unresolved _ except to Cooley and other Woodson
descendants for whom it is not rumor but established family fact,
passed down from generation to generation by diverse branches of
the Woodson family.
</P>
<P>
   As president and general counsel of the Thomas Woodson Family
Association, which represents some 200 of an estimated 1,800
Woodson descendants, Cooley had been a tireless spokesman for the
family's assertions, appearing on national television as recently
as June.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from gaining general public recognition of the Woodson
family's descent from Jefferson, the only real issue has been the
family's quest for the right to be buried in the cemetery at
Monticello, Jefferson's home in Charlottesville. The cemetery is
owned by a Jefferson family association, representing some 800
acknowledged Jefferson descendants, which has cited the lack of
evidence in denying burial rights to the Woodson family.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley and other Woodson descendants had been cheered by a
recent research project in which an effort is being made to use DNA
to help resolve the dispute. Because the DNA analysis being used is
valid only through unbroken male descent, and because all of
Jefferson's acknowledged descendants are descended from his two
acknowledged daughters (his only acknowledged son died in infancy),
it can at most establish that the Woodsons are related somehow to
Jefferson, perhaps through one of two nephews, not necessarily
descended from Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, any established scientific link between the Woodsons
and Jefferson could create extra pressure on the Jefferson family
association to open the cemetery to Woodson descendants.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of DNA samples taken from descendants of Woodson,
Jefferson's uncle, his nephews and a control group of prominent
Virginia families is being conducted at a laboratory in Oxford,
England, and the results are not expected to be published for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley was buried on July 25 at Forest Lawn Cemetery in
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his parents, Ruth and Robert Cooley Jr.; his
wife, Ruby; a son, Robert IV of Charlotte, N.C.; two daughters, Dr.
Michelle Cooley-Quille of Baltimore, and Lisa Cooley, a news anchor
for WCBS-TV in New York, and a brother, Col. Howard G. Cooley of
Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri.

COMMENTARY: TRUMP'S LOSS IS A VICTORY FOR TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's been down before.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, that bleak moment back in the early '90s
when, as sympathetic New Yorkers will remember, he had to sell his
yacht and accept a $450,000-a-month allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was all the trouble with Ivana, followed by all the
trouble with Marla, much of which got splashed on the front page of
The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all in all, these last couple of weeks haven't been good
ones for the Donald. In Atlantic City, N.J., he was frustrated by
an old lady who beat back his efforts to condemn her house. In
Washington, the federal government small-mindedly insisted that,
no, public parkland could not be offered as collateral for mortgage
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in New York, Donald Trump lost the Coliseum site
at Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   He had been eyeing the site for nearly 15 years. Back in 1985,
he had tried to raise there a truly magnificent Trumpaleum, a
137-story wonder in the shape of a spaceship. This time around he
played it safer, proposing to put up only 72 floors. He offered
more money for the site than anyone else, and threatened to sue if
he didn't get it. Still, the seller, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   That such a prize should have slipped from Trump's vigorous
grasp was, understandably, a sharp disappointment to him. ``I had
the best building at the highest price,'' he lamented in an
interview from his car phone last week. ``I had the worst political
consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the cosmic scheme of things, too, his loss of the site
was kind of surprising: just think of all the damage he could have
done with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trumpification'' is in urban design circles a term of art, and
not on the whole a complimentary one.
</P>
<P>
   From the site on Columbus Circle where Trump won't get to build,
a short walking tour takes the student of contemporary architecture
to no fewer than three Trump properties, all steps on what one
prominent architect calls a ``trail of tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Right across the circle is the Trump International Hotel, which
the developer created out of the old Gulf and Western building. In
the process he took a decidedly undistinguished building and still
managed, in the opinion of many, to ruin it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original building was nothing,'' said James Steward
Polshek, a former dean of the Columbia University School of
Architecture. ``It became less than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks away, on Central Park South, is Trump Parc, the
former Barbizon Plaza Hotel, which Trump had hoped to tear down. In
the end, he had to settle for bolting a huge gold-colored awning to
the front of the Art Deco structure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street, is Trump Tower, once home
to Trump himself, as well as to a two-story indoor waterfall, acres
of peach-colored marble and enough gold chrome for every faucet in
Beverly Hills. Among architects and critics, it is generally held
to be Trump's least bad bad building. Paul Golberger, the
architecture critic for The New Yorker and formerly for The New
York Times, even confessed to a certain grudging fondness for its
``warm vulgarity.''
</P>
<P>
   A slightly longer walking tour would include Trump's latest work
in progress, Riverside South, which the developer prefers to call
Trump Place. According to the cool appraisal of Polshek, the
complex overlooking the Hudson River expresses ``an architecture so
grotesquely banal that it is an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   His many detractors note that Trump has, over the years, brought
in some of the biggest names in the business _ among them Philip
Johnson and Robert Stern _ to work on his projects. And yet, no
matter what he builds or whom he gets to design it, the results,
they say, reflect the same esthetic. His buildings are inevitably
big, shiny and profoundly self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything he's done that has any lasting urban
or esthetic value,'' said Carter Wiseman, an architecture critic
formerly with New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Trump suggested that the reason he lost the Coliseum site last
week was his own disproportionate success. He ticked off all the
properties he owns in the neighborhood, including the recently
acquired General Motors Building, saying, ``Perhaps that played a
role.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't discouraged. He has already bid, he said, on
another slice of Columbus Circle _ the old, and still only
moderately ugly Cultural Affairs Department building.

EDITORIAL: TROUBLE IN THE OTHER MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The poor, heavily Indian state of Chiapas in southern Mexico is
a world apart from cosmopolitan Mexico City. It is also home to the
four-year-old Zapatista rebellion for Indian autonomy, land reform
and a new Mexican political order. President Ernesto Zedillo has
mishandled relations with the Zapatistas since peace talks
collapsed in 1996, abandoning dialogue and trying to impose his own
solutions. As an elected leader, Zedillo is responsible for
preserving constitutional order. But he can better do so by
compromise than by confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in Chiapas has recently grown more violent. Last
Christmas, a paramilitary force aligned with Zedillo's party
massacred 45 Indians in the village of Chenalho. Zedillo responded
with a credible investigation and removed negligent officials. But
in June, the government raised tensions anew by sending the army
and police to reassert control over Zapatista-run communities. The
Zapatistas, meanwhile, have turned from guerrilla violence to
political organizing, deepening their support. Zedillo must make
greater efforts to coax them back to the bargaining table .
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks broke down after the Zedillo government backed
away from several constitutional reforms to which its own
negotiators had unwisely agreed. The government was right to reopen
these questions. But instead of trying to create an atmosphere for
resumed negotiations, its actions have been highhanded and
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, implacable government hostility forced the bishop
of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz Garcia, to abandon efforts to mediate the
conflict. Then the government overturned a longstanding policy of
tolerating the parallel administrations set up by the Zapatistas in
33 villages. That led to a clash in which eight Indians and two
police officers were killed. Zedillo speaks with pride about his
commitment to a new, more pluralistic Mexico. Regrettably, that
vision seems not to apply to Chiapas.

NEW ASTRO JOHNSON IS A RELIEVED PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Putting on the new uniform was a little funny.
</P>
<P>
   You might expect something like that when you're 6-foot-10, legs
longer than a heron's. You don't just go and pull something off the
rack.
</P>
<P>
   So Randy Johnson tugged and tugged at his knees, trying to
stretch the pants of his new Houston Astros' uniform down far
enough to reach his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like the size pants I wore when I was in Little
League,'' Johnson said Sunday, tugging some more and grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right: Grinning. Smiling. Pleasant. Thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's almost perpetual glower of 1998 was gone _ except on
the pitching mound, where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson showed it doesn't matter if it's the American League or
National League or maybe even the American Legion or the Japanese
League _ anything to get out of that dead-end job with the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, instead of pitching as scheduled at the Kingdome,
instead of making his start against the Yankees and all those pesky
New York lefties, Johnson was the new ace on a first-place team in
the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   In his Astro debut, he struck out 12, walked only one, and beat
the Pirates, 6-2, at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   His new teammates are glad to have him. Just ask Astros'
second-baseman Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me? A horse like that who can chew up a bunch
of innings? To get a guy like him ... my God,'' Biggio gushed,
drooling at the Astros' chances of reversing their fortunes against
the mighty Braves this October.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's good fortune was an absurd and embarrassing
trade-deadline deal, Johnson for three minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Mariners feel bad. Believe me, we've been there
before, losing 98 games,'' Biggio said. ``But they didn't do too
bad. The pitcher they got, Freddy Garcia, he's really good. The
shortstop, (Carlos Guillen) he's OK, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After telling his new employers he would rather stick to his
work schedule, Johnson was moved from a scheduled debut Monday
against the Florida Marlins in Miami into the lineup against the
Pirates. He pitched seven strong innings, giving up six hits,
including a home run to Pittsburgh's Aramis Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new team I had to face today. I wasn't really pleased
with the way I threw but I'll take it because the team won,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   We all know he's human, after all. But even when not at his
best, he's basically overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear so much about him, then you face him live and you
realize, hey, it really is true. He's really as good as everyone
says,'' said Kevin Polcovich, the Pirates' leadoff hitter and one
of Johnson's strikeout victims. ``He's just so tough to hit. And
he's so big, it looks like he delivers the ball to the plate by
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   So now there will be all these new National League hitters to
dazzle. Or is it the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell if I'll be the one who has the advantage
since they don't know me,'' Johnson said. ``I don't know the
hitters, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also now must bother with having to hit. He didn't have
much success at the plate Sunday, although he did make contact in
two at-bats before pushing through a bunt attempt for strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee I won't be ripping the cover off any baseballs
this season,'' he said. ``But I do need to put in a bat order.''
</P>
<P>
   For his short-notice debut, the Houston equipment manager
scrounged up a loaner bat that looked like a matchstick against
Johnson's giant frame. An old friend and former teammate, Astros'
pitcher Doug Henry, lent him a batting helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make do,'' Johnson said, amused and light-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   He is now a man relieved, or at least a man who is free. Free
after nine months of misery on a team he insists he never wanted to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have been a Mariner forever and finished
my career there,'' Johnson said. ``There are a lot of memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Without rehashing the entire, tired scenario, Johnson said the
Mariners did not do the right things to make him feel wanted. Some
incidents are minor, showing Johnson's immense over-sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mariners did make one gigantic blunder last season.
Johnson was 100 percent recovered from back surgery, yet the
Mariners failed to pick up his option for 1998. Instead of feeling
some measure of thanks for his Cy Young and post-season
accomplishments in 1995, he felt unappreciated and financially
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the starting pitcher for the (1997) All-Star Game. I was
something like 12-2. I thought that would have been the time,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it doesn't matter what did or did not happen. The
divorce and the reasons are history _ though far less memorable
than the history Johnson created for the Mariners and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   His only regret is the way it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for a lot of people. The Seattle fans. My teammates
in Seattle. My family and myself. I just felt like this was a
little drawn out and much like the Lewinsky-Clinton deal. No one
wants to hear about it, but all we kept hearing about in Seattle
was when or who is going to get Randy,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   They say baseball is a business. That is why Randy Johnson is no
longer a Mariner, since someone, somewhere decided Johnson was one
Mighty Mariner they could not, would not afford.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball is also a daily psychology lesson. And Sunday, when
Johnson became a winner in the National League for the first time
since the Expos traded him to the Mariners in 1989, he seemed
satisfied with one very important element:
</P>
<P>
   The Astros want him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did not. So he just wanted to say one more thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``For nine years, the fans in Seattle treated me very nicely.
They always gave a nice ovation. There are probably some things I
did that I would not have been able to do without the fans'
encouragement. So I just want to say again that I'll miss my
teammates back there in Seattle and the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said to tell everyone ``Hey.''

<P>
   Connecticut used to be known as ``The Land of Steady Habits,''
but that was before an ad agency came up with ``Connecticut, We're
Full of Surprises.'' The earlier nickname was better. While it is
true that the state did go through a disquieting period when large
structures were collapsing left and right _ a hotel here, a bridge
there _ it really does not like all that much excitement. I covered
the capitol for a long time, and the only surprise I can remember
was the day the state Senate, caught in a violent battle between
fans of the deer and fans of the whale, dyspeptically voted to name
the human being official state animal.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's incumbent governor, John Rowland, a Republican,
may be familiar to out-of-state residents for his starring role in
tourism promotion commercials. (Americans who plan their vacations
on the basis of the local elected officials' affinity for water
sports will remember that Rowland is the one in the canoe with his
wife, while New York's George Pataki was the guy teaching a little
boy to fish.) Rowland's opponent this fall will be Rep. Barbara
Kennelly of Hartford. As surprises go, it was at least a bit of one
that she would give up her very safe seat to make the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've virtually got to have a lobotomy, and you could still
get re-elected if the economy's good if you're the governor,'' said
Bill Clinton at a Kennelly fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a remark designed to bring the party faithful to
their feet cheering. ``He was just having too good a time,'' said
someone who sat with the president at the $5,000-a-plate luncheon
catered by Martha Stewart. Clinton caught himself in time to assure
the crowd that he was not trying to suggest that John Rowland had
had a lobotomy. But he obviously did mean that Barbara Kennelly
would have a tough time winning even if surgeons disconnected the
frontal lobe of the governor's cerebrum between now and November.
The president couched this as a tribute to Mrs. Kennelly's
political courage, but it was pretty dispiriting all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has been talking a lot about cities and schools and
doling out tax cuts, but it is not as if there is nothing to carp
about. Like New York, Connecticut's economic upturn is lagging
behind the nation's, and the state labors under a disproportionate
amount of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no economic development strategy. Where we've given
publicly subsidized economic development aid, 86 percent of the
jobs never materialized,'' said Bill Curry, who ran against Rowland
in 1994. Curry, obsessed with policy, wanted to try again this
year, but party elders seemed to feel voters would prefer Mrs.
Kennelly's warm persona to an analysis of Rowland's privatization
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the congresswoman, having made the jump, seemed to sink like
a stone. She turned out to be a terrible speech maker, as well as a
teller of truths who grimly assured reporters that yes, the polls
did matter. Deconstructing Rowland's administration began to look
like a better idea, and a former state legislator who is known as a
policy whiz was grafted onto the ticket as the candidate for
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, making a local visit, told Mrs.
Kennelly's staff to keep her away from big speaking engagements and
get her in close to the voters, where she is most impressive. At
the Martha Stewart lunch, someone complimented the president on his
wife's knowledge of Connecticut politics. ``We've been talking
about this race,'' said Clinton, launching into a dissection of
local politics. You would have thought that he came from the Lower
Naugatuck Valley. Then the greatest campaigner of our generation
walked up to the dais and delivered the lobotomy speech.

SEAHAWKS' TOP PICK SIMMONS OUT 2-4 WEEKS WITH KNEE INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Just when things were going so well for Anthony
Simmons, the Seahawks' first-round draft choice could be sidelined
up to a month with torn cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, a linebacker from Clemson, was injured in Friday
night's preseason opener at Dallas and is scheduled to have
arthroscopic surgery Monday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that happens,'' Simmons said Sunday.
``It's really nothing you can prevent, but it's something that you
can deal with. Right now, I just have to deal with it and take time
to heal up.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury was originally called a bruised knee and not
considered serious. Now Simmons will miss at least two weeks, but
more likely four.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was just one of several players injured in the 20-19
victory over the Cowboys, and he was not the most serious.
</P>
<P>
   Backup center Frank Beede is expected to miss the season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, coach Dennis
Erickson said. Additional tests to determine the extent of the
damage will be made when the swelling in the joint subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Also injured were starting middle linebacker Dean Wells, who
strained his right calf muscle; backup linebacker Michael Barber,
who has a bruised back; and reserve safety Eric Stokes, who
aggravated his left hamstring, which he pulled last summer and
forced him to miss most of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Barber and Stokes are scheduled to return to Seattle _ Barber to
have a magnetic resonance imaging test; Stokes to have blood
drained from his thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve center Greg Bloedorn (sprained knee ligament) and backup
running back Steve Broussard (strained calf muscle) already were
sidelined with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned about injuries,'' said Erickson, who
lost 17 starters for a total of 72 games last year. ``But that's
part of the game. Every team gets guys hurt. You just hope it's not
serious enough that you lose somebody for the whole season. That
happened to one of our players (Beede). That's bad, but that's part
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wells, Simmons and Barber all standing on the sideline,
outside linebacker Jason Kyle worked in the middle during Sunday's
90-minute practice. But Wells and Barber are expected to play in
Saturday night's preseason home opener against the Indianapolis
Colts at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   As for the center position, backup guard Chris Gray becomes No.
2 and Washington State rookie Jason McEndoo is No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons wasn't just in camp on time _ only the second Seahawks
first-round pick to do so since 1982 _ he was having a good camp.
The rookie linebacker was using his speed and play-making ability
to contribute on special teams while learning the defense. He was
drawing praise from his coaches and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Now Simmons is sidelined with the first knee injury of his
career, and he can't even recall the play in happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a setback for him. He needs to practice. He really needs
it badly,'' Erickson said. ``It's going to set him back some. He
just needs to study and mentally be in it.''

MARINERS RELIEVER-TURNED-STARTER RATTLES YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He struck out the side in the first inning, fanned two
more in the second and another in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad Randy Johnson impersonation on Sunday by Paul
Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   With 47,872 fans at the Kingdome wondering just how the Mariners
are going to replace the departed Johnson, who was traded to the
Houston Astros on Friday, Spoljaric set the tone for the Mariners'
6-3 victory over the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander pitched into the fifth inning, exited with a
two-run lead and the Mariner bullpen maintained the edge as Seattle
ended a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner's two-run homer off Yankee starter David Cone (15-4)
in the seventh inning put the Mariners ahead by three runs, and
Mike Timlin secured his sixth save despite a scare in New York's
three-hit ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight was on Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work as a starter for the first time this season and
felt a little uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little too excited in the first inning after (striking
out) the first two batters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill rocked the reliever-turned-starter with a home run,
and Spoljaric promptly walked the next two batters before striking
out Jorge Posada to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got out of the first inning, I relaxed and did what I
wanted to do and actually felt comfortable out there,'' he said.
``It was an adrenaline rush, but I just ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric departed two outs too early to qualify for the win.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't wind up with any outrageous expectations, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Randy Johnson and will never be Randy Johnson,''
Spoljaric said. ``Maybe someday I will be as successful as him, but
I won't be a strikeout pitcher. As long as you make the pitches
against any team, even a team as good as the Yankees, you can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella said Spoljaric earned further starting
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched very well before getting a little tired in the
fourth inning, and rightfully so,'' Piniella said. ``He threw more
pitches (last night) than any game this season. It's not easy doing
what he did, but he seemed very relaxed and smooth out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Used primarily as a setup reliever in 41 appearances this
season, pitching just 442/3 innings, Spoljaric threw a season-high
76 pitches against the Yankees, who lost for only the 28th time in
105 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said the plan is to increase Spoljaric's running
routine to build stamina and give the left-hander another start in
about two weeks when a fifth starter is again needed.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin, meanwhile, has emerged as Seattle's main man at the end
of games and has six saves in seven save opportunities. But Sunday
the right-hander deflected the attention he was getting toward
Spoljaric, whose locker is directly across the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Almost one year ago, they were involved in a trade-deadline deal
bringing them from Toronto to Seattle for outfielder Jose Cruz Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good stuff and can do the job as a starter or
reliever,'' Timlin said of Spoljaric. ``To me, he is capable of
giving this team quality innings.''
</P>
<P>
   As the shock of the Johnson trade begins to wear off, Timlin
said it was important for the team to treat the former ace's
departure as an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we have to look at it (is) as him going on the
disabled list, like he blew out his back or something,'' Timlin
said. ``There is no reason for us to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners gave up an early run Sunday but retaliated in the
second inning when catcher Joe Oliver singled home Edgar Martinez
from second base.
</P>
<P>
   They took the lead for good in the third, thanks to a botched
play by Yankee first baseman Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and one out, David Segui lined a shot at
Spencer, who dropped the ball and was able to get only a force out
at second base. The botched double play enabled Alex Rodriguez to
score from third to break a 1-1 tie, and Buhner followed with a
run-scoring single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, 4-for-15 with two home runs lifetime against Cone going
into the series finale, provided the clinching blow with his eighth
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The three RBIs give Buhner 22 in 21 games since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   New York, boasting the best record in major league baseball,
continued to play longball against the M's. The Yankees hit two
more homers, by O'Neill and Chad Curtis, and now have 18 this
season against Seattle pitchers.

BLAME MARINER OWNERS FOR RANDY JOHNSON TRADE BUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There is a lesson for Mariner owners in the Randy
Johnson trade: Stay out of the way when it comes to baseball
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The M's ended up with much less for Johnson than they were
offered back on June 2, when a still unnamed owner blocked a
proposed trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers that would have netted
experienced right-handed starting pitcher Ismael Valdes,
infielder/outfielder Wilton Guerrero and a minor-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on and off the team say the owner was Nintendo of
America executive Howard Lincoln. Whether he blocked the deal and
why remain closely guarded secrets; the owners aren't willing to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the decision forced Woody Woodward, the vice
president of baseball operations, to play a high-stakes poker game
as Friday night's non-waiver trading deadline approached.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the best pitcher in franchise history, already had made
it known numerous times that he wouldn't return to Seattle next
season, and if he wasn't traded, the M's would have had to offer
the unhappy left-hander salary arbitration just to get two draft
choices next June.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the deadline, the less room Woodward had to maneuver.
By Friday, his only hope for leverage was a bidding war between the
New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians. And that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Yankees said owner George Steinbrenner's
only interest in Johnson now was to make sure he didn't join the
Indians. Steinbrenner wanted to keep his own powerful team intact
for a probable World Series appearance and planned to pursue
Johnson in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Indians general manager John Hart concluded that he
had virtually no chance of signing Johnson to a long-term contract,
so he wasn't willing to deal players with major-league experience
and, according to those familiar with negotiations, never made a
concrete offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking competition from Cleveland, the Yankees began
subtracting from a list of available players that originally
included pitcher Hideki Irabu, second baseman Homer Bush, reliever
Ramiro Mendoza, outfielder Ricky Ledee and minor-league infielder
Mike Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking toward the 9 p.m. PDT deadline, Woodward
called other teams that had expressed interest in Johnson _ the
Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants and Baltimore Orioles. He
eventually settled for three Astro minor-leaguers _ pitcher Freddy
Garcia, infielder Carlos Guillen and a player to be named later,
possibly within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners now have a blueprint on how not to handle a similar
situation. In the future, when a player in the final year of a
contract says he doesn't want to play for the team, they should
trade him long before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership should have realized Johnson was a short-timer two
years ago when he told an Arizona Republic reporter in spring
training that he wanted to be the starter when the expansion
Arizona Diamondbacks played their first game. He sent the same
message last August in Chicago when he and his agents told the
Mariners not to offer him a contract extension because he wouldn't
be back.
</P>
<P>
   What the M's couldn't have known was Johnson's reaction when
they announced in November that no extension would be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acted hurt. And instead of using his option year as a
springboard toward a lucrative deal elsewhere as a free agent, he
did not consistently show the fire or focus that made him the most
dominating pitcher in the major leagues during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He's gone now, but shouldn't be forgotten _ especially by the
owners who let him go at too low a price.

 DEFENSE HELPS SELE SETTLE DOWN (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By DONALD EMMONS c.1998 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR; ARLINGTON, Texas Q The evening started out precariously for
Rangers
right-hander Aaron Sele last night.  &QL; P &QR; He gave up two runs on two
hits in the first inning against the Chicago
White Sox and appeared on his way to remaining winless in seven
outings since the All-Star break.  &QL; P &QR; However, Sele settled down as
the Rangers rolled to a 12-3 drubbing of the
White Sox before 28,175 at The Ballpark in Arlington.  &QL; P &QR; RI
struggled a little bit early, but I kind of gritted my teeth and
came
back and pitched well,S said Sele, who earned his 13th decision of
the year, tying a career high for a season. RIt was just a matter
of making some changes to get the ball down.S  &QL; P &QR; Sele (13-8)
pitched eight innings, allowing three runs on 10 hits while
striking out two and walking two. After allowing the White Sox to
score another run in the second, he had little trouble the rest of
the game, until he was replaced after throwing 110 pitches, 78 of
them strikes.  &QL; P &QR; The decision ended an 0-3 showing over four games
for Sele, who hadnUt won
since July 4. It also helped to restore his earned-run-average that
had ballooned to 4.51 over his previous six outings.  &QL; P &QR; RAaron
bounced back after struggling with his command in the first and
second innings,S Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. RAfter that, I
thought he made a lot of quality pitches.S  &QL; P &QR; However, Oates
considered SeleUs first victory in nearly a month a product
of sound pitching and a sure-gloved defense inspired by two
newcomers Q third baseman Todd Zeile and shortstop Royce Clayton.
 &QL; P &QR; Acquired in trades, Zeile and Clayton each made fielding plays
that helped
kill potential early scoring opportunities for the White Sox.  &QL; P &QR; RI
think our pitcher saw a couple of plays [by Zeile and Clayton] made
tonight that gave him confidence,S Oates said. RThe pitchers see we
can take care of the ball and score some runs. That can spread all
over.  &QL; P &QR; R[Sele] started getting the ball down.S
 &QL; P &QR; Sele, who said he never got down on himself during the recent
winless
period, also credited his defensive support Q particularly a
revamped left side of the infield Q for the win.  &QL; P &QR; RI was happy
that the first inning didnUt turn into a bigger inning [for
the White Sox],S Sele said. RI was able to stay out there and they
did the rest.S

ZEILE, RANGERS RIP WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers wanted to upgrade at shortstop
and in the rotation, so they traded for Royce Clayton and Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile, the other guy general manager Doug Melvin brought in
during the Friday trading frenzy? Oh yeah, part of the cost for
Clayton and Stottlemyre was Fernando Tatis, so the team needed a
third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ``other guy'' is the best guy.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile reached base in all five plate appearances and made all
the plays in the field yesterday as the Rangers thumped the Chicago
White Sox, 12-3, at The Ballpark in Arlington to reclaim sole
possession of first place in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile walked three times, hit his second home run in two games,
and had another homer taken away when White Sox right fielder
Magglio Ordonez brought it back in the park and ``held'' him to a
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what Todd Zeile's done getting on base,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``And he's played some mighty fine third base
both nights.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 5-for-6 _ a sparkling .833 average _ with two homers, four
runs batted in, four runs scored and three walks in his first two
games in a Texas uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier, starting off the way I have,'' Zeile
said. ``To see two wins since I've been here is great. I think
everyone is energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, good things also are happening for the lineup as a
whole. The Rangers had 17 hits last night, including homers by
Zeile, Roberto Kelly, Lee Stevens and Rusty Greer. The first eight
hits and seven runs came off White Sox starter Jaime Navarro
(8-13).
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (13-8) benefited from the booming bats to win for the
first time since July 4. He gave the offense a chance to put it
away by pitching six shutout innings after giving up two runs in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Sele didn't have to be that good, because the offense has come
out of a collective slump. The Rangers have 29 hits and six homers
in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Those are, of course, the first two games since the new players
joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days have been a lot of fun,'' Oates said.
``Maybe the new guys are trying to impress us, and maybe the old
guys are trying to impress the new guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the most impressive moment last night was the home run
that Stevens hit in the third inning. He turned on a fastball by
Navarro and clubbed it far and deep down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   The only question was whether it would be fair or foul. Stevens
tried to influence it by leaning to the left as he trotted toward
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to keep it fair a little bit,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit the foul pole, about five feet from the top. If it
wasn't still going up, it had barely started coming down. It was
measured at 385 feet, the distance from the plate to where it hit
the pole. If it hadn't been stopped, it might have carried another
100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A little higher and to the left, and Stevens might have hit the
``win a free suit'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also singled in the eighth, and is 7-for-12 in his last
four games to come out of a deep slump.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball being what it is, Stevens and his slumping teammates
surely would have broken out sooner or later. After all, this is a
team that leads the majors in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   That the surge happened when Oates began putting Zeile and
Clayton in the lineup is more than a coincidence, though. Zeile
replaced Tatis, who had three homers in 95 games, and Clayton _ who
had two hits yesterday _ replaced Kevin Elster, who was hitting in
the .230s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind we improved our lineup on a
consistent basis,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement so far is the ``other guy.''

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Guard Everett McIver could practice as
early as Wednesday, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. McIver didn't
play in the preseason game against the Seahawks because of a neck
wound suffered in a dormitory incident at Midwestern State that
Cowboys coaches termed ``horseplay.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jones nor Cowboys coach Chan Gailey would comment on
Saturday's Star-Telegram report that wide receiver Michael Irvin
was involved in the incident. ``We've said all we are going to say
about it,'' Jones said. When asked about the report after practice,
Irvin had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   McIver was not at practice and could not be reached for comment.
Don't blame Cunningham
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey took the heat off kicker Richie
Cunningham, who drew some criticism from fans for missing an extra
point and a 46-yard field-goal attempt during the loss to the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said those misses came when backup center Steve Scifres
was the snapper. Scifres' snaps were a bit slower than those of
regular snapper Dale Hellestrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not bad snaps,'' Gailey said. ``It's just not the
same rhythm. So your stride is a little bit off _ just enough to
make you miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae was the snapper when Cunningham converted 25- and
20-yard field goals and an extra point against Seattle. But Gailey
wanted to also give Scifres some playing time, just in case he's
needed in a critical situation during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when \RHellestrae\S might get an injury, and
you might not have the first-team snapper,'' Gailey said. ``That's
something Richie has to see and know and make a little adjustment
on his part, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cunningham took the blame for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really got no excuse missing those kicks,'' he said. ``I
just came up too fast on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cunningham was the second-most accurate kicker in the
NFL. He was 34 of 37 on field-goal attempts _ 91.9 percent _ and
was 24-of-24 on extra-point kicks.
Mills shut out
Free-agent signee Ernie Mills was supposed to be the front-runner
to start at wide receiver opposite Michael Irvin. But Gailey found
himself explaining why no passes were thrown to Mills against
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't have anything to do with him or anything,'' Gailey
said. ``He played the same as he had. It just worked out that we
didn't have any passes called that way during the course of the
ballgame.''
He's No. 3
Despite a rock-solid performance by rookie free-agent Danny
Gonzalez against Seattle, he is not about to unseat Jason Garrett
as the No. 2 quarterback. At least that's what Gailey said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was 9-of-12 passing for 105 yards against the Seahawks.
His totals included eight consecutive completions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did surprise me,'' Gailey said. ``And that's not fair to
him for it to surprise me, because I had really no basis except
practice. He'd had limited reps at practice, so I'd never seen
that. \RBut\S I love those kind of surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free-agent wide receiver Jeff Odgen also surprised Gailey
when he ran the wrong route on one play, but still wound up making
a reception from Gonzalez. Odgen finished with a team-high four
catches for 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the passes \ROdgen\S caught, he wasn't in the right
spot, but he caught it,'' Gailey said. ``What's bad is he and Danny
were obviously on the same page.''
Woodson-Sanders up in air
The Cowboys have not decided whether Pro Bowl safety Darren Woodson
and Pro Bowl cornerback Deion Sanders will play in Thursday's
scrimmage in El Paso against the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson (shoulder, triceps) and Sanders (ankle) were held out of
the Seattle game for precautionary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said: ``We need to see where they are with the injuries,
and the rehab stuff.''
They said it ``''I've never seen nothing like that before.''''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The House stands Monday on the threshold of approving the most
sweeping overhaul of election fund-raising laws since Watergate.
Few in Washington gave campaign finance reform any chance earlier
this year. But last Thursday and Friday, the House dramatically
rejected 16 amendments designed to kill off reform legislation.
Dozens of Republicans defied Newt Gingrich in those votes. If
pro-reform lawmakers stay together on Monday, the House can approve
the Shays-Meehan bill banning unlimited ``soft money'' donations to
political parties, the very donations at the center of the recent
fund-raising scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill needs to win by the widest possible
margin. That is because of unusual parliamentary rules crafted by
Gingrich, in which any bill that gets the most votes this week
wins. If the Shays-Meehan measure is approved, Gingrich will
probably lobby immediately for a watered-down version in order to
trump it. A separate measure backed by a bipartisan group of
freshman members would, for example, ban soft-money contributions
to national party organizations but permit them for state parties,
opening a huge loophole. Approval of the Shays-Meehan bill on
Monday, and the quick dispatch of competing versions, would clear
the way for final passage by the end of the week. The bill would
then go to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The cynics say reform has no chance in the Senate even if it
passes the House. These same experts said House Republicans would
never defy their leadership and join with Democrats to back reform.
But under pressure from Christopher Shays of Connecticut, they did.
In New York, Sherwood Boehlert, Amo Houghton, Sue Kelly, Michael
Forbes, James Walsh and Benjamin Gilman voted again and again to
reject killer amendments. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut joined with
Marge Roukema, Bob Franks, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank LoBiondo
of New Jersey to do the same. Tom Campbell and Zach Wamp,
Republicans from California and Tennessee, showed particular
courage. Also impressive were the efforts of Richard Gephardt and
David Bonior to help Martin Meehan of Massachusetts keep Democratic
votes in line.
</P>
<P>
   By banning soft-money donations to parties and curbing
fund-raising for campaign ads by single-issue advocacy groups, the
Shays-Meehan bill would drastically reduce the role of
special-interest money in elections. Why would anyone allow such
corruption to continue now that the opportunity for reform is here?

DEFENSE HELPS SELE SETTLE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONALD EMMONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The evening started out precariously for
Rangers right-hander Aaron Sele last night.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up two runs on two hits in the first inning against the
Chicago White Sox and appeared on his way to remaining winless in
seven outings since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sele settled down as the Rangers rolled to a 12-3
drubbing of the White Sox before 28,175 at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled a little bit early, but I kind of gritted my teeth
and came back and pitched well,'' said Sele, who earned his 13th
decision of the year, tying a career high for a season. ``It was
just a matter of making some changes to get the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele (13-8) pitched eight innings, allowing three runs on 10
hits while striking out two and walking two. After allowing the
White Sox to score another run in the second, he had little trouble
the rest of the game, until he was replaced after throwing 110
pitches, 78 of them strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ended an 0-3 showing over four games for Sele, who
hadn't won since July 4. It also helped to restore his
earned-run-average that had ballooned to 4.51 over his previous six
outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron bounced back after struggling with his command in the
first and second innings,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``After that, I thought he made a lot of quality pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Oates considered Sele's first victory in nearly a month
a product of sound pitching and a sure-gloved defense inspired by
two newcomers _ third baseman Todd Zeile and shortstop Royce
Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired in trades, Zeile and Clayton each made fielding plays
that helped kill potential early scoring opportunities for the
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our pitcher saw a couple of plays \Rby Zeile and
Clayton\S made tonight that gave him confidence,'' Oates said.
``The pitchers see we can take care of the ball and score some
runs. That can spread all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RSele\S started getting the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who said he never got down on himself during the recent
winless period, also credited his defensive support _ particularly
a revamped left side of the infield _ for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy that the first inning didn't turn into a bigger
inning \Rfor the White Sox\S,'' Sele said. ``I was able to stay out
there and they did the rest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   He has a scar on his chin and regular features. His manner is
polite. He leaves money for the groceries he steals and a
handwritten note naming the owner of the vehicle he took. The press
regularly calls him an ``outdoorsman,'' an honorific with overtones
of class demarcation. He has lived in isolation long enough to
remain unspecific in the eyes of his neighbors in western North
Carolina. His childhood was blurred, to outside eyes at least, by
his family's strange beliefs, his manner withdrawn even in ninth
grade, when he wrote a school paper denying the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But when Eric Rudolph, 31, is finally captured and if evidence
warrants his indictment for the fatal January bombing of a
Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic _ and if he is charged too for
the 1996 bombings at Olympic Park in Atlanta _ the shadows will
begin to fall away. Rudolph has been on the run for six months and
is believed to be hiding in North Carolina's Nantahala National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   As a fugitive, Rudolph has elicited sympathy among a few
residents of the area. A number of things make this possible, if
perverse. His belief in a militant white separatism that is
anti-abortion, anti-homosexual and anti-government finds echoes in
a region where white separatist organizations are known to have
taken refuge. In a place full of ``outdoorsmen,'' what some
residents seem to be feeling is something akin to the respect a
hunter feels for his prey. The implicit absence of that respect at
the FBI _ its determination simply to get its man in a businesslike
manner _ merely adds to the unpopularity of a strong government
presence where government has never been particularly welcome. The
search itself embodies the conflict between terrain, on the running
man's side, and technology, on the FBI's.
</P>
<P>
   But what really enables even this limited expression of local
sympathy is vagueness. The cruelty and indecency of the Birmingham
bombing has been echoed, so far, by nothing in Rudolph's words. No
one has heard them. It is easy enough to imagine oneself in
Rudolph's place, on the run, for his predicament is far better
known from movies and television than he is. It is much harder to
imagine just who and what kind of person could have detonated the
bomb at the New Woman All Women Health Care Center.

   Frank Hayes Wheaton Jr., who served for three decades as head of
Wheaton Industries, a Millville, N.J., glass manufacturer founded
by his grandfather, died on July 21 at the University of
Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 85 and a lifelong
resident of Millville.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton Industries, formerly the Wheaton Glass Works, was built
into the country's largest family-operated glass company by his
father, and Wheaton expanded its operations overseas. Wheaton makes
everything from fine crystal to table glassware to plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton entered the family business in 1935 after attending
Boston College. He became chief executive in the mid-1950s and
served until dissatisfied family members replaced him in 1991. The
company was later sold to Alusuisse-Lonza Holding Ltd. of Zurich,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton was president of Wheaton Village, a glass museum in
Millville that he founded and endowed. A boating enthusiast, he
also served as president of Dorchester Shipbuilding Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton is survived by his wife, Mary Bainbridge Wheaton; a son,
Frank H. III, of Jacksonville, Fla.; three daughters, Mary Edith
Smith of Newington, N.H., Susan Ball of Greenwich, Conn., and Nancy
Wheaton of Gardnerville, Nev.; a brother, Laur Don Wheaton of Rose

BRAZIL IS THE REIGNING POWER IN BEACH VOLLEYBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gold medalists were Brazilian. The runners-up were
Australian. The sand was Canadian. The Goodwill Games women's beach
volleyball final at Wollman Rink Sunday further proved that the
sport no longer belongs to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The power has shifted to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
where there are more than 200 volleyball nets along a two-mile
stretch of sand. The top players have their own coach, their own
trainer and their own masseuse _ the same luxuries afforded soccer
star Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder Brazil rules the beach? Shelda Bede and Adriana
Behar continued the bullying on a sparkling afternoon in Central
Park Sunday, dispatching Australia's Pauline Manser and Kerri
Pottharst by 12-9, 12-5 in front of 2,800 spectators. The victory
gave Brazil a sweep of the men's and women's events at the games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming a familiar scene. Another Brazilian women's team
won the 1997 world championships and the 1996 Olympics. Bede and
Behar lead the world professional tour and would appear to be the
early favorites for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lots of confidence,'' said Holly McPeak of the
United States, who earlier teamed with Lisa Arce to defeat Italy's
Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi, 12-11, 12-3, for the bronze
medal. ``It's a confidence knowing you can perform every game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-5-inch Bede and the 5-9 Behar wear down opponents
with well-placed serves and consistency. They dive for balls that
would land for winners against less agile players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponents make mistakes before we do,'' Bede said through
the translation of her teammate. ``We are calm and concentrated.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behar said she and Bede practice jump-serving an hour a day, a
ritual unheard of elsewhere. In the second game, Bede served three
aces in a row between the tall, muscular Australians to give Brazil
a 6-1 lead and little hindrance to a $30,000 payday. The
Australians will share $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for McPeak and Arce, the once top-ranked duo must find a way
to improve without a domestic tour, which collapsed last year.
Their solution? Move temporarily to Brazil.

RED SOX BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ With their 8-7 loss to the Boston Red Sox Sunday night
at Edison Field, the Angels fell out of first place and nobody in
the home clubhouse was very happy about it. In fact, the Angels
made a couple of roster moves after the game, and manager Terry
Collins promised there would be more to come _ soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox ran off to an 8-0 lead and held off an Angels rally
before 35,763 fans, completing a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have lost five of six on the homestand, with the AL
Central-leading Cleveland Indians in town for three games beginning
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   They fell one game behind Texas in the AL West, a spot in the
standings that seems more fitting for a team that has lost 20 of 29
since June 30. The Angels had held first place in the division for
all but six days since June 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels managed to make this one interesting after the Red
Sox scored four runs in the first, one in the third, one in the
fifth and two more in the sixth on a Mo Vaughn homer to go up 8-0
against Angels starter Jason Dickson (9-9). But the Angels rallied
in the bottom of the sixth off Red Sox starter Tim Wakefield
(13-5), who sailed through five innings, allowing only one hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Angels sent 11 batters to the plate and scored
six runs. They got five hits, including Garret Anderson's two-run
homer (No. 12), three walks, a sacrifice fly and an error by
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to make a game of it.
</P>
<P>
   They scored another in the ninth off Red Sox closer Tom Gordon
but came up short when Anderson grounded out to first with the
potential tying run on first. Anderson, whose hitting streak was
snapped at 28 games Saturday, had three hits Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say Anderson isn't going anywhere, but the same
isn't true for others. After the game, the Angels sent second
baseman Justin Baughman and left-handed reliever Mike Holtz to
Triple-A Vancouver, called up left-handed reliever Trevor Wilson
and activated second baseman Randy Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   Other moves are coming, Collins promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make some changes,'' he said. ``Shake things up
here. We've got to find the right mix, find a way to get it done.
We need to start getting people's attention and getting it done on
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have not been happy with the production of Dave
Hollins (.244, 10 homers, 36 RBI) or Cecil Fielder (.241, 17
homers, 68 RBI). Even though Fielder has decent power numbers and
leads the team in RBI, he has struggled in key situations, hitting
just .169 with runners in scoring position and two out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are trying to find a spot on the roster for Todd
Greene, and releasing a veteran might be the only way to do it.
However, Hollins is making $1.9 this season and is guaranteed $1.9
next year. Fielder is making $2.8 million this year and is owed
about $900,000 for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh really?'' Angels DH Tim Salmon said when told changes would
be made. ``There's no question we have to do some things to shake
things up a little bit. . . . Yeah, I think I'm going down. Just
joking. I'm not going to speculate on who they will be. But this
team needs to do something to turn it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to a point where everybody knows how badly we need
to win. Sometimes you lose focus on what it takes to get a win. You
focus so much on the end result, you forget what it takes in
between, doing the little things. We need to focus on each at-bat
and playing defense each inning. And at the end of the game, cash
in and see where you're at.''

ON TO THE KENWOOD CUP WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE

<P>
   Driving across the Golden Gate Bridge recently on his way to
work, Paul Cayard gave way to idle reflection. He was an hour
behind schedule at his San Francisco office. And, trying as he is
to begin an America's Cup campaign, each of his calendar hours
looks more like a week of commitments. Not a good time to be
running late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was late,'' the 39-year-old yachtsman said recently.
``But I was thinking, `I'm not in a hurry.' A year ago, I would
have been completely stressed out. But the Whitbread race has put
everything in perspective. Alone in the Southern Ocean, the way we
were, there were those moments where you are really scared. And
that really makes an impression on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The adrenaline-charged reports that Cayard sent by satellite
from the 60-foot EF Language are history. Regarded at its finish
last May as a stunning victory for a team of mostly round-the-buoy
sailors, the achievement by the EF crew in the Whitbread Round the
World Race was a personal triumph for Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is back to rounding orange buoys, and the next event
on the list is the 11th biennial Kenwood Cup, which is scheduled to
begin today off Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard has agreed to sail as tactician on Illbruck-Pinta, a One
Design 48 being chartered for the Hawaii series by an aspiring
around-the-world team from Germany. The Germans are so committed to
the next equivalent of the Whitbread in 2001-2002, which will be
called the Volvo Ocean Race, that they purchased EF Language and EF
Education, both former Whitbread competitors _ for training
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of Illbruck-Pinta will be John Kostecki of San
Francisco, the regular Illbruck skipper who also happens to have
signed on with Cayard for the America One 1999-2000 America's Cup
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard is struggling to find the $20 million or more in
corporate sponsorship that he and most of the other 15 cup
challengers are still seeking. In addition, Cayard has lost several
key members of his team.
</P>
<P>
   The first defection came last year when Laurent Esquier,
Cayard's veteran cup manager, took a job with Prada, the Italian
challenger. Last spring, Steve Erickson, a longtime friend and
sailing cohort in the Whitbread Round the World Race, also took a
position with Prada. Then last week, Kimo Worthington left America
One. Worthington is expected to sign on with Young America, the New
York Yacht Club team.
</P>
<P>
   For Kostecki, a vital member of the America One effort and still
loyal to Cayard, sailing with his America's Cup boss is a two-way
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, adding Paul Cayard to our Illbruck-Pinta crew is a
nice bonus for the Kenwood Cup,'' Kostecki said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day Kenwood series includes eight day races: four ocean
triangles and four windward-leeward courses of about 10-12 nautical
miles each. On Friday is a 150-mile middle-distance race from
Honolulu to Maui, and on Aug. 11, a 376-mile race from Oahu to Maui
and back.
</P>
<P>
   America's Cup teams are revving up their intensity now, with
many sailors choosing to hone their skills in the Kenwood Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the One Design 48 yachts have been transported to Hawaii
for the regatta. Their presence is being felt by Ken Morrison,
Kenwood's race director for the last 20 years. Since its inception
as the Clipper Cup in 1978, the biennial regatta has featured team
racing based on handicap rules for differently designed boats.
</P>
<P>
   But that mix is eroding. A weak Asian economy this year has
reduced the number of handicap entries from Japan, Australia and
New Zealand. In 1982, there were a record 82 boats; now there are
about 30.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the six 1D48 yachts are not competing in the
long-distance race because of a tight shipping schedule. That
leaves 24 boats to sail the last and most important race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look very closely at the proliferation of One
Design 48's,'' Morrison said about realistic prospects for a
greater one-design fleet in the Kenwood Cup 2000.

VELARDE SET FOR SECOND COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ No, the Angels didn't make a trade, but they will have
some ``new faces'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde will rejoin the team tonight and start at second
base after completing a rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A
Vancouver. It will be Velarde's second ``comeback'' of the season.
Following reconstructive elbow surgery in April of 1997, Velarde
came back and played in games May 13 and 14, going 3 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   However, he suffered a stress fracture in the elbow and had to
shut it down again.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said Velarde won't necessarily
start every day. Instead, he will monitor the condition of the
second baseman's elbow daily.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Velarde on the roster, the Angels sent rookie
Justin Baughman to Vancouver. Baughman hit .245 with one homer and
20 RBI in 57 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want Justin Baughman sitting on the bench,'' Collins
said. ``He's too good a prospect to not be playing every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also called up left-handed pitcher Trevor Wilson
(5-9, 3.62 ERA at Vancouver), replacing struggling reliever Mike
Holtz. Holtz is 2-1 with a 5.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Holtz needs to go pitch and get his confidence back,''
Collins said. ``He lost the feel for his curveball. It's not as
sharp. He has one of the toughest jobs in the game. He had to come
in and face Ken Griffey Jr., Mo Vaughn, the best lefties in the
game. It's not like he has to face me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of the business,'' Holtz said. ``You don't do
your job, you start over. That's what I'm going to do. You can be
bummed out, and I'm certainly not happy. But the best way I can
help this team is to go down, work hard and get back to what got me
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Add call-ups: Catcher Charlie O'Brien also will join the team
today. O'Brien, acquired in a trade from the White Sox for two
minor leaguers last Thursday, has been out with a broken right
thumb. He is eligible to come off the disabled list today, but he
won't be activated for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Hill feeling fine: Pitcher Ken Hill (elbow) threw Sunday and
felt fine. He'll throw again Wednesday before beginning a rehab
assignment Sunday at Cedar Rapids because the Angels will be in
nearby Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he feels is going to be the No.1 thing, but we plan to
have three (rehab starts) scheduled,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Matchup for the ages: When third baseman Troy Glaus, who
celebrates his 22nd birthday today, faced Dennis Eckersley, 43, of
the Red Sox in the eighth inning Sunday, one could say there was a
definite generation gap. In 1976, the year Glaus was born,
Eckersley went 13-12 with a 3.44 ERA in 36 games (30 starts) for
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Against Eckersley, Glaus hit a comebacker and was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Projecting Erstad: Darin Erstad continues to play at a
record-breaking pace. His projected season totals in hits (203),
doubles (49), total bases (345) and extra-base hits (81) would be
Angels records.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 homers and 19 stolen bases, Erstad has a chance to
become only the second Angel ever to have a 30-30 season. In 1977,
Bobby Bonds hit 37 homers and stole 41 bases.

ARRIVALS HELP GIVE RANGERS NEW ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Two scenes keep running through the head, as
the Rangers get adjusted to Todd Zeile's .833 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the Rangers' former shortstop, who possessed
a perpetual California tan and, alas, a terminal California
attitude. The 1996 Rangers had just returned from their potentially
calamitous September swing through Seattle and Anaheim. Their
season-long division lead was shriveling. Their throats were
clenching. Concern was the order of the day in the silent Rangers
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Except at Kevin Elster's locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' a smiling Elster tried to explained, ``the important
thing is that we're having fun. This is just a game, and we're
still having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Whoopee cushions and Hootie and the Blowfish tickets for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The second memorable scene comes from the 1993 World Series. The
mayor of Philadelphia, Frank Rizzo, looking to disparage the
opposing Blue Jays, makes a politically incorrect reference to
Toronto pitcher Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the Jays had won the Series, Stottlemyre took the
microphone and, in front of citizens from two nations, suggested
that His Honor can kiss his posterior.
</P>
<P>
   The word is attitude. And the Rangers would like to think
they've dealt themselves a whole new one.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty Stottlemyre may be the social antithesis of the man
he must replace, lefty Darren Oliver. Darren's easygoing style was
once mistaken for a strong stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he had the competitive fire of a refrigerator light
bulb.
</P>
<P>
   The equally breezy Elster, while well-liked, was showing as much
range at shortstop as that other Hollywood infielder ... Rosie
O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be done. The Rangers looked like a tired,
uncertain bunch for a six-week stretch in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, whether it was waiting for the ink to
dry on the new owner's bill of sale or for the starting pitchers to
actually get someone out, this team lost its edge. Its confidence
vanished in a week, while losing back-to-back home series in June
to the Angels and the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the heat. It was the futility.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's dramatic dealings, therefore, were a wakeup call long
overdue. It was management's way of applying its shoes to the rear
of the players' pants.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been, for lack of a better word, electrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, the new third baseman, has enjoyed a Roy Hobbs debut.
After a three-hit, three-RBI opening game, he came back last night
and missed a two-homer game by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton, Elster's successor at shortstop, has brandished
an active bat and a hustling attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude. That word again.
</P>
<P>
   And the best may be yet to come, Tuesday night when Stottlemyre,
Philadelphia's once-favorite son, takes the mound against his old
team, the Blue Jays. Stottlemyre has the demeanor, as well as the
pitching goods, to assume the staff's No. 1 role for the remainder
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver couldn't. His lackluster spring was followed by a blase,
inconsistent summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had to move on.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny. Without so much as a timely base hit, the Rangers
were seen Friday night _ the major-league deadline for trades
without waivers _ as surging past both the Angels and Seattle
Mariners. The Angels, adrift in Disneyland, will play out the
season with a pat hand. The Mariners, on the other hand, bungled
the Randy Johnson trade and then passed it off as creative
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   How times change. Before the season, the Mariners were hailed by
some as this year's World Series champions. Now they're in the
throes of rebuilding, with a lion's share of their own once-feisty
attitude, Johnson's, gone to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new guys have arrived, the Rangers have played like
the caffeine has finally kicked in. Zeile won't stop getting on
base. Clayton runs out ground balls like a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was only the Chicago White Sox and, last night in
particular, the weekly burnt offerings known as Jaime Navarro. But
it beats what the Rangers have been parading out for the past six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new attitude in town. Management hopes that it's
contagious.

GIANTS, PHILS PLAY BRAWLBALL 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ ``Dear Miss Manners, is it a breach of etiquette
to steal second base when your team is leading by seven runs in the
fifth inning? Sincerely, the San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia
Phillies.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. A simple letter like that could have spared
these two teams a lot of heartache Sunday. But ballplayers being
ballplayers, they settled it differently, with two bench-clearing
brawls that resulted in three ejections, bruises on Barry Bonds'
forehead, a certainty that the National League will suspend Bonds
for charging the mound and enough angry words to call this city's
nickname into question.
</P>
<P>
   One positive thing the Giants took from the City of Brotherly
Love Sunday was an explosive 15-3 victory. The win, their third
straight, was highlighted by back-to-back-to-back homers in the
second inning by Ellis Burks (with two aboard), Bonds and Jeff
Kent.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, the Giants also viewed the fisticuffs as a
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want things to get stirred up like that with
possible suspensions, but this doesn't put a damper on the game,''
manager Dusty Baker said. ``Sometimes something like this brings
guys closer. You're defending one another. That doesn't make it
right, but it's August, we've played 100 games and it's the summer.
You see most riots occur in the heat of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The unpleasantness began in the fifth inning, after Bonds ripped
his fourth hit in four at-bats to right field, driving pitcher Kirk
Rueter home for a 9-2 lead. With first baseman Kevin Jordan holding
him on, Bonds stole second.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, stealing a base with a seven-run lead is viewed as
pouring it on. But since Bonds did it in the middle of the game,
not toward the end, and since the Giants' pitching staff had
squandered leads of 4-0 and 6-1 in the first two games of the
series before rallying back, Bonds felt he was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when Bonds led off the seventh against new pitcher
Ricky Bottalico, the hard-throwing right-hander fired his first
pitch at Bonds' right leg, hitting him above the kneecap. Bonds,
who had expressed frustration at being hit when he was plunked
twice in Montreal last week, bolted for the mound and took
Bottalico down at the knees.
</P>
<P>
   The benches emptied and jumped on the pile. Although a lot of
words were exchanged and somebody socked Bonds in the head from
above, there were few punches thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any cheap shots,'' Giants second baseman Kent
said. ``It was a pretty professional brawl, as those things go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants felt that Bottalico threw at Bonds deliberately in
retaliation for the stolen base. In fact, Baker accused Phillies
manager Terry Francona of putting Bottalico in the game for that
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was obvious,'' Baker said. ``He pitched two
innings yesterday, and a guy like that, you wouldn't figure he'd be
in a game like this, especially after he just had an operation. It
seems to me he was probably put in there to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds defended the theft, his 19th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as baseball has been around, in the fifth inning, the
game is not over,'' he said. ``You play the game for five innings.
Now, if the guy is not holding you on, or if it's the sixth inning
or later, you give them the courtesy (of not stealing). You don't
go out there and expect a team to lay down and die. That's
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team,'' Bonds said of the Phillies. ``They keep
scoring and keep coming back. You can't take anything for granted.
We haven't been able to hold them from scoring runs. We've had
six-run leads, and other teams have come back to tie us.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Phillies saw things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Alex Arias, who would be a central player in the
second bench-clearing incident, was the most vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt he's a great player,'' Arias said of Bonds.
``But do you want to be a great player with stats that don't mean
anything? I'm sure half of his steals are like that. I never had
respect for the guy because of things like that. His own teammates
don't tolerate him. He's a stats guy. That's all he's worried
about.''
</P>
<P>
   During the brawl, Bonds and Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling
exchanged words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't saying anything to him that his own teammates weren't
saying about him on the field,'' Schilling said. ``He's a
first-ballot Hall of Famer, no doubt, but when you don't play the
game right bad things will happen. What he did was bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds knows he will be suspended, but he was not sorry he
charged the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only restrain yourself for so long,'' he said. ``You
try to handle things the best way you can. The suspension should
come to the person who started it. It shouldn't come for defending
myself. You can hit my kneecap and end my career. What am I
supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also took a swipe at Bottalico, who was ejected as well,
saying the pitch did not hurt much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got spanked worse than that,'' Bonds said. ``I'll take one
shot with a baseball over my dad spanking me for 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The other shoe dropped with two out in the bottom of the seventh
inning. Rueter, who allowed a two-run homer by Scott Rolen in the
fourth and a solo homer by Arias in the fifth, hit Arias with a
changeup or fastball, depending on your point of view. Arias
started toward the mound slowly, emptying both benches again.
</P>
<P>
   Giants catcher Brent Mayne restrained Arias and little else
happened, except for Arias shoving Giants first base coach Carlos
Alfonso as Alfonso tried to restrain him. That's a bad idea;
Alfonso is a martial-arts expert.
</P>
<P>
   Arias was ejected, but Rueter was not, because home-plate umpire
Jeff Nelson felt Rueter did not try to hit the batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a changeup,'' Rueter said. ``I tried to go inside and
it cut on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias said it was a fastball with purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing this game long enough to know it was a
fastball. There's no chance a left-hander is going to throw a
right-hander a changeup inside. I might be dumb, but I ain't
stupid,'' Arias said. ``A mistake? He hasn't made a mistake all
year. He was living on the outside corner all day, then he makes a
mistake inside? Have the decency to say you hit me and get on with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias also was upset with Baker for the way the manager
restrained him, saying, ``A manager is supposed to calm things
down, not start anything. He pushed me. I don't thank that was nice
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Baker, ``I don't care what he said. He was up in my
player's face. He was going to fight. He wasn't out there to paint.
He doesn't respect me? I don't care. Who is he in my life? Nobody.
If he don't like that, he can come up to my chest and tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an odd twist in the NL schedule, the Giants will stick
around and play the Phillies again Monday afternoon. As the man
used to say, hold on to your hats.

SUFFERING AS ILLUSION IN A SURREAL LANDSCAPE IN SANTA FE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The Santa Fe Opera's second structure _ which
opened in 1968, after the first one burned down, and has just been
rebuilt _ was perhaps unique in the extent to which it welcomed in
a spectacular natural setting without sacrificing theatrical
integrity. But it was not the only feature that made the company
distinctive. Even as access to the great outdoors has been
curtailed this season in what is effectively a third theater, the
programming remains typically adventurous, with the last piece put
in place on Saturday evening: the American premiere production of
Ingvar Lidholm's ``Dream Play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the theater has lost its character by any means, as
Colin Graham's production of ``A Dream Play'' showed. The rear of
the stage remains open to mountains and sky, and Derek McLane's
scenic design, with its low backdrop of fluffy clouds, seemed a
whimsical extension of the actual sky seen above, all in keeping
with the opera's surreality.
</P>
<P>
   The major change in the $19 million reconstruction is a new,
full roof, which closes the big gap that made audiences feel so
much a part of that natural setting, for good (on glorious starry
nights) and ill (during punishing downpours). The outdoor air still
wafts through in abundance, and the remarkable light shows
generated by the night sky are visible all around. In more
practical terms, the seating capacity has been expanded by 237, to
2,126, and theatrical capabilities have been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   But practicality seemed remote indeed on Saturday, as Lidholm's
opera, which was first performed in 1992, in Stockholm, Sweden,
transformed the house into a weird dreamscape. The work's
surreality, which seems radical even today, especially in opera,
closely mirrors that of Strindberg's ``Dream Play,'' of 1901, which
argued that ``the world, life and human beings are only an
illusion, a phantom, a dream image ... a dream become reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In play and opera, the god Indra, beset by the complaints of
humanity, sends his Daughter to earth, to investigate the human
condition. As she lives human parts _ lover, wife, mother _ and
finds disappointment, frustration and tragedy everywhere, her
Candidean innocence gives way to an oppressive understanding of the
human lot, which is ultimately saved only by its being illusory.
</P>
<P>
   Lidholm, a Swedish composer born in 1921, fits all of this out
with a wonderfully flexible score. As in much of his music, he
draws heavily but imaginatively on Stravinsky: ``The Rite of
Spring,'' on which he based his ballet ``Rites,'' of 1960, but
also, strikingly at the end, the Symphony of Psalms. There are
touches of Britten's ``Peter Grimes,'' too, yet Lidholm speaks with
an individual voice. His handling of a rich harmonic palette is
masterly, especially in chords that mutate before the ear. He is
also a virtuosic orchestrator, though he does not hesitate to set
the instruments aside for long dramatic passages by the chorus
(here, the Santa Fe Desert Chorale).
</P>
<P>
   The work was performed in Graham's English translation of
Lidholm's Swedish libretto. The central role of the Daughter is a
splendid vehicle for a lyric soprano, and Sylvia McNair turned it
into a tour de force, showing as thorough an involvement in the
quirky drama as in the vocal flights. Among the Strindbergian alter
egos, Hakan Hagegard repeated the rough-hewn role of the Officer,
which he created in Stockholm; Thomas Barrett functioned smoothly
as the Lawyer, and Richard Stilwell was commanding as the Poet,
working through to the truth with the Daughter.

   Of the lesser characters, Judith Christin was especially
effective as the Stage Door Keeper. Hal France conducted the
orchestra, which rose beautifully to Lidholm's many challenges.
</P>
<P>
   This was a rewarding evening of musical theater if hardly an
easy one. Yet the audience, evidently long accustomed to adventures
cooked up the company's general director, John Crosby, showed
admirable gumption. Few patrons left at intermission, though many,
bemused, scurried off to buy a libretto at the newly expanded gift
shop.

   Another relative novelty, on Friday evening, presented no such
problems. Tim Albery's lively production of Berlioz's ``Beatrice
and Benedict,'' also sung in English, was clever (overclever at
times) and remarkably detailed (if overbusy at times): mostly a
delight.
</P>
<P>
   It was aided by an excellent cast, headed by Susan Graham,
lustrous of voice and deft in her comic timing. The other leads,
Gordon Gietz, Elizabeth Futral and Nathan Gunn, formed a fine
ensemble vocally and dramatically. Timothy Nolen stole several
scenes as the chorus master, and Nancy Maultsby added stature to
the role of an attendant. Edo de Waart conducted fluently, and the
orchestra played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatrice and Benedict'' is to be performed next on Thursday
evening, ``A Dream Play'' on Wednesday. On Monday, meanwhile, comes
Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,'' which opened all three Santa Fe
theaters, starting in 1957, and on Tuesday, Mozart's ``Magic
Flute,'' in a new production by Jonathan Miller.

`TRISTAN AND ISOLDE': A PRODUCTION FOR A NEW CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: BRITAIN, CANADA, Wa.)   (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A promising new production of Wagner's daunting
``Tristan und Isolde'' by an important opera company is always an
event. But what brought critics from across the United States and
abroad to the Seattle Opera on Saturday night for the premiere of
the company's new production of arguably Wagner's greatest opera
was the chance to learn if, for the first time since the days of
Birgit Nilsson and Jon Vickers, two singers have arrived who can
truly make a claim to these incomparably demanding touchstone
roles.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first staged performance of Isolde by the British
soprano Jane Eaglen, who has already established herself as a major
interpreter of Brunnhilde in the ``Ring'' operas. It was similarly
the first stage performance of Tristan by the Canadian tenor Ben
Heppner, who is already a noted interpreter of Tannhauser,
Lohengrin and Walther. The expectations were high, and the pressure
on them must have been intense. Vocally they did not disappoint.
These fine artists have waited until the right ages to take on
these roles: Ms. Eaglen is 38 and Heppner is 42, old enough to have
depth, young enough to sound fresh and leave many years for
enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Opera has been an important place for both singers,
and the company came through for them, providing a noted conductor,
Armin Jordan, generous rehearsal time and a provocative production
directed by Francesca Zambello, which will very likely engender
divided reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eaglen understands that Wagner must be sung basically with
the tried-and-true principles of the bel canto tradition: a sense
of long line, evenness of vocal production and smooth legato
phrasing. But you must have uncommon stamina and soaring power for
Isolde, and Ms. Eaglen is the first soprano since Ms. Nilsson to
make singing the role seem natural. She has warm, vibrant sound and
full-voiced high notes that slice easily through the thick
orchestration. Most impressive, however, is the elegance of her
softer singing, the richness of her pianissimos.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably with Ms. Eaglen comes the issue of her size. She is a
large, thick-limbed woman. Obviously this limits her dramatic
impact, but it also somewhat affects her singing. I had not known
her to have such fire and temperament as she brings to this
portrayal. Still, there is sometimes a lack of rhythmic
incisiveness and energy in her singing that seem related to her
physical sluggishness. And for whatever reason, perhaps first-night
jitters, her pitch sometimes edged sharp. But overall this
sumptuously sung Isolde was the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The bright tenorial coloring of Heppner's voice is ideal for
Tristan, and he sings the role with ardor, poignancy and clear
German diction. He also, of course, is a hefty person. But it does
not seem to impede the vitality and trim of his singing.
</P>
<P>
   Although a complete uncut version of the opera was announced,
two cuts, mostly from Tristan's music, which are often used, were
insisted upon by the general director, Speight Jenkins, after the
dress rehearsal: a long passage in Act II sometimes called the
``Tag und Nacht'' episode, and part of Tristan's long, exhausting
monologue in Act III, about 11 minutes in total. Jenkins and
Heppner want to restore the cuts later, but for this first try
caution seemed advisable. Jenkins pointed out that Lauritz
Melchior, the Tristan of the century, probably never sang the role
without cuts.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Heppner will surely gain in confidence in the role. A
real Tristan has arrived.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Zambello worked with her frequent collaborators, the set and
costume designer Alison Chitty, and the lighting designer Mimi
Jordan Sherin. The production, typical of Ms. Zambello, is a
mixture of symbolism and nonperiod realism. The ship on which
Tristan transports the Irish princess Isolde to the Cornish king,
Marke, whom she is being made to marry, is a massive, gray,
stage-filling freighter. The walls slide apart to reveal Isolde, a
captive below; above sailors swab the deck with mops, and Tristan
broods, conflicted between loyalty to his king and untapped love
for Isolde. Clearly, since this is an opera about internal emotions
not external actions, Ms. Zambello and her team wanted to frame the
lovers in smaller spaces within the larger stage. But the framing
device does the singers in and calls attention, paradoxically, to
Ms. Eaglen's lack of mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the stage effects are just that, effects, the most
intrusive of which being the real sizzling flames that leap up and
surround the lovers at the climactic moment of their drug-assisted
passion. It is a smoky, silly, and somewhat smelly effect that
distracted our attention from one of the great musical moments in
all of opera.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the imagery was striking, and Ms. Zambello remains an
excellent director of singing-actors.
</P>
<P>
   She did wonderful work with the excellent young American
mezzo-soprano Michelle De Young, who brought a sisterly tenderness
to the character of Brangane, Isolde's attendant. And perhaps it
took a female director to allow the wounded Tristan and his loyal
friend Kurvenal, imposingly sung by the bass-baritone Greer
Grimsley, to be so physically tender with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan conducted a spacious and tellingly shaped performance.
The playing of the orchestra, though sonorous and full of
character, sometimes lacked crisp rhythmic articulation. But the
sweep of the conception was always involving.
</P>
<P>
   The fine English bass Peter Rose was moving as King Marke. James
Cornelison as Melot, Archie Drake as the steersman and Doug Jones,
doubling as the sailor and the shepherd, gave solid performances.
The most important news remains the emergence of the exciting new
Tristan and Isolde. The audience ovations were deservedly ecstatic.
Ms. Eaglen and Heppner are to sing the roles at the Metropolitan
Opera in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   This production runs at the Seattle Opera through Aug. 28.

   Now this is networking.
</P>
<P>
   The online bookseller Amazon.com has enrolled the 100,000th Web
site for the Amazon.com Associates Program, a so-called affiliate
network that pays a commission of up to 15 percent for each sale
referred from a site. Members simply recommend titles at their
sites and establish links that enable direct purchases from
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It expands our presence to the far corners of the Web,'' said
Shawn Haynes, who runs the program for Amazon.com. The 100,000th
site, signed on Thursday, was the Miami-based Careernet.com, a
nationwide recruitment and job-posting service that will recommend
career-guidance books to visitors. Other recently enrolled,
high-profile associates include Intuit's Quicken.com, Compaq
Computer, and ABCnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's affiliate network is up sharply from 30,000 just
last February, with much of the growth driven by the company's
expansion into music CD sales. That move has attracted die-hard
fans of every conceivable musical artist, affiliates who feed
traffic to Amazon.com from online shrines to Frank Sinatra or
Barenaked Ladies or David Cassidy or just about anyone else who has
ever put lips to microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said the two-year-old associates program generated a
significant minority of Amazon.com's total revenue, which topped
$100 million in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One of Amazon.com's closest competitors in the online music
business, N2K Inc.'s Music Boulevard site, has renamed its
7,000-member Remote Access Music program, now simply calling it the
affiliate program. It, too, pays other Web sites commissions of up
to 15 percent for referred sales.

   A Way to Find Out What a Job Is Worth
</P>
<P>
   Dagwood Bumstead made a career of asking for a raise he never
seemed to get, but he might have had better luck had he been armed
with data from a new World Wide Web site, the Salary Zone
(http://www.ioma.com/zone).
</P>
<P>
   The site lets surfers, from clerks to chief executives,
determine their value in the marketplace by asking for comparable
salaries based on several factors: sex, region, management
responsibility, size of company and level of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the world you can find out what you're worth in a way
that wasn't possible before,'' said Kathie Fitzgerald, the
Webmaster for the site, which is run by the Institute of Management
Administration, a business management publisher. The group surveys
professionals in a variety of fields twice a year and publishes 34
newsletters, like Shipping Manager's Report and Controlling Law
Firm Costs. ``A human resources professional would pay $199 a year
for a subscription to one of our publications,'' Ms. Fitzgerald
said. ``But if you're a job hunter, that would be ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, visitors to the site can pay $40 and wait 24 hours for
a verdict on their worth in the open marketplace. The institute's
parent company, the Bureau of National Affairs, based in
Washington, collects similar data on a wider group of professions,
and the two groups merged their data bases for this Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitzgerald said there was a growing interest by individuals
in using the Web for career development. ``People looking for work
and people looking for talent are using the Internet more and
more,'' she said.

   One Expert's Buzz Is Another's Target
</P>
<P>
   There are two main paths to credibility in the world of
professional technology experts. One is to champion new trends,
making sweeping judgments and pronouncing ways in which the latest
technology could make all nonbelievers obsolete. This is called
preaching to the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The other is to debunk new trends, poking holes in the
assumptions that others have made and throwing cold water on the
preachers. This is called being a calculated contrarian. Both
techniques seem to work when it comes to selling reports for
thousands of dollars. But the two strategies will go head to head
this week as two of the more prominent high-technology consulting
firms publicize reports on the convergence of voice and data
traffic in the nation's communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on the market for telephone calls that use
Internet technology, Abhi Chaki of Jupiter Communications calls the
consolidation of voice, video and data information onto unified
networks an ``inescapable reality.'' The firm says that will fuel
the adoption of Internet-style phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, the views of people like Chaki have
taken on the patina of conventional wisdom. But what is really
inescapable after reading the report is the feeling that Jupiter,
based in New York, is congenitally friendly to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The calculated contrarian, Forrester Research, based in
Cambridge, Mass., is as intent on tearing down the concept of
network consolidation as Jupiter is in promoting it. In its latest
report, Forrester says that businesses will not bother with unified
voice-data networks and that multiple networks will live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is demystify hype,'' Maribel Lopez, the
Forrester analyst behind the report, said in an interview. ``The
buzz, a lot of it has to do with data guys looking to sell the next
router upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the interest of demystification, it should be made clear
that Forrester made an early copy of the report available to a
reporter in an effort to create some buzz of its own.

   A New Watchdog Against Internet Fraud
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is beefing up its
cyberpatrols with the creation of a new office to combat investment
fraud on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   John Reed Stark, an eight-year member of the SEC's enforcement
division, has been named to lead a new unit, the Office of Internet
Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Stark, formerly the commission's special counsel for Internet
projects, said that creating the office would formalize efforts
that had already resulted in the prosecution of 30 cases. Those
have involved virtually every type of investment scam, including
phony offerings, market manipulations, frauds that aim at a
particular ethnic or religious group, and so-called pyramid and
Ponzi schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet access is ubiquitous and coming down in price,''
Stark said. ``Hardware is cheap. A lot of software is free, so it
is spreading across the planet. At the same time, we are
experiencing the greatest bull market in history. Put the two
together and you have more people gambling instead of investigating
their investments.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC already maintains a Web site
(http://www.sec.gov/enforce/comctr.htm) where people can lodge
complaints. Stark said he received about 120 complaints via e-mail
every day. ``They are the same scams that we've had over the last
65 years _ just on the Internet,'' he said.

IT'S NEVER TOO SOON TO START WORRYING
</HEADLINE>
  By TIM KEOWN &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's going to be tough for the 49ers to recover
from Sunday's 14-13 win over the New England Patriots. All those
penalties, the costly interceptions, the short kickoffs _ it's just
way too much to dismiss with a wake-me-in-September shrug.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's early. First exhibition game, first week of August,
all that. But you know what? They always tell you it's early until
it's too damned late. Fact is, somebody has to sound the alarm for
sanity here: You let it slide and slide and pretty soon you're
laughing at those holding calls and taking bets on the next offside
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes an institutional thing, like the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci knows. He's a coach, wears a headset, watches a
lot of film. After the game, he said, ``I told all the guys in the
locker room, whether you're handing out water or playing in the
game, that we've got to get better this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Great to see football again, isn't it? Five exhibition games for
everyone to savor. There's so much to worry about, and so much time
to worry. They say the exhibition season doesn't mean anything, but
we know that's not true. If it was, then try to explain why the
coaches still lament the amount of work left to do. Or why the
referees still take forever to explain the obvious. Or why the
cheerleaders still smile their cryogenic smiles.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition season is made for guys like 49ers third-string
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller. He played nearly three quarters
Sunday night, and the stage was his. Beginning in five weeks, it
would take injuries to both Steve Young and Ty Detmer for
Druckenmiller to make his way onto the field, but for now his
performance is going to be dissected with scientific intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Druckenmiller the perfect primer for the worrier's
training camp. You worry about him now, then work your way up to
worrying about Steve Young. It's a progressive thing, like jacks or
better to open.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci started the bidding, saying, ``We're nowhere near where
we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why they charge full price for exhibition games:
Druckenmiller played pretty well, but he threw two interceptions
near his own end zone _ one on a pass he never should have thrown
and another on a pass he never should have thrown so hard.
</P>
<P>
   And so afterward, when asked about his second interception,
Druckenmiller said, ``I guess the receivers have got to remember
that with Druck in there, it's coming at you like a howitzer.''
</P>
<P>
   This guy's priceless. It's obvious he needs to play more.
Somebody needs to circulate a petition or something. Promise them a
stadium, or a mall, anything to get this guy more playing time.
Young is thoughtful and articulate, always able to find the right
18-20 words to sum up the whole experience. But Druck _ Druck's in
a different league. Young can't compete with a guy who goes
third-person nickname on himself while in the act of verbally
puffing up.
</P>
<P>
   You remember what Bill Walsh said? He said take Jake Plummer.
Maybe Walsh knew Druck was in the wrong sport at the wrong time.
Druck should have been a baseball player in the '20s and '30s,
riding trains and calling his own shots.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition games are for guys like Druck and Tony Blevins, a
free-agent cornerback from Kansas. Blevins knows the golden rule
for free-agent rookies: Do something spectacular and hope it comes
while the coaches are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Blevins tried as hard as humanly possible
to keep a punt inbounds at the goal line, and he succeeded by
twisting his body in several unnatural directions. Frankly, whether
the Patriots started their drive at the 20 or the 1 was completely
immaterial to most everyone on the planet, but for Blevins it was
beyond important. If he does it enough times, they'll put the name
above his locker in something more permanent than tape.
</P>
<P>
   Blevins was no doubt one of the reasons Young said, ``It looks
like our team really likes to play football. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but being a football player you can tell the
difference. In the long run, we'll win games because we have that
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   That alone shouldn't be enough to stop anybody's worrying,
because 13 penalties for 112 yards is Raider football whether the
guys making the penalties like to play football or not. And even
though the first-team offense scored easily on its second
possession, and the first-team defense made Drew Bledsoe look like
Dieter Brock, you can never be too vigilant when it comes to
drawing conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   After all, even the guys who played well shouldn't be spared
your concern. You have to wonder whether some of them, like our
friend Druck, might be in serious danger of peaking too soon.

advertising agencies. By Saul Hansell.

<P>
   VILLAGE-MEDIA (New York) _ iVillage.com began with little more
than the premise ``Internet for the rest of us'' and a focus on
baby boomers. After encountering its share of false starts (like a
site, ``Vices and Virtues,'' now defunct, about the competing
forces of indulgence and health), it has evolved into the leading
women's online ``community'' on the Web. It attracted more than 2
million different visitors during June, according to the Web
measurement company Relevant Knowledge. By Lisa Napoli. (With photo

<P>
   GUGGENHEIM-HOGS (New York) _ ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' is an
exhibition quite different from anything else that Museum Mile on
Fifth Avenue has ever experienced. Bathed in biker glory, it has
become the most highly attended exhibition in the Guggenheim's
61-year history, far outstripping retrospectives of Roy
Lichtenstein and Ellsworth Kelly, and more popular than
authoritative surveys of Chinese, Russian and Italian art. By Carol
Vogel. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   CUNNINGHAM-DANCE-REVIEW (New York) _ Pure movement has seemed
Merce Cunningham's primary concern over 45 years of making dances
for his company. It is a concern reflected in the programs'
earliest choreography, created in 1956, in the new work on the
program and in his latest explorations of computer dance, the
subject of a panel discussion and video installation that were also
part of this dance-packed weekend at Jacob's Pillow. By Jennifer
Dunning. (With photo.)

GIULIANI SAYS HE WILL NOT RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is not running for
president, at least for now. But he is not ruling it out, either.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a regular routine whenever he takes questions
from the national news media, Giuliani said Sunday that he was
focused solely on running the nation's largest city, and that he
did not have any plans to run for the nation's highest office in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention at this point of running for any other
office,'' Giuliani said Sunday on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``When I
have that intention, I'll tell you about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he had ruled out such a run, Giuliani backed
away slightly, saying, ``I never completely rule anything out, but
the most important part is, I haven't ruled it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks will likely do little to quash speculation
that he is interested in bringing his brand of moderate
Republicanism to a national stage. In recent months, Giuliani has
traveled to Arizona and other places to point up his record on
crime, welfare reform and civility campaigns. And in October, he
will go to New Hampshire, a state regarded as an early barometer of
presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Giuliani repeated earlier statements about the intention
of the New Hampshire trip, saying that he hoped to broaden the base
of the Republican Party. Giuliani also said that he hoped to
persuade party members to seriously consider selecting New York as
the host of the Republican National Convention in 2000.

49ERS TOP PATS, COLLECT FLAGS 
BY IRA MILLER
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one got seriously hurt and the starters
played at least respectably. On that basis alone, the 49ers'
exhibition opener Sunday was a success.
</P>
<P>
   That's not quite the same, however, as being ready for the
season to begin. Which, of course, they are not, the 14-13 victory
over the New England Patriots notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were called for 17 penalties, 13 of which were
accepted. Six of the penalties were called against first-string
players, five of them in the first quarter alone. ``It made the
game kind of sloppy,'' said coach Steve Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   And backup quarterback Jim Druckenmiller threw two
interceptions, both of which killed possible scoring drives in the
red zone. In Druckenmiller's defense, one came on a scramble when
his arm was hit, the other off a dropped pass. But several of his
other throws were behind receivers, although he completed 10 of 14
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we can all get better at every phase of our game,''
said Mariucci, who didn't excuse himself, either, saying the 49ers
leaned more on their passing game, especially in the first half,
than he had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci has made a point this summer of talking about how he
plans to open up the offense. But he didn't envision an 18-5
pass-run ratio for the 49ers' first five possessions, which is what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw the ball a little bit more, but not to
that extent,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young played only the first two possessions at
quarterback, handling 12 offensive plays and completing five of
nine passes for 64 yards. Young set up the first touchdown with a
perfect 28-yard pitch to reserve wideout Mark Harris on 3rd-and-15
that was just beyond the reach of Patriots cornerback Chris Canty.
A two-yard TD pass to Garrison Hearst followed.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darnell Walker, who started 11 games for the 49ers
last season, scored the other San Francisco touchdown on a fumble
recovery in the end zone. Jeff Posey, a defensive end who was on
the practice squad last year, forced the fumble, by Scott Zolak,
New England's backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chris Doleman had an interception for the 49ers,
when he dropped into coverage on a zone blitz. Among youngsters,
safety Lance Schulters, the fourth-round draft choice, made several
eye-opening plays including a near-blocked punt and a late-game
sack.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback R.W. McQuarters, the first-round pick, played much of
the game at right cornerback, but was hardly tested; the Patriots
threw only a couple of passes in his direction, to no effect.
Mariucci said McQuarters would be worked into the nickel and dime
specialty defenses this week in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' first-string defense, missing only free safety Merton
Hanks, did not permit New England's starting offense to cross
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better than the first game last year,'' observed strong safety
Tim McDonald. ``I think our guys wanted to start fast. It was a
pretty solid effort by our starting unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people have taken it for granted that the defense would be
fine this season, and Sunday's performance did nothing to diminish
expectations. New linebacker Winfred Tubbs played effectively, and
new cornerback Antonio Langham did a good job a couple of times
forcing receivers off their routes and out of bounds, according to
defensive coordinator John Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the focus this summer, however, has been on the
offensive line, which seemed to get through the first game without
difficulty, even though it was missing two projected starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anybody get overwhelmed,'' said Bobb McKittrick,
the offensive line coach. ``So from that standpoint, I was pleased.
We've been through a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, though, have the 49ers been through worse with
penalties. To put the 13 accepted penalties in perspective, the
team record for penalties in a regular season game is 15.
</P>
<P>
   Starters flagged were Tubbs, Doleman, tackle Bryant Young and
end Roy Barker on defense and center Chris Dalman and left guard
Ray Brown on offense. The 49ers were called eight times for
offsides on defense, all by different players.

RED SOX HOLD OFF ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ At this rate, they should have full-color
brochures printed up and sent to travel agencies across New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an alternative to a Caribbean cruise, a stroll down
the Champs Elysees, or a week in the Swiss Alps?
</P>
<P>
   For a really good time, take a West Coast tour with the Red Sox!
</P>
<P>
   What was once thought to be a nightmare excursion continued to
be a giddy joyride for the Sox, who leaped to an eight-run lead
against the Anaheim Angels, then held on for an 8-7 win that
assured them of a winning record on their spin around the Pacific
Rim.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest passengers to hop on board, lefthanded
reliever Greg Swindell, joined right in the fun after the Angels
added a few late thrills. Swindell, acquired at the trading
deadline from Minnesota Friday night, struck out two in a scoreless
seventh inning that threw the brakes on the Anaheim comeback, which
began with six runs off Sox starter Tim Wakefield and reliever Rich
Garces and was abetted by a throwing error by Nomar Garciaparra
that allowed the sixth run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley followed Swindell with an inning of vintage
Eck, fanning two in the eighth, and Tom Gordon rang up his third
save of the trip and league-leading 31st of the season despite
giving up a run on a couple of singles and a force out in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice,'' Swindell said after striking out Jim Edmonds,
retiring cleanup man Tim Salmon on an infield tapper, and striking
out Dave Hollins after Garret Anderson's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in there, and I was thinking, `Is there any reason for
me to be nervous? I've been playing this game since I was 7 years
old.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I couldn't get any spit in my mouth. First time for a new
team, it was very nerve-wracking. I wanted to do so well. I'm glad
it's over with, and I'll try to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who already had taken two of three from Oakland
before sweeping three from the reeling Angels, are 5-1 on this
trip, a season-best 21 games over .500, and have just two games in
Seattle before departing this side of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have one stop left before going home _ a four-day
dalliance in Texas against the Rangers, who Sunday passed the
Angels as the first-place team in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also opened some serious distance between themselves
and their closest pursuers in the wild-card chase. Sunday night's
win put them 7 1/2 games ahead of the Angels, who are 9-20 in their
last 29 games, 4-13 in their last 17 at Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take advantage of this time,'' said Mo Vaughn,
whose two-run home run and 27th of the season in the sixth gave the
Sox an 8-0 lead and proved to be the margin of victory. The home
run also made it 10 straight games in which the Red Sox have hit at
least one homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing well,'' he said, ``but the main thing is, the
road trip is not over yet. We've done some things that have put us
in a pretty good stand, but we have to continue to do the things
we're doing. This team has got to be mentally ready.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one player more nervous than Swindell Sunday, it
was Vaughn, according to Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who has hit in all 10 games since he told a Toronto
newspaper he wanted to play for the Blue Jays next year, spent his
third straight game as Red Sox DH, with Mike Stanley playing first
base. The Sox dugout, Martinez said, was barely big enough to
contain him between at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so nervous,'' Martinez said with a laugh. ``He's jumping
and yelling at everybody. He doesn't know how to be on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who had outscored the Angels, 18-5, in the first
two games here, wasted no time in jumping on Anaheim Sunday night,
giving Wakefield a 4-0 lead before the Angels came to bat. Darren
Lewis singled, John Valentin doubled, and Nomar Garciaparra singled
home Lewis with a broken-bat single, giving him at least one RBI in
his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary followed with a high chopper that Angels pitcher
Jason Dickson fielded and threw to a vacant first base. Garciaparra
scored from first and O'Leary, who was credited with a single,
wound up on third on the two-base error. Stanley's sacrifice fly
made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox made it 5-0 without benefit of a hit in the third.
Valentin walked, advanced to third on two wild pitches by Dickson,
who also walked Vaughn, and scored on Garciaparra's infield out.
That was Garciaparra's second RBI of the night, and 16th in the
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra reached on an infield hit with one out in the fifth,
took second when Stanley drew a two-out walk, and scored when
Darren Bragg shot a single through the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield checked the Angels on just one hit, a second-inning
single by Garret Anderson, through the first five innings, before
being knocked out in the sixth, when he gave up four runs, two on
Anderson's home run. But with his bullpen picking him up, Wakefield
was credited with his 13th win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' said Eckersley, who has been unscored
upon in his last four appearances. ``But I don't want to get
carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot more relaxed. It's nice to pitch when we're
winning. That's all you can ask for.''

NO NEED TO PANIC JUST YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ OK, so they didn't look so good Sunday when it
counted, but before you head to the Tobin Bridge to do a Greg
Louganis, let me give you some advice from the old neighborhood:
``Fahgetta about it!''
</P>
<P>
   For just over the first quarter of their first exhibition game,
the first offense of the New England Patriots stayed on the field
at 3Com Park against a first-rate defense and looked like it had
never left Pittsburgh. The offense seldom moved, and when it did it
went in reverse as often as it went forward. Understandably, this
may have caused you some alarm, bad memories being the most
difficult ones to erase, but fear not.
</P>
<P>
   The performance shortfall applied to most everyone involved,
including quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was a miserable 3 for 9
with an interception and a fumble; young running back Sedrick Shaw,
who fumbled once to set up the San Francisco 49ers' first touchdown
when he got stung by linebacker Winfred Tubbs; and a corps of wide
receivers who had only three receptions in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   So what did you expect? A juggernaut?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are installing a new offensive scheme and although
you may have heard that more times than you'd like to the past few
years, Sunday it was a valid explanation for what was, at best, an
underwhelming offensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   New offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's entire design is based
on timing, and timing comes only with time. Both the timing and the
time necessary to develop it clearly were still missing Sunday, and
so, predictably, there were problems. But thankfully they appeared
to be the kind that can be solved in the simplest of ways: by
returning to Smithfield, R.I., and practicing a few thousand more
snaps, as the Patriots will begin doing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think it's pretty clear we had first-game problems,'' said
coach Pete Carroll. ``We were not real clean with the throwing
game. We've got a lot of cleaning up to do on the offensive side.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly true of the running game, which was not much
in evidence, as Shaw and No. 1 pick Robert Edwards failed to do
anything to make you forget the best of Curtis Martin. Of most
concern was the fact that when the varsity was playing it averaged
just 3.3 yards a carry on 16 first-half tries, with Shaw handling
nine (for 34 yards and a 3.8 yard average) and Edwards six for 20
more (3.3 yards a carry). Things went downhill from there, believe
it or not, with New England ultimately rushing for just 88 yards on
32 carries, a 2.8 yards-per-carry average. That number was worse
even than last year's 3.7 yards a carry, which only goes to show
you that just when you think things can't get worse, you learn
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't see anything pop out,'' Carroll said of his
young backs. ``There was nothing to get lit up about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite problems with field position created by its offense,
New England's defense remained stout. Even though it faced
situations where the Niners began drives at their 44, the New
England 35 twice, and then the 49er 41, the defense surrendered
only one touchdown, and that came only after the 49ers had
recovered Shaw's fumble at the New England 35.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted as well that that fumble came at the end of a
series in which the offense actually showed something by driving
the ball from its 6 to the 37 with some power running that produced
three first downs and reason for hope before Shaw's drop.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco would not score again until backup quarterback
Scott Zolak was sacked and fumbled the ball into the end zone. He
then illegally batted it forward in an attempt to get it back on
the playing field, but instead directed it into the hands of backup
cornerback Darnell Walker, who fell on it for a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This situation later would change admirably when the Patriots'
reserves came on in the second half and began to outplay the 49ers'
reserves, closing the lead to 14-13 before time ran out. What that
proved was that the Patriots who will seldom play this year are
better than the 49ers who will seldom play this year.
</P>
<P>
   This is a point that should not be minimized, especially on a
day when the Patriots who will play did not play as well as the
49ers who will play, because ready reserves are a goal of Carroll's
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Backup tight end Lovett Purnell, for one, had himself a day,
catching five passes for 54 yards. So, too, did rookie wide
receiver Tony Simmons, who made six catches for 67 yards. And the
defense's first impression was of a group that had not lost
anything from the way it was playing at the end of last season,
when it was among the stingiest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   So, all in all, this is no time for panic or even much
grumbling. There is plenty of time for the timing to improve.

   And even if it doesn't, there's plenty of time for panic later.

PATRIOTS VICTIMS OF BAD TIMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ Its time has not come.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the new passing game, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was way off. No question about it,'' said new
Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese. Drew Bledsoe echoed
that, saying, ``If we played like that in a regular-season game,
we'd get beat by any team in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps a college team or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots Sunday lost the first of their five exhibition
games in 1998, 14-13 to the San Francisco 49ers at 3Com Park, but
don't be fooled by the score. While the second team seemed to grasp
the Zampese offense much better than the first team, the goal is to
have that the other way around. The good news: Scott Zolak led the
Patriots on two impressive second-half drives against the 49ers'
second-team defense, pulling the team back from a 14-3 deficit at
the half. So New England appears to have some depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott did some good things,'' said coach Pete arroll. ``But he
made a play in the end zone that we can't have from an experienced
backup quarterback in the NFL.'' That came early in the second
quarter when 49ers linebacker Jeff Posey blasted past second-year
offensive tackle Ed Ellis as Zolak dropped back into his end zone
to throw, forcing Zolak to fumble. The 49ers' Darnell Walker fell
on the ball for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Zolak, who wasn't available to the media after the
game, completed 18 of 34 passes for 181 yards. Six of those passes,
for 67 yards, went to rookie Tony Simmons, a prominent figure in
the two second-half scoring drives. One of the drives produced a
touchdown on 18 plays, the other a 31-yard field goal by Adam
Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also was not bowled over by the Patriots' running game,
which produced 88 yards on 32 carries. Forty-eight of those yards
came from starter Sedrick Shaw, on 16 carries, a 3-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really stood out,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Robert Edwards had six carries for 20 yards, but he was
sidelined by a troublesome left groin.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said of his performance, ``I really don't know until I
watch the film.'' He certainly won't like viewing his first-quarter
fumble, when he was hit by linebacker Winfred Tubbs at the Patriot
39. That led to the 49ers' first score, a 2-yard pass from Steve
Young to Garrison Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sedrick had the fumble and that was unfortunate,'' said
Carroll. ``Those plays can really put a team in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who was in for 25 plays, completed three of his nine
passes for 23 yards and threw an interception to defensive end
Chris Doleman in the first quarter. Terry Glenn caught no passes.
Ditto Vincent Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to play well in this offense right from the
start,'' said Bledsoe. ``I don't think it's going to take five
games. You can't expect to turn the ball over like we did and beat
a team like the 49ers.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive was that the 49ers couldn't throw to Tebucky Jones's
side, as the first-round pick did a nice job in bump-and-run
coverage at right cornerback with the second-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I did OK,'' said Jones. ``I got some action and got
my feet wet out there. I wish we'd won. I just have to get better.
It was difficult out there today, but I think I held my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The second offense clicked immediately in the second half. Zolak
directed a 79-yard drive that consumed 8:27 of the third quarter,
culminating in a 1-yard run by Shaw. Nine of the 18 plays were
runs, while Zolak spread the ball in the air to Michigan rookie
Chris Floyd, Simmons, and Lovett Purnell. The touchdown got the
Patriots within 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   On the second drive of the quarter, Zolak directed the team from
its 15 to the 49er 13 before things stalled two plays into the
fourth quarter. Vinatieri booted the second of his two field goals,
a 31-yarder, to bring the Patriots within 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   But Zolak couldn't bring the Patriots all the way back, hindered
by poor field position in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real disappointed we couldn't win that game in the
fourth quarter,'' said Carroll. ``I think it's pretty clear we had
first-game problems. We were not real clean with the throwing game.
We've got a lot of cleaning up to do on the offensive side.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first quarter, Shaw rattled off runs of 6 and 9
yards, but on the second possession and on his third straight
carry, Shaw was nailed by Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers went right at Chris Canty, burning him twice on a
drive that was finished with a 2-yard swing pass to Hearst for the
first score of the game.
</P>
<P>
   After Derrick Cullors returned the kickoff 41 yards to the 46,
Bledsoe, who seemed out of sync from the start, became confused by
the 49ers' zone blitz and threw the ball right at Doleman at the
49ers' 40.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slade bailed out the Patriots by intercepting Jim
Druckenmiller at the Patriot 5, setting up Zolak's fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots ran a decent two-minute offense at the end of the
first half, getting the ball at the 36 after a 29-yard return by
Canty. Vinatieri ended up kicking a 27-yard field goal.

NIGERIA HAS DRUMMED UP SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ The young man who plays the role of the St. Joseph's
Hawk is admired by one and all in the world of college basketball.
Custom dictates that he begin flapping his wings the minute he
takes the floor and never stop until the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   That's impressive. But he does not bang a drum.
</P>
<P>
   Samson Shobowale does. He began banging his drum when the
Nigerian national team came onto the floor Sunday (or perhaps even
sooner), and he did not stop until a good 20 minutes after his team
had blown away South Korea by an 89-65 score, which was about 2 1/2
hours later. Shobowale banged during play. He banged during
timeouts. He banged during the entire halftime break. He banged and
he banged, and it would not have bothered him if the game had gone
four overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our tradition to play when the players play,'' he
explains. ``We always have to beat the drum. It is our
communication with the players. It lets them know we are behind
them. We do not get tired of beating the drum. We love doing it, so
why would we get tired?''
</P>
<P>
   Shobowale is an integral part of the best fan group at the World
Basketball Championships. There is some competition from the
ever-joyous Argentines and the colorfully clad Lithuanians, and
there is the obvious national pride being manifested on a nightly
basis by 18,000-plus Greeks. But for sheer joie de vivre, not to
mention sheer endurance, they are all tied for second place behind
the lovable Nigerians, who play music and sing nonstop in support
of their beloved Tigers (and don't ask why they are the Tigers,
since there are no such beasts in Nigeria).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are great,'' says Obinna Ekezie, the Maryland
senior-to-be who has inherited the center spot from the injured
Yinka Dare (tendinits of the shoulder, or so they say). ``They give
us the extra energy to go out there and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are out there playing, you do not always hear them
because you are concentrating on the game,'' says guard Mohammed
Acha. ``But you hear them during a foul shot or a timeout, and they
give you a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is provided by three drums, two trumpet players (they get
a little break) and assorted noisemakers. Song and dance is
provided by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sing songs to praise God,'' explains Shobowale. ``We sing
songs to praise the players. We sing songs to praise ourselves. We
sing songs to inspire our team. It is the music of inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is not going to win a medal, but Nigeria is not a bad
team. The leading scorer Sunday was none other than former Boston
University great Tunji Awojobi, who had 24 points on an assortment
of inside moves and a few face-up jumpers. He is one of seven
members of the 12-man roster who play professionally in Europe or
Asia. Ekezie, a Maryland starter, is one of three Division 1
American college players. Godwin Owinue played in the CBA last
year. And there is the perpetually underachieving Dare, whose
lackluster play in the team's first three games means he was not
missed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers are an amazing story because, in truth, they hardly
know each other. They congregated in Lagos for, depending on whom
you believe, somewhere between four and 10 days before coming here
for this tournament. Coach Ayo Bakare says the team had perhaps 20
practices, which is about 10 more than the players claim. But it is
evident that if this team had just a little more time together, it
could have made some noise in the championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just starting to become a team,'' laments Ekezie.
``Each of these players was a big man on his team. It is not easy
for some of them to give up a shot to another man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting better and better,'' says Bakare. ``We have had
an awesome improvement. With just a couple of more weeks together,
three, perhaps, we could be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   His immediate concern is an ever-shrinking roster. With the drug
suspension of center Julius Nowsu and a run of injuries, he
possibly will dress just seven men for Monday's 13th-place game
against Japan. ``The fans will help us get through this,'' says the
6-foot-7-inch Awojobi, who can expect to go 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria was in a tough bracket in which it lost close games to
Argentina and Australia, medal contenders both. This is Nigeria's
first trip to the World Championships, and with Sunday's victory
they have achieved the minimum goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't come in dead last,'' grins Ekezie, who says he never
had played basketball before learning the game at Worcester
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   They will play their final game at the 1998 World Basketball
Championships Monday, and they will not be doing it alone. ``We
will be there for them,'' says Shobowale, who, incidentally, is
Awojobi's brother, and who says he watched Tunji's great game
against Drexel two years ago live via satellite. ``When the team
sees us there, it can never go down. And if it does go down, it
will go down fighting. We fight for our team and for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentleman, commence banging.

PANTANI PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Marco Pantani took the winner's place on the Tour de
France podium here Sunday, marking the first time an Italian stood
there in 33 years. In second place was Jan Ullrich, of Germany, who
won the race last year. And right behind them, in third place, was
Bobby Julich of Glenwood Springs, Colo., the highest American Tour
finisher since Greg LeMond won it in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Tour de France should have been a celebration for
almost everyone. Instead, when the race came limping into Paris
there almost a sigh of relief from riders and spectators that it
was over. It hadn't been killed, but it had been so decimated by
dropouts and accusations of drug use it was far from the spectacle
it has been for the past 84 years. One team was kicked out during
the first week and more riders bailed out over the next two weeks,
leaving only 14 of the original 21 teams.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Pantani had dyed his goatee and mustache blond to
match his yellow jersey, it was clear the glitter has faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy because all the bad times I have are now
ended,'' said Pantani, 28, who crashed into a car during a race in
1995 and broke his leg in two places. ``But my first victory in the
Tour de France was most difficult because of all the doping stories
and the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani only won two stages in the three-week event that started
in Dublin July 11. But his total time of 92 hours 49 minutes 46
seconds was more than three minutes ahead of Ullrich, and three
hours in front of last-place finisher Damien Nazon. Pantani will
collect $440,000 for his win.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who finished third overall last year, won the ``Giro,''
or Tour of Italy, in June. He's the first winner of both Tours
since Miguel Indurain of Spain in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Julich, 26, seemed content with his third-place win that was
good for $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from another planet,'' Julich said of Pantani. ``It's
something to tell your grandchildren that you raced in the same
pack with the winner of the Giro and the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that a steady rain was coming down as the
riders started the final 92-mile race into Paris. But as they hit
the Champs Elysees the skies cleared, and the pack circled the road
from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde 10 times to
build up for a sprint to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Steels of Belgium jumped over the line first, claiming his
fourth stage win.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jersey was passed around the first week, with
American George Hincapie coming within seconds of wearing it. But
when Ullrich took it over last weekend, it looked like the race
might be a repeat of last year.
</P>
<P>
   That was, until last Monday, when Pantani made his way up one of
the Tour's steepest mountains in the Alps, cutting through the rain
and fog to make a statement. He not only won the stage, beating
Ullrich by almost eight minutes, but he took over the leader's spot
and wore the yellow jersey until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the Tour was marred by the police investigations for
drugs, and two interruptions _ one in which the protesting riders
delayed the start of a stage for two hours, and one in which they
rode so slowly the stage was nullified. Seven teams left the Tour,
and seven people have been placed under formal investigation for
doping-related charges, including one rider, Italian Rodolfo Massi.
</P>
<P>
   So as the daily headlines blared more about drugs than racing,
fans seemed to grow resentful. Some of the hundreds of thousands
who lined the route, which covered 2,400 miles, held signs that
read, ``EPO Gratuit, (EPO for free),'' referring to the illegal
blood-enhancer. One said, ``Il Tour Est Mort (The Tour is Dead)''.
</P>
<P>
   Others defended the race, however, and held signs that read,
``Tour '98: Injustice,'' or ``Viva le Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The riders had mixed emotions, too. Tyler Hamilton, of
Brookline, Mass., said of the drug investigation, ``I think a lot
of positives will come from this.'' But Laurent Jalabert, the
leader of both strikes, said racers were ``being treated like
cattle'' before he dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour went on, but without riders like Richard Virenque, who
was second in last year's race; No. 1 ranked Jalabert; Fernando
Escartin, who had been fourth overall; and Massi, who was seventh
overall and wore the climber's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The US Postal Service team had something to cheer about _ sort
of. The squad was one of only two to have all nine riders cross the
finish line. But co-general manager Mark Gorski acknowledged that
it was an almost hollow victory in light of so many dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to overlook whatever shadow might be over these
results and know that the Tour de France is going to happen next
year,'' he said. ``The sport is going to go on. The success and
continued existence of cycling may be clouded, and it's definitely
going to be impacted, but it's going to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Team member Jean-Cyril Robin, of France, placed sixth overall,
and Dariusz Baranowski 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would J.C. have been sixth in the race if he hadn't been
impacted by some of these defections and dropouts?'' Gorski said.
``Probably not, but he may be top 10. So we've reached a lot of our
goals. We've got a great spirit on our team and I'm really proud of
that. The guys have gone through this experience and I think
they've probably learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who finished 51st overall, said he'll stay in Europe
to continue racing through the end of August before he heads back
to New England, where he'll probably compete in the Killington,
Vt., stage race in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had much to brag about, from Julich's third-place
finish to teammate Kevin Livingston's 17th-place finish to
Hincapie's near miss of the yellow jersey to Hamilton's near miss
of a stage win.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of it all was three-time Tour winner LeMond, who
was never seen at the finish but was leading a bike tour along
different stretches of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no doubt that Julich, the new American on the racing
scene, felt the presence of the former champion. He is, after all,
following in LeMond's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked for this since I watched it on TV,'' Julich said.
``I knew right away that was my destiny, to be in the Tour de
France.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's not just in it _ he's at the top of it.

VALDERRAMA DEAL STILL UP IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ MLS commissioner Doug Logan expects Carlos
Valderrama to join the Revolution before Wednesday's game against
San Jose. But Valderrama said Sunday he might remain in Florida,
possibly returning to Tampa Bay, where he owns a house and where he
played in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things to consider about New England, such as
the cold weather,'' Valderrama said after playing the World team in
a 6-1 loss to the US in the MLS All-Star game Sunday. ``It is a
difficult decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan hoped to announce that Valderrama and a Miami domestic
player would be exchanged for Joe-Max Moore and a Revolution
foreigner. MLS deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati met with Valderrama
in an attempt to conclude the deal Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution apparently wanted to discard Dutchman Richard
Goulooze, who was signed to replace Francis Okaroh in central
defense and has failed to make an impact at other positions. But
the Fusion balked at taking Goulooze, a cousin of coach Thomas
Rongen's, who has a three-year contract, preferring David Nakhid.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's eagerness to part with Goulooze highlights the
apparent error in expecting him to replace Okaroh. And in a league
with a salary cap, such a mistake can be costly. The Revolution
have the worst record in MLS with 16 points in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the league what player we want,'' Miami general
manager Leo Stillitano said. ``It is up to the league to make the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami was also reluctant to part with defender Leo Cullen,
instead offering Matt Kmosko.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos wants to come to New England,'' Rongen said. ``If my
hunch is right he will be in a Revolution uniform. I made good eye
contact with him and his eyes had a sparkle in them. Carlos's eyes
speak volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rongen said the Revolution have made sacrifices to accommodate
the trade, which became a possibility after Valderrama clashed with
new Miami coach Ivo Wortmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two major players in the deal are Carlos and Joe-Max but
the two secondary players could be very important,'' Rongen said.
``We have given in other areas, giving up on getting another player
from another team. We have tried hard to make the deal happen.
There comes a point when it's got to make sense for both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Revolution acquire Valderrama, they must discard a
foreigner. They also hope to make a separate deal to sign Vladan
Vicevic, a naturalized Salvadoran from Yugoslavia. Vicevic, a
defensive midfielder, moved to El Salvador to play professionally,
then was recruited to the national team by former coach Milovan
Djoric. Vicevic joined El Salvador for World Cup qualifying and
played in a 4-2 loss to the US at Foxboro Stadium in November.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient, though, is Valderrama, who could not only
salvage the Revolution's playoff hopes but also Rongen's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a unique relationship with Carlos, in effect a
lifetime contract,'' Logan said. ``We respect him as a professional
and want him to finish his playing career in this league. I am
confident we will find a place for him, probably before the next
regular-season game (Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a problem with the new coach in Miami. Any time a new
coach comes in, there is a period of great tension and stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems all might have been solved if the league had simply
traded coaches _ Rongen for Wortmann _ which would have reunited
Rongen and Valderrama and returned Rongen to South Florida, where
he has had his greatest coaching success. But Logan said such a
deal ``will not happen.''

SWINDELL, MERCED ENJOY NEW SURROUNDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Greg Swindell was reading a bedtime story to
his daughters Brenna and Sophia late Friday night, after he'd come
back from the ballpark, when the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the story? ``Where Do Bears Sleep,'' Swindell said,
``but I had to cut it short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swindell kids may not have found out where bears sleep, but
they soon discovered that their daddy would be needing a pillow in
Boston, after he picked up the phone shortly after the midnight
trading deadline Friday and was told by Twins general manager Terry
Ryan that he'd been traded to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell's teammate in Minnesota, Orlando Merced, already had
come back from the ballpark that night, too, convinced that his
request for a trade had gone unfulfilled. He said as much to his
wife, Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was about 90 seconds before the deadline, and I
looked at my wife and said, `Hey, baby, we're not going anywhere,
we might as well swallow it,''' Merced said.
</P>
<P>
   Merced had the TV on, he said, and ESPN was just announcing that
the trading deadline had arrived. Just then, his phone rang, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Terry Ryan, saying, `You're going to Boston,''' Merced
said. ``My wife started jumping all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest members of the Red Sox were both in their new
uniforms Sunday. Merced, a lefthanded-hitting first
baseman-outfielder who has had just two at-bats in the last two
weeks, was not in the Sox' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, meanwhile, was on call, the latest candidate for a job
that has gone undone all season, a dependable lefthander out of the
bullpen. Swindell doesn't have the fastball with which he won 18
games for Cleveland in 1988, but it's still his weapon of choice.
``I always go to that if I'm in trouble,'' he said. ``It's the only
pitch I really rely on.''
</P>
<P>
   A starter for his entire career until signing with the Twins two
years ago, Swindell, 33, gestured across the Sox clubhouse, where
catcher Scott Hatteberg was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started two games in spring training my first year with the
Twins,'' Swindell said, ``both against the Red Sox. Hatteberg got
me put in the bullpen. He hit two home runs in one game, and after
that, I went to the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The move has been a fortuitous one for Swindell, who was
released by both the Astros and Indians in 1996 and thought his
career might be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost ready to quit,'' he said, ``then January rolls
around and you get that feeling again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this has prolonged my career. And hopefully, I'll get
in the playoffs this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, a jumbo-sized Texan (6 feet 3 inches, 230 pounds) who
followed Roger Clemens to the University of Texas, made his major
league debut 12 years ago for the Indians against the Red Sox, but
never has played in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Merced, meanwhile, was with Pittsburgh teams that lost to Jimy
Williams's Braves in both the 1991 and '92 National League
Championship Series. He hasn't been back to the postseason since,
and after having shoulder surgery last season, in his one year in
Toronto, Merced passed up a chance last winter to join the Red Sox,
signing a minor league contract with the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his time in Minnesota, neither the team nor the
player was happy. ``No matter what I did,'' Merced said, ``I got in
the doghouse. I tried to hang in there, but the less I played, the
more frustrated I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Merced, who never had the reputation of being a problem player
for either Jim Leyland in Pittsburgh or Cito Gaston in Toronto, had
a major falling out with Tom Kelly in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kelly apparently became upset with him after he went
into the manager's office and asked if he could play more. ``I
never asked him to play me every day,'' he said. ``I wanted to see
if I could help the club more. But he shut me down. I guess he
didn't like me asking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like Fidel Castro. I'm more pro-democrat. We never
really got along. I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merced, asked about an incident in Chicago in which he was back
in the clubhouse reading a newspaper in the ninth inning of a game
in which Kelly was looking for him to pinch hit, Merced said it was
common for him to go back to the clubhouse to prepare for an
at-bat. ``I already had stretched,'' he said. ``I was watching the
game on TV. Mentally, I was ready. It was a miscommunication
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, an incident in which he ripped up the lineup
card in Oakland a couple of days later was misconstrued. He said he
was leaning against the wall on which the lineup card was posted,
accidentally knocked it off the wall, and impulsively ripped it up.
Even his teammates took notice of that, Merced said, including
Swindell, who asked him about his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Greg, `If people think I was disrespecting my
teammates, I apologize,''' Merced said. ``But that wasn't it.
Everything I did, people were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get out of there because I wasn't playing.''
</P>
<P>
   His wish granted, Merced said he was ecstatic to be with the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great situation, a great tradition,'' he said. ``I
want to thank the people responsible for getting me here.
Hopefully, I'll pick up where I left off before I quit playing.''

ZOLAK TAKES BAD WITH GOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scott Zolak's season normally is drawing to a
close right about now. Such is life as New England's backup
quarterback, especially when you're riding in Drew Bledsoe's
sidecar.
</P>
<P>
   Life as Bledsoe's second makes for a hot July, a busy August,
and standing sentry on the sideline for most of the autumn and
early winter.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Zolak was one busy backup, moving in for an
ineffective Bledsoe in the second quarter, surviving some early
rough going, and getting the offensive game to percolate a little
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Scott battled well,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``He
made that one terrible play in the end zone ...''
</P>
<P>
   The play in question came with just more than a minute remaining
in the first half, with the Patriots on their 5. Zolak dropped back
into the end zone and, under pressure by Jeff Posey, dropped the
ball around his feet.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, conventional wisdom would have called for a swat
of the ball. Zolak's wisdom prevailed, but his execution was
lacking. He swatted the ball, handball-like, only he knocked the
ball toward the goal line rather than out of bounds. What might
have been a safety, a 2-point hit for the Patriots, instead turned
into a touchdown when Darnell Walker pounced on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a desperation, garbage play,'' said Carroll.
``It's the type of play we can't have from an experienced backup
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Zolak is entering his eighth season in a New
England uniform. He has logged the years, but his experience as a
backup has dwindled significantly in the Bledsoe years. Witness: 10
passes, 7 completions for 68 yards the last two seasons. Inactivity
such as that leads to swatting balls in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak was among the first Patriots out of the dressing room
after the loss and security guards prevented media from approaching
the New England bus after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's appraisal of Bledsoe, agreeing that his No. 1
playcaller looked out of sync: ``It's just one thing or the other.
It just wasn't as clean as we would have liked.''

TOO EARLY TOO TELL IF SHAW HAS LEGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The coming weeks and months will tell us if more
than a pair of legs left town when Curtis Martin wandered away from
the Patriots to play under Bill Parcells's loving hand and kind
arm, not to mention Leon Hess's pile of cash.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Sunday night, 60 minutes into the
relevant-only-if-you-want-it-to-be exhibition season, Martin's free
agent walkaway had the Patriots' running game spinning its wheels _
wheels that went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just average ... I didn't see anything
special,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll about the work of his
backfield in Sunday's 14-13 loss to the 49ers. ``No one got to the
hole clean, and the unfortunate part was Sedrick's fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw, last seen as the Patriots' last hope when the 1997
season ended in Pittsburgh, finished with 48 yards on 16 carries,
which made him about half the New England ground game (32 carries,
88 yards). The second-year back, who didn't run for a yard in the
'97 regular season, opened the New England offense Sunday with two
carries that netted 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But a decent start quickly turned into false hope. With the
Patriots on their own 37, on second and 9, Shaw got popped at the
line of scrimmage, lost the ball, and watched it fall into the
clutches of 49ers linebacker Lee Woodall. One drive. One turnover.
One large question mark hung over the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a good play, I'll just leave it at that,'' said Shaw.
``What happened? I won't know until I watch the film.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when he didn't look capable of running to daylight,
Shaw spent much of his brief time in a postgame interview telling
the media that he won't know what to say about his performance
until the lights are turned down low and he can watch tapes. Who
knows, maybe the movie will be better than the stat book. It's
often that way at the cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw scored New England's only touchdown, a 1-yard dive at 6:33
of the third quarter that helped cut San Francisco's lead to 14-10.
And overall, there was nothing dreadful about anything Shaw did,
just as there was not much bad to say about the work of Harold Shaw
(8 carries, 22 yards) or Robert Edwards (6 carries, 20 yards). On
the flip side, however, no one looked good lugging the ball, and
with a whole new passing game being implemented this season by
offensive czar Ernie Zampese, someone at some point is going to
have to seize the day on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is football, you are going to have your ups and
downs,'' said Sedrick Shaw, who saw slighty more of the latter in
his '98 debut. ``You are just going to have to try and show
consistency. I think I feel all right. I'll watch the film, take
everything to heart, and see what I have to improve on.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, does Shaw have the speed, power, and quickness
to be an NFL running back? Based on 16 average-to-lackluster
carries Sunday, no one would have him labeled for Canton, Ohio.
That's precisely what Parcells once said about Martin, when the two
were cozying up, symbiotic-like, on Route 1. Who knew then that
Parcells had Martin pegged more for Fort Knox than the Hall of
Fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm taking it all in stride,'' said Shaw, repeating
his mantra. ``I'll have to watch the film. The system is real good.
It's simple, not very complicated. It's timing, basically, and
everyone has to get it together.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what interaction he had on the sideline with the coaching
staff, Shaw made it sound like there wasn't much to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running back is instinctive,'' said Shaw. ``Things are
happening out there ... it's hard to tell anybody what to look
for.''

NICE HAUL FOR HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
 200-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ There was a perfect symmetry to it all.
</P>
<P>
   After his father, Tommy, turned the first lap at New Hampshire
International Speedway in a Busch Grand National car in 1990, Andy
Houston made his first visit to NHIS as a NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series rookie a triumphant one by winning the first truck race of
his career in Sunday's Pennzoil/VIP Discount Auto Centers 200.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Houston arrived in victory lane after laying down a few
victory doughnuts in his No. 60 Addington Racing Chevrolet, he was
greeted by his beaming father, who, in his glittering career that
spanned a record 417 Busch races, never won at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a really special moment, and I won't ever forget that
for a long time,'' Houston said of the victory lane meeting with
his father. ``He's just been retired from racing for a couple of
years now, and it's really hard for him. He's raced _ I don't know
_ for 30 years, and to be there standing in the pits and not being
behind the wheel was pretty tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me when I got to victory lane, `I knew that I was
going to get to victory lane again.' He said, `I might not have
been driving, but we're here.' So it was just a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tommy Houston, winner of 24 Busch Grand National races, ``I
have never won a race in my life that felt as good as seeing that
boy come down there for the checkered flag. He drove one heck of a
race. He drove a smart race.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 27, a native of Hickory, N.C., became the first NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series rookie to win this season after outdueling
fellow rookie Greg Biffle in a dazzling last-lap duel. Biffle
finished runner-up in his No. 50 Grainger Racing Ford F-150 when he
surrendered the lead to Houston in the final turn of the 200-lap
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clean,'' said Biffle, who swapped paint with Houston in
a last-lap drag race down the backstretch into Turn 3. ``I was just
trying to keep him down on the bottom of the racetrack to keep him
from getting into the corner good. I was just trying to do all I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time rookies finished 1-2 since Kenny Irwin,
Boris Said, and Rick Crawford finished 1-2-3 last June 6 at Texas.
Houston's victory, which was the first by a rookie since Irwin's
Texas triumph, vaulted him from 15th to 10th in the point standings
(1,768) and paid $44,575. ``It wasn't quite what Jeff Gordon
made,'' Houston joked, referring to Gordon's $1 million windfall
from his Brickyard 400 victory. ``But I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race that was highlighted by green-flag pit stops _ a first
in series history _ Houston capitalized on a winning pit strategy
developed by crew chief Rick Ren that called for a ``short pit''
for right-side tires on Lap 73. Twenty laps later, Houston came in
for left-side rubber and, on a green flag stop on Lap 162, pitted
for right-side tires and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've been in trouble if a caution came out,'' said
Houston, who survived a spark plug problem at the start of the race
and a pit-row fender bender with race leader Ron Hornaday to lead
three times for 56 laps. ``We were banking on it going green the
whole way. But I think getting right-side tires and fuel was what
really helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   It enabled Houston to put some serious heat on third-place
finisher Joe Ruttman and, at the very end, on Biffle, who fell out
of the lead when he was tapped from behind by Houston in Turn 4 of
the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We touched from the middle of Turn 1 and 2 to the middle of
Turn 3 and 4,'' Houston said. ``Then we weren't touching anymore
and I was looking at the checkered flag.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dale Shaw, of Center Conway, N.H., battled battery problems on
the last lap to hold off a hard-charging Brad Leighton, of Center
Harbor, N.H., to win the Pennzoil/VIP Discount 100 Busch North
Series race. ``Another 50 feet of racing, and he would've caught
me,'' said Shaw, who pocketed $23,800 for his 13th career Busch
North victory. ``But I was just driving it as hard as I could at
the end.'' ... After crashing his primary car Saturday and starting
40th, Mike Stefanik, of Coventry, R.I., survived a crash-marred
Featherlite Modified Tour event _ which was stopped five laps from
the finish to clear an eight-car melee _ and outraced Reggie
Ruggiero on the last lap to take the checkered flag in the third
and final race of the Pennzoil/VIP Discount Auto Centers
tripleheader.

INNOVATE WINS TURF WAR AT ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
 LIVING HANDICAP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ How good is Innovate?
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old proved she was the champion filly over the
Rockingham Park turf course Sunday, winning the $75,000 Spicy
Living Sweepstakes Handicap to back up her victory in the Rock
Breeders' Cup July 5. The question now is: can the talented
daughter of Relaunch do some serious business against the heavy
hitters at Saratoga?
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Innovate, who is owned by Willam Clifton Jr., and
the Rudlein Stable and trained by H. James Bond, was more
impressive in the Spicy Living than she was in the Rock Breeders'
Cup, swinging out from behind three horses turning for home and
motoring to the wire 1 3/4 lengths in front of Hero's Pride. Local
standout Sandy Gator ran hard and had the lead in midstretch, but
finished third, a half-length farther back.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Innovate was the second choice at 9-5 ($5.60)
under Frank Lovato despite her heroics here in July. Hero's Pride,
from the outstanding turf barn of trainer Christophe Clement, was
favored at 7-5 with Chris DeCarlo, coming off a strong allowance
win at Belmont Park. But when the real running started, Hero's
Pride could not match strides with Innovate to the wire despite
Hero's Pride having gained the lead between calls. Innovate had
defeated another Clement-trained horse, Heaven's Command, to take
the Rock Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Gator, ridden by Rudy Baez, was part of a three-horse
entry (including Nana's Toy, who was fourth, and Tara's Reward,
sixth) trained by Jimmy Hartley. She tried her best, which wasn't
quite good enough. Innovate tallied in the fast time of 1:47 2/5
for the ``about'' one mile and one-eighth distance over the grass.
The course record is 1:45 4/5 (Kiri's Clown in 1995) and the stakes
record is 1:46 4/5 (Via Borghese, '93).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned entering the stretch because I had two
horses in the entry (Tara's Reward, who set the early pace, and
Sandy Gator) in front of me and Clement's filly on the outside of
me,'' said Lovato. ``I was definitely concerned with the traffic
setup. Innovate was beautiful today. She was patient and it allowed
me to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally did get clear, I had to wake her and put her
into a dead drive. After three or four strides, she was gone. It
was unbelievable. I was shocked at how fast she finished that last
eighth. It was incredible. I think she'll fit in at Saratoga. Both
of the Clement fillies she's run against have been competitive up
there. She will be dangerous. She showed them she's got ability and
class. She's just getting to be her best.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCarlo made no mistakes with Hero's Pride, Innovate was just
too strong. ``I was surprised to see her go past me,'' said
DeCarlo. ``I left her at the three-eighths pole and she was boxed
in. My horse ran hard but the other horse was too good. I think the
ground might have been a little too hard for my mare,'' who
previously raced in Europe. ``But I knew Lovato was going to have
to track us. I went when the time was right. Innovate is just
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Innovate's success was an operation to correct an
entrapped epiglottis that her camp discovered after she ran third
in a stakes race at Hialeah in May. Since the breathing problem was
corrected, she has authored the two fine efforts at Rock, and Bond,
who is based at The Spa, will be studying the Saratoga condition
book to find the right spot for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really ready for this race,'' said Carlos Correa, an
assistant to Bond. ``She was sharper for this one than the first
one. My boss was very confident in her and she ran the way she was
training. We have her good right now, that's the main thing. We
don't know how good she is. We'll give her a shot in the big time
now that we have her confidence up. Whatever her next assignment
is, it will be at Saratoga.''

   Three quirky, highly personal portraits explore the themes of
racial and sexual identity by mixing memoir, literary criticism and
reflections on politics and psychology. The subjects are the
author's spirited mother, who moved to Brooklyn from Barbados;
Dorothy Dean, a brilliant but self-destructive fixture in New
York's gay scene in the '60s and '70s; and the Harlem poet and
dramatist Owen Dodson, who was Hilton Als's mentor and lover. In
1997 our reviewer, Andrea Lee, admired the ``almost magical
cohesiveness'' of these ``truly original'' essays, calling this ``a
book to read several times, noting how its application grows
broader and broader upon consideration.''

   &UR; THE GOOD BROTHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Chris Offutt. Scribner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   After his brother is killed, Virgil Caudill tries to escape a
blood feud in his Kentucky hill town by fleeing to Montana, but he
can't shake the past or the psychological pull of his homeland.
Last year in these pages, Jo Ann Kiser called this ``a fine first
novel by a fierce writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; T. REX AND THE CRATER OF DOOM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Walter Alvarez. Vintage, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A geologist describes how the discovery of a giant
65-million-year-old crater in Yucatan helped advance the once
scandalous theory that a comet or asteroid killed off the dinosaurs
(and nine-tenths of the planet's species at the time). Last year
our reviewer, Timothy Ferris, called this a ``deft and readable ...
account from the world's leading authority on death from above.''
In  &UR; DINOSAUR LIVES: UNEARTHING AN EVOLUTIONARY SAGA &LR; , by John R.
Horner and Edwin Dobb (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13), a leading
paleontologist and bone collector explains his craft and uses the
fossil record to offer fascinating ideas about how dinosaurs lived
and evolved. ``We can't all study dinosaurs, but books like this
mean we can all enjoy the process and the results,'' Philip
Gingerich wrote here in 1997. Back in the Holocene, the creatures
described in  &UR; THE MODERN ARK. THE STORY OF ZOOS: PAST, PRESENT AND
FUTURE &LR; , by Vicki Croke (Bard/Avon, $12), benefit from the author's
close-up observation of their lives in captivity. Combining history
with vivid accounts of maulings, this is an ``absorbing,
provocative book,'' Carol Peace Robins said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CORNERSTONE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Zoe Oldenbourg. Translated by Edward Hyams. Carroll &AMP; Graf,
$14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The title of this somber historical novel, which has just been
restored to print, refers to Christianity in 13th-century France
and the struggle among the members of a landowning family in
Champagne to build spiritual values in the squalid, bloody age of
chivalry. The result, Elizabeth Janeway said here in 1955, is ``a
vital book, and a rich one'' by an author of ''very substantial
talent.'' Three hundred years later in the New World, the events of
 &UR; AZTEC AUTUMN &LR; , by Gary Jennings (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $6.99), unfold
during another brutal time, in the years after the invasion of
Mexico by the conquistadors. The hero is a young Aztec who plots
revenge after witnessing the death of his father at the hands of
the Spaniards. ``Jennings's fascinating if often gory novel is
guided by exhaustive research,'' Charles Salzberg said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOE IS I: THE GRAMMARPHOBE'S GUIDE TO BETTER ENGLISH IN PLAIN
ENGLISH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia T. O'Conner. Riverhead, $11.
</P>
<P>
   With chapter titles like ``Death Sentence: Do Cliches Deserve to
Die?'' and ``Comma Sutra: The Joy of Punctuation,'' it's fair to
assume that this grammar book, written by a former editor at The
New York Times Book Review, is irreverent and reader-friendly. But
it's also surprisingly useful. In 1996 our reviewer, Daniel
Pinkwater, called the guide ``lighthearted and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERONIMO REX &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Barry Hannah. Grove, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author's audacious first novel follows the larger-than-life
comic exploits of Harriman Monroe as he romps through the South in
the 1950s and '60s. When it was first published in 1972, our
reviewer, Jim Harrison, called this ``a stunning piece of
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNGRY GHOSTS: MAO'S SECRET FAMINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jasper Becker. Owl/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist re-creates in chilling detail the 1959-61 famine
that killed up to 30 million Chinese, a calamity caused by the
obstinacy of the nation's ruthless, ideologically driven leaders.
The book, with a new afterword on the current famine in North
Korea, is ``powerful and important,'' Nicholas Eberstadt wrote here
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXILES: THREE SHORT NOVELS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Philip Caputo. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in Micronesia, suburban Connecticut or Vietnam, the
misfit heroes in this collection are outsiders whose defects lead
them into trouble. Last year in these pages, David Haward Bain said
two of three stories displayed the author's ``extraordinary eye for
the exotica of locale and behavior.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 25,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, `LOLITA' STILL DISTURBS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am probably responsible for the odd fact that people don't
seem to name their daughters Lolita anymore,'' Vladimir Nabokov
once said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita'' is Nabokov's story of Humbert Humbert, a 36-year-old
man, and his doomed obsession with a 12-year-old girl. Few literary
creations have entered the popular imagination in the same way
``Lolita'' has.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the idea of Lolita, defined by the American Heritage
Dictionary as ``a seductive adolescent girl,'' should be passe.
After all, if they were made flesh, Humbert and Lolita would not
seem out of place on ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' There, under the
hot lights, Humbert would slump in his chair, alternately sullen
and importuning, while Lolita, peevish and out of control, would be
restrained by stagehands as she seethed about how Humbert done her
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nabokov's ``Lolita,'' or at least what people think of when
they think of Lolita, continues to disturb. Sunday night, a new
R-rated movie version, starring Jeremy Irons and directed by Adrian
Lyne, will have its American premiere on Showtime cable television.
It will open in theaters next month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Cincinnati-based National Coalition for the
Protection of Children and Families urged Showtime not to broadcast
the movie, but the network declined to cancel it. ``This film will
increase child molestation and have a harmful effect on pedophiles
and healthy men,'' said Jerry Kirk, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   Like the novel, the new movie almost didn't reach the public.
Nabokov's novel, completed in 1953, was rejected by five American
publishers for fear of being prosecuted for obscenity, before it
was published in Paris in 1955 and in New York in 1958 by G.P.
Putnam's Sons.
</P>
<P>
   The movie languished for more than a year, its distributors
deciding on only a limited release in Europe, which was absorbed by
pedophilia scandals in Belgium last year. Similarly, American film
distributors, worried that the subject matter would be box-office
poison, rejected the movie until Showtime, in search of
high-profile programming, picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nabokov did not write Lolita to gain sympathy for
pedophiles,'' said Alfred Appel Jr., editor of ``The Annotated
Lolita'' (Vintage, 1991). ``Lolita is not about pornography. It's
about a crippling obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   But what also disturbs is that Humbert is recognizably human,
said the novelist Martin Amis, who wrote an article in the Atlantic
Monthly on ``Lolita'' in 1992. His obsession shocks, Amis said,
because it is the failing of a human being, and not that of a
monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of hidden sexuality in a child is a haunting one,''
he said. ``It is something that some part of us wants to see, but
another part of us never wants to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tricky on the page, ``Lolita'' is even trickier on screen. The
book was first adapted to film in 1962 by Stanley Kubrick, who
complained later that he had not anticipated the intensity of
studio censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The movie eventually became more chaste, with Humbert becoming
older and less vigorous in the person of 52-year-old James Mason,
who never kisses Lolita. At the same time, Kubrick made Lolita more
lurid _ and a teen-ager _ in the person of 15-year-old bikini-clad,
lollipop-licking Sue Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   The lurid stuck. When people think of Lolita, they think of that
sexually aggressive teen-ager, not Nabokov. The latest movie
version hews closer to the book, but any depiction of sex with a
child, unfiltered by Nabokov's ironic prose, is shocking. Lyne's
Lolita, Dominique Swain, who was 15 at the time of filming, is made
to look, with pigtails, like a 12-year-old.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a screening of ``Lolita'' earlier this year, the movie's
screenwriter, Stephen Schiff, was startled when a woman blithely
said to him, ``I guess you called her Lolita because she was really
kind of a Lolita, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Today there seem to be so many real-life counterparts to Humbert
and his ``Lo'' (full name: Dolores Haze), ranging from the
buffoonish to the discomforting to the horrifying: Amy Fisher and
Joey Buttafuoco, Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen, JonBenet Ramsey
and her murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Coontz, author of ``The Way We Really Are: Coming to
Terms With America's Changing Families'' (Basic Books, 1997), said
earlier Americans held views about children and sexuality that
would be disturbing today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1889, the age of female consent was 10 in 14 states,
including Alabama and New Jersey, and as young as 7 in Delaware.
Campaigns led by early feminists helped raise the age to 18, she
said. ``In a way, however, innocence then became eroticized,'' Ms.
Coontz said. ``Lack of experience, innocence, became the ideal for
the marriageable woman. But what is the ultimate lack of
experience, if not the prepubescent?''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Postman, who wrote ``The Disappearance of Childhood''
(Vintage, 1994), said ``Lolita'' is disturbing for a far deeper
reason; childhood, as an age of protection from adult secrets, is
fast disappearing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new technologies, television being at the forefront,
there are fewer and fewer secrets _ medical secrets, sexual
secrets, political secrets,'' Postman said. ``Adults used to reveal
secrets to you, the child, in stages, in school, in books. When you
knew all the secrets, you become an adult. But now all of that is
available on the Internet or TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as society has become more tolerant of sexual matters,
including adultery and homosexuality as well as teen-age sex, it
has become less tolerant of anything that hints of adult sex with
preteen children, said Paula Fass, author of ``Kidnapped: Child
Abduction in America'' (Oxford University, 1997). ``We've become a
society obsessed by, haunted by, sex with children,'' she said.
``I, as a parent and citizen, want our children protected, but now
any kind of adult love or attention paid to children is immediately
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schiff, it was easy to keep the novel's late 1940s period
for the movie. ``I didn't set Lolita in contemporary times for a
simple reason,'' he said. ``It would be absurd. Parents today would
be looking for Humbert Humbert everywhere.''

 WHAT THE RUSSIANS ALREADY KNOW ABOUT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally file on Saturday, August(The Week in Review) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Centuries ago, when laying siege to Moscow was a coming-of-age
rite for aspiring young plunderers and sackers, a tradition
developed in which invading chieftains camped southwest of town, on
a big hill by the Moscow River, and awaited word of surrender.
Legend says Napoleon slept there, in 1812, at the climax of one of
history's most infamous military campaigns. This was no ordinary
hill.
</P>
<P>
   It no longer exists. A few years ago, the Russians bulldozed it
tabletop-flat to build an outsized monument to their victory in the
Great Patriotic War, otherwise known as World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Russians take World War II seriously. This is not to say that
Americans do not. Perhaps to its credit, America has been bowled
over, emotionally and viscerally, by ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the
new Steven Spielberg film that is being hailed as a corrective to
Hollywood's glorification, even trivialization, of combat.
Moviegoers are yanked out of their romantic reveries about war by a
display of gore that makes Sam Peckinpah look like Mr. Rogers. They
may never look at a war movie the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   To which Russians might say, ``What took you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If on your territory there was a war every 10 years, and half
the country was destroyed and every family lost someone _ well,
what attitude would you have toward war?'' asks Pavel Chukhrai.
``For us, war was never a stroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Chukhrai, a Spielberg fan, has more standing to speak about war
films than most. He is one of Russia's most successful modern
directors. His most recent film, ``Vor'' (``A Thief''), was
nominated for an Academy Award and won a sheaf of foreign prizes.
It is the story of a family taken in during World War II by a con
man in a military uniform; it is also a parable about the rule of
Stalin and Russia's tragic search for a strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Chukrai's 77-year-old father, Grigory Chukhrai, is the director
of one of Russia's most acclaimed and controversial World War II
films, ``Ballad of a Soldier.'' It is the 1959 story of a war hero
who is rewarded with home leave, falls in love, tends to his mother
and eventually returns to the front to die in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian films always had big crowds of soldiers, battle scenes
and people giving their lives for the motherland,'' he said in an
interview last week. ``I decided to make a film about what happens
when the world loses a single nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   These are pacifist themes, yet as the invasion of Afghanistan
and the conflict in the breakaway republic of Chechnya demonstrate,
all Russians are not pacifists.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the military disasters in both places go a
long way to explain the strain of cynicism that runs through
Russian attitudes toward the military today, which both Chukhrais
acknowledge. Among the young in particular, war and military
service, at a time when the government is hard-pressed to pay its
soldiers, have lost much of their appeal, as they did in the United
States after the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``For generations after me, the Great Patriotic War is very far
away,'' said the younger Chukhrai, who was born in 1946. ``The
attitude isn't so emotional. I can have an attitude toward Napoleon
and the War of 1812, but it isn't emotional. It's the same with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Russian emotional involvement with the Great Patriotic
War is not so easily dismissed. May 9, victory day, remains the
greatest of Russian holidays. There is a group of young Russians
who volunteer time and effort to search for the unrecovered bones
of lost Soviet soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are a little rankled that Americans seem to know so
little of the winter siege that preoccupied Hitler's army while the
West marshaled its strength for the campaign in Western Europe that
inspired countless miles of Hollywood celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   Russian army casualties, conservatively estimated at 29 million,
represented more than three-quarters of all Allied casualties in
the war, according to the historian Orlando Figes _ and that's not
counting Russian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As the two Chukhrais make clear, World War II for the Russian
people was never a struggle for Stalin or communism; rather, it was
a struggle against German invaders. In America, a nation which has
not been invaded since 1812, it is a distinction that is easily
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were not defending communism,'' the younger Chukhrai
said. ``They were defending their national identity, their loved
ones. It is not for nothing that people who fought there believe to
the end of their days _ 40, 50 years later _ that this was the high
point of their lives.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The enduring Castro
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 5, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There are some things that just won't go away. Examples:
nuclear waste, Monica Lewinsky's dress _ and Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a wickedly interesting period on the Castro front.
</P>
<P>
   He triumphantly toured three English-speaking Caribbean islands,
including Grenada, from where his ``workers'' were expelled 15
years ago by U.S. troops. Throughout the Caribbean, including the
three visited nations, calls echoed for the end of the U.S.'s
37-year-old embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As Castro reveled in a 21-gun salute in Grenada and sympathy for
the isolation of his island by the U.S., his enemies continued to
tear at each other, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. Liars called
liars ``liars,'' and the gullible stood by their gullibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exile community, physically and emotionally scarred by
years of political doublespeak from no less than nine different
White House occupants and hordes of congressional types, and
cannibalized by internecine squabbling, seems more involved now
with putting out internal fires than figuratively lighting any in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And the media isn't helping matters much.
</P>
<P>
   Even The New York Times appears to have given too much credence
to a man who first claimed that the late Jorge Mas Canosa and the
Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) paid him to launch
terrorist attacks on Havana hotels last year.
</P>
<P>
   When the Times printed that story, an enraged Miami-based CANF
not only denied involvement in terrorism but threatened to drop a
libel suit on the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the story, an aging, admitted terrorist, now says
he lied to the Times reporter and that the reporter should have
done a better job of checking out his story. (Everyone, it seems,
complains about the media _ even the ones who corrupt them.)
</P>
<P>
   The Times, oddly, says it is standing by its story because that
is what the source told the paper. There's nothing like a direct
quote, even if it is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, and while Castro was polishing his belt buckle
for his trip to Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada, a woman stepped
forward to claim that she was part of a surgical team that treated
Castro for a brain disorder last year.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language edition
of the Miami Herald, that was doing the reporting. Naturally, the
Castro government denied it. Then people within the Cuban exile
community began wondering about the woman. There were questions as
to how long ago she defected to Costa Rica and whether she really
was a doctor, and ultimately her ex-husband living in Colombia
reported the woman was a total fraud: not a doctor, not even a
nurse. He said she was a teller of tall tales.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban diaspora is particularly painful. U.S. presidents have
promised them an end to Castro but have not delivered. Instead,
they invoked U.S. neutrality acts and told the CIA-trained exile
operatives to behave themselves _ sell limes on street corners, or
insurance, but don't do what we trained you for.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, self-proclaimed militants would say they have
returned to Miami from raids on the Cuban coast when, in truth,
they never went anywhere other than the neighborhood coffee stand.
These fouled the deeds of the militants who actually performed
anti-Castro raids before the U.S. muscled them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In the almost four decades of Castro's dictatorship, he has
successfully twisted the U.S. embargo to be the sole reason for all
that is wrong in Cuba. We gave him that opportunity, and continue
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And in Miami, those who years earlier felt his spiked heel
stagger in rumor, belief and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   First Jack Nicholson turns up in Havana and praises Castro, then
a 21-gun salute for him in Grenada. ``This must be as good as it
gets,'' Castro probably is thinking to himself.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Death, yes; taxes, no _ so says Big Tobbaco
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you still have any doubts about just how cynically the
tobacco companies have been jerking you around with their megabuck
advertising campaign against federal legislation, check the report
just put out by the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cigarette companies' game has been to distract us from
the obvious, CDC has had to go to the bother of proving the
obvious. A CDC study finds that a sharp increase in cigarette taxes
would deeply slash sales, precisely the objective of recently
failed legislation that would have used a cigarette tax increase to
force up the price.
</P>
<P>
   The health agency calculates that a 50 percent increase in the
price of cigarettes would lead some 3.5 million smokers to quit and
far more to cut down. Overall, CDC figures 60 billion fewer
cigarettes would be smoked annually. The biggest gains against
smoking would be among low-income folks, minorities and young
people _ all of them prime targets of opportunity for the tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies would hate in particular losing the young. The
cigarette makers need young smokers to make up for the 400,000 of
us they kill with their product every year _ more than the deaths
from murder, alcohol, AIDS and traffic combined.
</P>
<P>
   It is to preserve the profits from this annual human slaughter
that the industry has flooded television with commercials
pretending cigarette companies are the good buddies of working guys
and gals.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the pitch: Washington wants to get its hand on
smoking just so it can soak working folks for more taxes to pay for
more big government. In a series of commercials, all variations on
the same themes, the industry plays the hot buttons as if it were
the church organist pounding out a mighty hymn. Taxes _ bad.
Government _ bad. Working people _ good.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the industry cared about working people it would
stop selling them poison and go into bedding or insurance or
anything else less lethal. But the $40 million tobacco has spent so
far _ small change compared to the lost sales it fears _ fails to
mention that the biggest beneficiaries of the reduced smoking would
be exactly the same people it pretends to be protecting from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the CDC study counts as news is its currency.
We've known for years that smoking is price-sensitive with many of
tobacco's customers. Another study just last May found that the
proposed $1.10 tax per pack would cut teen smoking by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's far more payoff than is likely from the scolding, just
say no-no ads the Republican Congress, having done tobacco's
bidding by quashing legislation, now favors as a politically
face-saving substitute.
</P>
<P>
   An unbought Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, continues
trying to find a political opening that would let him bring back
his tobacco control bill. He is struggling upstream against a
torrent of industry advertising that has managed so far to convince
enough folks that a $1.10 tax on cigarettes is somehow a bigger
cost than those 400,000 lives and $50 billion in annual medical
expenses that we shell out to keep the tobacco companies rich.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

 c.1996 Family Circle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

 THE SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER': OUTRAGEOUS  
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August(The Week in Review) 
(mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This spring the call went out to the creators of television
programs: The networks want something original, something fresh; no
more cop shows, lawyer shows, emergency-room shows and sitcoms
about the dating dilemmas of New York City 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the results look disappointing, according to one
top programmer, who in an unusually confessional interview assessed
the coming television season in blunt terms: ``The quality of the
new shows this year is absolutely horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But how about original? Well, the new season features the
first-ever sitcom set in the Lincoln White House and featuring Mary
Todd Lincoln grabbing Abe's stovepipe hat, climbing on a table and
warbling, ``Happy Birthday, president,'' with Monroe-like (and I
don't mean James) fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.'' If nothing
else, the comedy series, to be unleashed this fall by the
mini-network UPN, signals the desperate need for network television
to find something that breaks though the bland clutter that many
executives say is causing the ever-increasing erosion of their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   With its producers acknowledging that UPN executives asked them
to ``do something outrageous,'' ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' might be seen
as what happens a year after an outrageous, dirty-mouthed animated
show called ``South Park'' becomes a talked-about hit on a cable
channel seen in less than half as many homes as a broadcast
network.
</P>
<P>
   That open call for outrageousness led to such ideas as a
``karaoke sitcom,'' in which an audience member would be dropped
unrehearsed into the cast of a comedy each week, and ``Catch Me If
You Can,'' which was to feature a couple of contestants on the lam
around the country and hunted by professional trackers. Neither of
those shows made the fall schedules. That leaves ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer'' to inject a hearty dose of the outrageous
into the new season.
</P>
<P>
   How outrageous is it? In the pilot episode Lincoln downs brandy
doctored with an aphrodisiac that leaves him so charged up that he
starts rhapsodizing about all those boys going to war with ``big
biceps'' and ``washboard stomachs,'' and winds up in a hug with his
black aide, declaring, ``It's not right for one man to own another
_ respect, care for, vacation together, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   That aide is Desmond Pfeiffer, a fictional member of the White
House kitchen staff, an unlucky emigre from England, where he was a
wealthy landowner. (Nobody's going for verisimilitude here.)
Desmond's last name, by the way, is pronounced with the P, as in
``Puh-feiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is fictional: Gen. Ulysses S. Grant is around,
drinking in all of his scenes and forgetting which color uniform
his troops wear. And Mary Todd Lincoln is featured throughout.
First, she's upset because Abe has hired a new secretary, Mona,
with an especially low-cut bodice. (Abe does growl like a wolf at
the prospect of Mona taking dictation.) Mary calls Mona a foul name
through a pretend cough.
</P>
<P>
   Later Mrs. Lincoln laments that she and Abe haven't had much of
a love life since that war started and, from her bubble bath, she
makes a play for Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond puts her off at one point by sending her downstairs with
the message: ``Francis Scott Key left a bag of taffy for you in the
Green Room.'' So he would have been dead for 20 years at that point
in history, how's Mrs. L. supposed to know that?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Abe gets enough of the love potion to the point that
Mrs. Lincoln exults to Desmond, ``The Old Rail Splitter is back!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Barry Fanaro, one of the show's creators, this is
not meant to be a conventional sitcom and certainly not a history
lesson. Instead, its goal is contemporary political satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making as much fun of Lincoln as we are of
Clinton,'' Fanaro said. ``Lincoln is going through the same
scrutiny that a president goes through now. And we're able to make
fun of politics today. We'll also make references to other
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else comes close to ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' despite the
crying need, as Peter Roth, the president of entertainment for the
Fox Network, put it, for programs that are ``different and
distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   But is this the definition of ``different and distinctive''
programming that viewers really want?
</P>
<P>
   Chi McBride, who stars as Desmond, said: ``Everybody's not going
to like everything. I wouldn't have liked being in the pitch
meeting for `Hogan's Heroes.' `See, some Nazi concentration camp.
And it's funny!'''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: ``Hogan's Heroes'' ran for six years.

 AN AMERICAN ARCHETYPE: THE PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC  
(The Week in Review) 
(mk) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A deranged man who believes that the CIA and other secret
government forces are conspiring to control his mind goes on a
rampage, and innocent people die.
</P>
<P>
   Lashing out in an explosion of paranoia, this figure has become
an American archetype. By the time a gunman barged into the Capitol
on July 24, killing two police officers and wounding a tourist, the
figure was so familiar that the suspect, Russell Weston Jr., might
have been wearing a sign around his neck: loner, with delusions of
government persecution. Diagnostic history: paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The usual discussions ensued about the clinical nature of
schizophrenia, which medical science has concluded is a biological
disease of the brain. But little attention was paid to the cultural
dimension of the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries produce terrorists and murderous psychopaths,
but experts say the United States clearly leads the world in the
production of deranged people with paranoid delusions who commit
public acts of violence _ individuals like Timothy McVeigh, who
killed 168 people when he blew up a federal building in Oklahoma in
1995, and who believed that the military had secretly implanted a
computer chip in his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many of these paranoid schizophrenics focus their
delusions on the same few suspects: the CIA, the president and
other federal agents?
</P>
<P>
   ``A strain of paranoia has always been just below the surface of
the American attitude toward the government,'' said Geoffrey Cocks,
a historian at Albion College.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shweder, a professor of human development at the
University of Chicago, said, ``Paranoids as a rule pay close
attention to what's going on.'' Considering some of the documented
abuses by the CIA, the FBI and other federal agencies, Shweder
said, a deranged mind could easily find evidence to spin delusional
theories.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much detailed research on why America produces
delusional people prone to violence, but some experts say the easy
availability of guns and explosives contributes to the phenomenon,
as does the weakening of traditional family and community safety
nets that used to keep many of the violent mentally ill in check.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the World Health Organization during the 1980s found
that paranoid schizophrenics in 10 countries shared ``persistent,
compelling delusional beliefs about themselves and the world in
which nothing is accidental and everything has special
significance,'' said Assen Jablensky, a professor of psychiatry at
the University of Western Australia who helped evaluate the
research.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ which focused on Japan, Denmark, Colombia, Nigeria,
India, the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Britain, Ireland
and the United States _ found that schizophrenics generally
responded better to treatment in less developed countries than in
more technologically developed ones.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that schizophrenics in Colombia, Nigeria
and India suffered less severe symptoms than those in Britain and
the United States, a difference attributed to cultural factors like
stronger extended families and greater financial pressure to hold a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Westermeyer, a professor of psychiatry at the University
of Minnesota who has done extensive research on the mentally ill in
Southeast Asia, said that in less developed countries, ``People who
have paranoid delusions tend to focus them more on powerful
spiritual forces, like demons or gods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel their life is being taken out of their control
they might look to things like sorcery, ghosts or the animistic
forces in nature,'' he added, or to ``black magic'' directed at
them by relatives or neighbors with whom they are having a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   An obsession with ``sources of great power'' is a common thread
among all delusional paranoids, said Irving Gottesman, a professor
of psychology at the University of Virginia. In the United States,
paranoid delusions ``usually involved God or Jesus'' until well
into this century, Gottesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came radio, which carried messages from unseen voices from
far away, followed by television, which distilled broad national
experiences into intensely personal images. With the advent of
broadcast technology, Gottesman said, ``We went from Jesus to the
CIA without a break, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Westermeyer added: ``In the United States, you don't see nearly
as many mentally ill people anymore who have delusions and
hallucinations with regard to God and the saints as you did 20 or
30 years ago, when I was first doing this work. In our secular
society, it's more a matter of, well, `The president or the CIA is
affecting my behavior by radio waves or microwave receivers in my
teeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme cases like the shootings in the Capitol aside, the
source of most violence by paranoid schizophrenics is closer to
home, Westermeyer said. ``You actually get more of that kind of
violence on a pedestrian level _ people ascribing the evil in their
lives to a spouse, to parents, a boss or co-workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Goldstein, an associate professor of psychology at
Stanford University, said: ``We all feel some paranoia or have what
could be classified as delusional thoughts occasionally. That
doesn't mean we're all suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who are, she said, it is logical, if not
reasonable, to fix on bogymen like the CIA: ``Somebody all-powerful
is out to get me? It must be the CIA. Why? It's all-powerful. It's
done all these bizarre things. And it's secretive.''

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, the late Speaker Thomas O'Neill's famous
dictum that all politics is local has been gospel in this capital,
believed in the soul, repeated early and often. But Tip O'Neill
hadn't seen this year's fight over statistical sampling to augment
the 2000 Census and to account for those who are generally missed
by traditional head-counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   As if defying the laws of politics _ and some might even say
logic _ the pitched battle over what seems an arcane subject has
not been marked by the regional divisions that normally define
fights over how to count the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the current imbroglio has been a purely partisan
affair, so much so that some of the principals seem to be putting
party loyalty above the interests of their state or region.
Republicans are fighting _ and Democrats are staunchly supporting _
the Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling even though
there is evidence that the states that will be helped the most by
sampling will be the strongholds of their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not understand the Republican opposition to sampling,''
said David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, who is studying the impact of the
use of sampling on the census. ``The states that would be hurt the
most are much more Democratic than the states that are
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed methodology is straightforward. The Census Bureau
plans to count at least 90 percent of all households in every
census tract _ neighborhoods of roughly 1,700 dwellings. The
results of that large ``sample'' will be used to estimate the
number and characteristics of the people in the remaining 10
percent. To provide a quality check, statisticians will compare
their estimates with the result of a national survey of 750,000
households.
</P>
<P>
   But if the method seems clear-cut, the lineups for and against
sampling seem bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1990 census had been adjusted using sampling methods,
Georgia's population would have been boosted by about 300,000. Some
demographers feel the same result would probably happen in 2000.
Yet sampling is opposed by all the members of the state's
Republican delegation, including Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has
filed suit in federal court to have the Census Bureau's plans
declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the Congressional Research Service suggests that
if the Census Bureau does not use sampling in 2000, Mississippi
could lose a congressional seat. Yet the technique is vigorously
opposed by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``No one
is served well by having some computer in Washington guess how many
people live in Buckatunna, Mississippi,'' Lott's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic proponents of sampling exhibit their own
incongruities. A study by the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies indicates that some of the states with the most to
lose from sampling are Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts and Missouri.
But some of the staunchest proponents of the method are people like
Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, and Rep.
Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that everybody on both sides of the aisle ought to
look closer at what sampling might do to their respective states,''
said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a sampling opponent who was
the ranking Republican on the House committee that oversaw the 1990
census. ``Some people favor sampling. But if their numbers go up a
little bit because of sampling, and the numbers go up substantially
in other states, they may lose.''
</P>
<P>
   An explanation for the positions might be that politicians, like
generals, are fighting an old war. Like many issues where race is
involved _ and it is minorities who are disproportionately
undercounted _ the assumption is that it is a problem of blacks in
northern cities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 1990 census showed that the undercount was becoming
more an issue for the Sun Belt, a sign of how the South and West
are being transformed by the influx of Latino immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real change from where the undercount was in 1990
from where it was in 1980,'' said Paula Duggan, a senior policy
analyst for the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research center for
Northern lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But ignorance of the country's demographic shifts is not the
whole answer for the sharp partisanship that characterizes the
current debate over sampling.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1990 census many Sun Belt lawmakers, both Republicans
and Democrats, were well aware of how their states would be
short-changed in the allocation of federal funds. They pleaded with
the Bush administration to adjust the population count upward based
on numbers that had been derived through sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now argue that they merely want a more accurate
count when the data are used for disbursing federal funds. But,
they say, the use of sampling to apportion seats in the House and
draw congressional districts is illegal and could be manipulated
for partisan advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allocating representation in Congress, where there are
always winners and losers, which is much more fundamental than
money,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposes sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the current political dynamic may be pushing both
parties toward positions on sampling that may be against their own
regional or state interests.
</P>
<P>
   Because such a large proportion of those who are missed by
traditional counting methods are minorities, some analysts say, the
Democratic Party, whose statewide and national candidates depend on
black and Hispanic voters, have little or no choice but to support
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you imagine what would happen if the Democrats said we
don't care if there is a black undercount or a Hispanic
undercount?'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Republicans holding a thin majority of 11 seats in
the House, there may be a palpable fear that anything, including
sampling, might cause them to lose power. After all, holding onto
the chairmanship of a congressional committee that decides which
federal programs are financed is probably more politically
compelling than getting a few million additional dollars through
funding formulas based on population counts.

FOREIGN POLICY'S NEW BUZZWORD: CONTAGION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, Aug. 1.) (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another era, the domino theory was used to
justify America's risking of lives in Southeast Asia and other
battlefields of the Cold War. Lose one country to communism, and
others would fall. Historians will long argue whether the theory
was right, or a politically convenient fiction. But few were
willing to gamble on finding out, until the threshold of national
pain became too great in the rice paddies of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   For a year now the domino theory has been making a comeback,
this time paired with the newest buzzword in foreign policy:
contagion. The general idea is the same _ if one country's economy
is permitted to implode, it could start an uncontrollable set of
events around the world _ even if it has less to do with guns and
communists than with currency reserves and the psychology of
panicked investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial domino theory has actually proven more accurate
than the national-security domino theory,'' Lawrence Summers, the
deputy secretary of the Treasury, mused in his office last week.
``Vietnam fell and other countries didn't. But you saw what
happened after Thailand,'' the ground zero of the Asian meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a significant shift in the way some in Washington
look at how the world is woven together. Before the Mexican peso
crisis in late 1994, only economists talked about ``financial
contagion.'' Now it is the throw-away phrase of dozens of daily
headlines. Like any fast-spreading disease, it now comes in many
varieties: There is market contagion, export contagion, yen
contagion, and now even reverse contagion, which is akin to giving
the flu to children and then catching it from them all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who were comfortable with the old Cold War dominoes
now stuff their speeches with speculation about contagion's
political impact. Last week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
cautioned that the political impact was just beginning to be felt.
``Misery,'' she warned in Australia, which is reeling from Asia's
troubles, ``can give rise to mistrust among nations.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration, like the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations during Vietnam, is using the fear of falling
dominoes to get Congress to finance a policy of containment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday President Clinton used the latest evidence of a
slowdown in the American economy _ 1.4 percent growth in the second
quarter, down from 5.5 percent _ to bolster his arguments that
Congress should pony up $18 billion more for the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF cites the anxieties about ``systemic contagion'' in the
world's major economies to explain why it has led rescue efforts
totaling roughly $150 billion in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea
and the riskiest bailout of all, Russia. (And that excludes this
summer's coming attractions: Ukraine, Pakistan and perhaps
Malaysia.)
</P>
<P>
   But how many of the world's problems can contagion really
explain? Can a banking crisis in rich, mismanaged Japan really
explain the flight of investors from broke, mismanaged Russia? Why
should a stampede of investors out of a small nation like Thailand
cause absolutely nothing for two months and then lead to a stampede
in neighboring Indonesia and then faraway emerging markets from
South Africa to Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   And since it was not exactly a well-kept secret that Southeast
Asia is a hotbed of cronyism, corruption and weak banks, how could
some of the world's savviest investors suddenly conclude that this
a fatal flaw, one that sent them racing to pull out their money?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that sometimes the fall of the fiscal dominoes
makes perfect sense. Except when it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The most straightforward strain of economic contagion is as old
as international trade, and these days farmers in North Dakota and
miners in Australia can tell you all about it. Asia's slowdown has
cut deeply into its consumption of all kinds of commodities.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while to ripple through the world economy, but now it
has hit full force. American exports, which drove economic growth
for so long, have fallen off a cliff. Moreover, the resulting
commodities glut has depressed prices for everyone. And the price
declines have wreaked havoc elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's biggest problem is that it can't convince its people to
pay taxes, but its second-biggest problem is the decline in oil
prices that has cut into its most important source of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other, more complex channels of contagion, like
the currency devaluations that have sent Asia reeling. More than
ever, countries compete with each other the same way companies do:
South Korea and Japan, for example, both produce computer chips and
cars. And when one country's currency falls, those products are
suddenly available in the United States and elsewhere at sale
prices. That tempts other countries to let the value of their
currencies fall.
</P>
<P>
   That can quickly turn into a vicious, competitive cycle, which
is one reason the United States is pleading with China and Russia
not to devalue their currencies. ``If China devalues, Southeast
Asia is back in the fire,'' says one senior IMF official. ``And if
Russia devalues, that's it for the Ukraine.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, of course, don't stand around watching. They play a
critical role in fueling the fires, or tamping them out. And this
is where the markets and the politics get so intertwined that it is
impossible to tell where domestic economic policy stops and
diplomacy begins.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, for example, The New York Times reported that
American officials and outside experts now believe Japan's banks
may have upward of $1 trillion in bad debts. Traders began to sell
the yen, and kept selling after the new Japanese finance minister,
Kiichi Miyazawa, made comments about his economic plans that
sounded wobbly to investors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Russian officials, fresh from their latest
IMF bailout, sounded marginally less serious about implementing the
reforms they promised in return for the world's money. Investors
hit the sell button.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is where the market contagion kicks in. If Japan is getting
sicker, doesn't that mean its time to sell currencies elsewhere in
Asia, where everything depends on how fast Japan recovers? And
other investors, sitting in their offices in New York or at a home
computer in Berlin, may simply decide that they didn't know as much
about some of these countries as they thought they did.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than examine the differences between Thailand and
Indonesia they succumb to the natural reaction to pack up their
cash and get out of every emerging market. Technology has made that
cheaper and easier to do than ever, so infections spread faster
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not limited to new investors. ``We were
astounded to discover how little some very large investors knew
about Korea,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said a few months
ago. Once burned, he noted, they looked for similar symptoms
elsewhere and found them all over the globe. That's when those
dominoes start falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to describe this is rational panic,'' said
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who has studied the causes of
contagion. ``Even if you think that conditions are fundamentally
sound in a country, if everyone else is headed out the door, it
makes sense for you to head out, too, because someone is going to
be left holding the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs and others have been studying the question of how to
identify countries that could easily fall prey to contagion. He and
others are increasingly focused on the ratio of a country's
short-term debts to its foreign currency reserves. If the debt
soars out of line with the reserves, it can lead to panic. But the
IMF is hesitant to blow the whistle on countries that appear headed
for trouble, for fear of causing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So countries are looking for other solutions. Tung Chee-hwa, the
chief executive of the world's most free-market city, Hong Kong,
startled Clinton's delegation during its visit last month when he
talked about whether Asian countries should control the flow of
capital into and out of the region. No one in Asia talked that way
when $400 billion poured in between 1990 and 1996. But then it all
left at once.
</P>
<P>
   All that money is not going to flow back any time soon.
Investors hate uncertainty. Eventually, bargain hunters sense that
the bottom has been hit and money is once again trickling back into
Thailand and Korea. But as anyone who has played with dominoes
knows, knocking them over takes a lot less time than setting them
up.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., likened homosexuality to
kleptomania and alcoholism. But through a prism of pragmatic
politics, his comments seemed to make sense: The latest Gallup Poll
shows that 59 percent of Americans say that homosexual behavior is
morally wrong. In his own party, Lott played to a particularly
receptive audience, because Republicans are far less accepting of
homosexuality than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Given the pounding President Clinton took in 1993 when he tried
to overturn the ban on homosexuals in the military, he, too, seemed
to be asking for trouble recently when he issued an executive order
barring federal agencies from discriminating against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's move may have been shrewd as well: The most
pronounced shift in attitudes toward homosexuals in recent years
has been a steady increase in support for equal rights in
employment, housing and job protections. A survey by the
president's pollsters, released last week by the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay group, showed that 70 percent of Americans support
Clinton's order.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion about homosexuals is so fluid, and often so
seemingly contradictory, that it can be treacherous for any
politician to take a stand on anything related to homosexuality.
For years Democrats and Republicans have been skittish about the
issue, and not only because many people are uncomfortable about
delving into private lives. Attitudes toward homosexuality are so
complex that they cannot easily be transformed into yes or no party
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has been so verboten that it was considered a
triumph for homosexual organizations when, early in Clinton's first
term, the White House released a photograph of the president
meeting with leaders of the groups.
</P>
<P>
   But now, homosexuality has sprung to the lead of political
dialogue on more fronts than ever. Last week, the House approved a
measure that would deny federal housing money to San Francisco
because of its support of homosexual partners; a measure, also
passed, would take $21 million from housing programs for people
with AIDS and give it to veterans. The House will also consider a
measure that would deny federal money to carry out Clinton's order
regarding gay federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans have succeeded in blocking his nomination of a
wealthy gay contributor, James Hormel, as ambassador to Luxembourg.
The debate intensified when conservative groups began running
full-page newspaper advertisements featuring ``reformed''
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual groups responded with their own advertisements,
including one that featured smiling Republican parents and their
lesbian daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, are becoming more visible on gay issues. Clinton
was the guest of honor at a fund-raising event Saturday in East
Hampton, N.Y., sponsored by gay Democrats. Vice President Al Gore
and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic leader, are
increasingly willing to back gay issues. Gore will be the featured
speaker in September at the annual dinner of the Human Rights
Campaign. And five openly gay Democrats are running for Congress
this year, a record number.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, the debate is intended to bring out voters on
the fringes next November. Surveys show that the most conservative
Republicans are particularly uncomfortable with homosexuality, just
as the most liberal Democrats are most likely to embrace gay
rights. But a deeper explanation is that with the increasing
aggressiveness of the gay political movement and the greater
visibility of gays in pop culture, there is an assumption that
tolerance is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about these issues as Americans as we never
have before,'' said Richard Socarides, a senior White House adviser
who is the principal liaison on gay issues. ``I'm sure that the
changes in public opinion are quite frightening to conservatives _
but they're irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking. While attitudes seem, slowly, to
be drifting toward acceptance, the conundrum is that most people
still do not approve of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contradiction is that Americans are strongly in favor of
equal opportunities _ even for a situation they don't necessarily
approve of,'' said Frank Newport, the editor of the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the proportion of Americans who think homosexuals
should be hired as elementary school teachers has steadily
increased, to 55 percent in 1996 from 27 percent in 1977, according
to the Gallup Poll. But there is still a sizable proportion who do
not want homosexuals teaching elementary students. And in the view
of many Americans, homosexual behavior is now more acceptable than
adultery. But people still lump the two in the same category.
</P>
<P>
   Survey after survey shows a generational divide. Seven out of 10
people who are 65 and older say homosexual behavior is wrong,
according to the Gallup Poll; only five out of 10 who are between
18 and 29 have that view. While a recent Gallup Poll found that
more people think homosexuality is a product of environment and
upbringing rather than a biological trait, more and more Americans
think homosexuality is not a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Because attitudes toward homosexuals are evolving, politicians
can draw the wrong conclusions from poll findings that seem to back
their views. The proliferation of AIDS made the public less
sympathetic toward homosexuals in the 1980s, but by the time of
Clinton's election in 1992, tolerance had increased immensely. But
Clinton may have mistakenly concluded that an increase in support
for gay rights meant that people would support homosexuals in the
military. They did not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was more mindful of the polls in his re-election
campaign, when he signed a bill that opposed gay marriages. The
move enraged homosexual organizations but was intended to help him
rebuild good will with conservative Democrats. Politically, it was
a no-lose position because even most Democrats who believe
homosexual behavior is morally acceptable do not believe that
homosexuals should be allowed to marry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are now finding that despite public discomfort with
homosexuality, sharp oratory may not be welcome either. Some are
now distancing themselves from Lott's comments, fearing they could
make the party appear intolerant and carry a political toll in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it helps to have public leaders engaged in that
kind of dialogue,'' Speaker Newt Gingrich said. Gary Bauer, a
prominent conservative who heads the Family Research Council, said
he wished the debate would focus on policy matters like gay
adoptions (which polls show most Americans do not favor) _ not on
whether homosexuality is a sin. But he also said, ``On the sin
issue, I don't want to undercut Trent in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said he did not share the view
of some Republicans that criticism of homosexuals by people like
Bauer made his party appear insensitive. He said he worried more
about Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who as part of his aggressive
courtship of gay voters has condemned many of his fellow
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone like D'Amato saying we're intolerant hurts us far more
than anything Gary Bauer says,'' Goeas said, ``because it plays
into the label of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   That Republicans are even debating how not to appear intolerant
is perhaps the best evidence of how the perception of public
attitudes toward homosexuals has evolved.

 BUSINESS AND LABOR STRUGGLE WITH GLOBALIZATION  
(The Week in Review) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 54-day General Motors strike erupted over local issues, like
the automaker's push to speed up work at a plant in Flint, Mich.,
but the strike shared a theme with walkouts as far away as Denmark
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these strikes and others is labor's push to resist
what many economists say is an irresistible force: globalization,
which opens markets to fierce competition. Globalization has pushed
GM and other companies to reduce costs, and has created downward
pressures on wages in wealthy countries. It has pushed companies to
downsize, transfer jobs overseas and press their workers to produce
more.
</P>
<P>
   It was GM's effort to take many of these steps _ to speed up
production and to transfer work to low-wage Mexican factories _
that precipitated the strike, which was settled last Tuesday after
paralyzing production and idling 190,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say they are trying to slow _ and possibly even
tame _ globalization, to make it less hostile to workers, and
limit, for example, the exportation of jobs. But many economists
say unions can neither slow nor stop globalization, a trend in
which the economies of the world are growing ever closer and
competition keener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're fighting history,'' said Clyde Prestowitz,
president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based
research group. ``It's partly a doomed effort to preserve an old
way of life that's not preservable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the GM strike and other anti-globalization actions may
backfire by provoking companies to accelerate plans to export jobs
so they can minimize their dealings with truculent unions.
</P>
<P>
   The GM strike can backfire in other ways. With the dealers
complaining that their lots are depleted, sales of GM cars are
expected to fall, and the consequent loss in market share will
pressure the automaker to close more plants and lay off more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts predict that GM, frustrated by the
union's resistance to cost-cutting measures at individual plants,
will simply close several plants altogether to slash costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said unions were often short-sighted in fighting efforts,
like GM's, to cut costs in the face of global competition.
``General Motors management has to do what it's doing, as painful
as it is, and bite the bullet now,'' Josten said. ``If they don't
do that now, GM's market share will diminish. It will become
increasingly less competitive and ultimately there will be fewer GM
employees due to layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor unions are stepping up their battle against
globalization. In California, the nation's largest apparel union
has protested Guess' decision to move jeans production to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, workers staged a rash of strikes, angry that
foreign pressure to open markets and to stop subsidizing industry
is undermining their job security. In Denmark two months ago,
500,000 workers struck after employers resisted demands for six
weeks of vacation, saying they could not afford it because of
foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders acknowledge it is impossible to halt
globalization, saying their goal is to transform it into a less
harmful force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade unions are trying to shape history, not reverse it,''
said David Smith, director of public policy for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to put the globalization genie back in the
battle,'' Smith said. ``Whether it's workers in Flint or workers in
Seoul, people are wrestling with the question of, `How are we in
this moment of epochal change going to make this work for working
people?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The unions argue that corporations gain too many of the benefits
of untamed globalization, fattening profits while squeezing wages
and encouraging downsizing. And they say they are fighting for all
workers, not just for union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will show you that wherever there have been strong
trade unions, there has been a fairer distribution of the wealth
created,'' said Bill Jordan, general secretary of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions, a coalition of unions from 141
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say globalization is boosting not just
corporations but the world at large by helping hold down prices, by
pressuring industry to increase efficiency and by making more
inexpensive products available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And, economists point out, globalization sometimes helps push
wages up, not down. Boeing and Microsoft, for example, can pay high
salaries partly because of the immense foreign demand for their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concerned that globalization could prove the great
downward leveler of wages, union leaders often state that their
goal is ``upward leveling'' _ to improve wages and working
conditions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when American unions pressured Congress to shelve
legislation to extend free trade to other nations, labor was often
branded as protectionist.
</P>
<P>
   But unions defended themselves, saying they would go along with
the legislation as long as new trade agreements guaranteed labor
and environmental rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you raise labor standards in low-wage countries, that's
good for them and it's good for us,'' said Frank Borgers, a
professor of labor relations at the University of Massachusetts.
``It would slow the exodus of jobs.''

 TRYING TO CHANGE CHINA'S SYSTEM IN ORDER TO SAVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, Auguslt(The Week in Review) 
(mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ever since the Communist Party took charge here in
1949, China's leaders have thrived on an unending cycle of
political campaigns. With quaint-sounding names like Let a Hundred
Flowers Bloom or the Cultural Revolution, campaigns were supposed
to sound noble. The realities were often horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all was the Great Leap Forward, Mao Tse-tung's cockeyed
scheme of mass industrialization that destroyed the economy and
caused a famine that killed 30 million people around 1960. Yet even
in lesser campaigns, the same pattern was repeated: In public,
innocent victims were persecuted in the name of a bogus ideal; in
private, it was actually crass political jockeying that inspired
and directed a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that legacy, political campaigns continue in China
today. As in the past, they sound noble, but are purely political.
Most ordinary people are now wise enough to ignore them. But the
party itself is still clinging to its antiquated ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Jiang Zemin unveiled China's latest
campaign. It targets smuggling, which reached epidemic proportions
in China years ago and is a trade dominated by the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   True, in this case the target is hardly innocent, but as in
other campaigns, larger goals are being pursued. Jiang wants the
nation's military forces to relinquish their vast business
operations and, more important, he wants to reassert the authority
of the central government.
</P>
<P>
   That authority is being eroded by a variety of factors,
including the freer flow of information and insidious corruption.
Perhaps the biggest question facing China today is whether the
Communist Party is becoming vulnerable to an unexpected political
jolt strong enough to topple it. No one can predict such surprises
or their results _ like the failed Soviet coup in 1991 that yielded
the unintended consequence of propelling Boris Yeltsin to power _
but people can smell vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   They smell it today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of time,'' said a magazine editor in
Beijing, reflecting a popular sentiment. ``No one believes in
communism anymore, so how can there be any justification for a
Communist Party ?''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing utter dissatisfaction among wide sections of the
populace, and facing the potentially explosive danger of wide
unemployment as inefficient state-owned industries are overhauled,
Jiang is starting to tinker around the edges _ trying to change his
system to save it.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, newspapers and television programs were given mild
encouragement to report on egregious corruption cases. A handful of
university professors and scholars at research institutes have
started talking openly about the need for political reform.
Magazines with juicy stories of political intrigue, although highly
unreliable, are selling more openly on Beijing streets.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a small step toward greater openness when
President Clinton visited in June and, during a live national
broadcast, was shown publicly disagreeing with Jiang on sensitive
topics like the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to take advantage of the marginally more tolerant mood,
some political dissidents have emerged in the past month to try to
announce the formation of a fringe party, still expressly
forbidden. Several have been detained and then released in a
merry-go-round of a legal procedure that reflects a minor softening
in Beijing's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   All these modest changes come at a time when the government,
with a new pro-reform prime minister, Zhu Rongji, is trying to
reduce the size of central ministries and undertake a vast reform
of China's outdated banking and housing systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jiang seems to be betting that a minuscule amount of opening
will help assuage the innumerable complaints that gurgle near the
surface all the time throughout China. It is a wager with sizable
risks, looming even larger if China's economy stalls.
</P>
<P>
   For there is a distinct possibility that steps toward openness
and accountability will only create even greater pressure on the
floodgates of popular discontent. As with Mikhail Gorbachev's
attempts to save the Soviet system by reforming it, letting in a
little sunlight can expose a void where political legitimacy should
be.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the military equation. Judging that the time is right for
change in China's political and economic culture, Jiang has ordered
the military to relinquish its business operations.
</P>
<P>
   The order was treated with incredulity at first, so deeply
entrenched is money-making in the contemporary culture of the
People's Liberation Army. Yet Jiang appeared to be serious, as
China's media went into full blitz to make the point that he was,
with army generals and senior officials emerging one after another
to say they were earnestly addressing the task of fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, the worst-kept secret in China was that the
army operated an enormous smuggling racket. It was a stunning
political milestone for Jiang to say publicly (addressing a meeting
of top military officers no less) that China's military was deeply
involved in illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than question the root of the problem _ an
authoritarian system that leaves the military unaccountable _ or
even reconsider the high import duties that make smuggling cellular
telephones, cigarettes and diesel oil so profitable, China's
leadership instead declared a campaign against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   An expert political tactician, Jiang is unlikely to have
launched the anti-smuggling campaign, or to have ordered the
military out of business, without confidence that senior military
officers are on his side.

<P>
   In fact, the main threat to the success of his campaign appears
to be not an outright rebellion by money-making officers but a
miasma of obfuscation and hidden transfers of ownership.
</P>

   Wei Jianxing, a senior official in charge of anti-corruption
efforts, alluded to that peril at a recent public meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army, armed police and law enforcement departments are
prohibited from hiding, relocating, transferring or selling
properties belonging to enterprises they run, or from distributing
funds and property belonging to firms held privately under any
name, from making false financial reports or rewriting, hiding or
destroying financial documents,'' Wei said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the larger issue is whether taking on the military _ until
now off limits to public criticism _ will provoke a deeper
examination of failings by the ruling authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army has always been sacred,'' said a retired Communist
Party official who is sharply critical of the current group of
leaders. ``It seems a very bold move to take on the army, no matter
how corrupt it has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what is the next step?''

 POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CLINTON SCANDALS  
(The Week in Review) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No less an authority on Watergate than Richard
Nixon proclaimed President Clinton's Whitewater affair graver than
the scandal that ended Nixon's presidency and ruined his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it?'' Nixon said to Monica Crowley, the young
researcher who chronicled his thoughts in the final years of his
life. ``They said it's nothing like Watergate. I say it's worse. In
Watergate, we didn't have profiteering, and we didn't have a
body.'' He was referring to the 1993 suicide of Vincent Foster,
Clinton's close friend and deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's comment came in April 1994, nine days before his death _
and four years before the appearance of the telltale dress, the
talking points and the Tripp tapes.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last week, the Whitewater scandal of which Nixon
spoke had completed its transformation from a musty investigation
of an Ozarks land deal into a 24-hour national soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky agreed to tell prosecutors about her
relationship with the president, and to give an account of a
December meeting in which the two agreed to deny a sexual
relationship. And Clinton agreed, after months of resistance, to
testify on videotape in a criminal inquiry, making him the first
sitting president to appear before a grand jury investigating his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Nixon's assessment, which seemed so quirkily
self-serving in the context of Arkansas real estate, is
Washington's conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist George Will declared Clinton's behavior ``more
menacing to the civic culture'' than Watergate because Clinton had
enlisted the public as co-conspirators by repeatedly asking them to
believe the unbelievable. Corruption of the public, Will said, is
worse than abuse of governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The author William Bennett _ brother of the president's lawyer,
Robert Bennett _ said Clinton's scandals were ``worse than
Watergate'' because they belittled the presidency and rendered the
public insensate to immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Will and Bennett are both longtime conservative critics of
Clinton, so perhaps their comments are predictable. But
commentators from all parts of the political and ideological
spectrum are predicting that the Lewinsky matter will have lasting
consequences as Watergate did, not only for this president but for
the presidency and for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it will, though it's worth stopping for a minute to
note that nobody has a clue yet what even the short-term
consequences for Clinton will be.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way to compare Watergate and Whitewater.
While the former did have large and lasting effects, it is easy to
imagine that the latter will not.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate, the benchmark scandal for this generation, did more
than bring down a president. It brought to Washington a
congressional class of young, reform-minded Democrats who delayed
Republican ascendancy for 20 years. It deepened the Vietnam-era
public distrust of government. And it spawned legislation meant to
curb the influence on money on politics and created the office of
the independent counsel now occupied by Kenneth Starr, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars and political observers say Clinton's troubles _
however they are resolved _ will not have profound effects like
Watergate, which diminished the power and moral authority of the
presidency and changed the way Americans viewed their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the effects commentators have predicted for
the Clinton scandals, and some of the counter-arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Crippled Presidency Theory
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited a presidency that had been downsized by
Watergate and the end of the Cold War. He further diminished the
office with a deliberate attempt to lower the public's expectations
of what its occupant could accomplish. Two years ago he declared
the end of the era of big government and embarked upon a program of
bite-sized policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter contributed to the diminution of the
presidency, as Jay Leno and David Letterman supplanted political
scientists as the public interpreters of the nation's highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   But quite apart from the current investigative frenzy, Clinton
has given little indication that he intends to try to accomplish
big things in his remaining 29 months in office. With a hostile and
divided Congress and a complacent public, his space for political
maneuver would be limited, even if he commanded broad public
respect. While nearly 70 percent of the public approves of the job
he is doing, 56 percent don't like or trust him as a person,
according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be ups and downs in the prestige of the
presidency,'' said Alonzo Hamby, a presidential scholar at Ohio
University. ``Some presidents will bring more authority and credit
to the office than others. It's sort of a shame in this case. We
started out with this obviously intelligent, engaging, interesting
younger president and now we've come to be talking about how good
he is at ceremonial occasions and projecting empathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Not-So-Splendid Isolation Theory
</P>
<P>
   White House aides and sympathetic legal authorities say
Whitewater could inflict lasting damage to the presidency by
increasing the isolation of the office. Courts have ruled
decisively against Clinton's claims of privilege for conversations
with political advisers and in-house lawyers. An effort to shield
Secret Service agents from grand jury testimony in the Lewinsky
matter was also slapped down.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled last week that Bruce Lindsey,
deputy White House counsel and Clinton's closest confidant, could
not invoke lawyer-client privilege to avoid testifying before the
Lewinsky grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Tatel, in dissent, predicted dire consequences of
the ruling, saying the unique demands of the presidency require
freewheeling advice from aides and government lawyers. The
majority, however, decided that future presidents have no need to
worry about a breach of confidentiality unless they are plotting
potentially illegal acts subject to legitimate investigation.

</P>
<P>
   The Political Fallout Theory
</P>
<P>
   Democrats naturally worry that Clinton's problems could rub off
on them, not only in congressional elections this year but in the
presidential race in 2000. But Clinton's fortunes and those of his
party have often failed to coincide. And it is telling that many
Republicans see more political problems for them if Clinton leaves
office prematurely than if he survives. If he quits, Vice President
Al Gore becomes an incumbent candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Silbey, professor of political science at Cornell
University, said that even assuming the worst outcome for Clinton _
resignation or impeachment, both of which he considers highly
unlikely _ there would be little political impact. Gore would move
into the White House and presumably continue the policies that he
and Clinton have pursued for the past five-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a personal tragedy for Clinton, and one more
terrible bump in the blows we've been taking as a political system,
but it doesn't have the staying power that Watergate did,'' Silbey
said. ``People would shrug their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Changed Public Discourse Theory
</P>
<P>
   One effect of Whitewater that may take a long time to dissipate
is the lifting of taboos on discussions that not long ago were
considered unfit for public discourse. In 1987 Gary Hart opened
politicians to questions about extramarital sexual affairs. Clinton
survived weeks of questions during the 1992 campaign about his
relationship with Gennifer Flowers. He finally quieted them with a
qualified confessional on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone contemplating a run for public office must weigh the
prospect that his or her morality will be debated on cable
television by sex therapists, jury consultants and dime-store
philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching some of these press briefings over the past weeks,
you get the idea that nothing is sacred after all,'' Silbey said.
``That's the longest-lasting impact of all. Nothing is out of the
arena of discussion, and maybe some things should be.''

   Justice Thomas Criticizes His Many Critics
</P>
<P>
   Although his delivery was measured and unemotional, Justice
Clarence Thomas made an extraordinary speech to a large gathering
of black lawyers and judges, a group that included many of his
critics. Until now, Thomas had spoken only before groups carefully
selected to insure their friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   But appearing before a convention of the National Bar
Association, the nation's largest group of black lawyers, he issued
an appeal for understanding. At the same time he harshly criticized
his opponents, saying they are racists because they do not accept
that he has come by his conservative philosophy on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I am an
intellectual slave because I am black,'' he said, adding that those
who suggest he takes his ideas from the white conservative justices
demean him. ``The stench of racial inferiority still confounds my
olfactory nerves,'' Thomas said.

   Land Is on the Ballot
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in one of the nation's most ambitious efforts to
preserve vanishing farmland and woodlands, the New Jersey
Legislature passed a ballot measure that would ask voters in
November to approve borrowing $1 billion to protect half of the
state's remaining 2 million acres of undeveloped land over the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After years of unchecked development, done largely to expand
local tax bases, local officials are finding that such growth is
increasing taxes and causing overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' vote is a major political triumph for Gov.
Christie Whitman, who made preserving 1 million acres of open space
the top priority of her second term.
</P>
<P>
   Slain Officers Eulogized
</P>
<P>
   Official Washington and more ordinary folks filed silently
through the Capitol rotunda around the flag-draped coffins of
Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson. President Clinton
said that the two men had ``consecrated this house of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The two officers, who later were buried in separate ceremonies
at Arlington National Cemetery, were killed by a gunman on July 24.
Russell Eugene Weston Jr., 41, who was charged in the attacks, was
recuperating from wounds in a Washington hospital.

   Neglect at Nursing Homes
</P>
<P>
   For residents of America's 17,000 nursing homes, conditions have
improved since 1987, when Congress set stringent federal standards.
But in two days of hearings, the Senate Special Committee on Aging
heard that the abuse and neglect of patients continue at many
nursing homes. The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, delivered a harsh judgment on homes in California,
nearly one-third of which have been cited for violations that could
cause death or life-threatening harm. Other witnesses said they
believed that similar problems existed elsewhere.

   A Disputed Election
</P>
<P>
   Cambodians voted with obvious enthusiasm last Sunday, embracing
the chance to choose their new government after years of coups and
bullying by their leaders. International observers pronounced the
election a success, and Stephen Solarz, heading an unofficial
American delegation to monitor the vote, sounded like Muhammad Ali
when he declared that he had witnessed ``the miracle on the
Mekong.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions immediately arose about intimidation and possible
fraud that cast a shadow over the vote. The incumbent leader, Hun
Sen, appeared to have won, but his rivals, Norodom Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy, protested the outcome.

   Sierra Leone got back its most wanted criminal. Foday Sankoh,
who led a brutal movement called the Revolutionary United Front,
which has made the country all but ungovernable for nearly a
decade, was sent back to Freetown by Nigeria, which arrested him
last year when he arrived on an arms-buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian peacekeeping troops had been trying to undo his damage
in Sierra Leone, where Sankoh took part in the overthrow of the
elected president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in May 1997, and where his
followers have been engaged in savage attacks on civilians in the
last six months, human rights groups say. The RUF has been killing
and mutilating men, women and children, deliberately making them
grisly examples of the rebels' lingering power.

crimes against humanity.

   Russia in Afghanistan, Again
</P>
<P>
   It would be as if the U.S. Army had decided to get involved once
more in Vietnam. Moscow, which saw its dreams of a Soviet empire
shattered in Afghanistan, is once again enmeshed in that country's
bloody guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and elsewhere say that both Russia and
Iran are now providing weapons, training and logistical support to
the Afghan rebel groups fighting the fundamentalist Taliban, which
now controls most of the country.

   Restricting Fraternization
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is ordering the Army to restrict its policies
governing dating, sexual intimacy and other close relationships
between officers and enlisted soldiers. The change makes the Army's
fraternization policy consistent with those already in effect in
the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Those services bar most
personal relationships between officers and soldiers, to preserve
discipline in the ranks.

   Call Back, They're Busy
</P>

   The scramble for scale in the telecommunications industry
continued as phone companies tried to avoid getting left behind by
the industry's globalization. Bell Atlantic, the nation's biggest
local phone company, agreed on Tuesday to acquire GTE for $52.9
billion. Two days earlier, AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 long-distance carrier,
had unveiled a $10 billion joint venture with British
Telecommunications, Britain's largest phone company.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look forward to using the same phone number on both
sides of the Atlantic. The AT&AMP;T-British Telecom venture will serve
multinational corporations, not consumers.

   Voluntary Affirmative Action
</P>
<P>
   These days backers of affirmative action have had to find
creative ways to keep the policy going. Such is the case for the
Federal Communications Commission. In April a federal appeals court
struck down its requirement that broadcasters conduct special
efforts to hire minorities. Last week, the FCC chairman, William
Kennard, announced that several of the nation's largest networks,
radio groups and cable companies had agreed to maintain affirmative
action programs on a voluntary basis.

   Mike Tyson snapped again. Near the end of a three-and-a-half
hour public hearing before members of the New Jersey State Athletic
Control Board, Tyson lost his cool and uttered an expletive as his
lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., made an impassioned plea for the panel
to give the former world heavyweight boxing champion a boxing
license.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Tyson publicly blew his lid, he bit Evander
Holyfield's right ear in the third round of a championship bout on
June 28, 1997, and Nevada revoked his boxing license. The New
Jersey board will review Tyson's application Thursday and decide by
week's end.

ANGELA BASSETT GETS IN THE GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or
by fax at 816-822-1444.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 &HT;     Includes a color slide of Angela Bassett in a scene from ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``It's always the fear that holds you back,'' Angela Bassett
says.
 &HT;    In one sense, she's talking about Stella, her character in the
upcoming film ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' which opens Aug.
12. Stella is a business executive so caught up in her life that
she hardly has one _ until a quick-fix trip to Jamaica and a
romance with a younger man bring her a new perspective on life.
 &HT;    In another sense, though, Bassett is talking about herself,
because she knows all about being Stella.
 &HT;    ``I always had the `Good Girl Syndrome,''' she says. ``I'm a
good daughter, a good worker, a good sister, a good person. I'm all
about serious stuff. It can be exhausting.''
 &HT;    The man who helped her find her own way back was the actor
Courtney B. Vance, who recently starred in ``The Preacher's Wife''
(1996). Bassett had known him for years without ever contemplating
romantic involvement.
 &HT;    Her sense of him changed when, at a community playhouse, she
overhead him talking to a mutual friend who, suffering from
cerebral palsy, was facing the loss of her beloved dogs because she
could no longer walk them.
 &HT;    ```What if I came over every morning at 7 a.m. and walked them
for you?''' Vance asked.
 &HT;    ``At that moment, I fell in love,'' Bassett says, smiling.
 &HT;    She and Vance married last year.
 &HT;    ``I finally sat myself down and said, `You know what, Angela?
It's OK to let loose. It's OK to fall in love, because this life is
going to be rough any way you look at it,''' the actress recalls.
``At that moment, I found my groove.''
 &HT;    Right now, things are groovy indeed as Bassett enjoys a late
lunch at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. Dressed in a sky-blue,
beaded sun dress, her arm muscles rippling, she sways to a breeze
that offers some relief from the heat.
 &HT;    Speaking of heat, ``Stella'' is already being proclaimed one of
the year's most erotic films. But don't look for Bassett to do her
first nude scene _ she remains adamantly opposed to the idea.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to prove with this movie that you can be a lady and
still be sexy,'' Bassett says. ``I know people are looking for a
little titillation, whether it's violence or sexuality or whatever.
But I feel that nudity is gratuitous. I want no part of it.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Taye Diggs, who plays Stella's Jamaican hunk,
does appear in the altogether in a romantic shower scene with a
clothed Bassett.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, I said, `It will be OK to take all your clothes off,
baby,''' the actress says, laughing. ``The poor guy had to wear a
sock over his private parts, and that was attached by an invisible
wire.
 &HT;    ``Unlike a woman, this man had no fat, so you could see the
wires burrowing into his skin,'' she adds. ``I felt real bad for
him, but in the back of my mind, I kept thinking, `Thank God it
isn't me.'''
 &HT;    Vance might have been thinking the same. The two married two
weeks into filming, and Bassett spent most of her early married
life making out with another man.
 &HT;    ``It was tough,'' Bassett admits. ``I was like, `Hi, how are you
today, honey? Oh, it was fine. Nothing went on today.'''
 &HT;    Jokes aside, Bassett says that what drew her to Stella was the
character's vulnerability.
 &HT;    ``You've seen me do my tough act,'' says Bassett, who battled an
abusive husband in ``What's Love Got to Do With It'' (1993), burned
her husband's car in ``Waiting to Exhale'' (1996) and harangued
Congress in ``Contact'' (1997). ``I wanted to show that I could
also be soft and loving onscreen.''
 &HT;    The older woman/younger man dynamic also resonated for Bassett.
 &HT;    ``At one point, my mother had a boyfriend who was pretty
young,'' she recalls. ``I remember being taken aback.
 &HT;    ``I was away at college and I came home on break, and this young
guy was at my home, just hanging out,'' she says. ``To what extent
it went, I don't know _ I don't need to know.
 &HT;    ``I was just like, `This is too weird for me. I'm going back to
school.'''
 &HT;    Bassett usually doesn't talk about her past in interviews, but
today she seems to be in the mood.
 &HT;    ``You don't want to talk about it when you grew up in the
projects,'' she says quietly. ``I grew up in a place where people
were selling drugs down the hall. My childhood was filled with
wondering if our apartment would be broken into when I got home.''
 &HT;    She was born in New York, but when she was 8 her parents split
up.
 &HT;    ``I remember the judge told my mother, `Take your children back
home to Florida, where you come from, or they're going into foster
care,''' she says.
 &HT;    Bassett, her sister and her mother wound up in the projects of
St. Petersburg. Even then, she says, she felt driven to perform.
 &HT;   ``As a kid, I would turn up the record player and scream, `Mom,
this is my favorite song,''' she recalls. ``Then I would do the
entire Temptations act. I would be all of the Jackson Five. I'd get
up and grab a brush and act it out until it was my sister's turn.''
 &HT;    The real turning point came when she was 15, however, on a visit
to Washington, when she and some friends went to see a performance
of ``Of Mice and Men,'' starring James Earl Jones.
 &HT;    ``I was crying my head off at the end,'' Bassett says. ``At that
moment, I knew if I could only make people feel like this, I would
be happy for the rest of my life.''
 &HT;    Bassett won a scholarship to Yale University. After earning
bachelor's and master's degrees, she headed for New York. She
admits to having had her doubts, however.
 &HT;    ``At the time,'' she recalls, ``if you saw a black woman in the
movies she was a prostitute, the maid or the neighbor, or some
other image I didn't like.''
 &HT;    Instead, she gravitated toward theater, and won parts in two hit
plays by August Wilson, ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' (1984) and
``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' (1986).
 &HT;    She was on her way. Hollywood cast her as strong women in ``Boyz
N the Hood'' (1991), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``What's Love Got to
Do With It.''
 &HT;    As her career ripened _ her ``What's Love Got to Do With It''
role as Tina Turner earned her an Oscar nomination _ her life
outside work was neglected, she admits, not unlike Stella's.
 &HT;    ``I didn't trust marriage,'' Bassett says. ``I would pray that I
wouldn't be fooled by a man. I can be quite gullible.''
 &HT;    Even when she started dating Vance, an old friend, she was still
ambivalent about it.
 &HT;    ``When we went out for the first time three years ago on a real
date,'' she recalls, ``I kept thinking, `I know him. God, I hope he
doesn't like me, because it would be too weird.'''
 &HT;    She got over it. When he proposed one day last year on the
streets of New York, Bassett said yes. She hasn't regretted it yet.
 &HT;    ``I love that my husband wants to make sure I am comfortable and
taken care of every second of the day,'' she says.
 &HT;    Looking at her own life, personally and professionally alike,
Bassett can't resist thinking that she's found her own groove.
 &HT;    ``It blows my mind to think about how far I've come,'' the
actress admits. ``I look around and see the people who inspired me,
and I want to yell, `Look at me now!'''

 Includes a color slide of Drew Carey with Kathy Kinney in a scene
from ``The Drew Carey Show.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember those hazy, crazy days when networks used the summer
months to try out new shows?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, most of those series were forgettable filler, but there
were also some gems, including ``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour,''
``Melrose Place'' and ``Northern Exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition has now been resurrected with ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway?,'' which premiered Aug. 5 on ABC for a six-week run.
</P>
<P>
   The offbeat game show is actually a remake of a long-running
British series. The new version is hosted by the brushcut star of
``The Drew Carey Show,'' who also thinks the whole concept of
summer shows deserves a second look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I used to love watching new series in the summer,'' Carey
says wistfully. ``I never understood why the networks stopped doing
that. One of my all-time favorite shows as a kid was `The Ken Berry
Wow Show,' which was a summer-replacement series. I still remember
jokes from that show.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the way TV is so competitive right now, you really should
have original programming all year round,'' he adds. ``Hey, you
might as well try something new out in the summer. What have you
got to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, ABC has plenty to gain with ``Whose Line.''
They've slotted it in a promising niche _ right after reruns of
``The Drew Carey Show'' on Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of me following me,'' Carey says, laughing.
``Hey, if I can't hold my own audience, I'm in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is a remake of the British version _ currently running
daily on the Comedy Network _ and has an undeniably distinctive
setup: Four comics perform unrehearsed skits and improvisational
scenes, based on suggestions from a studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   As host, Carey sets the scene for each skit and oversees the
proceedings. The entertainment value comes from each comic's
ability or inability to think quickly on his/her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, when it comes to actual laughs per minute, I don't
think I've ever seen a funnier show,'' says Carey, who is
admittedly biased, since he's also an executive producer. ``The
humor is just, like, bang-bang-bang! It just keeps coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey's inspiration to adapt ``Whose Line'' for an American
audience clicked several months back, when he and his ``Drew Carey
Show'' castmates began trying some onstage improvisational scenes
at the Melrose Improv in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt right,'' says Carey, who had already become a fan
of the British show through the Comedy Central reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helped matters that Ryan Stiles, who plays the
doofus Lewis on ``Drew Carey,'' had been a regular on the British
``Whose Line'' since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about redoing it here, and it just seemed like a
great idea,'' Stiles says. ``Obviously, it was also great having
Drew involved, because it meant we would have a lot more viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting the television deal together, Carey and Stiles _
by this stage also an executive producer _ hooked up with Canadian
comic Colin Mochrie, Greg Proops and Brad Sherwood, all veterans of
the British version, and newcomer Wayne Brady to tape six shows at
the end of June. Studio-audience tickets were offered through Los
Angeles radio stations, and the response was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last week's taping, we had 700 ticket requests for 300
seats,'' Carey says. ``That's for a TV taping! Usually you have to
beg people to come to a new-show taping.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey doesn't make any great claims for his role on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the easiest job of all,'' he says. ``I do an improv
scene at the end, but mostly I just get to sit there and laugh my
head off.''
</P>
<P>
   The more difficult work falls to the comics, who have a split
second to make a random concept into something hilarious. After
almost a decade of annual treks to London to tape the British
``Whose Line,'' Stiles and Mochrie are the unofficial in-house
experts, and both notice differences between the two versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improv stuff was the same, but the audiences were really
great here,'' Stiles says. ``They really got into it and were way
more responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mochrie agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British audiences were far more laid-back and polite,'' he
says. ``They were really whooping it up at the L.A. tapings, which
is great for the performers. Also, there isn't any censorship in
the British version, but in the U.S., we were told we couldn't use
certain words, like `erection.' And, of course, Drew is a totally
different host.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. On the original British series, which recently
completed its 10th season, host Clive Anderson is a totally
refined, thoroughly composed Englishman. On the new show, Carey is,
well, Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of times,'' Mochrie recalls, ``when I
actually heard spit takes coming from the side of the stage, and I
would look over and I could see Drew was wiping water off his chin.
He was just killing himself at all the tapings. Believe me, Drew
and Clive have a completely different method of hosting this
show.''
</P>
<P>
   That Carey should be convulsed isn't too surprising: The entire
improvisational scene is virgin territory to him. He spent more
than a decade doing rapid-fire stand-up in clubs and on HBO
specials before landing his own hit sitcom, but never ventured into
improv.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole improv thing is a totally new world for me, but I
really love it,'' he says. ``It's harder than stand-up _ you have
to pay a lot more attention. But both Ryan and Colin told me that
they can't possibly imagine what it would be like to do straight
stand-up. So it depends on what you're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Improv comedy is, indeed, an acquired art. The Toronto-based
Mochrie is a veteran of the Second City Stage Company and
innumerable television commercials, and says that it's particularly
difficult to transport his improv skills to television.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a club, you can take more time with the scenes,'' he says,
``but on a television show, it's faster, so it can sometimes become
a one-liner type of comedy. Basically, it's like a strange marriage
of stand-up and improv.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's like a theater atmosphere,'' Styles adds,
``because we're really playing to the people sitting there in the
studio, not the home viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Carey fans, the big attraction to ``Whose Line'' may be
getting an hour-long dose of their favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Drew he should get a correspondent job on `20/20,' so
that way he could be on two hours in a row,'' Stiles jokes. ``I
think Drew would do a really good job on their more twisted
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't expect to see Carey sitting beside Hugh Downs and
Barbara Walters anytime soon. However, the big fella is hoping that
``Whose Line'' will catch on for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, the best thing that could possibly happen would be
for this show to do well in the summer and get picked up for the
regular season,'' Carey says. ``If that happens, we'd do a show
every Saturday. I'd just have to show up three hours for the taping
_ no problem. I'd love every minute of it.''
</P>

 Includes a color slide of Vince Vaughn with Anne Heche in a scene
from ``Return to Paradise.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Everyone on the planet thinks Vince Vaughn is a huge star in the
making _ everyone, that is, but Vaughn himself.
 &HT;    The tall and winsome lead in the hip indie film ``Swingers''
(1996), Vaughn went mainstream as a dino-meal deluxe in Steven
Spielberg's ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (1997).
 &HT;    Dodging dinosaurs was a switch for the 25-year-old Vaughn, who
was born in Minneapolis and raised in the well-heeled suburbs of
Chicago. He first made it onscreen in a ``Heartbeat of America''
television commercial for Chevrolet, soon followed by television
appearances on ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' and ``21 Jump Street,'' and
then brief turns in the films ``For the Boys'' (1991) and ``Rudy''
(1993).
 &HT;    Then came ``Swingers,'' and all of a sudden Vaughn was a hot
commodity.
 &HT;    ``I don't pay much mind to the hype,'' he says. ``I get
recognized, but I have the same friends I've always had and,
really, I haven't been in big films like a lot of these other guys
you're hearing about.
 &HT;    ``I never got into acting to get this or that one day, or so I
could go back to my hometown and have a parade thrown for me,''
Vaughn adds. ``My thing has always been that I love to act for the
fun and the love of it.''
 &HT;    If that's the case, his current schedule qualifies as a love
feast. He has three films coming up and more in progress. In fact,
he's promoting his current ``Return to Paradise'' by telephone, on
a break from shooting the controversial remake of ``Psycho.''
 &HT;    ``Return to Paradise,'' a crisis-of-conscience drama starring
Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix and David Conrad, is due to hit theaters on
Aug. 14.
 &HT;    The three actors portray Americans in Malaysia, who part ways as
pals after a month of partying and debauchery. Two years later,
desperate lawyer Anne Heche delivers stunning news to Vaughn and
Conrad: Phoenix has been imprisoned on drug charges for the past
two years, and will hang in eight days if the two don't agree to
jet to Malaysia, admit culpability and do hard time.
 &HT;    It's a hard-hitting drama, and despite its picturesque locales _
the cast and crew visited such diverse ports of call as Manhattan,
Philadelphia, Macao, Thailand and Hong Kong _ Vaughn says that it
was a difficult shoot. Jet lag, language barriers, homesickness and
jampacked scheduling all took their toll.
 &HT;    ``I'd never been to the Far East before and it was my third film
in a row, so I spent most of last year in hotel rooms,'' the actor
says. ``You get on a plane for a period of time, come down and your
whole environment has changed. You just don't have a balance. We
shot six-day weeks.
 &HT;    ``By the end of it I was really tired,'' he says. ``And I didn't
even have a chance to relax and see any of the places I was in.''
 &HT;    Vaughn did, however, find time to bond with Phoenix and Heche _
which is good, because he'll be working with both again, in the
upcoming ``Clay Pigeons'' and in ``Psycho,'' respectively.
 &HT;    It seems like a repertory company in the making, but Vaughn
swears it's just coincidence.
 &HT;    ``How about that!'' Vaughn says. ``I like both of them. Joaquin
is a really great actor, really giving, very genuine and he's
touched me in a way.
 &HT;    ``Anne is a brilliant actress, one of the best,'' he adds.
``She's a chameleon, and can take on a comedy or a drama or
whatever and just be excellent in it.
 &HT;    ``They both cared so much about `Paradise,''' he concludes,
``but didn't have to run around in dark moods, because they trusted
themselves to get to the place they needed to be.''
 &HT;    ``Clay Pigeons,'' due later this year, casts the actor as nutso
drifter Lester Long, who makes life hell for Montana gas-station
attendant Clay Bidwell (Phoenix). Georgina Cates, Scott Wilson and
Janeane Garofalo co-star in the October release, which Vaughn
describes as ``an indie punk-rock film, a dark comedy.''
 &HT;    After ``Pigeons'' comes ``A Cool, Dry Place,'' with Vaughn as a
young father raising a kid and trying to kick-start his life again.
Joey Lauren Adams, late of ``Chasing Amy,'' plays his girlfriend,
while Monica Potter is the ex-wife who re-enters the picture.
 &HT;    Then there's ``Psycho.'' The need for it has been questioned _
the original is one of Hollywood's all-time favorites _ but the new
version, though set in the 1990s and shot in color, adheres almost
word-for-word to Joseph Stefano's script for Alfred Hitchcock's
1960 classic.
 &HT;    Directed by Gus Van Sant, the remake hands Anthony Perkins' wig,
knife and mother complex to Vaughn. Janet Leigh's legendary shower
sequence goes to Heche, while Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and
Viggo Mortensen take on the roles originally assayed by Vera Miles,
Martin Balsam and John Gavin, respectively.
 &HT;    ``I'm showing up on the set, at the motel and I'm saying these
lines,'' says an obviously stoked Vaughn, who watched ``Psycho'' as
a teen and was as freaked by it as anybody. ``It's like an
out-of-body experience.
 &HT;    ``Truthfully, I was scared at first,'' he admits. ``I thought,
`Should I play this role?' because I thought people would compare
me to Perkins and ask why we're remaking `Psycho.'''
 &HT;    And indeed all that came to pass. Still, Vaughn says, he doesn't
regret his decision.
 &HT;    ``For me, it's a challenge,'' the actor says. ``It's an
interesting character. Van Sant is a really interesting director.
It's got great actors.
 &HT;    ``To let perceptions, or the fear of perceptions, stop me from
doing it would have been a mistake, would have been wrong,'' he
says. ```Psycho's' going great, and I hope it turns out great, but
regardless, I feel good about my reasons for wanting to be involved
in it.''
 &HT;    Actually, Vaughn feels good about most things these days. And
why not? He's working steadily, he isn't trapped in paint-by-number
would-be blockbusters and he has the chance to display his range by
breathing life into a gallery of swingers, serial killers and dads
in comedies and dramas alike.
 &HT;    ``I know how lucky I am,'' he says. ``Out here, entertainment is
the No. 1 industry. It's constantly around you _ billboards, trade
magazines, this and that.
 &HT;    ``It can be real hard if you're not lucky enough to crack
(Hollywood) in some way, as an actor, agent, whatever,'' Vaughn
says. ``I'm getting to do the roles and films I want to do now, but
I remember what it was like to be at home, not have an agent, not
have people returning your phone calls, to walk around the block at
3 in the morning putting together some kind of game plan.
 &HT;    ``To do what I'm doing now just feels great.''

 Includes a color slide of James Avery in a scene from ``Going
Places.'' 
 By JAN BENZEL  
 c.1998 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adventurous armchair travelers have always had plenty of
vicarious options, from the books of Lawrence Durrell and Margaret
Mead to television shows from National Geographic and Charles
Kuralt, not to mention the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those who don't have the vacation time _ or even
the inclination _ to canoe down the Zambezi alone or feast on yak
butter in Nepal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Going Places,'' a public-television series now in its second
season _ airing Mondays on PBS at 8 p.m. (EDT) _ aims to appeal to
the ordinary traveler whose idea of a good time is a little
history, a lot of scenery, some local culture, a tasty meal and a
comfortable bed.
</P>
<P>
   James Avery, probably best known for his role as a judge on the
NBC series ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air'' or as the star of the UPN
sitcom ``Sparks,'' is the new affable host, picking up where the
veteran weatherman Al Roker, the affable host for the first season,
left off.
</P>
<P>
   With hourlong video visits to popular and photogenic vacation
destinations including South Africa, Sydney, Ireland, Miami,
Ecuador and Las Vegas, the show has earned the rather specialized
distinction of being public television's highest-rated travel
series.
</P>
<P>
   The series doesn't have a formula, says executive producer
William R. Grant, so much as it has a loose concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's imagine that we're going to spend a week somewhere and
capture a variety of experiences, some traditional, some not in the
guidebooks,'' he says. ``Places you'd be pointed to by local
experts, a little bit of food, a little bit of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery introduces each show, does voice-over narration and is the
surrogate traveler on a couple of programs. In Florida, for
example, the camera follows him in his convertible, but also takes
a tour of the city's Art Deco buildings with a local authority and
keeps its eye on two 20-ish sisters in Miami for some chic fun,
including a foray on Rollerblades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What works in TV programs of all sorts is the people,'' Grant
says. ``Characters are everything. In these shows, the place is a
character and the people you meet there, whether they're the guides
or the other people you've traveled with. Tourists are stand-ins
for the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Segments of the Ecuador trip are told through the experience of
a young, attractive tour group that does some trekking in the Andes
and stays in a remote lodge on the Amazon. The Australian author
Thomas Keneally provides colonial lore on a visit to Sydney. A show
called ``The Bloodiest Field'' documents Civil War re-enactments of
the Battle of Antietam in Hagerstown, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The programs cost about $200,000 each _ low for documentary
programming, Grant says _ and are shot in about 10 days. The eight
programs are among the 20 to 25 new hours of ``travels and
journeys'' programming shown on public television each year.
</P>
<P>
   An advance guard does some scouting before the camera crew
arrives. Still, Avery says, ``sometimes we have to change plans
when what was supposed to be a fascinating temple turns out to be a
hut in a ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   He is already taping next season's shows, and recently returned
from Bali.
</P>
<P>
   He loves travel, but wants his creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a child of the '60s,'' he says. ``I've been through all
that, sleeping in the dirt. I'll do just about anything, but in
Bali they tried to get me to go to a cave with fruit bats. A dark
cave with a bunch of flying rats? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical advice is sprinkled in with the chats, scenery and
geography. A doctor interviewed about the dangers of drinking water
and eating vegetables in Ecuador urges ``caution, but not to the
point of obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a happy marriage of two electronic media, the show leaves
most of the service information to a well-thought-out ``Going
Places'' Web site, which can be found at www.pbs.org. Travelers
with an actual urge to leave their armchairs can go from television
to computer to find relevant phone numbers, maps, further facts,
figures and advice.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us can sit back and enjoy the ride.

ONE MAN'S HATE SPEECH, ANOTHER'S POLITICAL SPEECH

<P>
   Sex and lurking sexual predators aren't the only worries people
have about the Internet. Web sites that blaze with hate and bigotry
have also come under fire recently. And unfortunately, there are
those who would hack a hunk out of the First Amendment in order to
ban such sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech on the Internet has grown rapidly _ through Web
sites, e-mail, bulletin boards and chat rooms _ according to a
study published by the Anti-Defamation League last year. The ADL
monitors the Internet looking for anti-semitic speech propagated by
neo-Nazi, white supremacist groups. In the study, ``High-Tech Hate:
Extremist Use of the Internet,'' the ADL notes that hate Web sites
more than doubled in one year, from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech can be loosely defined as speech that reviles or
ridicules a person or group of people based upon their race, creed,
sexual orientation, religion, handicap, economic condition or
national origin.
</P>
<P>
   A number of universities, more sensitive to people's feelings
than the significance of the First Amendment, have written speech
regulations to punish students who post hate messages on the World
Wide Web. Some universities have put blocking technology on their
computers that have Internet access _ to filter out Web sites that
advocate racism, anti-semitism, white supremacy, homophobia,
Holocaust denial, sexual superiority, anti-government vigilante
justice, and other forms of prejudice and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who push for a rating system for every Web page,
with stiff fines for those who didn't rate their sites or rated
them wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably an Aryan Nations or Ku Klux Klan site would have to
rate itself (or be rated by others) so that children could not gain
access when the appropriate filtering program is installed to read
the ratings and block some categories.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., labelled
the Nation of Islam as a hate group in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes the software filter called Cyber Patrol
made a decision months ago to block out the American Family
Association's Web site because it contains prejudicial statements
against homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing American Family Association, ironically, has
pushed parents, schools and libraries to use Internet filters like
Cyber Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A number of academics argue that hate speech should not be
protected by the First Amendment. Fortunately, their arguments have
not been persuasive against our long and honored tradition of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   While we may despise the comments made on some of these
hate-filled Web sites, it is difficult to argue they are not
espousing a political position. Often one man's hate speech is
another man's political statement. And political commentary has _
and should have _ the highest First Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Supreme Court noted in finding the Communications
Decency Act unconstitutional last year, anyone with access to the
Internet can be a pamphleteer sending e-mail messages to thousands
of recipients with one click of a button, or posting Web sites that
are eventually seen by hundreds of thousands. It is the most
democratic communication media yet devised.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of any social or political movement cuts a path
to recognition by using radical, sometimes outrageous rhetoric. The
rhetoric is there to define or redefine the landscape in terms that
suit that particular movement. It is there to shake up the
prevailing state of affairs. This has been true in this nation from
the time of our own revolution to gain independence from Great
Britain to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the British Crown could have considered the
Declaration of Independence a form of hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Workers of the World, the labor movement, the
socialist movement, anti-war movements, the Black Power movement,
poverty marches, veteran's marches, the temperance crusade, women's
liberation movement, the anti-abortion movement _ all used
inflammatory rhetoric like a blowtorch to burn a hole in the status
quo. To demand that people take sides. And see the world
differently.
</P>
<P>
   If hate speech were prohibited, socio-political movements could
be crushed before they even started.
</P>
<P>
   The current cliche about ``civility'' in debate may be fine when
we all agree to basic premises and we're all well fed and treated
equally. We can afford to be polite to one another and chummy. But
civility does not serve the downtrodden, the forgotten, the
invisible, the persecuted, the hungry and homeless. Civility in
pursuit of justice plays to the power structure's selective
deafness. To be effective, the voice must be raised, the tone
sharpened, the language at a pitch that slices the air.
</P>
<P>
   Americans know this at heart _ we were born in a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech is not the cause of bigotry, but arises out of it
and a sense of political and social powerlessness. Allowing those
who feel powerless to speak _ no matter how vehement the language _
salves the speaker. Venting frustration, anger and hurt is an
important use of language. It may actually short circuit an
inclination for physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   The black playwright Imamu Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) had one of
his characters in ``Dutchman,'' his 1960s play about a black
rebellion, say that for every poem he wrote, there was one less
white man he killed.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressing speech, even hateful speech and perhaps especially
hateful speech, would inevitably lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   We don't protect the civil rights of those who are targets of
hateful speech by suppressing the speech of hate mongers. For
eventually, inexorably, such suppression turns and bites those it
is supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Speech laws that have been adopted to protect racial minorities
are actually used to persecute the very people they were created to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   This has been true in Great Britain and in Canada _ just as it
has been true at universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the University of Michigan put its speech code against
racist speech into effect and before the code was struck down in
1989 as unconstitutional, 20 students were charged with violations.
Ironically only one was punished, a black student for using the
term ``white trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The power structure interprets and enforces the law. Where white
males dominate, white males are less likely to be prosecuted under
such laws _ cynical but true.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressing hate speech is more dangerous than allowing it to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, hate speech has a role to play in a nation
dedicated to vigorous debate about public issues.

 &HT;    Florida government addressing problem of poor indoor air
quality; many workers sickened by fumes
 &HT;    By Lillian Weis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You can't see it. Some can't even smell
it or taste it. But you can feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like chasing a ghost,'' Palm Beach County Facilities
Compliance Manager Dean Zehnter said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to pinpoint exactly what is in the air at the Palm Beach
County Sheriff's headquarters and many other buildings in South
Florida can be as daunting as solving a mystery. It has cost the
sheriff's office an estimated $26,000 in cleaning and consulting
fees since late June to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four of the sheriff's 77 dispatchers have seen doctors for
problems related to air quality in the building. A noxious odor
that caused eye and throat irritations and led to respiratory
problems forced workers to evacuate their office four times in the
past month. The only other time there was an air-quality complaint
there was in December 1995, at the crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say it's this one thing,'' assistant director
of administration Georgette Carroll said. ``There's nothing else
that can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of proof is great for a science that's imprecise.
Even the most sensitive instruments used to test air quality can't
detect the low levels of chemicals that the human body can, said
Holly Bailey, president of Bailey Engineering Corp., a Palm Beach
Gardens-based company that has been testing indoor air quality for
about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bodies are very sensitive, but they can't identify the
problem,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither can most experts. Everyone's sensitivity level to gases
released into the air is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know which are the bad compounds and how they
are going to react,'' said Gene Tucker, a senior research engineer
at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's lab in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA, people spend as much as 90 percent of
their time indoors. Indoor air pollution has consistently ranked
among the top five environmental risks to public health in recent
studies conducted by the EPA and the Science Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA doesn't regulate indoor air because little data
exists on its pollutants and the effects they have on people, said
Garvin Heath, an employee at the indoor environments division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is not there,'' Heath said. ``Without that kind of
data, you can't regulate anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Indoor air quality studies are under way at the Research
Triangle Institute in North Carolina and universities throughout
the country. Tucker, who has studied the sources of indoor air
pollutants and ways to control them since 1983, said progress has
been made in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to develop ways to measure the chemicals emitted
in buildings, and we're working with manufactures to learn how to
make products that limit the emissions of gases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts look for the usual suspects such as mold in air
conditioning units, which provide a wet environment where mold and
mildew thrive, and dust mites. Wil Spaul, a $200-an-hour certified
industrial hygienist hired by the sheriff's office, identified
those _ among other problems _ in the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   County and sheriff's officials believe smoke from the wildfires
in Central Florida that led to health advisories here may have led
to some of the employees' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   All commercial air handler units in public buildings must
distribute a blend of outdoor air and recirculated indoor air, as
required by industry standards established in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fix all at the present time that solves all indoor
air quality problems,'' Zehntner said.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air
Conditioning Engineers have set industry standards and guidelines.
The key is maintenance and control of indoor air pollutants,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said most problems linked to a sick building surface soon
after construction is completed. The Martin County Courthouse was
closed for four years because toxic fungi growing in mold and
mildew made employees sick. It was deemed a sick building by
experts who found moisture and humidity problems.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County spent $27 million renovating the two-building
complex, relocating employees and litigating against builders and
designers of the complex, which reopened in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with the Palm Beach County sheriff's
headquarters, which was first built 16 years ago and expanded in
1993. The problems are new and affecting only the communication
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had sick-building syndrome, we would all be sick,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County, which owns and maintains the 1
million-square-foot complex, has 40 workers on site who follow a
maintenance schedule that includes checking the 26 air conditioning
units monthly. The sheriff's budget for maintenance and repairs
last year was $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   To identify the problem at the communications office, Bailey
Engineering first tested the temperature, relative humidity and
carbon dioxide levels, which were fine. They then searched for
another environmental cause by asking employees questions that
would determine what happened before they became ill.
</P>
<P>
   But isolating a specific chemical as the cause of an illness is
nearly impossible. Thousands of compounds exist naturally, adding
to synthetic ones that release chemicals into the air. Scientists
don't know what effects cumulative compounds may have on the body,
and that's why they say it's important not to discount any
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carroll said, ``there's a level of anxiety going into
work when you are wondering if you'll get sick again.''

 &HT;    Lying about sex: criminal or courteous?
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Martha Ezzard will be on vacation until Aug. 10)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA- What is the impact of the Clinton sex saga on American
culture and politics? Or is this baby-boomer president as much a
reflection of today's culture as an influence on it? Either way, a
majority of the American people say they didn't want to know the
embarrassing details of the alleged Monica Lewinisky affair.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent leak of the Lewinsky deal with the special
prosecutor is true, either the president or Lewinsky may have lied,
but Lewinsky says (according to the leaks) that the president
didn't pressure her to lie under oath. That means he couldn't be
charged with the criminal act of obstructing justice and it's
doubtful perjury can be proved in a he says, she says conflict.
Despicable as the president's behavior may be, most Americans
understand that it doesn't endanger the nation. Clinton is
responsible to his wife and his God for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, is also a creature of
today's culture_ the socially conservative culture. Conservatism,
once defined as minimizing government and maximizing individual
liberties, now fosters government as the moral police. Starr has
also missed a lesson basic to every good prosecutor _ you don't use
all of the legal power at your disposal lest you fill the jails
with parking meter violators. Arranging bribes, endangering
national security, using public office for private gain _ that is
the stuff of a special prosecutor, not the sex lives of high
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office has become little more than a sieve for Illegal
leaks of grand jury testimony to media_ a matter serous enough to
cause a federal judge to ordered an investigation. Starr violates
the time-honored ``doctrine of clean hands,'' which says those who
disregard the tenets of justice cannot plead before the court for
it
</P>
<P>
   Starr has employed attorneys on his staff with less than clean
records.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Udolf, a former Georgia District Attorney, is a good
example. Udolf was found liable by a federal jury for violating a
Dawsonville carpenter's constitutional rights. Udolf tried to
coerce Ronald Reeves to testify against his employer in a drug case
Udolf was prosecuting. Udolf had Reeves thrown in jail on a bogus
stolen weapon charge. He didn't allow Reeves to call his wife or
lawyer for 24 hours, never scheduled a hearing , and grilled Reeves
about the drug case, not the gun charge. A federal judge fined
Udolph $50,000 for violating Reeves' constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Udolf isn't my idea of the caliber of lawyer who should be
questionning the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned the special prosecutor's press spokesman Charles Bakaly
to ask about Udolph's role in the investigation. After three calls
and five days, an aide left a message that Bakaly would need to
know my questions before he could talk to me. Even Star's
spokesperson doesn't seem to get the hang of his job.
</P>
<P>
   But in almost every corner of the nation, folks get the hang of
this unfortunate chapter of American politics: a president who
succeeds as a policy maker and fails as a moral model. A zealot of
a special prosecutor. And Americans find different ways to say why
they'd keep Clinton in office anyway.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly southern woman from an upscale Atlanta suburb put it
this way: ``If the president did have an improper relationship with
that young woman, lying about it was the gentlemanly thing to do.''

 &HT;    Sit first in judgment of ourselves
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Last month, speaking at the 89th annual NAACP
convention in Atlanta, the group's president and chief executive
officer, Kweisi Mfume, called the justices of the Supreme Court
hypocrites when it comes to matters of diversity. His comment that
the justices ``should be ashamed of themselves'' made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring law clerks, the justices reflect a decided bias for
whites from three Ivy League schools: Harvard, Yale and Columbia.
USA Today reported that of the 394 clerks the current justices have
hired, 4.5 percent were Asian, 1.8 percent were black, and 1
percent were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Each justice hires three or four clerks a year, and they have
significant influence. Clerks screen most of the cases, thus
helping decide which ones the court will hear, and they draft most
of the rulings. Justice Antonin Scalia, who has consistently voted
against affirmative action, has never hired a black clerk during
his 12 years on the bench. During 26 years on the high court, 99
percent of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's clerks have been
whites and 88 percent have been males.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines aside, the part of Mr. Mfume's speech that impressed
me most was his plea to all Americans, individually and
collectively. He asked us not to retreat from the struggle for
civil rights into ``the comfort of our own existence.''
</P>
<P>
   His words struck a resounding chord with me because the NAACP
fought for the comforts of my existence, from equal pay as a
teacher to access to public accommodations. Another compelling
reason to reflect on Mr. Mfume's words is that he leads by example.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, this brother who transformed himself from
school-dropout street hustler to widely respected,
college-educated, urbane, respected politician had arrived at a
position of status longed for by many and achieved by few. The
former five-term congressman from Baltimore was comfortably
situated on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, however, he left Congress to run the NAACP, which at
the time seemed to be a dying organization. The nation's oldest
civil rights group was $4 million in debt, reeling from scandals
related to former CEO Ben Chavis and adrift without assertive
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the organization has a $2 million surplus. There is a new
emphasis on recruiting young members. Most important, Mr. Mfume has
brought the NAACP full circle, seeking to include all people who
want to eliminate racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP was founded by a coalition of blacks and whites. Mr.
Mfume would have those of us who have achieved sufficient economic
stability and a modicum of status step outside our comfort zones to
address prejudice and bigotry. Only with the involvement of those
who now feel no personal urgency to get involved in the struggle
can we create the kinds of coalitions that wield moral authority in
shaping this nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   As the hiring practices of the Supreme Court confirm, America is
still not sufficiently free of discrimination against blacks and
other minorities to abandon affirmative-action remedies. The NAACP
is committed to fight to change that reality. But, as Mr. Mfume
said, those of us who abhor prejudice and bigotry have an
obligation to step outside our insular status to open doors
undeniably closed against minorities except by government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would happen if all of us who deny we are
prejudiced put aside our stereotypical prejudgments of each other
to really get to know a person of a different race. Imagine if we
did this of our own volition, without being coerced by law. And
imagine what would happen if those of us who believe racial
prejudice can destroy this country acted on the job, in the home
and throughout the community to confront bigotry, whether directed
toward us or others.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect we would discover that that kind of affirmative action
is the only kind this nation needs.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Soft sand, hard sell
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Beach-Dude Way is to hang loose and not hassle anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the world's great systems of social philosophy, The
Beach-Dude Way has its enemies and detractors. And its newest
enemies are making its mellowest practitioners testy.
</P>
<P>
   The Beach-Dude Way is a more complex philosophy than apparent on
the surface. Take another look at this credo and you will note it
has two parts: (1) hang loose; (2) don't hassle anyone. A personal
expectation and a related social duty.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign at the beach entrance instructing people in
this. There should be. As it is, most beach signs violate the
spirit of Section 1 of The Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Beach-Dude Way is universal to beaches. It is respected
internationally, even in crowded city-beaches. You can sit on
beaches from Rio to Miami, shoulder-to-shoulder in a crowd of
sunbathers with skyscrapers behind them and sea before them, and
find the folks around you to be determinedly loose, nonaggressive
and nonjudgmental. So powerful is The Beach-Dude Way that it can
tame even hard-living urbanites of all backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   But it can't deter the march of aggressive free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Beachgoers in Florida complain increasingly that they are
stalked by enemies of The Beach-Dude Way.
</P>
<P>
   They report being hunted by salesmen. And not just any salesmen
-- time-share condominium salesmen. Salesmen who are as persistent
as panhandlers. As aggressive as telephone swamp-lot peddlers. As
impervious to rejection and insult as the most whacked-out cult
members.
</P>
<P>
   They disguise themselves as beach-dudes in order to walk among
them. Yet they are the very opposite. They are hasslers. Hasslers
are what people drive to beaches to escape. The natural enemies of
beach dudes.
</P>
<P>
   So as more beach-dozers awake to the smiling faces of pitchmen,
new tensions are building on the shore. Tourists are screaming,
motel owners are complaining and chambers of commerce are calling
for prudent self-regulation. Beach-dudes, meanwhile, are wading
into deeper water and calming themselves down.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ugly situation.
</P>
<P>
   The right to privacy, as Louis Brandeis first defined it, is
``the right to be left alone.'' And the beach-dude is as private as
a crab. He walks a habitat where the right to be left alone is
better respected than in any other public place.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive salespeople are predators in such an environment.
Their prey lack the usual natural defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Freely trespassing, the salesmen break the unwritten social
compact of the beach. They violate the expectation that beaches
exist as hassle-free preserves.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a culture where telephone salespeople call us during
dinner, mass mailers fill our mailboxes with sweepstakes entries
and scam-artists stuff our e-mail accounts with sure-fire
get-rich-quick schemes. So maybe it's naive to believe we might
avoid them simply by walking outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the time-share hawkers are shoreline trailblazers and we
can soon expect magazine-subscription peddlers and insurance
sellers to follow their footprints by the surf. Maybe vendors of
riptide and shark insurance, too. The door-to-door salesman is
being replaced by the outdoor-to-outdoor salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Nature has just become scarier.
</P>
<P>
   So this summer, I walk the shore with caution. I apply sunscreen
and look out for jellyfish, sharks and time-share salesmen. I block
out the drone of low-flying planes trailing advertising banners. I
flee the thudding bass of radio boomboxes. I am alerted a mile away
to the lawnmowerlike aroma of power-skis. (The smell of lawn work
sparks in me an instinctive flight reflex.)
</P>
<P>
   This combination is enough to make me wonder if there's a
Mountain-Dude Way.
</P>
<P>
   If there is, though, you'd have to wear shoes to live it. That's
no good.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I suspect mountain-trail time-share salesmen already
are stuffing flyers and contracts in their backpacks. Why would
someone sell time-shares on a mountaintop? Because it's there.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Hillary deserves better life
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Bill's fault, but it's Hillary who let us down
</P>
<P>
   It was about 11 in the morning before I could pick up the front
page of the newspaper. I guess seeing it in black and white made it
that much more distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to deny it,'' the headline said, and I knew right
then I wasn't going to like what I was about to read.
</P>
<P>
   So I came to work and drank my coffee and pretended to be both
well-informed and well-adjusted about Bill Clinton's shortcomings,
which we've known for awhile now are many. And as the day, and my
nerve, progressed, I began to gingerly digest the details of the
Monica Lewinsky immunity deal almost as though I was snapping back
from the flu and had to start off with a glass of flat ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   Sips. Little sips.
</P>
<P>
   What's so unfair about all this is that I should be furious with
him. The realist in me knows that. I should hate him. Detest him. I
should forget about the kid from Hope and the bumper sticker I put
on my truck seven years ago and the way he and Hillary looked at
each other as they danced on the night of his first election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'm furious with Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'm thinking, ``How could she? Why did she?''
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair, I suppose, to turn so quickly on a woman whom I
have always held in such high regard. And if ever Hillary needed a
good friend, it is now. But part of my anger is so simple, really,
so basic.
</P>
<P>
   She's not living the life she's telling us to lead. She's not
leading the life she deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Women supported Hillary Clinton, and thus, her husband, because
she is smart and powerful and appeared to be kind and generous.
Women supported her because she was a good mom. Hillary affirmed
all the things we knew about ourselves but were still just a little
unsure of. We'd hacked our way through the male world for so long
that we still loved the repetition.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of lesson did she teach us, really? More to the
point, what kind of lesson did she teach her impressionable
daughter, Chelsea? That it's OK to go through a marriage constantly
worrying that your husband might be with another woman? That
cheating's OK as long as the two of you are good and powerful
together?
</P>
<P>
   A big part of me can't wait for someone to hurry up and write
the Clinton's inside story. I am hoping, praying, for a few
late-breaking good reasons that might make it as clear as a bell
why Hillary stood by her man for all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I realize a good explanation is impossible. I think I knew
that back in January when I first heard the words Clinton, intern
and black dress strung together.
</P>
<P>
   I had another column ready to go for today. It was a lovely
story about my dear friend's coming marriage and the fact she's
found her first real love at age 41. But publishing a story about
the bliss of romance four days after I sat at my desk with a sour
stomach and sipped the Monica-Bill story somehow didn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a little like I was going through life with my heart
in the right place _ but my head on wrong. And I'm afraid Hillary's
done enough of that for all of us.

 &HT;    Clinton's moral legacy
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Richard Nixon turned in the doorway of the Marine
helicopter and gave his two-armed victory salute just before he was
</P>
<P>
   whisked away from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   What will Bill Clinton do? Perhaps he will give his pretend
military salute. Maybe it will be a big wave with a big smile.
Should Hillary be
</P>
<P>
   there standing there by her man?
</P>
<P>
   These details need to be worked out. Clinton, after all, is
concerned about his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to look good when future generations compare the
departures of America's two disgraced presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it remains an open question whether Clinton serves out
his presidency. But there is no question that Clinton's greatest
legacy to
</P>
<P>
   the nation will be lowered moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had to lower its adultery standards. Considering
the adulterous behavior of the commander in chief, there's no way
the
</P>
<P>
   military could kick some private out of the Army for violating
the Uniform Code of Military Justice ban on adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's treatment of women has lowered the standards by which
men treat women. Clinton and his supporters have no problem
trashing the
</P>
<P>
   reputations of women who complain that they were victims of
Clinton's crude and sexually harassing behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be unacceptable for men accused of sexual harassment
to defend themselves attacking the reputations of the complaining
women.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has made smearing the backgrounds of his accusers an
practiced art form.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters have either defended his boorish actions or
kept silent. Either way, moral standards have been lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist Gloria Steinem facilitated Clinton's legacy of
dumbed-down moral standards by defending him when White House
volunteer Kathleen
</P>
<P>
   Willey reluctantly reported that Clinton grabbed her, kissed
her, groped her breast and forced her hand on his genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem said even if what Willey said was true Clinton was not
guilty of sexual harassment because he ``took 'no' for an answer.''
We now have
</P>
<P>
   the one-free-grope standard.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Clinton's legacy, Americans who used to demand only
the highest standards from their elected officials now defend
Clinton by
</P>
<P>
   saying that other presidents had adulterous affairs. Before
Clinton, standards set by the lowest common denominator were
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has given us lowered standards on truthfulness. He
can look Americans straight in the eyes and lie, such as his
performance on
</P>
<P>
   60 Minutes when he lied about his affair with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans heard him on tape urging Flowers to lie about their
affair if questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Americans flocked to this new Clinton standard by saying, ``If
you can't lie about sex, what can you lie about?'' Har, har. Wink,
wink. Nudge,
</P>
<P>
   nudge.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton appears to be caught in a lie under oath when he
said he did not have sex with Monica Lewinsky, a 21-year-old White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Another new lowered moral standard is the argument that even if
the president did lie under oath in the Paula Jones case, it was a
civil
</P>
<P>
   case. Besides, the case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   So, thanks to Clinton, the new standard is that Americans can
commit criminal perjury as long as it is committed on a civil case
that might
</P>
<P>
   get dismissed. Parents may have a difficult time teaching that
standard of criminal mendacity to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legacy of lowered morality also has left parents with
the chore of explaining oral sex, semen-stained dresses and how
some daddies
</P>
<P>
   cheat on their mommies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with this, thanks to Clinton and
his legacy to the American people.

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Hitting the jackpot
without Powerball
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Becoming a millionaire is surprisingly easy. Any American
teenager with average intelligence and decent health can plan to
retire with more than $1 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the August/September issue of The Futurist
magazine lays out the simple guidelines for retiring rich. To
guarantee ``future wealth,'' just get a solid education, work hard,
invest early, stay married and don't squander money on frivolous
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But could it really be that simple? Could a blue-collar worker
with no college degree or inheritance really retire as a
millionaire? Absolutely. Here's how, based on financial
calculations in The Futurist:
</P>
<P>
   Let's say a teenager finishes high school and gets a job. He
lives lean so he can put $500 a year into a savings account and
still spend about $3,000 over a few years to pay for the training
to become an auto mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Now at age 22, he has $2,000 in savings and lots of
opportunities to earn $30,000 a year as a mechanic. If he puts his
savings into a mutual fund paying a 10 percent compounded rate of
return (equal to the appreciation of the stock market over the last
50 years), he will collect $194,000 from that one-time investment
at age 70.
</P>
<P>
   Then assume our young mechanic can average a 2 percent annual
pay raise (after adjusting for inflation) throughout his career. If
he saves just a tenth of his income each year and invests it
conservatively for a 6 percent rate of return, he'll have $1.1
million at age 70. Throw in the $194,000 from his initial
investment, and he's living on a lake, golfing every day and
driving a big luxury car. If he stays married to someone who earns
and saves a similar amount, the couple will be multimillionaires,
and that's not even counting the equity they might have in a house.
</P>
<P>
   Without getting any inheritance, without worrying about Social
Security, without depending on his boss for a pension plan, our
mechanic will retire wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Powerball, the crack cocaine of state
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, millions of Americans put on a dramatic demonstration
of why very few people will retire as millionaires. The
lottery-crazed gamblers took time off work, drove long distances
and wasted valuable hours in huge lines trying to buy a ticket to
instant riches.
</P>
<P>
   An individual's chances of winning the jackpot were less than
one in 80 million, slightly less than my chances of being crowned
Miss America this year.
</P>
<P>
   While one winning ticket did make a few people rich last week,
the rest of the country was made poorer. The news media were filled
with reports of people who skipped work and spent small fortunes on
gasoline trying to get to packed stores where they could throw away
more time and money on tickets.
</P>
<P>
   How many waitresses will struggle this week because their
customers squandered potential tip money on the lottery last week?
How many kids won't get a back-to-school sweater this week because
their mothers blew the budget on Powerball? How many trips to the
dentist will get put off because would-be patients lost their
meager savings?
</P>
<P>
   At least in Georgia, which does not participate in Powerball,
people have realistic chances of becoming millionaires from the
lottery. That's because lottery revenue goes into the HOPE
scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   Losers buy the lottery tickets. The winners ignore the games and
focus on qualifying for the scholarship money. Those who use
lottery funds to get good educations can easily become
millionaires. In Georgia, those who throw their money down the
lottery rat hole make it possible for others to retire rich and
happy.

 &HT;    Take a tour of the '60s and keep on truckin'
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- August marks the birthdays of a pack of '60s icons
including Andy Warhol and the Grateful Dead's late front man, Jerry
Garcia. In their honor, why not crank up your Web-based time
machine and take a closer look at the people and ideas that shaped
the 1960s?
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly as many sites for the Dead as there are bootleg
concert tapes, but any Grateful Dead Web journey should start at
the official home page at http://www.dead.net, which also offers
links to a variety of sites related to San Francisco, the sixties
and other influences on the band. One link leads to a site called
Sixties.com (http://www.sixties.com), a tribute to the legendary
Haight-Ashbury culture and birthplace of the band.
</P>
<P>
   As the historians and other folks who keep tabs on such things,
the '60s were also a time of political and social upheaval, some of
which is chronicled on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Psychedelic '60s: Literary Tradition and Social Change
(http://www.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/sixties/index.html) is a
treasure trove of information on the music, poets and politics that
helped shape the decade. Once you get past the lofty-sounding
title, it's possible to spend hours here reading up on people such
as Timothy Leary, newspapers such as the long-defunct Berkley Barb,
or about the early origins of the women's movement. There's lots of
information here, well written and well organized. One small
complaint is a few more pictures would have been nice, but as a
'60s primer this is an excellent resource.
</P>
<P>
   For more of an immersion experience, try the Summer of Love Web
site at http://www.sftoday.com/enn2/summerlove.htm. ``Enter here
with flowers in your hair,'' beckons the start page referring to
the line from the song ``If You're Going to San Francisco.''
Visitors can be transported back to 1967 for a virtual tour guide
to San Francisco, ground zero for the legendary Summer of Love.
Learn about the famous Fillmore theater where concert promoter Bill
Graham booked bands such as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful
Dead, page through the ``Hip Dictionary'' or read up on the Free
Speech movement and Yippie founder and counterculture guru Abbie
Hoffman. Music fans will love pouring over articles about the
Beatles' 1967 landmark album Sgt. Peppers Lonelyhearts Club Band,
which was released that summer, and the Monterey Pop festival.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol fans will find more than just soup cans at the site
designed by the Andy Warhol museum at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .warhol.org. In addition to documenting Warhol's life and works,
it also provides links to other aspects of Warhol's world including
a site devoted to Warhol's one-time musical proteges, Lou Reed and
the Velvet Underground (http://www.rocknroll.net/loureed/), whose
music has been cited as a major influence on many rock and
alternative bands working today. There's also another excellent
site devoted to the Velvets at
http://members.aol.com/olandem/vu.html.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Child proof is proof enough for me
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ All that stands between me and relief are the
gel capsules inside that little bubble - the one I'm holding
between thumbs and forefingers. As I struggle, I remember reading
somewhere that what really separates humans from animals is the
fact that we have opposing thumbs. It made sense at the time, but
looking back on it, I'm not so sure. When was the last time you and
your opposing digits successfully ripped into a little silver
packet that instructed you to ``tear here''?
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It's 3 a.m. and I'm sitting on the side of the bathtub,
shivering, swearing and trying my damnedest to ``tear here.''
Instinctively, I stick one corner of the bubble pack in my mouth
and begin to gnaw. Nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Fumble. Expletive. Vow: If I live, I'll never, ever, buy another
packaging miracle that has been tested by a bunch of sadistic
chimpanzees. And no childproof bottle caps either.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm feeling lousier by the minute. I'm thinking maybe
I'd better take my temperature, a serious sign because I haven't
seen a thermometer around the house since my son got out of grammar
school. I begin the search in the most logical place - the linen
closet. Of course, I can't reach anything in the three-foot deep
cabinet so I pull out the bottom drawer and stand on it - barefoot.
But not for long. A couple of seconds at a stretch is all my sick
soles can handle.
</P>
<P>
   I find it on the fourth pain-ridden try, in a jar with some old
plaid shoe laces probably left over from high school days - mine. I
try not to calculate their age (I feel lousy enough already) as I
struggle with the bubble-packaged thermometer. Methodically, I pull
at everything sticking out. Nothing happens. Next, I try pushing
and twisting at the same time. Still nothing. I'm reduced to
swearing as I fling it across the room.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it pops open and the thermometer rolls across the
floor with Biddy Bother, my Siamese nemesis, in hot pursuit. Shes
been taking in the whole show, without comment which is most
unusual for her. She's faster - but I'm bigger. ``If you don't give
me that thermometer,'' I find myself threatening, ``I'm going to
die right here on the spot and you'll miss breakfast because no one
will find my body until mid-afternoon which is probably when 'll
begin to stink.'' I crawl across the bathroom, grab the
thermometer, shake it down, and stick it in my mouth. Too late to
worry about germs. I lean against the toilet and wait.
</P>
<P>
   It's 102. I'm really sick. In fact, I'm feeling a bit like Fred
Sanford, staggering around with my hand on my chest declaring,
``This is the big one, Elizabeth.'' All of my survival instincts
are firing now and my focus is on that bubble packet. I go for the
scissors and begin trimming away the edges. Two snips, and I've
unintentionally disemboweled the blue gel caps and cold remedy is
running through my fingers onto the cat. Neither of us is happy and
now I have to wash off the cat so she doesn't overdose on flu
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In my fever-ridden stupor, I come to the conclusion that the AMA
and the pharmaceutical companies are in cahoots thereby ensuring
that packaging designs will thwart even the most agile sufferer,
and put patent remedies totally beyond the reach of the weak and
the digitally impaired. Result: a trip to the doctor AND a few
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning I visit the doc who listens to me
breathe, shakes his head, and tells me I've done it again -
pneumonia. He writes out a couple of prescriptions and suggests I
take it easy for a few days. I ask if I can have my pills in a
paper bag since only well people can get medicine bottles open.
</P>
<P>
   He's not amused. Okay, I'm sick...and so's my humor.

 &HT;    TNotebooks have crisis of proportions
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There is in human nature a battle between big and
small, the fascination with what is tiny vs. the awe of bigness.
</P>
<P>
   Some things get cooler as they get smaller. Wireless phones,
silicon chips, quarks, Thumbelina. And, of course, we want some
things to be as big as can be: pro football linemen, Godzilla, the
World Trade Center, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Technology -- natch -- is only too happy to oblige either
impulse.
</P>
<P>
   You want a sport-utility vehicle the size of a township? You
plunk down a few months salary and it's yours. You want a miniature
speaker for your stereo? No problem. Sometimes we want smaller,
sometimes bigger.
</P>
<P>
   But now, notebook computers seem caught between the competing
urges.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the very existence of notebooks seems proof that
people need smaller, lighter computers. The only limit to building
smaller ones seemed to be the size of people's hands -- keyboards
had to be large enough to give us a fighting chance at typing. And
you recall the original notebooks with their three lines of
semi-legible type.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, notebooks are trying to grow at the same time they
maintain their portability. More specifically, many notebooks are
being made with larger screens -- up to 15.1-inch displays. The
user gets a better picture, often with souped-up sound and graphics
as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the result for those models -- increasingly defining the
high end of the market -- are notebooks that are larger and
heavier. Some even check in at 10 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the July issue of Mobile Computing &AMP; Communications,
reviewers took on 16 notebooks, each with displays measuring 13.3
inches or more diagonally. Among the machines tested:
</P>
<P>
   -- AMS Tech's Rodeo 3040ECX draws praise for speed and ability
to support several storage devices. However, sigh the reviewers, it
is large and heavy and the display is ``a bit dull.'' For
information on the $3,900 notebook, call the company (626-814-0782)
or visit its Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .amstech.com).
</P>
<P>
   -- IBM's ThinkPad 600, a $4,934 notebook, is fast, thin and --
at 6.5 pounds -- light of weight in the large-display category,
according to reviewers. For more information, call the company
(1-800-426-7255) or visit its Web site (http://www.ibm.com
</P>
<P>
   /thinkpad).
</P>
<P>
   -- Hewlett-Packard's OmniBook 4100 also won generally good
reviews. The $4,274 machine is thin, performs well and offers both
good display and long battery life, reviewers say. For more
information, call the company (1-800-322-4772) or visit its Web
site (http://www.hp.com).
</P>
<P>
   -- VisionBook Pro 7590 from Hitachi costs $4,134 and performs
well, reviewers say. Unfortunately the keyboard is poorly designed
and the battery anemic by comparison to other Pentium notebooks.
For information, call the company (1-800-555-6820) or visit its Web
site (http://www.hitachipc.com).
</P>
<P>
   Using your thumb to travel
</P>
<P>
   Just how you get from place to place is a very personal,
idiosyncratic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether you prefer car, bus, taxi, plane, train or
foot power. How do you navigate across the frontier of the screen
in your personal computer? Most PC users started with typing the
complex codes needed for DOS. Thanks to folks like Apple Computer,
the much quicker mouse with the more user-friendly interface became
common. (Although Xerox scientists are generally credited with the
invention.)
</P>
<P>
   A California outfit now suggests that the truly ``natural,
intuitive link between people and computers'' is really the
thumb-operated trackball.
</P>
<P>
   Logitech, which is based in Fremont, Calif., says its TrackMan
Marble is a more advanced cousin of the trackballs used in many
laptop computers. The device results from four years of research
and uses ``advanced optics and neural network logic'' to detect
movement and pass along the information to the computer, according
to Logitech. The result, the company claims, is a control of the
cursor that is fast and precise.
</P>
<P>
   The device also has three mouse buttons, which can be
customized, letting you assign a function to a button. Traditional
trackball technology is subject to problems with dust, as well as
chemical reactions between metal and oil or with the user's skin,
Logitech says.
</P>
<P>
   The TrackMan Marble works with IBM-compatible systems and
requires Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT for scrolling, although
it can be used as a standard mouse with Windows 3.1. Unfortunately,
TrackMan Marble is not yet engineered to be compatible with Apple,
the original user-friendly computer.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested list price for the device is $80.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the company's sales office in North
Miami Beach (510-795-8500) or visit the company Web site
(http://www.logitech.com).
</P>
<P>
   Code or Kierkegaard?
</P>
<P>
   Programming over Proust. That's the conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   It is assumed by many that the route to the techiest of the
high-tech jobs passes through a university's engineering or
computer department or some trade school equivalent. It does seem
logical, after all, that computer programming courses are the path
to computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Ullman, a software engineer and author, says that is
the exact wrong way to produce the next generation of great
techies.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece in The New York Times, Ullman argues that
the very idea of a computer science degree is relatively new and
may be misguided. She notes that no one can teach tomorrow's
programmers what the cutting edge will be, since it doesn't exist.
More importantly, she says old-style educations were well-suited to
training someone for an industry that was in constant flux and
frequent revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we knew was how to learn, which is all that one can hang
on to in a profession in which change is relentless. The generation
of programmers who followed us were, well, disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't seem to have a clue about anything but
computers, she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman is author of ``Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its
Discontents,'' whose title is itself a reference to a certain
well-known work read by many students in liberal arts. Ullman says
schools should stress subjects ``that foster a flexible and open
mind,'' rather than the latest skills, which will become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is education in the broadest sense, she wrote.
``Programmers seem to be changing the world. It would be a relief,
for them and for all of us, if they knew something about it.''

 &HT;    911 calls from cellular phones clogging systems; compensation
sought
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Stephanie Murray was impaled by a
steel rod as she rode in a van, the 13-year-old's mother spent
several crucial minutes with a testy Fort Lauderdale police
dispatcher trying to get the distressed family's location.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Murrays been home, dispatchers' screens would have
displayed their address and telephone number. But they were calling
from a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency and law enforcement managers in South Florida and
nationwide are pushing to make cellular phone users pay for the
technology 911 operators need as the phones boom in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The phones make up a fourth of lines statewide and up to 30
percent in South Florida. And while projections 2 1/2 years ago
said there'd be more cellular phone numbers than wired lines by
2008, that milepost has already been moved up to 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, the Federal Communications Commission ordered that
by April 1998, cellular telephones and systems would have to
provide dispatchers the caller's number and the location of the
nearest phone tower, which narrows the call to about a 5-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also said that by October 2001, cell companies had to
have technology in place for dispatchers to locate callers within
about 400 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC said states must have a money source first.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, regular customers already pay up to 50 cents a month
per line for 911. Proposed legislation would charge cellular users
50 cents as well. They now pay nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular companies have balked at the extra expense to customers
but have bought into the idea within the past month, said Jim
Martin, the state's 911 coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit for this service is enormous and well worth the
price,'' Jim Robinson, manager of advertising and promotions for
GTE Wireless, said from Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the companies have reacted to the 2001 deadline,
improvements in the technology and polls that show public support
for the idea. Some customers surveyed said they'd actually switch
to a company that had it.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, wary of launching still another tax, have stalled
on the issue. But with phone companies signing on, the lawmakers
are expected to push the bill through the next session, said John
Ricco, governmental liaison for the Florida Association of
Counties, which has supported the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely momentum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said no sponsor has come forward but agreed the plan now
looks good for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Should the legislature approve the plans next spring, counties
would start collecting fees almost right away, but equipment
probably wouldn't be in place until 2000, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, the equipment will cost about $100,000,
said Mark Adler, the county's 911 coordinator. Running it would
cost about $75,000 a month, he said. Martin and St. Lucie counties
do not yet have estimates.
</P>
<P>
   So far, less than 2 percent of the nation's phones are in
compliance with the FCC rule, said Bill Stanton, executive director
of the National Emergency Number Association, a non-profit group
that supports 911 dispatch centers and educates the public.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's ruling doesn't provide any penalty, state 911
coordinator Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Automatically knowing a caller's number could save time, money
and even lives if, for example, a motorist:
</P>
<P>
   Makes a prank call that keeps police from a real emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Is ill or being attacked and isn't able to give a location or
cell phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Gives a wrong number because he or she has new service or
doesn't often use it.
</P>
<P>
   Is in an unfamiliar area or a rural stretch with few exits,
landmarks or mile markers _ a problem aggravated by Florida's large
numbers of seasonal residents and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Calls 911 but the call drops out; the motorist redials but has
crossed into another town and is connected to a different agency,
prompting confusion and overlapping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are under the impression that we automatically know who
they are,'' said Joe Laviano, 911 manager for the Martin County
Sheriff's Office.

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Free e-mail offers good in most cases
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Despite grumbling from old-time Internet users, some
of the best things on the Net are still free.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, some things that weren't free in the old days --
e-mail, for instance -- are available from a number of sources
without paying a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be clear, most of the free e-mail services require you
already have a way to connect to the Internet. There are exceptions
but, most commonly, these services are most often used by people
who already have access to the Net at school or work.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush then, the idea seems dumb. If you have access to
the Net already, you probably have the ability to send e-mail. So
why sign up for one of these free services?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're increasingly popular for several reasons: (1)
You'll get a permanent e-mail address that won't change the next
time you change Internet providers; (2) For those who have access
to the Net only through work or school, it's a way to send and
receive e-mail privately; and (3) Even if you have trouble
accessing your Internet provider while traveling, these services
will be available from any computer that can log on to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally dozens of free e-mail services, and the list
grows by the week. Our first stop will be at a service called Hot
Mail. Now while that may conjure up images of, uh, steamy e-mail,
Hot Mail is provided by Microsoft. You can find out about the
service at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .hotmail.com/. Then, if you like what you see, you can sign up
at the same address.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, signing up is easy, unless you mind answering a few
questions about your income and level of education. You should be
able to complete the questions in about two minutes, and your new
e-mail address will become effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, which is known best for its search engine, also offers
free e-mail. The system is so similar there's no need to go into
detail. Just go to Yahoo! at http://www.yahoo.com/ and look for the
link to the free e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing you'll notice immediately about all the
Web-based e-mail systems. All of them seem to work the same way.
But if you're shopping for an e-mail service, take the time to read
about the extras offered. Besides free e-mail, some of the sites
offer an electronic filter that will remove some (but not all) junk
e-mail; others have free reminder services (for instance, sending
you an automatic note to remind you it's time to start shopping for
an anniversary gift).
</P>
<P>
   At Bigfoot.Com (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .bigfoot.com/), you'll be offered these types of features as
well as a free auto-responder. What's that? It's a program that
automatically responds to your e-mail, even when you can't. For
instance, when you're on vacation, you could set the auto-responder
to thank the sender for the e-mail and promise to respond when you
get back.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other free e-mail services, but -- unless
you would enjoy making a lifetime project out of testing each one
-- most people will be pleased with one of the services already
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But what about folks who don't have Internet access? None of the
services that we've discussed will help in a case like that.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the original free e-mail providers, Juno, not only
gives you a free e-mail account, it also gives you a way to connect
-- usually through a local telephone number -- free. There are just
two catches -- and considering the fact you won't pay a cent to use
Juno, they don't seem out of line: (1) You'll have to put up with
the advertising that bombards all Juno e-mail customers each time
you connect; and (2) While your e-mail address will let you send
and receive any Internet mail, your free Juno account doesn't
entitle you to any other Internet services such as Web browsing.

 &HT;    Mac News: Ascend personal manager doesn't quite measure up
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ascend, based on a philosophy of life management, is a popular
personal information manager among PC users. The Mac version,
though, works and feels like an afterthought by the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   It's buggy and missing some major features now standard in most
Mac personal information managers such as Claris Organizer, Now
Up-To-Date (soon to be renamed Eudora Planner) and Consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who value the emphasis on life goals might like
Ascend. The program holds true to that philosophy, which isn't the
case for any other personal information manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the philosophy asks you to think deeply about
what's important to you and then prioritize your life accordingly.
That is, if you want to be a writer, focus on writing well and not
on how many things you write.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is the software incarnation of this philosophy. The
program asks you to think about your values, prioritize them and
then come up with a plan to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend translates your plan into a series of tasks you can check
off day to day and keep track of your progress toward the greater
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the deeper look at scheduling, Ascend includes a
journal feature. It lets you record your daily thoughts and
feelings. This is not a feature unique to Ascend, since many other
personal information managers now include journals.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of today's personal information managers, Ascend
includes a calendar, a to-do list and an address file. To-dos and
notes can be linked to contacts and contacts linked to to-dos.
</P>
<P>
   The program also lets you store random bits of information such
as a Social Security number or a password. But this feature is not
well integrated into the rest of the program. You can't link these
tidbits of information to contacts or to-dos.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't find in Ascend is a menu bar icon that lets you
quickly enter new items without launching the program. Organizer,
Consultant and Now Up-To-Date all have this feature.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a number of annoying bugs. The calendar doesn't
open up on the current day, and the feature designed to let you
import addresses from another personal information manager doesn't
work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Franklin Covey, Ascend 4.1 retails for about $100.

   AUSTIN _ Austin's status as one of the country's most wired
cities has a drawback _ a virulent one _ and this past week it hit
close to home.
</P>
<P>
   A computer virus infected personal computers at the University
of Texas last week, threatening to wipe out the hard drives of
thousands of machines. Then Monday, Microsoft Corp. and Netscape
Communications Corp. said that flaws in their popular Web-based
e-mail programs let programmers spread viruses over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people log onto the World Wide Web, they become
increasingly susceptible to infection from a computer virus,
experts say. And those recent events have left users wondering how
to best protect their machines and files.
</P>
<P>
   One line of defense is anti-virus software, which scans all
files and programs _ new and old _ to check for any of the
thousands of viruses it recognizes. After users purchase the
program from an anti-virus software maker, they can download free
updates from company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virus protection software is only as good as the version
you're running,'' said G. Morgan Watkins, associate director of
Academic Computing and Instructional Technology Services at the
University of Texas. ``Viruses are nasty and can hit when you least
expect it, so get some life insurance _ it won't cost more than
$100. And it's a reality of the computer age.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 years ago, however, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was still a fledgling community of computers, with
barely a dozen computer viruses running through the system. And
back then, the viruses packed more attitude than punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them just carried annoying messages,'' Watkins said.
``One gave me chills _ it had a `Welcome to your worst nightmare'
feel to it. Another one promoted legalization of marijuana. But
they were more irritating than malevolent.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. In the span of a decade and backed by the
Internet's explosion into a vast global network, computer viruses
have become too numerous to count.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,000 new viruses are created each month, according to
Roy Jenevein of Austin-based HighPoint Technologies Inc., which
makes software that recovers data lost to viruses or other
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   A virus is a string of computer codes that infiltrates a user's
software or memory. Most viruses stay dormant until the computer
tries to carry out a certain task _ and when it does, the virus
takes over and feeds the computer a series of harmful instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A successful virus _ one that does something really nasty _
wouldn't show its true self for some period of time,'' Watkins
said. ``That way, people are unaware that they're infected and it
spreads to more and more machines before being triggered.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, words in some documents might suddenly become
gibberish; at worst, the virus could block access to any files
saved on the machine or make it impossible to even start the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the so-called Win32/CIH virus in UT's computer system
put at risk years of professors' research, the dissertations of
graduate students and even the university's records. Gone
undetected, it could have rendered thousands of machines useless,
Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a day and a half to warn everyone _ that's not much
time,'' Watkins said. ``But I think we got people to read our
messages, and most people weren't affected. We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Viruses can attach themselves to specific programs _ like word
processing software or spreadsheets _ or can infect disk or CD-ROM
drives. Jenevein said they don't often eliminate data from
computers, but they hide it so the system can't access any files.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the most common way of spreading a virus is by
attaching an infected file to an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses are getting smarter and quicker,'' he said. ``And they
don't give you tips about their nature _ they hit abruptly, and
that's it. Once you've opened an (infected) e-mail, it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters are e-mail hoaxes that make it challenging
for users to differentiate between fact and fiction. One widely
circulated _ and, experts say, false _ e-mail claims that opening
any e-mail entitled ``Good Times'' will automatically erase that
computer's hard drive, and it cites Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates as
its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hoaxes out there, but unfortunately, there's
no way to really know,'' Jenevein said. ``If someone says to watch
out for a certain virus, and you aren't sure about it, the safe
thing is not to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the fact that computer viruses can grow and
multiply as fast as their biological counterparts, Watkins said
they're far from being users' most prevalent problem. Bugs in
software or hardware can freeze the screen, forcing users to
restart and lose any unsaved work.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins recommended that both home users and businesses take the
time to back up important files by either saving to diskettes, or
printing the documents.
</P>
<P>
   But, with a laugh, he noted that nothing, not even a computer
virus, is as deadly to data as a simple human error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you are your own worst enemy,'' he said. ``How many
times have we thrown something in the trash we wish we hadn't, or
deleted the wrong paragraphs? It happens all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely learned that the hard way.''

As I struggle, I remember reading somewhere that what really
separates humans from animals is the fact that we have opposing
thumbs. It made sense at the time, but looking back on it, I'm not
so sure. When was the last time you and your opposing digits

 &HT;    Money Talk: Focused funds are mutuals' fad of day
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The people who sell mutual funds keep coming up with
seductive concepts to get you to invest. Some of those approaches
actually work. Some are no more than gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others that might well be both a good idea and a
good investment, which brings us to focused, or concentrated funds.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind focused funds is beguiling: Instead of
spreading a mutual fund's investments over scores or hundreds of
stocks, the manager concentrates the money in 20 or 30 stocks.
After all, the sales people say, nobody wants to buy the manager's
20 or 30 second-best ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Focused funds are the wave of the present. Morningstar, the
Chicago-based financial publisher, counts 100 diversified, domestic
stock funds that hold 30 or fewer stocks. A full one-third of them
were founded in the last 2 1/2 years. They are, says Morningstar
senior analyst Michael Stout, ``the fund fad of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stout has studied the trend with great care, and his conclusions
are worth listening to:
</P>
<P>
   ``To sum it all up, if you want to buy a concentrated fund, you
better make sure the manager is a very good stock picker,'' he
said. ``You can't take a mediocre stock-picking strategy, slap a
focused format on it and expect it to do any better.''
</P>
<P>
   So how come they are becoming so popular, or at least more
numerous?
</P>
<P>
   Stout's theory is investors -- paying more attention as they
pour money into retirement funds and the like -- have come to
realize most funds don't do as well as the S&AMP;P 500. In turn, mutual
fund families are looking for ways to improve their performance and
lure those customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea of concentration with just a few super stocks has a
lot of intuitive appeal, and it's probably easy to sell,'' Stout
said. ``Fund companies are always looking for new fund ideas to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a momentum factor. ``As fund companies see
other companies coming out with focused funds, they start their
own,'' Stout said. It helps, he added, that some of the focused
funds have impressive records.
</P>
<P>
   So how, then, do investors pick a good one?
</P>
<P>
   Stout's suggestion is to rank small-portfolio funds by 10-year
returns, checking how each fund's average annual results compare
with competitors with similar goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table shows the six funds that scored highest on that scale.
It excludes funds now closed to the public, and it excludes sector
and international funds.
</P>
<P>
   Note this is a first step -- a sorting rather than a selection.
``Now you have to research each of these funds,'' Stout said. ``You
make sure the fund manager is still there, and he's not 65 years
old. And look at the style of the fund, whether it is something
that appeals to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, top fund on the list, Oppenheimer Quest Capital
Value, has been managed by Jeff Whittington only since January
1996. Over the last three years it has returned 13.9 percent a
year, according to Morningstar. That's 14.9 points below the S&AMP;P
500. You might still like the fund, but it would behoove you to
look at it more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   A second consideration is Stout's methodology excludes a raft of
younger funds, some of them from well-respected managers and fund
families.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's FundInvestor, a monthly magazine, reports Ralph
Wanger's Acorn fund family is opening the Acorn Twenty, a U.S.
fund, and the Acorn Foreign Fifty. The latter will spread itself
among 40 to 60 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, SunAmerica has started a Style Select Series Focus
fund, which will invest in the 10 top choices of Elizabeth
Bramwell, Sig Segalas and Tom Marsico.

 &HT;    TNotebooks have crisis of proportions
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There is in human nature a battle between big and
small, the fascination with what is tiny vs. the awe of bigness.
</P>
<P>
   Some things get cooler as they get smaller. Wireless phones,
silicon chips, quarks, Thumbelina. And, of course, we want some
things to be as big as can be: pro football linemen, Godzilla, the
World Trade Center, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Technology -- natch -- is only too happy to oblige either
impulse.
</P>
<P>
   You want a sport-utility vehicle the size of a township? You
plunk down a few months salary and it's yours. You want a miniature
speaker for your stereo? No problem. Sometimes we want smaller,
sometimes bigger.
</P>
<P>
   But now, notebook computers seem caught between the competing
urges.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the very existence of notebooks seems proof that
people need smaller, lighter computers. The only limit to building
smaller ones seemed to be the size of people's hands -- keyboards
had to be large enough to give us a fighting chance at typing. And
you recall the original notebooks with their three lines of
semi-legible type.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, notebooks are trying to grow at the same time they
maintain their portability. More specifically, many notebooks are
being made with larger screens -- up to 15.1-inch displays. The
user gets a better picture, often with souped-up sound and graphics
as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the result for those models -- increasingly defining the
high end of the market -- are notebooks that are larger and
heavier. Some even check in at 10 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the July issue of Mobile Computing &AMP; Communications,
reviewers took on 16 notebooks, each with displays measuring 13.3
inches or more diagonally. Among the machines tested:
</P>
<P>
   -- AMS Tech's Rodeo 3040ECX draws praise for speed and ability
to support several storage devices. However, sigh the reviewers, it
is large and heavy and the display is ``a bit dull.'' For
information on the $3,900 notebook, call the company (626-814-0782)
or visit its Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .amstech.com).
</P>
<P>
   -- IBM's ThinkPad 600, a $4,934 notebook, is fast, thin and --
at 6.5 pounds -- light of weight in the large-display category,
according to reviewers. For more information, call the company
(1-800-426-7255) or visit its Web site (http://www.ibm.com
</P>
<P>
   /thinkpad).
</P>
<P>
   -- Hewlett-Packard's OmniBook 4100 also won generally good
reviews. The $4,274 machine is thin, performs well and offers both
good display and long battery life, reviewers say. For more
information, call the company (1-800-322-4772) or visit its Web
site (http://www.hp.com).
</P>
<P>
   -- VisionBook Pro 7590 from Hitachi costs $4,134 and performs
well, reviewers say. Unfortunately the keyboard is poorly designed
and the battery anemic by comparison to other Pentium notebooks.
For information, call the company (1-800-555-6820) or visit its Web
site (http://www.hitachipc.com).
</P>
<P>
   Using your thumb to travel
</P>
<P>
   Just how you get from place to place is a very personal,
idiosyncratic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether you prefer car, bus, taxi, plane, train or
foot power. How do you navigate across the frontier of the screen
in your personal computer? Most PC users started with typing the
complex codes needed for DOS. Thanks to folks like Apple Computer,
the much quicker mouse with the more user-friendly interface became
common. (Although Xerox scientists are generally credited with the
invention.)
</P>
<P>
   A California outfit now suggests that the truly ``natural,
intuitive link between people and computers'' is really the
thumb-operated trackball.
</P>
<P>
   Logitech, which is based in Fremont, Calif., says its TrackMan
Marble is a more advanced cousin of the trackballs used in many
laptop computers. The device results from four years of research
and uses ``advanced optics and neural network logic'' to detect
movement and pass along the information to the computer, according
to Logitech. The result, the company claims, is a control of the
cursor that is fast and precise.
</P>
<P>
   The device also has three mouse buttons, which can be
customized, letting you assign a function to a button. Traditional
trackball technology is subject to problems with dust, as well as
chemical reactions between metal and oil or with the user's skin,
Logitech says.
</P>
<P>
   The TrackMan Marble works with IBM-compatible systems and
requires Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT for scrolling, although
it can be used as a standard mouse with Windows 3.1. Unfortunately,
TrackMan Marble is not yet engineered to be compatible with Apple,
the original user-friendly computer.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested list price for the device is $80.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the company's sales office in North
Miami Beach (510-795-8500) or visit the company Web site
(http://www.logitech.com).
</P>
<P>
   Code or Kierkegaard?
</P>
<P>
   Programming over Proust. That's the conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   It is assumed by many that the route to the techiest of the
high-tech jobs passes through a university's engineering or
computer department or some trade school equivalent. It does seem
logical, after all, that computer programming courses are the path
to computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Ullman, a software engineer and author, says that is
the exact wrong way to produce the next generation of great
techies.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece in The New York Times, Ullman argues that
the very idea of a computer science degree is relatively new and
may be misguided. She notes that no one can teach tomorrow's
programmers what the cutting edge will be, since it doesn't exist.
More importantly, she says old-style educations were well-suited to
training someone for an industry that was in constant flux and
frequent revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we knew was how to learn, which is all that one can hang
on to in a profession in which change is relentless. The generation
of programmers who followed us were, well, disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't seem to have a clue about anything but
computers, she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman is author of ``Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its
Discontents,'' whose title is itself a reference to a certain
well-known work read by many students in liberal arts. Ullman says
schools should stress subjects ``that foster a flexible and open
mind,'' rather than the latest skills, which will become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is education in the broadest sense, she wrote.
``Programmers seem to be changing the world. It would be a relief,
for them and for all of us, if they knew something about it.''

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ Becoming a millionaire is surprisingly easy. Any
American teenager with average intelligence and decent health can
plan to retire with more than $1 million in assets. An article in
the August/September issue of The Futurist magazine lays out the
simple guidelines for retiring rich. (Geewax, Atlanta

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH _ Last month, speaking at the
89th annual NAACP convention in Atlanta, the group's president and
chief executive officer, Kweisi Mfume, called the justices of the
Supreme Court hypocrites when it comes to matters of diversity. His
words struck a resounding chord with me because the NAACP fought
for the comforts of my existence, from equal pay as a teacher to
access to public accommodations. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post)

   LANE-COLUMN _ The Beach-Dude Way is to hang loose and not hassle
anyone. Like all the world's great systems of social philosophy,
The Beach-Dude Way has its enemies and detractors. And its newest
enemies are making its mellowest practitioners testy. Beachgoers in
Florida complain increasingly that they are stalked by enemies of
The Beach-Dude Way. From Daytona Beach. By Mark Lane. (Lane, )(k)

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ All that
stands between me and relief are the gel capsules inside that
little bubble - the one I'm holding between thumbs and forefingers.
As I struggle, I remember reading somewhere that what really
separates humans from animals is the fact that we have opposing
thumbs. It made sense at the time, but looking back on it, I'm not
so sure. When was the last time you and your opposing digits
successfully ripped into a little silver packet that instructed you
to ``tear here''? Does this sound familiar? (Schuett, Cox News
Service) (k) MOVED.

<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ I'm furious with Hillary. I'm thinking, ``How
could she? Why did she?'' It's unfair, I suppose, to turn so
quickly on a woman whom I have always held in such high regard. And
if ever Hillary needed a good friend, it is now. But part of my
anger is so simple, really, so basic. She's not living the life
she's telling us to lead. She's not leading the life she deserves.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Richard Nixon turned in the
doorway of the Marine helicopter and gave his two-armed victory
salute just before he was whisked away from the White House.
Actually, it remains an open question whether Clinton serves out

   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA- What is the impact of the Clinton sex
saga on American culture and politics? Or is this baby-boomer

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Free e-mail offers good in most cases
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Despite grumbling from old-time Internet users, some
of the best things on the Net are still free.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, some things that weren't free in the old days --
e-mail, for instance -- are available from a number of sources
without paying a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be clear, most of the free e-mail services require you
already have a way to connect to the Internet. There are exceptions
but, most commonly, these services are most often used by people
who already have access to the Net at school or work.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush then, the idea seems dumb. If you have access to
the Net already, you probably have the ability to send e-mail. So
why sign up for one of these free services?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're increasingly popular for several reasons: (1)
You'll get a permanent e-mail address that won't change the next
time you change Internet providers; (2) For those who have access
to the Net only through work or school, it's a way to send and
receive e-mail privately; and (3) Even if you have trouble
accessing your Internet provider while traveling, these services
will be available from any computer that can log on to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally dozens of free e-mail services, and the list
grows by the week. Our first stop will be at a service called Hot
Mail. Now while that may conjure up images of, uh, steamy e-mail,
Hot Mail is provided by Microsoft. You can find out about the
service at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .hotmail.com/. Then, if you like what you see, you can sign up
at the same address.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, signing up is easy, unless you mind answering a few
questions about your income and level of education. You should be
able to complete the questions in about two minutes, and your new
e-mail address will become effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, which is known best for its search engine, also offers
free e-mail. The system is so similar there's no need to go into
detail. Just go to Yahoo! at http://www.yahoo.com/ and look for the
link to the free e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing you'll notice immediately about all the
Web-based e-mail systems. All of them seem to work the same way.
But if you're shopping for an e-mail service, take the time to read
about the extras offered. Besides free e-mail, some of the sites
offer an electronic filter that will remove some (but not all) junk
e-mail; others have free reminder services (for instance, sending
you an automatic note to remind you it's time to start shopping for
an anniversary gift).
</P>
<P>
   At Bigfoot.Com (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .bigfoot.com/), you'll be offered these types of features as
well as a free auto-responder. What's that? It's a program that
automatically responds to your e-mail, even when you can't. For
instance, when you're on vacation, you could set the auto-responder
to thank the sender for the e-mail and promise to respond when you
get back.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other free e-mail services, but -- unless
you would enjoy making a lifetime project out of testing each one
-- most people will be pleased with one of the services already
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But what about folks who don't have Internet access? None of the
services that we've discussed will help in a case like that.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the original free e-mail providers, Juno, not only
gives you a free e-mail account, it also gives you a way to connect
-- usually through a local telephone number -- free. There are just
two catches -- and considering the fact you won't pay a cent to use
Juno, they don't seem out of line: (1) You'll have to put up with
the advertising that bombards all Juno e-mail customers each time
you connect; and (2) While your e-mail address will let you send
and receive any Internet mail, your free Juno account doesn't
entitle you to any other Internet services such as Web browsing.

office at West Boca Medical Center, Jacobson is surrounded by
acolytes. They are the parents of children with cerebral palsy and
brain damage, and they believe in his magic. They sing his praises.

Some can't even smell it or taste it. But you can feel it. ``It's

Manager Dean Zehnter said. Trying to pinpoint exactly what is in
the air at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's headquarters and many

At home, dispatchers' screens would have displayed their address

investment, which brings us to focused, or concentrated funds.

   MACNEWS _ Ascend, based on a philosophy of life management, is a

in most Mac personal information managers such as Claris Organizer,
Now Up-To-Date (soon to be renamed Eudora Planner) and Consultant.
Still, those who value the emphasis on life goals might like
Ascend. The program holds true to that philosophy, which isn't the
case for any other personal information manager. (Haddad, Atlanta

 &HT;    Mac News: Ascend personal manager doesn't quite measure up
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ascend, based on a philosophy of life management, is a popular
personal information manager among PC users. The Mac version,
though, works and feels like an afterthought by the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   It's buggy and missing some major features now standard in most
Mac personal information managers such as Claris Organizer, Now
Up-To-Date (soon to be renamed Eudora Planner) and Consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who value the emphasis on life goals might like
Ascend. The program holds true to that philosophy, which isn't the
case for any other personal information manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the philosophy asks you to think deeply about
what's important to you and then prioritize your life accordingly.
That is, if you want to be a writer, focus on writing well and not
on how many things you write.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is the software incarnation of this philosophy. The
program asks you to think about your values, prioritize them and
then come up with a plan to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend translates your plan into a series of tasks you can check
off day to day and keep track of your progress toward the greater
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the deeper look at scheduling, Ascend includes a
journal feature. It lets you record your daily thoughts and
feelings. This is not a feature unique to Ascend, since many other
personal information managers now include journals.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of today's personal information managers, Ascend
includes a calendar, a to-do list and an address file. To-dos and
notes can be linked to contacts and contacts linked to to-dos.
</P>
<P>
   The program also lets you store random bits of information such
as a Social Security number or a password. But this feature is not
well integrated into the rest of the program. You can't link these
tidbits of information to contacts or to-dos.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't find in Ascend is a menu bar icon that lets you
quickly enter new items without launching the program. Organizer,
Consultant and Now Up-To-Date all have this feature.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a number of annoying bugs. The calendar doesn't
open up on the current day, and the feature designed to let you
import addresses from another personal information manager doesn't
work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Franklin Covey, Ascend 4.1 retails for about $100.

AND HOW ABOUT THE LINCOLN-FORD-MERCURY MEMORIAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a lot of hand-wringing in Washington these
days about how to keep Social Security afloat when the baby-boom
generation hits retirement age. I'm pleased to report that I have
the answer: corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   I got the idea from Ralph Lauren. You know Ralph Lauren. He's
the tan guy in a T-shirt who is always surrounded by beautiful
women. The New York designer recently shook off his entourage to
join President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren earned a spot on stage with the Clintons by pledging $13
million to restore one of the museum's treasures: the flag that
inspired ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Francis Scott Key wrote a
poem, which later became the national anthem, after the flag
survived the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore
during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star-Spangled Banner was an inspiration to Francis Scott
Key, it's been an inspiration for me, and I want it to be an
inspiration for future generations,'' Lauren said in announcing his
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lauren doesn't write poems. He designs clothes, and
his flag sweaters are one reason that his company, Polo Ralph
Lauren, reported net revenues of nearly $1.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The product tie-in is obvious, but just in case anybody missed
it, the president gave Lauren's sweaters a big fat plug at the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most of us have _ well, maybe not most of us, but a
lot of us, including Hillary and me _ have those great Polo
sweaters with the American flag on it,'' the president said. ``I
wish I had one with the Star-Spangled Banner on it, because that's
the gift that he's given America today.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought you had to be tan, have tousled blond hair and live on
Cape Cod to wear those sweaters, but I think Clinton is on to
something with this cash-for-commercials program. He just didn't
take it far enough. How much do you think Lauren would have given
if Clinton had agreed to call the flag the ``Polo-Spangled
Banner''?
</P>
<P>
   We could do the same thing at the Washington Monument, where
Target is underwriting another restoration effort. Why not? Nearly
every sports facility in the country is already known by its
corporate sponsor. If we can have a United Center and a USAir
Arena, why can't we have a Target Washington Monument?
</P>
<P>
   Think about the possibilities. The Lockheed Martin Pentagon. The
Archer-Daniels-Midland Agriculture Building. The Excedrin/Maalox
Internal Revenue Service Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could announce the new corporate sponsors at a briefing
in the 1-800-FLOWERS Rose Garden, behind the Sherwin Williams White
House and near the Turf Builder South Lawn. (Victoria's Secret
might want to get in on the White House action, too, but I don't
think they'd make the approved bidders list.)
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on the Capitol would surely go sky high. Maybe we could
call it the NRA Dome in exchange for payments from the National
Rifle Association. If Democrats take charge, they could call the
entire Capitol complex Tort Village in honor of the Trial Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't just have to be buildings that get corporate
sponsorship. I'm sure the Walt Disney Co. would have picked up the
tab for Clinton's recent China trip if he had called it the Mulan
Tour. Guinness breweries and Stolichnaya Vodka could underwrite
forays to Ireland and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam Hussein acts up again, we could launch Operation
Ex-Lax, the mother  &QL;  &UR;

PUTTING A GUILT TRIP ON GUILT-TRIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pat Robertson hasn't thought of this one yet,
but it occurs to me every day: God's punishment for the liberal San
Francisco Bay area is liberals.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, it isn't earthquakes, fires or possible comets.
It's all those people with ``Commit random acts of kindness''
bumper stickers, the ones who commit systematic acts of
guilt-tripping for the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   The following is one example: On a hot Saturday not too long
ago, I bought a carton of Coors on sale at Safeway. In the parking
lot, a woman getting out of an expensive, nonunion-made Japanese
car looked at the picture of John Wayne on the side of the Coors
carton and said, ``John Wayne beer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, pilgrim,'' I said. ``It's on sale.''
</P>
<P>
   (I could have added that it's also good hot weather beer,
because it's the beer most like water, but I didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Republican beer,'' she snorted, as she went into Safeway,
owned by Republicans who laid off thousands of workers after a
merger a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I drove home seething with smart comebacks I could have made,
then drowned my sorrows in the insipid product of right-wing
brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous grocery-store guilt trip is one of the basic
Bay-area interactions. You can get nailed by a stranger for
anything from not bringing your own cloth bag to buying red meat.
If you buy veal, the call probably goes out for guilt trip backup.
</P>
<P>
   Most guilt-tripping is done with the simple glare. However, many
strangers, like the woman who didn't like John Wayne or Joseph
Coors, have the effrontery to lecture you.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who won't even shush their screaming kids.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't have a good response to the grocery-store guilt
trip. All I can think of is: ``Do I know you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up'' or ``Who are you, Jiminy Cricket?''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for right-wingers. They don't guilt-trip people for,
say, wearing Birkenstocks. They just laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For bigger sins, they call for comets from God _ which we can
deal with, as long as we have Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   There really aren't any conservatives or liberals anymore.
People are defined, not by coherent philosophies, but by who or
what they dislike.
</P>
<P>
   No one is open-minded, as liberals are supposed to be. So-called
liberals are just open about the things they mind.
</P>
<P>
   Like the woman yapping about Republican beer while at a
Republican store, they're maddeningly inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Wear a fur, and get lectured by someone in a jacket made by
slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Go hunting, and get shunned by people who buy meat wrapped in
plastic far from stinking feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   Light up a cigarette in your own home, and a neighbor will say
you're poisoning her children through the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a BMW, of course, and you deserve everything you get.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the list of things you have to feel guilty about
in the Bay area keeps getting longer.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to feel guilty about sex, though. Perhaps that
explains why Bill Clinton has visited the Bay area more than any
place in the world except that infamous little room off the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bay-area shoppers know enough to skip grapes, iceberg lettuce
and strawberries because it's better to be safe than sorry about
boycotts. Forget Hefty bags and other nonbiodegradable items made
from depleted fossil fuel resources.
</P>
<P>
   You buy that kind of stuff at Costco where nobody cares about PC
shopping, just good deals. You can engage in mass
crypto-consumption at Costco.
</P>
<P>
   And there was my most recent mistake. In a column last week, I
mentioned buying ``The Joy of Cooking'' at Costco, and a woman who
does publicity for an association of independent booksellers wrote
a full-page letter lecturing me for it. When I called her, she
lectured me more.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, it was Costco, and the cookbook fell into my cart by
accident, like the other $200 worth of stuff I bought there.
</P>
<P>
   This woman was doing a great job of PR, and she was doing it the
Bay-area way, by guilt-tripping a member of the press.
</P>
<P>
   I love my independent booksellers, who have soul and titles
Borders doesn't have, so I won't add to their problems by saying
how much money I saved by buying ``The Joy of Cooking'' at Costco.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe guilt-tripping will save independent bookstores and fossil
fuels, and keep people from drinking watery Republican beer. It
probably will work in the Bay area, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In my Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, by
J.E. Lightner, the noun ``guilt trip'' first appears in literary
sources in the 1970s. One of the first appearances of the term is
in Cyra McFadden's ``Serial,'' set in our own Marin County. The
guilt trip is our trip.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the beer and book police got under my skin, and this is my
way of working it out.
</P>
<P>
   I guess there's only one thing I can say to all you
guilt-trippers: Don't you feel bad doing it? You ought to.

PHOTOS OF TRAGEDY AREN'T TAKEN LIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assembling a newspaper is not an exact science.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a science at all.
</P>
<P>
   Each day's product is the result of hundreds _ maybe thousands _
of individual decisions ranging from what ads go where to how many
pages are printed to what goes on what page and with which picture.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one page of the newspaper subject to great
discussion and, often, heated argument. That is the front page.
</P>
<P>
   The decision-making process begins early and continues until the
last available second. Editors from all editions are involved, and
depending on the issue, the executive editor may be called in to
arbitrate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the care, concern and discussion, I can count on a
few calls each week about the front page. Readers want to know why
some stories made it and others did not. Some call with a list of
stories that they think were more worthy than those picked by the
editors.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram of July 13 and a
picture on the front page that showed the grieving aunt of Edna
Rodriguez. The 8-year-old girl disappeared from her home July 11,
and her body was found the next day. The July 13 photograph was an
excellent picture taken by Joyce Marshall. But it also showed in
the far background the child's body covered by a sheet.
</P>
<P>
   There was much discussion before the picture was printed.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few calls. No one argued that the story
belonged elsewhere, but they did believe that the picture was
invasive.
</P>
<P>
   I do not react well to such pictures, although over the decades
I've shot television footage of the same scene and directed
front-page placement of other, similar photographs. I also must
admit that I am more conservative in my present role than I was
when the decision to print belonged to me. But I am conservative on
this.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, I reacted to the tiny image of the child's covered
body in the background, which, for me, would have been the deciding
factor against front-page publication.
</P>
<P>
   I reported the reader conversations to the staff and questioned
whether these kinds of pictures are so common as to add little
information to the stories they accompany. Senior editors
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty in capturing a photo like this one by Joyce
Marshall is enormous,'' said Gregg Ellman, photo chief in the
Arlington newsroom. ``To begin with, you're dealing with a hostile
environment because of the crime involved, and carrying camera
equipment just makes you even more of a target for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was tragic,'' he said. ``As journalists, we are
supposed to cover the news. Unfortunately, more often than not the
news is not positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days we have to fight very hard with our own editors to
get high-impact photos in the paper because many of them are
running scared to put a photo of this caliber on their pages,''
Ellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Vetter, a Star-Telegram managing editor in Fort Worth,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had numerous discussions about sensitivity and invading a
woman's moment of grief before deciding that this was a wonderful
photo that captured the horror and emotion of a little girl's
death,'' Vetter said.
</P>
<P>
   The covered body in the background never came up because it was
a very small part of the image, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensitivity should always come into play; in this case, we
chose a photo of the aunt with a hand over her face, which gave her
a small measure of privacy yet still conveyed the moment,'' Vetter
said. ``But we can't go overboard and be too cautious. Sometimes
the news should horrify and disturb people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is a thoughtful and sensitive photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggle with taking the responsibility that comes with my
actions and the pictures I take and do not take,'' she said. ``I
weigh the cost the photo will have on the people involved and the
benefit to the reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware of my intrusiveness as a member of the media in
times of tragedy and emotional devastation and see too many times
the exploitation of this grief,'' Marshall said. ``I am glad that
we continue to question our decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   I found her description of the scene that day particularly
telling:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived at the location where the child's body was
found, the first person I encountered was a very distraught
television reporter who had witnessed the scene as the police
discovered the body of the missing girl,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to tell a story with pictures, and that is what was
on my mind, while, through my own tears, I witnessed family members
collapse under unimaginable grief,'' Marshall said. ``Although I
stayed for several hours, I did not take many pictures or feel a
need to follow family members to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   One surprising thing you learn as a journalist is that people in
grief often are willing, sometimes eager, to share their grief with
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very fine line between public moments and private
ones,'' Marshall said. ``Eleven years ago my ideas were challenged
by a family who at the very emotional funeral of a mother and two
children _ immigrants from India who died a violent death _ asked
me to record their grief in its most painful and direct form.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would have backed off, they urged me forward, saying
they wanted their story to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisions first to shoot and then to print photographs like
this one are taken very seriously. You may not agree with those
decisions, and when you do not, you should call or write because
that helps us the next time.
</P>
<P>
   But the decisions are not made lightly, nor are they made _ at
least in print _ just to sell papers.

NEED SOME GOOD LUCK? TRY A HORSESHOE, OF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Superstitions and folklore continue to surround
us, even in today's learned society.
</P>
<P>
   One superstition that has to do with good fortune or luck is
hanging a horseshoe over the door to a house, garage, barn or
business.
</P>
<P>
   The first horseshoe-manufacturing machine was patented in 1835
by Henry Burden of Troy, N.Y. Back then, you were likely to find a
thrown horseshoe on any country or city road. Today, they're only
found in those areas where there is still horseback riding.
</P>
<P>
   If you come upon a horseshoe, legend has it that you must spit
on it after you pick it up, and then hang the horseshoe over your
door for good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Horseshoes hung over doorways were believed to keep the devil
and evil witches away. Why the devil? Legend is that the sound of a
blacksmith hammering shoes on an anvil attracted his attention one
day. The devil bought a set of shoes for his hoofs, but the
blacksmith, knowing who he was dealing with, nailed on red-hot
shoes without first cooling them down in water. Instead of driving
the nails around the outside of the shoe and hoof, he drove the
nails straight through the center of the devil's hoof.
</P>
<P>
   The devil paid for his shoes and left. After walking several
miles and dancing and prancing, the shoes became pure torture. No
longer able to endure the pain, the devil tore the shoes off his
hoofs and threw them away.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the story goes, every time the devil sees a
horseshoe, he turns and runs away.
</P>
<P>
   A horseshoe should be hung with the ground surface facing out
and the prongs pointing upward, supposedly so that your luck won't
fall out.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the right size molding or room before the door
molding meets the ceiling, you can hang your horseshoe with the
prongs pointing downward. According to superstition, if a horseshoe
is hung with the heels hanging down, good luck will flow down on
all who pass through the door.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel that a horseshoe doesn't go with your decor, don't
worry about having to hang it up. Another old bit of wisdom states
that if you find a horseshoe, it will bring you luck if you spit on
it and throw it over your shoulder. But beware of finding a
horseshoe without the nails still in it, as that signifies bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Or you just may want to buy a decorative interpretation in
silver or brass, and forget the spitting.

LOTTERIES MAKE LOSERS OF US ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There are 38 state lotteries in America and many,
if not all, try to ensnare customers by hyping the size of their
jackpot. Lottery players throughout the country could care less
about the hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lotto and the multistate Powerball, among others,
pull the same stunt. Last week, New York said its game offered a
$40 million first prize. The farther-reaching Powerball advertised
a $250 million prize and in the end exceeded that record-setting
amount by $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Should you have been the one singularly blessed to have
prevailed over supernatural odds _ 1 in 80 million for Powerball
and 1 in 12.9 million in New York _ your actual immediate winnings
would not have been the ballyhooed $250 million or $40 million, but
a sum in the range of half of that. To collect the full advertised
amount, you would have to wait 25 years, and take your winnings in
annual installments.
</P>
<P>
   As 50 percent of such a payout is serious money, even for those
already wealthy, the question is why lottery operators insist on
using the higher figure when the lower one is impressive enough.
The reason is self-evident: To incite the kind of lottery mania
that infected many people this past week as they traveled far from
their homes, to stand hours in line, to buy a chance at the
Powerball fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the long-term payout doesn't come to the winner in
26 equal installments. If you grab the brass ring in New York, say
for an announced jackpot of $10 million and have opted for the
25-year payout, you would receive $250,000 the first year, before
taxes. Appreciably higher installments are not handed over until
the 15th year, when you would get $400,000, with subsequent annual
payments increasing by $10,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
   What New York state is doing is investing your winnings in an
annuity (something you rather might wish to do for yourself) and
dribbling out the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   But if, during the quarter of a century it takes to gain all
your promised winnings, your good fortune turns bad and you die,
your heirs inherit the high honor of paying up-front the taxes on
the remainder of the winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1996, however, players have been given the choice
of taking their prizes in a lump sum, generally amounting to about
half of the advertised prize. But it varies. For a time late last
year, it was down to about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New York is only doing what every other lottery that offers a
lump-sum payment does, which means that it should be rather
uncomplicated for all to indulge in simple candor and trumpet their
jackpots for their value at the time the numbers are drawn. Why not
make the payout over 30 years, or even more, and thereby enormously
increase the size of the jackpot that could be used to attract ever
greater number of players?
</P>
<P>
   It's absurd. The stark fact is that despite the odds, so many
people play this game. At the beginning, in the late 1960s, $48.5
million in lottery sales were made in New York; during the last
fiscal year reporting period, that figure was more than $4 billion.
In fiscal 1997-'98, nearly $2 billion was paid in prizes.
</P>
<P>
   New York Lottery took in $34 billion between fiscal 1967, when
the games started, and this past fiscal year. That provided $15.5
billion in revenues to the state. Of that amount, New York Lottery
Division spokesman Rob Hayes said, 45 cents of each dollar goes to
an educational account in the comptroller's operation, for use by
the state's schools. Forty cents is awarded in prizes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear just who plays the lottery, whether it attracts
players disproportionately from among those people for whom a buck
is consequential.
</P>
<P>
   New York Lottery says it aims its advertising at the average New
Yorker, and makes no attempts to target particular sub-groups.
Hayes points out that in 1996, Gov. George Pataki ``directed that
Lotto advertising reflect reality, and no longer show a winner in
his wading pool behind his huge mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's directive came after criticism of lottery
advertising by state lawmakers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money for education is a rationale that can serve more
than the state lottery, for it is a handy argument to extending the
scope of gambling under the battle cry of helping worthy causes.
The existence of lotteries, off-track betting parlors and Indian
reservation gaming halls paves the way for the introduction of
further activities, such as casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, what is being shunted aside is the idea that
government ought to pay for its operations through progressive
taxation, whereby the wealthy pay more than the well-to-do, and
they in turn pay more than those who make less.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be a strong sentiment running in this country that
gambling reflected a weakness of character. Of late, we've stood
that proposition on its head. Not for our betterment.

<P>
   No season brings out photographers like the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only because autumn is the most colorful time of year.
Spring, summer and winter are, in their ways, every bit as
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   It's also because no other season reminds us so strongly yet
sweetly that another year has passed, and it is the photographer's
lot to capture its fleeting beauty and to try to stop time in its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is doing so in a meaningful way. The fall is such
a popular subject that camera-laden tourists are as common as
squirrels. We are all familiar with this scene: a country road
winding into woods ablaze with golds, reds and yellows, and
somewhere in the picture, a weathered barn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you need only take time to consider the pictorial variables
at your disposal--grouped here into five areas--to return with
photographs that are personal and unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Choosing Your Subjects &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the media abound with predictions of peak foliage
viewing times. These are always tempered by speculation that it
will be an early or late fall, or that the year's colors may not be
at their best, because of insect damage or unfavorable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you choose your advice wisely, you would be mistaken to
equate fall with leaves alone. Fall is also a time for harvesting,
returning to school, migrating birds, changes in the weather,
preparing for winter, for towns and cities to reflect the season,
for outdoor portraits, for photographing lakes and fields--all
valid subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage, nevertheless, is deservedly high on any photographer's
schedule, and if your touring takes you through the woods at other
than peak times--most leaf watching is done on weekends--consider
what you have to gain.
</P>
<P>
   If you're early, the palette will include much greenery, and
you'll be able to show trees and single leaves in transition to
their autumn finery. If you're late, leaves will cover the ground,
and trees in various stages of undress will hint more strongly of
winter, perhaps creating unexpected patterns and interesting
contrasts between the vibrant and the dormant.
</P>
<P>
   A consolation to any fall tourist is that all species of trees
do not show their best colors at the same time. No matter when you
go, you're bound to find enough variety to satisfy all but the most
color-hungry lens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finding the Best Camera Position &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Often, the best angle presents itself immediately. You'll know
you have a shot, and finding the best vantage point will verge on
being an unconscious process. At other times, the subject seems
eminently worthy, but deciding on the approach confounds the
imagination. Then there are shooting situations between these
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   If you're driving and a subject catches your eye, stop and
investigate on foot. Although photographing through an open window
does not preclude good pictures, restrictions on your movements
severely limit angles.
</P>
<P>
   Your first instinct usually will be to take head-on, eye-level
shots. This point of view is the most prevalent and often the most
natural. But remember that the possibilities range from a worm's to
a bird's-eye view.
</P>
<P>
   You can lie on your back and shoot straight up or lie prone for
a ground-level view. If you need more height, try shooting from the
upper stories of buildings; in the country, go to a mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Composing the Picture &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A photograph is a section cut from the world and rendered in two
dimensions. The borders of your viewfinder separate the desired
image; making the exposure takes the subject out of its natural
context and places it in the frame on your film.
</P>
<P>
   A ``natural'' landscape would follow the contours of the scene.
Edges of the frame would lie between distinct pictorial
elements--between trees or leaves--and the horizon would guide you
in leveling the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Details can be suggestive of the whole. A leaf can represent the
season just as well as a mountainside of trees. Blades of fading
grass, ripened fruit, an abandoned plow, a pile of apple
crates--you can show them close up or from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Enhancing the Effect &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Choose 200-speed color film if you plan to shoot under bright
conditions; otherwise, go with the greater range of a 400-speed
film. For deeper colors, you can darken a blue sky and reduce light
reflections by using a polarizing filter over the lens.
</P>
<P>
   If your camera allows you to vary the aperture or f/stop
setting, overexpose slightly to bring out subtler hues, or
underexpose to give colors fiery prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Shutter speed may seem of little concern when your subjects are
rooted in the earth, but even a slight wind can set them in fast
motion. In that case, if your camera has variable shutter speeds, a
setting of 1/2SO of a second or higher may be warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Allow swaying tree limbs to paint a picture for you by placing
the camera on a tripod or other support and making an exposure of
1/4 of a second or longer. The crown of a large tree can extend 50
feet or more from front to back, so focus on the most important
element to put it in sharp relief.
</P>
<P>
   To create an unconventional but pleasing effect, throw the lens
out of focus. Colors will bleed indistinctly beyond their natural
borders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Creature Comforts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning long hikes through the woods, give some
thought to comfort and camera protection. Although you can slip a
compact point-and-shoot camera into a pocket, you might replace the
skinny plastic neckstrap that comes as standard equipment on most
full-size 35-mm cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With a somewhat wider fabric or neoprene strap, you'll have less
slippage and strain factors that grow in significance once you've
hiked for hours with a camera around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   A harness, consisting of a strap that goes around your back and
fastens to the camera, will keep the camera from bouncing around on
your chest and from getting tangled in branches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the non-photographic accessories you'll need are a
baseball cap with a broad sun visor, insect repellent and a
flashlight if your foray will begin late in the day. Wearing hiking
boots with soles that are not too worn minimizes the risk of a
fall, which can wreck your equipment even if it doesn't injure you.
</P>
<P>
   Stay off wet or slimy rocks, logs and roots, and don't cross
streams unless you can do so safely. As the season wanes, many
photographers go into hibernation until spring. So, while the
weather is still pleasant and the landscape full of life and color,
walk slowly and carry a loaded camera.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWERS &QL; :
</P>
<P>
   1.) B. Know things about your audience, like the culture of the
people in terms of race, language and religion. Understand the
attitude of the people attending as it relates to their reason for
attending and whether you are giving good or bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Know the size of the group, ages and experience in terms of
knowledge of your subject and position or status. This information
will guide you in knowing the level of detail you will need to give
as well as potential problems you should anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   2.) A. People have different learning and listening styles,
which include visual, kinesthetic (through experience) and/or
auditory. Those who learn visually like demonstrations, stories or
analogies, overviews at the first and an enthusiastic style of
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Those who learn kinesthetically like activities, opportunities
to ask questions, quizzes and participation. Those who have an
auditory style of learning like an organized talk with statistics
and facts. By including parts of your presentation that will reach
all learning styles, you will gain more buy-in from your audience.
</P>
<P>
   3.) A. Perhaps you are informing senior management on your
department's recent productivity levels. Maybe you are giving a
sales presentation. Or you might discuss recent losses to
competition with your view of the situation. Deciding the primary
objective helps you plan a targeted presentation.
</P>
<P>
   4.) C. There are times when a strategic approach is required,
such as developing a five-year strategic plan or presentations
targeted at long range objectives.
</P>
<P>
   5.) A. A tactical approach to a presentation is detailing the
ways to achieve an end result. It should include what skillful
methods you will use.
</P>
<P>
   6.) A. When you first begin gathering data you should find as
much material as possible without trying to judge what order,
category or relevancy it has.
</P>
<P>
   7.) A. A well-structured presentation should include an opening
that gets attention and a close that includes a call to action.
Both of these should not exceed 5 percent of your total allotted
time.
</P>
<P>
   8.) B. It is your choice whether to hand out papers before or
after your presentation. The decision is determined by whether or
not people need to take notes and follow along during your talk or
if the information can be reviewed later.
</P>
<P>
   9.) A. Tell the audience at the beginning of your presentation
whether or not you want to have them ask questions any time or if
you will take questions at the end. If you wait to answer questions
at the end of the presentation, be sure to prepare a statement to
bring closure to the allotted time.
</P>
<P>
   10.) A. When you are knowledgeable about your subject you can
give a credible, direct answer. Acknowledge a person's feelings in
order to defuse emotions implied in a hostile question.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCORE &QL; :
</P>
<P>
   If you have answered this quiz with a high score, 80 to 100, you
are thinking clearing and professionally. Your presentations are
well planned. I wish you continued success.
</P>
<P>
   If your score was 60 to 70, remember that giving a professional
presentation that gets the results you want calls for not only good
execution, but also careful planning ahead of time. Take note of
the questions missed and add the information next time.
</P>
<P>
   Below 60: Maybe you are not making many presentations at this
point in your career. Take note of the important concepts in this
quiz if you begin making more presentations and get started on the
right foot.

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ I like sweet potatoes, and always have. I like
their texture, their flavor and how they look. I like them baked or
boiled or cooked into pies, and I cringe when they are smothered in
marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I consume, at best, two pounds of sweet potatoes a year. And
each time I reacquaint myself with their earthy charms, I ask
myself the same question: Why don't we do this more often?
</P>
<P>
   Finding myself in Lima, Peru, I decided to look for an answer.
Lima bills itself as the City of Kings, but to root-crop
cognoscenti it is better know as the Spud Capital of the World. Few
cities can compete with Lima for the quality and variety of its
underground provender.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the home of the International Potato Center (known as
CIP), where scientists from 26 countries look for ways to improve
and promote a range of nutritious roots and tubers.
</P>
<P>
   CIP sees the potato as an answer to some of the world's most
pressing food needs. It is high in energy and vitamins, and easy to
grow. Indeed it has been a lifesaver through the ages. Sweet
potatoes grown in backyard gardens in the Philippines during World
War II helped keep American and Filipino prisoners from dying of
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have repeatedly relied on sweet potatoes for famine
relief, especially after typhoons devastated rice crops. Sweet
potatoes saved millions of lives in famine-plagued China in the
early 1960s; in Uganda, where a virus is currently ravaging cassava
crops, farmers are banking on the sweet potato to keep hunger at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all else fails,'' says Peter Ewell, an American economist
who heads CIP's Africa program, ``the sweet potato is always
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumption is down almost everywhere. The reason is not
taste or texture, but image. ``All over the world, people think of
sweet potato as a poor man's food,'' complains plant physiologist
Noel Pallais.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, farmers grow sweet potatoes as an off-season cover
crop, and feed much of the produce to cattle, pigs, or dogs. In
China, which grows more than 80 percent of the world's sweet
potatoes, more than three-fourths of the crop goes to livestock and
industry; only about 15 percent becomes human food, mostly for the
poorest sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are always proud to tell us that they aren't eating
sweet potatoes anymore,'' says Zhang Dapeng, a CIP plant breeder
whose native Szechwan province leads the planet in sweet potato
production.
</P>
<P>
   In a hallway at the potato center stands a glass case with some
promising options. From Peru come sweet potato starch, flour,
bread, and chips. From the Philippines come ketchup, jam, bottled
juice, and powdered soup.
</P>
<P>
   From Brazil comes a spicy snack food and bricks of sweet potato
paste. But by far the most ingenious collection comes from Japan:
candied cubes, salty balls, caramels and toffees, dark syrup, two
kinds of snack sticks, four kinds of noodles, and a perfectly clear
liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in Japan, sweet potatoes are losing their allure. Since
World War II, the land planted in sweet potatoes has plummeted.
Taiwan and Korea also saw production drop dramatically as their
economies boomed. Although the sweet potato still ranks seventh
among food crops worldwide, it's hardly at the top of its game.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Africa, where it is one of the few crops whose
production kept up with growth in population. In Rwanda, adults eat
about a pound a day. It was critically important in Uganda during
its recent civil war. ``You can drive tanks over it, you can leave
it for six months, and it's still there,'' says Ewell.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say people hold it in high esteem, however. ``It's a food
that you would never serve to guests,'' Ewell notes. ``It's the
macaroni and cheese of African cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Reynoso, a Peruvian plant breeder, says the potato is
high in Vitamins A and C -- nutrients in which millions of children
in developing countries are deficient. It provides half again more
energy, nearly twice the fiber and more than three times the
calcium of potatoes. The greens, which can be eaten by humans or
fed to animals, have a protein content about the same as alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes grow low to the ground, making them virtually
invulnerable to hurricanes and typhoons. They require few
chemicals, minimal water and almost no weeding. And they are
extremely productive.
</P>
<P>
   North Americans mainly know the Jewel and Centennial varieties,
with their deep orange flesh and brown skin. China is dominated by
a creamy white variety called Xushu-18. But Papua New Guinea claims
no fewer than 5,000 different kinds. Indonesia boasts about 4,000,
the Philippines 1,000, and Uganda 700.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes range from white to purple; some have lovely
kaleidoscopic patterns when opened. They can be as small as golf
balls or large as watermelons. Some are moist and sweet, while
others are dry and virtually flavorless.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are drawing from CIP's sweet potato gene bank to
improve productivity and address nutritional needs. In Africa, a
priority is to boost the Vitamin A content of the white sweet
potatoes that most people prefer. In Latin America, researchers are
looking for ways to ward off the sweet potato weevil, the crop's
most tenacious pest.
</P>
<P>
   The worst enemies of sweet potatoes aren't genetics or insects,
though, but memory and culture. Even in America, sweet potatoes
remind many people of hunger and hardship (like Thanksgiving, a
symbolic remembrance of a humbler past). Yet perhaps someday the
tables will turn, and the sweet smell of roasting sweet potatoes
will move us to rejoice in the generosity of the earth. In the
meantime, they deserve at least some thanks and respect.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
 &UR; A YAM IT'S NOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sweet potato and yam are unrelated. Yams have scaly skin,
sweet potatoes are smooth. Yams are tubers (like potatoes); sweet
potatoes are roots (like carrots). Yams rarely grow in temperate
countries. What Americans call yams are almost always sweet
potatoes. The confusion probably dates to slaves, who associated
the sweet potatoes in America with the yams they knew back home.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes can be found in more than 100 countries. In the
United States, more than half come from North Carolina and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia and the Pacific, sweet potatoes have been used to combat
asthma, constipation, sore throat and delayed lactation. In China,
doctors are investigating their usefulness against kidney, spleen,
and stomach ailments and some forms of cancer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't need a lot of time to boost well-being, ease stress,
maybe save your life. We looked at research on preventing illness
and found 20 strategies that each take ten minutes or less. What
are you waiting for?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Consider Popping a Vitamin-E Supplement &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final word isn't in yet, but a steady stream of evidence
points to vitamin E as a potent weapon against major health hazards
like heart disease and possibly Alzheimer's disease and some common
cancers. Women who took 100 to 250 international units daily for at
least two years were able to cut their heart-disease risk nearly in
half, according to Harvard University researchers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Replace Road Rage With Good Manners &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to lose your cool when you're stuck in traffic and
someone tries to cut in front of you. But instead of blocking that
person, do something nice. ``Performing small kindnesses is almost
certainly a health-enhancing behavior,'' says Redford Williams, a
professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center in
Durham, N.C. It helps you stay calm, preventing the release of the
stress hormone cortisol, which can raise blood pressure and
increase cholesterol levels, says Williams. With heart attacks as
the leading killer of women, you'll do yourself a favor when you
cut others some slack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Give Someone a Great Big Bear Hug &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A husband, kid, sister, friend. ``From birth on, humans need
touch,'' says Domeena Renshaw, a professor of psychiatry at Loyola
University of Chicago. ``It's a natural anti-depressant, and it
bonds one person to another.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Do Wall Push-ups for Muscle Tone &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many women have underdeveloped muscles in the upper body _ arms,
shoulders and chest. Upper-body strength training improves posture,
builds bone density (helping to prevent osteoporosis) and makes it
easier to accomplish everyday tasks like lifting a bag of groceries
or a child. Push-ups are effective, but many women can't do even
one. So try this modified version: Place your palms against a wall,
shoulder-width apart, and then step backward until the line of your
body from feet to shoulders is at a 45-degree angle. Bend your
elbows, and slowly lower your upper torso toward the wall until
your forehead is about an inch from it, then push back slowly until
your arms straighten. Repeat 9 times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don't Just Brush Your Teeth _ Floss Them Too! &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what kind of floss you choose as long as you
use it daily, says Kenneth Burrell, senior director of the Council
on Scientific Affairs at the American Dental Association. Flossing
removes what brushing misses: plaque between teeth that causes gum
disease. To get into the habit, Burrell advises, try flossing at
the same time every day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For a Healthy Snack, Peel and Eat an Orange &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting your five fruits and vegetables a day? Oranges are
portable and nutritious, containing several nutrients most women
need more of like folic acid (plus a little calcium) _ all this for
only 65 calories per medium navel orange. They also supply vitamin
C.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Smooth on Sunscreen (Everywhere) for Skin Protection &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to ultraviolet light can prematurely age your skin and
cause most common forms of skin cancer. Protect yourself every day.
For mostly indoor days use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen.
For outdoor days apply sunscreen liberally to all exposed areas
(don't forget the tops of your feet) at least 15 minutes before
venturing out, to allow the product to be absorbed by your skin.
Reapply every two hours or after perspiring heavily. For added
protection on sensitive areas like nose and cheeks, you can put
zinc oxide over sunscreen. Whatever you use, make sure it's ``broad
spectrum'' and has a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Help Your Diet Along by Walking Up the Stairs &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 135-pound woman burns about 15 calories in two minutes
climbing stairs, compared with three calories or so standing in an
elevator. That may not sound like much, but it adds up: if you take
the stairs five times a day, over the course of a year you'll burn
about eight pounds' worth of calories with very little effort.
What's more, you'll get a mini-workout that will strengthen your
thighs, calves and rear end in the process.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Down a Glass of Low-fat or Fat-free Milk &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An 8-ounce cup of skim milk supplies about 300 milligrams _ a
mineral that can reduce bone loss, helping to ward off
osteoporosis, in which bones become thin and prone to fracture. In
addition, research suggests that a calcium-rich diet may prevent
high blood pressure in some individuals. Don't like milk? Don't
worry. Non-fat yogurt has even more calcium per cup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Throw Away Your Old Toothbrush &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bristles become worn and lose their cleaning power after about
three months of use. So buy several toothbrushes at a time _ look
for soft bristles and a head small enough to reach your back teeth
easily _ to have on hand for a quick switch when your current one
frays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Concentrate on Breathing &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stress, tension and anxiety tend to make breathing faster but
shallower, increasing your heart rate and raising blood pressure.
Simply becoming aware of your breathing can help you return to a
more balanced state, notes Elana Rosenbaum, clinical coordinator of
the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at
the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester.
Whenever you have a couple of minutes _ standing in line, waiting
at a red light _ place your hand on your belly and just notice your
breathing pattern. Pay attention to the up-and-down movement of
your abdomen. When you find yourself in a tense situation, stop
what you're doing and ``go to your breath,'' recommends Rosenbaum.
If you focus on your breathing, whether slow or fast, you can quiet
yourself almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Give Yourself a Break From Your Computer &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staring at a screen for hours strains your eyes, wrists, neck
and, especially, your back. `'Sitting puts more pressure on your
back than standing or lying down does,'' says physical therapist
Benjamin Gelfand, supervisor of the Nicholas Institute for Sports
Medicine and Athletic Trauma at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York
City. At least once an hour, when you're working at the computer,
get up from your desk and walk around _ take a look out the window
_ or stretch. Try shoulder shrugs (raise your shoulders toward your
ears, hold for a few seconds and then slowly lower) and trunk
twists (stand up, gently rotate your upper body at the waist in one
direction, return to the center and repeat in the other direction),
Gelfand advises.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chat with a Friend &LR;  &QL;

   You might think those who are around lots of other people come
in contact with a variety of germs and get sick - often. Actually
the opposite may be true. When researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh exposed people to cold viruses, those with
the widest social network were the least likely to come down with
the sniffles. Other studies have shown that having friends you can
count on leads to longevity. So spend some time with your pals. You
might get it back in the end.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Schedule an Appointment for a Pap Smear &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors believe that every woman over age 18 should have
this test annually, yet one third skipped it last year, according
to a College of American Pathologists survey. The main reason: lack
of time. A pap smear can detect cervical cancer early, when it's
most curable. Death rates from this disease have dropped 70 percent
since the test was developed nearly 50 years ago, and today it's
mostly women who haven't had one in five years whose cases are
fatal. Don't put this test off another minute. (And if you're
worried about time, take some work with you to do in the waiting
room. Or try our two-minute breathing tip, and further improve your
health.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whip Up a Quick and Tasty Meat Marinade &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marinating chicken before grilling can block the development of
potentially cancer-causing substances that form when meat is cooked
over high heat, find researchers at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Lawrence, Calif. The recipe used in the study
combined olive oil, brown sugar, cider vinegar, lemon juice,
garlic, salt and mustard, but other studies have shown a variety of
alternate marinades will also work. Let your chicken marinate,
covered and refrigerated, at least four hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buy New Mascara &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We all know mascara lasts for ages, but if you use it for ages
you run the risk of getting an eye infection: Bacteria that are
normally present on the eyelids and eyelashes can be transferred to
the makeup container each time you reinsert the wand. Most brands
contain anti-bacterial preservatives, but these start to wear off
in three or four months. If you never use all of your mascara, try
getting a smaller tube or a trial size. Or buy your moisturizer
when mascare is offered as a free gift.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Always Buckle Up &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Halve your risk of dying or being seriously injured in a car
crash by wearing a seat belt each time you're in a car, says the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If everyone
followed this advice, the number of lives saved annually by seat
belts would more than double, from 9,500 to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Walk Around the Block &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking briskly for ten minutes a day can help prevent heart
disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some forms of cancer,
concluded a panel of experts from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine. Walking
is easy and convenient: Do it instead of driving to the video
store, or make it a family outing before dinner. Aim to accumulate
30 minutes or more of walking a day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eat Whole-grain Cereal &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's faster than standing in line for a muffin and probably a
lot better for you. Women who ate the most whole-grain cereal
reduced their risk of developing diabetes by about a third compared
with those who ate the least, according to a study at the Harvard
School of Public Health. One reason is that the fiber in whole
grains helps keep blood-sugar levels in check. High-fiber cereal
also fills you up _ enough to reduce the number of calories you eat
at lunch, reports another study _ so having whole-grain cereal for
breakfast may help control weight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Microwave Your Kitchen Sponge &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've cleaned up after cooking chicken. But now the sponge is a
perfect new home for salmonella. Don't toss it. Just rinse it and
pop it into the microwave for one minute. That's enough to kill
salmonella and other infectious bacteria, finds a study by Dean
Clever, professor of food safety at the University of California,
Davis. He suggests ``cooling'' your kitchen sponge daily. Make sure
it's damp first, and be careful when you take it out _ it will be
hot.

BOOK EXPLORES THE INTRIGUING WORLD OF THE IROQUOIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER RINGWALD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In 1990, I visited the Tonawanda Seneca
reservation in western New York to interview several chiefs and
leaders for a newspaper series on the Six Nations of the Iroquois
Confederacy. Quite naturally, they wondered, ``Why should we talk
to you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just here for a few hours; how can you understand us,
our history, our culture?'' several continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Fenton, when he studied us back in the 1930s, he lived
here for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Inwardly I groaned. Two years! I had to get to my next
appointment. But this mention of the abiding ethnologist steered me
to a remarkable scholar whose career stretched so far back that I
first presumed he was deceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I have been among the Iroquois people, I have been
told that I must see Fenton,'' reported Edmund Wilson, the critic
and scholar, in his 1957 classic ``Apologies to the Iroquois.'' He
called Fenton his guide and muse for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Now, still at it on the cusp of his 10th decade, William N.
Fenton has capped his career as dean of Iroquois studies with the
engaging, revealing, and massive volume ``The Great Law And The
Longhouse'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 786 pages, $70).
</P>
<P>
   Not all Iroquois respect Fenton's scholarship as did those
traditional Senecas. Many still smart over past disagreements with
Fenton, whose career included stints at the Smithsonian, as
director of the New York State Museum and as a professor at the
State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions always arise between the student and the studied,
particularly in ethnology and anthropology. Some Iroquois fault
Fenton for publicizing sacred ceremonies and betraying the trust of
his informants.
</P>
<P>
   But what is respect if not attention? Fenton's lasting
contribution, so evident in the volume at hand, has been to keep
looking at a people until he sees deeply into their culture and
history in order to explain those to outsiders. Further, past
Iroquois leaders have used Fenton's findings to renew ritual and
custom.
</P>
<P>
   With vivid images and direct language, Fenton brings the solemn
heart and soul of a people pulsing to life on the page, even for
the non-academic reader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1684, after an Iroquois force outwitted a French army, an
Onondaga speaker dictated terms in a famously brief and
distinguished oration. Fenton writes: ``In short, the speech, at
once satire, ritual sanction, and business, shoved the bateaux of
La Barre's sick soldiers off downriver to Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, he notes succinctly that ``cultures, like armies,
move on their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenton studs his accounts of even the smallest encounter between
the famed Iroquois diplomats and European invaders with details
from the diaries and letters of witnesses, as well as the memories
of descendants. When a female frontier prophet delayed certain
treaty negotiations with several hours of unwelcome prayer and
preaching, Fenton concludes, ``As an act of ill grace, nothing in
the annals of white and Indian affairs quite approaches Wilkinson's
performance before the Indian council during the Canandaigua
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   When the same talks were almost postponed in order to mourn the
death of an Oneida ancient, the chiefs justified an exception since
the man had been almost dead for so long. Fenton's wry comment:
``Having decided that the Great Spirit would countenance this
breach of custom, they went on with the council.''
</P>
<P>
   The author surrounds each moment, seemingly, with the grand
history of the 17th and 18th centuries, when scores of Indian
tribes and French, English and Dutch forces clashed, made peace and
jockeyed for position, riches and survival.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he sweeps history right up to our own threshold. Fenton
recounts visits to the Six Nations Reserve, a traditionalist
stronghold in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day, one could still sense the spirit of living history
as the old chiefs recounted the removal of their great-grandfathers
from New York state, how they looked around and discovered that
they numbered a majority of the (Iroquois) league chieftainships,
and how they rekindled the fire and reconstituted the league as a
local government on the reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His ethnological method, common to other experts, is both
profound and simple. Called ``upstreaming,'' it moves from the
obvious _ what can be learned from the living _ to historical
accounts. Similarly, Biblical archaeologists may ask a Galilean
shepherd the significance of an earthen mound before they excavate
it. This method worked well with the Iroquois, still famous for
their memories and oral traditions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Fenton reports that contemporary Senecas still
recite guarantees _ recorded in diaries but not in the treaty _
made by U.S. representatives at Canandaigua in 1794. He verifies
the reliability of the oldest Iroquois beliefs and legends by
noting that the 1799 teachings of Handsome Lake, a Seneca prophet,
have been preserved for 200 years through periodic recitations.
Their accuracy can be checked against Quaker missionary journals.
</P>
<P>
   Given this record, he writes, ``it stands to reason that other,
similarly kept and validated traditions in the same culture merit
consideration as oral history.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume could have been shorter. Its occasional
repetitiveness and the exhaustive detail may deter readers who
want, and need, to learn more of this ancient and powerful people
who still walk among us. The undeterred will be rewarded.

BON VOYAGE: LAFAYETTE OFFERS A TASTE OF FRANCE IN SOUTH LOUISIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ Want to lose yourself in the heart of Cajun
country?
</P>
<P>
   Consider changing your name to Thibodeaux, Fontenot, Landry,
Breaux or Arceneaux. Or how about Guidry? There are six columns of
Guidrys in the Lafayette phone book. But Broussard has it beat with
12-1/2 columns in the residential pages.
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette is very proud of being the hub city of Acadiana.
Brochures tout it as the ``Heart of French Louisiana'' and everyone
embraces the ``joie de vivre'' that is life in the bayou.
</P>
<P>
   The Cajun people who settled this area in the mid-18th century
migrated from Nova Scotia after a forced exodus by the British
crown. Separated from loved ones, the Acadian exiles found a new
home in French Louisiana, mostly between 1765-81.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized the Acadian story in his
poem, ``Evangeline.'' Here in Lafayette you can drive the
Evangeline Highway (Route 90), stay at the historic Evangeline
Hotel or bet on the ponies at Evangeline Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cajun French language survives in Louisiana. A waitress may
call a customer ``cher'' (dear), a band sets up to play a dance
called a ``fais-do-do,'' while visitors might be invited to attend
a pig roast, ``boucherie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cajuns seem to love a party. Downtown Alive! is a weekend
festival that runs 12 Fridays in spring (April-June) and fall
(September-November). Downtown shopkeepers sponsor the street party
at Jefferson and Vermilion streets that features bands playing
Cajun, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, jazz, and rhythm and blues.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers _ such as Isaac and Bertha Broussard _ take to the
asphalt to cut a rug as the other partyers enjoy a cold one and
wipe away the sweat. The Broussards, who have been dancing together
for 60 years, are decked out in bright-colored clothes and sport
more than a few strands of beads, which they share with visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of beer and soda ``pay the band,'' says Wayne LeJeune,
events and marketing coordinator for Downtown Alive!
</P>
<P>
   The new Bayou Bullfrogs of the Texas-Louisiana League show up at
Downtown Alive! to drum up support among Lafayette residents. One
of their coaches is Ron Guidry, a former New York Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Lafayette is getting a face lift, including the
construction of a $30 million federal courthouse and an $8 million
street improvement project.
</P>
<P>
   The main streets are wide and cobblestone. Inviting storefronts,
shops and restaurants also are getting a face lift in downtown
Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the library is the Children's Museum of Acadiana,
which is housed in a 1930s grocery store. Everything is hands-on in
this ``learning by doing'' museum. Built in 1987, the museum is
truly a community effort, and the directors work with area teachers
to tie in exhibits with school lessons.
</P>
<P>
   To get a feel for the history of the Acadians who settled here,
explore the Acadian Culture Center, a unit of the Jean Lafitte
National Historical Park and Preserve. A film chronicles ``Le Grand
Derangement,'' the history of the Acadian exodus from Canada. It is
a poignant film with haunting narration and music.
</P>
<P>
   Acadia was former French colony along the Northeast coast of the
Atlantic, including what is now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Prince Edward Island in Canada, and parts of Quebec and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Acadian Culture Center features artifacts from everyday life
of the people who settled this swampy region in south-central
Louisiana, raising cattle, rice and various crops.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, you might run across park ranger and self-taught
accordionist Phil Rose playing Zydeco music on his squeeze box.
</P>
<P>
   There are two living history museum/villages in the area:
Vermilionville, which is set on 23 acres on the Bayou Vermilion;
and Acadian Village, a folklife museum representing 19th-century
Acadiana, surrounded by 10 acres of gardens and woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Acadian Village, 200 Greenleaf Road, is open from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. daily. Admission is $6. Costumed guides lead tours of
structures dating from 1803 to the 1860s, and visitors can watch
women spinning cotton, a blacksmith at work and a craftsman making
Mardi Gras masks as they did in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Vermilionville, 1600 Surrey St., is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily. Admission is $8 for adults, $6.50 for seniors, $5 for
students (6-18) and free for children younger than 6. In addition
to a guided tour, there's a restaurant, daily live music and Cajun
cooking demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to go wrong with a meal in French Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Check out Mulate's Cajun Restaurant, 325 Mills Ave., Breaux
Bridge, La.; (800) 422-2586 or (318) 332-4648. The restaurant/dance
hall is open from 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and has a live band every
night. Everything is fresh and the specialties of the house are
catfish Mulate and stuffed crabs.
</P>
<P>
   The drive-in daiquiri bar is popular with locals, who don't
consider it an open container.

MIRACLES NEVER CEASE IN TINY LOUISIANA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND COTEAU, La. _ Some people might say that miracles happen
every day. At the Academy of the Sacred Heart in the tiny town of
Grand Coteau, a shrine stands at the site of a miracle that
occurred more than 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims are drawn to the Academy's second floor where they find
what is said to be the only shrine in the United States on the
exact location where a miracle has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1866 a young postulant at the academy, Mary Wilson, was sick
in the infirmary. She offered up prayers to John Berchmans, a holy
priest who lived and died in the 17th century. Nearly blind,
hemorrhaging and probably within hours of her death, Wilson was
cured after having a vision of the priest. (She died 18 months
later of a fever, before taking her final vows.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides the religious overtones that attract pilgrims, the
beauty and history of Sacred Heart draw 2,500 visitors in a town
about half that size.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1821, the school's main building was built in the
1830s. The architecture is Georgian, with bricks created from local
soil and cemented in a pattern known as Flemish Bond. The window
glass, imported from France, still shows dimples and waves,
evidence of its hand-blown origins.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the building are formal gardens, which were restored
in the 1980s. An alley of oaks, called Oakdale, runs from the front
gate of the academy to Grand Coteau. The trees were planted to
provide shade for the priests who made a daily walk from St.
Charles College to the cloistered nuns at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   The site also attracts its share of Civil War buffs, according
to local tour guides. During the Civil War, Union troops were
stationed at Grand Coteau, which is just north of Lafayette, and
skirmishes were fought in the area including the Battle of the Red
River.
</P>
<P>
   During a particularly loud skirmish a nun was said to have sent
out word: ``Gentlemen, please move your battle. It's disturbing our
class.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy found a strange protector in Union Gen. Nathan
Banks, whose daughter attended a New York Sacred Heart school.
Banks supplied the academy with staples from the commissary and
issued orders protecting the academy and its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 370 girls attending Sacred Heart, pre-school
through high school. Parents pay $16,300 a year for their
high-school age daughters to board and attend Sacred Heart.
Students come from all over, many from Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Coteau campus is the oldest continuous Sacred Heart
School in the world, according to development director Marie
Orgeron.
</P>
<P>
   Computers seem strangely out of place in classrooms that date
from the 1830s, but the girls still wear long white dresses and
march between the oaks during graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road from Sacred Heart, a newer business is making a
mark for the Grand Coteau economy. Catahoula's, named for the state
dog, is serving new Louisiana cooking in an old-fashioned, relaxing
atmosphere. The restaurant, which sits at Grand Coteau's only stop
light, is owned and operated by photographer John Slaughter and his
wife, Hilary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago (we) probably would have died on the vine
with this kind of restaurant,'' John Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 minutes from Lafayette, diners don't have too far to
travel to sample chef Daniel Landry's specialities _ Gorgonzola
stuffed angus tenderloin with sauteed oyster shiitake mushrooms or
grilled gulf shrimp with three roasted pepper sauces.
</P>
<P>
   The breaded breast of chicken with corn macque choux over
Cheddar cheese polenta wins hands down over fried chicken and
cheese grits _ typical fare from a small-town Louisiana truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   To get there: Take Interstate 49 from Lafayette, exit 11 to
Sunset/Grand Coteau on Louisiana 93. Turn right at the stop sign
onto Martin Luther King Drive. Catahoula's is at the stoplight at
Church Street and King.

TOUGH-GUY MOVIES LIKE `PRIVATE RYAN' MAKE IT OK FOR GUYS TO CRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A male tear-jerker movie is pretty easy to spot. It generally
involves competition _ which is almost always the way men in movies
feel safest in expressing their feelings for each other _ or the
threat of death, or a manly sacrifice. Some observers believe that
the shameless king of the genre is ``Field of Dreams,'' in which
not only is there a sacrifice (the compromise of adulthood), but
also someone comes back from the dead, and the boys get to have a
soul-healing game of catch. ``Field of Dreams'' is the
I-love-you-man ethos of the Bud Light commercials of a few years
back, writ large.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate men's tear-jerker film _ which happens to
combine at least two of these elements _ is ``Brian's Song,'' the
1971 TV movie. The defining moment is when Chicago Bear Gale Sayers
(Billy Dee Williams), tears streaming down his face, bellows ``I
love you, Brian Piccolo'' _ a tribute to his teammate (James Caan),
who died of cancer. It's probably still the fastest way to get a
group of guys to crumble into weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Such movies differ from traditional melodrama _ ``Gone With the
Wind,'' to use both a now-playing and classic example _ in that the
lump in the throat isn't directly evoked. The shell of masculinity
is preserved at all times, and the man's melodrama is usually set
in a macho line of work, such as those in the current bumper crop,
which includes ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Armageddon.''
Generally, the tears are massaged from a gesture or glance _ a
wounded Tom Hanks, raising a .45 to hold off an approaching tank in
``Ryan'' _ rather than the slow, satisfying build to Vivien Leigh's
``As God is my witness ...'' speech from ``Gone With the Wind.''
There is a riper, higher flow of adrenaline in both cases, but
standard melodrama is freer. Unlike the man's tear-jerker, the
situation doesn't always have to threaten the entire Free World.
</P>
<P>
   Ensemble tough-guy movies like ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The
Dirty Dozen'' and ``The Great Escape,'' in which the young stars
winked or grinned into the camera, upstaging each other in a show
of muscle and charisma before sacrificing their lives for the Good
of the Others, gave rise to the male tear-jerker in the '60s. These
movies could be looked upon as a kind of suspense film, because we
wondered who'd make it. And these films reinvented movie-star
hierarchy, changing the rules of who'd survive. In ``The Great
Escape,'' even Steve McQueen, self-contained cool embodied, doesn't
get out alive.
</P>
<P>
   The genre had vanished after John Wayne's constant single-handed
winning of World War II (and the old West for that matter) had
ceased to have meaning. When the war movie disappeared from the
scene, American movies shifted to a loner culture, and the nihilism
of the Vietnam era lent itself more to shock than pathos. The 1972
movie ``The Last Detail,'' starring Jack Nicholson as a lifer
sailor who awakens a part of himself after he transports a naive,
small-time criminal (Randy Quaid) to jail, borders on wresting
tears from us. But it strikes a deeper moral chord, and leaves us
to wrestle with a metaphor for self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   It took the '80s, and a repudiation of the on-screen code of the
leading man, to bring the real return of the men's tear-jerker
movie. The leading exemplar of this new male sob story is Mel
Gibson, whose combination of fragility and volatility finally
launched him into stardom in the ``Lethal Weapon'' movies. With his
clean-jawed good looks, Gibson had flirted with the big time with
such early-'80s movies as ``The Year of Living Dangerously,'' in
which his callow glibness and capacity for hurt made him seem the
first actor of his generation whose suffering didn't lessen his
machismo. When he stared at Sigourney Weaver in ``Year,'' he was
slightly awed by her. He didn't put on a passive male ingenue act,
gazing into the distance and waiting for her to come to him, like
the self-absorbed or overtly sensitive actors of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He's better in ``Year'' than perhaps in any movie since. In it,
he shows a side that men rarely displayed. Gibson didn't withhold
his feelings, and he wasn't a man of few words, a pose which even
Method avatars like Robert DeNiro still often held. Volubility and
a quick temper burn through Gibson at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in ``Lethal Weapon,'' he wrapped his volcanic baritone _
no actor gets such shadings out of such a normally reassuring vocal
range _ around the role of flamboyantly suicidal cop Martin Riggs.
Watching ``Lethal Weapon'' once, on a plane, I heard the sniffles
as Riggs confessed his anger and shame over his feelings about his
dead wife _ sounds that probably went unheard in the theater when
the film first ran, as the Goobers-rattling explosions and gunplay
made anything below a certain aural range impossible to detect.
Gibson's rages and melancholy, and his attachment to his partner,
Danny Glover, created a bond that had men slapping choked
high-fives of acknowledgment.

DESPITE CEASE-FIRE, RISING IRA VIGILANTE VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELFAST _ Andy Kearney was quick with his hands and didn't back
down from anyone.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard that the son of a woman he knew was beaten up,
Kearney went after one of the men who supposedly administered the
beating when he saw him in a bar. Kearney was not intimidated by
the fact that the man was a well-known senior figure in the Irish
Republican Army. In hindsight, perhaps he should have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of July 19, a group of eight reputed IRA men
appeared at the high-rise apartment Kearney shared with his
girlfriend and their 2-week-old daughter in the New Lodge section
of Belfast. The members of what is known here as a punishment squad
sealed off the perimeter of the building with military precision.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men burst into the apartment, where they found
Kearney lying down with his infant daughter on his chest. They
ordered his girlfriend to take the baby into another room. Kearney
was marched out into the hallway and summarily shot in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Before they left, the men ripped the telephone from the wall and
immobilized the elevator. In the time it took for his girlfriend to
run for help down the stairwell with their baby in her arms,
33-year-old Andy Kearney bled to death, one year to the day after
the IRA called a cease-fire it supposedly still observes.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet that destroyed an artery in Andy Kearney's leg has
also opened a furious debate over the sincerity of the IRA and
other paramilitary groups to honor their promises to end the
violence. The killing has embarrassed Sinn Fein leaders, who insist
that they cannot be held responsible for the actions of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant unionist politicians say that unless the IRA stops
its punishment shootings and beatings and declares unequivocally
that the war is over, its political representatives within Sinn
Fein cannot take their seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly
cabinet to be formed in September.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, for its part, believes that its cease-fire is solid. It
will not attack police, soldiers, or so-called economic targets.
But the IRA is still in business, as are its Protestant loyalist
counterparts. These organizations engage in extortion and other
illicit money-raising ventures. And they act as judge, jury, and
executioner in kangaroo courts they assert are necessary to keep
order because the police are not acceptable alternatives in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA beats or shoots people for what it calls ``antisocial
activity,'' an elastic term used to describe drug dealers, social
misfits, or somebody like Andy Kearney, who had the misfortune of
beating up the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   Glyn Roberts, spokesman for Families Against Intimidation and
Terror, a Belfast-based lobbying group, said that through the end
of last week, the IRA had carried out most of the 30 punishment
shootings attributed to Catholic republican groups this year.
Roberts said the two main loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster
Defense Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, had perpetrated
17 punishment shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the shootings, Roberts said, republicans have meted out
27 punishment beatings and loyalists have beaten 36 people this
year. Because punishment squads use cement blocks and baseball bats
with nails protruding from them, the injuries from punishment
beatings are usually worse than so-called kneecappings, whereby
victims are shot in the backs of their legs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political progress in Northern Ireland, rough street
justice appears to be increasing. Some people suggest that such
vigilantism has become more important to the IRA as a way to
maintain morale and to exercise control now that its volunteers
have nothing else to do.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Catholic republicans shot a 79-year-old man in North
Belfast. He was believed to be the oldest punishment victim of the
Troubles. It was unclear whether the shooting was done by the IRA
or the Irish National Liberation Army, a small splinter group. The
reason was also unclear. Royal Ulster Constabulary chief Ronnie
Flanagan said it was a case of mistaken identity. But neighborhood
residents said that the man was a suspected pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting a 79-year-old man cannot be justified, whatever the
alleged reason,'' said Roberts, whose group accuses the British and
Irish governments of turning a blind eye to the punishment beatings
and shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Kearney makes it impossible for the governments
to ignore the issue any longer. Under the terms of the Good Friday
agreement, which created the assembly and calls for cross-border
cooperation, any party linked to a paramilitary group can be barred
from holding office if that group violates the commitment to
nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionists who before Kearney's death seemed almost
resigned to the fact that Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness would become cabinet ministers now point to the killing
as a reason to oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders say that they are opposed to punishment squads
but are powerless to persuade the IRA to stop them. Sinn Fein
leaders repeat that they are not part of the IRA and cannot be held
responsible for its actions. But that is an argument they lost last
winter, when Sinn Fein was expelled from the peace talks after the
IRA allegedly killed two men.
</P>
<P>
   The man Kearney is said to have beaten and is believed
responsible for the attack on Kearney is an infamous IRA figure who
has survived several assassination attempts by loyalist hit squads.
He was also shot by a British soldier but survived.
</P>
<P>
   There is support for punishment squads in the poor,
working-class neighborhoods where they flourish. But the support is
hard to measure, given the inherent intimidation that accompanies
them.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say the IRA keeps its neighborhoods from being
overrun by hoodlums and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Kearney has a less charitable view of those who killed
her son. ``If they don't like you,'' she said, ``they dispense with
you.''

UNDATED: of acknowledgment.

<P>
   Bruce Willis evokes a similar masculine empathy. He broke
through in ``Die Hard,'' a precedent-setting action movie. Not just
for its plot, which has become the most imitated high-concept trope
of the last decade, but because it was the first action movie in
which the hero has to save the day, outwit sleekly outfitted
Eurotrash and reclaim the rights to his family. It's this
ingredient that the slavish copiers of the ``Die Hard'' formula _
including Willis himself in ``Die Hard 3'' _ neglect. It expanded
the threshold of masculine melodrama, because the battle with the
villains became an inadvertent metaphor for emotional maturation.
</P>
<P>
   Willis' anguish over rescuing his wife is as important a plot
segment as the Eagle Scout resourcefulness he shows in using
whatever's at hand to defeat the indistinct terrorists. It
redefines the ground rules of the adventure movie, because for the
first time, there's something real at stake: a man's future. This
introduction of melodrama to the genre let men in the audience risk
welling up as they watched, emboldened by the fearlessness of
Willis and his open access to his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gibson, Willis also used his popularity to take occasional
risks. He's better than you'd expect in ``In Country,'' playing a
whipped, dysfunctional Vietnam vet. He discards all the devices _
the half-smile that telegraphs craftiness, the gold-plated
smart-aleck delivery _ and creates real tension. He's unafraid to
show how lost he is. This wasted, adrift man, who's continually
aware of how weak he appears but can't hide it, still has a core of
dignity and resolve. There are glimmers of the tough, hopeful joker
he used to be. Willis is a limited actor, but he can bring
incredible power to a role because of his level of commitment. He
even shows a few hints in ``Armageddon,'' a movie so infatuated
with its own facility that there's barely a place for actors in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's when actors put their cool at risk that the male
tear-jerker really works. Robert Redford, who treats himself as if
he were Audrey Hepburn and uses the camera to dictate our responses
to him, isn't nearly as interesting or as affecting, not even in a
potential man's-man weeper like ``The Horse Whisperer.'' But Steven
Spielberg, working at the top of his form, builds a bigger, better
boys' melodrama with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' because it brings to
bear all those things _ competition, death, sacrifice _ that define
the genre. ``Ryan'' is so guileful _ barely a character or audience
member is left standing at the end _ that it may retire the male
tear-jerker for a while. No one, and no movie, could possibly
contend with it.

LEWINSKY CASE BUOYS REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH   AND DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans, who had begun to worry they could lose
control of the House this fall, now believe &UR;  &LR; the Monica S. Lewinsky
story has become serious enough to blunt the Democrats' momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans remain deeply divided over whether to use the
Lewinsky matter to attack the Democrats, or whether such a maneuver
would backfire, according to interviews with party members and
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Republican analysts are predicting many
Democrats will be disgusted or disinterested enough to stay home on
Election Day, helping the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a dampening effect,'' Republican pollster Linda DiVall
said. ``It makes it difficult for Democrats to communicate their
agenda since the news is so focused on this. Secondly, as people go
to the polls on Nov. 3, they are saying to themselves, `I don't
really dislike this Republican (congressional) incumbent.' There is
not the animosity that there was in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have proclaimed that the allegation that Lewinsky
had an affair with President Clinton will have no effect on the
fall campaigns. Democrats variously said that voters don't care
about the matter, that nothing has been proven, or that Clinton
isn't the person up for election.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, a growing number of Democrats are concerned that
the Lewinsky story will, at the very least, draw attention away
from the party's accomplishments and energize Republicans to turn
out on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   So far, independent analysts who track congressional races
cautioned that they have not seen an impact in any general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year is too localized for it to make a difference,'' said
Jennifer E. Duffy of The Cook Political Report. ``These races are
all about local issues. There is no overarching national trend. The
people are more worried about landfills than Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans prepare to visit their constituents this month,
some are eager to go on the attack. Senator John Ashcroft of
Missouri, who is considering a presidential bid, has frequently
questioned Clinton's moral character, like many other GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe it is best to let Democrats stew in the
controversy with no help from Republicans, thus keeping the GOP
above the fray. Indeed, while some Republicans have already called
for Clinton's impeachment, others said they don't want to begin
such proceedings unless there is overwhelming evidence that the
president engaged in a coverup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here for this stuff,'' said Representative David
Weldon, a Florida Republican. ``I came here for budget reforms and
tax reform. I don't relish the idea of taking this up, even though
I am a Republican and I oppose Bill Clinton's policies. I don't
want to see a president impeached, even a president who has done
some of the things Bill Clinton has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said the issue hasn't come up among constituents except
``among the Republicans that are well-informed.'' The GOP lawmaker
added: ``In my opinion, the majority of voters have been concerned
with economic issues, tax reform, keeping the budget balanced, and
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were reports last week that some Republicans are
developing a campaign playbook that relies on the Lewinsky story as
a major issue, top party officials said they are not following such
a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is going to be a factor in the elections,''
Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said, when
asked about the Lewinsky matter. ``I think that voters are going to
cast their ballots based on things they always do. They want the
issues that affect them personally _ things like tax cuts, the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Republican pollster Ed Goeas puts it, the best strategy for
the GOP is to ``just shut up and watch'' as the Lewinsky story
takes its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we enter into the fray, we do what the Democrats want,
which is to partisan-ize the whole process and give Democrats
someone to demonize,'' Goeas said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republican strategy does not dismiss the possibility
that the report delivered to Congress by the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, will result in impeachment hearings. If that
happens, Collins said, Republicans will cast it as the fulfillment
of constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing a theme that will be used by Republicans
throughout the fall, Collins said: ``We as individuals and as a
party have been very careful to say this is not a political
investigation. We are standing up for the rule of law and the
people's right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a midsummer snapshot taken during a mostly bad week
for the president may not be a good indicator of what will happen
in November. Indeed, it was just weeks ago that some analysts were
saying the Democrats had turned the corner and had a real chance of
retaking the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 228-206 edge in the House, which has one
independent, and a 55-45 majority in the Senate. While Democratic
officials say they have little chance of regaining control of the
Senate, they note that it would take only an 11-seat swing to
retake the House.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Democrats, Representative Ken Bentsen of Texas said he
has had few questions about the Lewinsky story from constituents.
People are more interested in the economy, even the smoke from
Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that some voters have become wearied or numbed by the
frequent stories about the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This latest bombshell is just one in a long line of bombshells
since January,'' Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Democrats who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the concern about the Lewinsky fallout is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is watching it, but nobody is talking about it,''
said a Senate Democratic official. ``I know this is right
underneath the surface that people are worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Ruben Hinojosa, Democrat of Texas, sounded
pleased that Clinton has decided to give his testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found a great deal of people saying they don't want
others messing with the president's private life,'' Hinojosa said.
``We have to respect that small percentage who are interested; this
is something that they have a right to know, and they will when the
president gives his testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnick, counselor to the president, predicted that the
Lewinsky matter would not have an impact on the elections and
rejected suggestions that the president has been harmed politically
by the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the Democratic National Committee funding, direct
mail, the events the president does around the country,'' Sosnick
said. ``I think you see a lot of energy and enthusiasm.''

WHY DO FIREFLIES FLASH AT NIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do fireflies light up at night?
</P>
<P>
   --M.T., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I thought fireflies appeared in late June or early July. We
haven't seen one this year.
</P>
<P>
   R.W., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What puts the fire in fireflies? The same thing that causes
many species to put on flashy displays: the mating urge.
</P>
<P>
   Entymologist Jim Lloyd of the University of Florida at
Gainesville, who's been studying fireflies for 36 years, says males
are the flashier flashes. ``They're saying, `Would you like to mate
with me? I'm a male of species X looking for a mate.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of the flashes identifies the species. Some have a
double flash that repeats every three seconds. Some have one short
flash that repeats at 10-second intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The females flash too. But they light up only once. And they're
perched, not flying. A male determines which single flash is coming
from a female of his species by the timing of the response to his
query.
</P>
<P>
   But just because she answers the male's personal ad doesn't mean
a relationship is established. ``The first female flash says `Come
a little bit closer and light up again so I can check you out,'''
Lloyd says. The female then watches to see how quickly the male
arrives, how close he gets, and other signals that humans haven't
figured out before deciding if this fly is her guy.
</P>
<P>
   If she's satisfied, she flashes back again. Then the lights go
out and the mating begins _ for most species it continues for
several hours. The next day the female lays her eggs. Most species
repeat the find-a-mate ritual nightly. ``Lightning bugs,'' as we
used to call them, light up between mid-June and mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Not all species spell out their desires in lights. Some
fireflies don't rely on bioluminescence at all, including three of
the 20 species that live in Massachusetts. They fly around during
the day looking for mates, sending out chemical signals. Then
there's the deadly female photuris firefly. She'll signal back to
males of other species that she is a female of that species willing
to mate. The guy fly buzzes over in the dark expecting to become a
dad, but the photuris female instead flashes her light just as she
strikes _ and the male becomes dinner.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 2,000 firefly species worldwide, in all sorts of
habitats. There are no studies confirming that fireflies are in
decline, but ``observers all over the country tell me that's what
they're seeing,'' Lloyd says. He thinks light pollution at night
may be one reason. ``That's noise to them, and might be affecting
successful mating.''
</P>
<P>
   Biology professor Sara Lewis of Tufts University says habitat
disruption may be a key factor. ``They're very habitat-specific.
Some fly only under a tree canopy. Some fly only along stream beds.
Some are restricted to open fields. And they don't disperse well.
The larvae don't crawl very far and the adults don't fly very
far,'' she says. As a result, even minor changes in habitat can
destroy a firefly population.
</P>
<P>
   This was actually a good year for fireflies, Lewis says, the
best in several years, because the moist spring was ideal for
firefly larval development.

   LEUKEMIA-OLDER-PATIENTS (Seattle) Treating older patients with
leukemia is an agonizing dilemma for physicians. Doctors can
increase an older patient's odds of a cure with aggressive
treatment, such as a bone marrow transplant, but the treatment
itself can kill the patient. That's the conundrum Seattle School
Superindent John Stanford has faced at each treatment decision
point in his battle with acute myelogenous leukemia. Researchers at
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have begun testing a
new-generation bone marrow transplant procedure that could one day
be used for older patients who aren't eligible for traditional bone
marrow transplants, and for others who are too sick to survive the
conventional bone marrow regimen. So far, six people have tried the
new procedure, which is not being done anywhere else in the world.

LEGAL CHAOS LEAVES CUBAN REFUGEES ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Immigration courts are filled with Cuban refugees. Jails
are packed with Cubans in legal limbo as judges, lawyers, and
prosecutors debate conflicting immigration rules. And while the
experts argue, scores of Cubans arrive by the boatload every month.
</P>
<P>
   All this might suggest that the immigration laws for Cubans need
sweeping reform. As it happens, though, sweeping reform caused much
of the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 30,000 Cubans arrived on rafts in the summer of
1994, the Clinton administration ended three decades of special
treatment for Cubans. No longer would anyone fleeing Fidel Castro's
Communist regime have an automatic right to become a US resident.
On the contrary, Cubans found at sea would be deported immediately,
just like Haitian ``boat people.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the theory. Most Cubans who are caught in the Florida
Straits these days are sent back in US Coast Guard cutters. The few
who make a strong argument that they face political persecution are
sent to the US naval base at Guantanamo, where they can seek asylum
in another country. Others, such as pregnant women who become sick
at sea, are often allowed into the United States. Still others, who
set foot on US soil, are usually allowed to stay and become legal
US residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's intent was to say that Cubans are not
Martians, Cubans are not to be put on a pedestal _ they are
supposed to be treated no differently than anyone else,'' said
Jorge Dominguez, director of Harvard University's Weatherhead
Center for International Affairs. A Cuban immigrant himself,
Dominguez approved of the change. But decisions about who stays and
who goes seem to be arbitrary, he said. And advocates for the
exiles say that even as Washington is worsening conditions in Cuba
by tightening the US embargo, immigration agents summarily send
back those who escape.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clara, in the middle of Cuba, Maria Elena Garcia could
not take it any longer.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trying, she had gotten pregnant and delivered a
girl in February. But the clinic that performed the caesarean
section had run out of surgical thread, and Garcia got infected.
Her husband, Roberto, could not afford to buy medicines on the
black market. His job as a gym teacher and basketball coach at a
school paid only 200 pesos, or $8, a month. Garcia's baby was
malnourished, her grandmother was sick from lack of vitamins, and
no one could earn a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   After secretly making preparations to leave, the family took off
from Cuba's northern coast on a 28-foot wooden fishing boat. The 17
passengers, who spanned three generations, carried the staples of
the Cuban diet of the '90s: bread, sugar, and water. These days,
getting out is easy because the Cuban border patrol boats rarely
have fuel. The Garcias knew that the United States no longer
welcomes boat people, but they didn't care. They had relatives in
Miami, including Maria Elena's brother, Juan, who had left in a
raft six years before and was doing well as a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Garcia recalls the adventure in fast-paced Spanish:
After puttering north for almost two days, the boat hit a rock and
water started to seep in. For hours, the passengers prayed for
help. Then they heard the buzzing of a powerful speedboat. It was
Juan, who had received a panicked call from Cuba saying his family
was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia acknowledges that the story sounds improbable, but she
says it is true. ``When we saw Juan, we all started crying,'' she
said. ``God is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Crammed with passengers, the boat ran out of fuel and was
spotted by the Coast Guard. Garcia and her infant daughter were
released to relatives in Miami because the baby was ill. The others
were sent back to Cuba _ except Juan, who was sent to a detention
center near Miami. He was charged with people-smuggling and,
because he was not a US citizen, he was also charged with illegally
entering the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smuggling! How much are you going to charge your own mother?''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   She is doing the paperwork that will allow her to stay legally
in the United States. But Juan, who worked long hours and never got
around to applying for US residency, faces deportation. Under
strict immigration laws enacted two years ago, noncitizens who
commit crimes must serve their time and then be deported. That
leads to a complication: Fidel Castro's government, which has
frosty relations with Washington, refuses to take back convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Penalver, an attorney who works with imprisoned
immigrants, says 1,600 Cubans who have served their time are
scattered in American prisons, awaiting deportation to a homeland
that won't accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cubans drifting in the Florida Straits on inner tubes
and rafts are no longer hailed as heroes risking their lives for
freedom, those fleeing the island want to make the 90-mile trip to
the United States as quickly as possible. Smugglers have responded
to the demand. Prosecutors say they have identified several
smuggling rings in south Florida that charge about $9,000 for each
adult they pick up on the Cuban coast or at pre-arranged locations
in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Cubans fleeing has accelerated this year because
drought and a low sugar harvest have heightened the sense of
desperation on the island. So far this year, the Coast Guard has
picked up 547 Cubans. Immigration officials say another 340 Cubans
have made it to shore _ often with the help of smugglers in
high-speed boats. Those numbers are more than twice the totals for
any year since the 1994 crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers pose a range of problems for US authorities. How
can prosecutors make a case if the only witnesses _ the passengers
_ are repatriated? Should there be a different standard for boat
captains who don't charge their passengers, such as a father who
fetches his children from Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many cases that we know in our heart of hearts are
good cases, but you pick these jurors and none of them want to
convict,'' said Wilfredo Fernandez, a prosecutor with the US
Attorney's office in Miami. ``Jurors say, `We've got violent crime,
we've got drugs, we've got kilos of cocaine falling out the sky,
and you're going to give me someone smuggling some poor people out
of Cuba?'''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Garcia lived the exile's dream. After arriving in Florida
on July 2, 1992, he went on a blind date with a woman who had the
same first name as his sister, Maria. They married and started
their own auto and boat repair shop. By working six and seven days
a week, they were able to buy a house with a pool. On July 2, 1996,
on the fourth anniversary of Garcia's arrival, Juan and Maria had a
son.
</P>
<P>
   The way the family tells it, Juan Garcia received the call from
Cuba about his missing relatives on June 26, a Friday. He set off
in a borrowed speedboat, trusting his instincts to find the
passengers, who included his mother, sister, and a 10-year-old
daughter from a first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to verify that account. At the US attorney's
office, Fernandez has heard too many miraculous-encounter-at-sea
stories. Most of these ``coincidences,'' he says, are actually the
result of a carefully planned rendezvous. Smuggling, in other
words.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia has not been told when he will face an immigration judge.
If he is found guilty, the authorities probably will say he has to
serve his time and return to Cuba. Of course, Cuba won't accept him
if the United States says he is a criminal, so he could be in limbo
for years. ``My husband would rather die than go back to Cuba,''
said his wife, Maria.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives who were deported are home in Santa Clara, worse
than ever. Roberto, the gym teacher, lost his job as punishment for
deserting the country. ``My family will not stay in Cuba, you can
be sure of that,'' said his wife, Maria Elena, as she held her baby
girl. ``They are going to keep trying and trying until they get
here.''

ALTERNATIVE LEUKEMIA TREATEMENT GIVES NEW HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Treating older patients with leukemia presents an
agonizing dilemma for physicians. Doctors can increase an older
patient's odds of a cure with aggressive treatment, such as a bone
marrow transplant, but the treatment itself can kill the patient.
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, older patients may not have to make such a
difficult choice.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have
begun testing a new-generation bone marrow transplant procedure
that could one day be used for older patients who aren't eligible
for traditional bone marrow transplants, and for others who are too
sick to survive high-dose chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, six people have tried the new procedure, which is not
being done yet anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Gordon Aaby, 30, who had a transplant
with the new method a little more than five months ago and credits
it with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a traditional bone marrow transplant, this process
involves no high-dose chemotherapy or intense radiation, the two
aspects of the conventional method that pose the most risk for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new procedure uses natural immune system cells,
called lymphocytes, along with new bone marrow from a donor to
``sneak up'' on the cancer and kill it without chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very novel, very experimental,'' said Dr. Rainer Storb,
head of the Clinical Research Division's Transplantation Biology
Program at Fred Hutchinson. Storb and principal investigator Dr.
Peter McSweeney are conducting a pilot study of the new treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Its promise is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Once refined, it eventually could lead to what Storb termed a
``drive-through'' transplant, a non-toxic procedure with the
potential to cure or treat a wide variety of malignancies,
including acute myelogenous leukemia , and genetic blood disorders,
such as sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional bone marrow transplants use high doses of
chemotherapy and radiation to kill cancer cells, irreversibly
destroying the body's blood-making machinery and immune system in
the process. The donor's bone marrow then essentially replaces the
patient's own system with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically almost kill you and then bring you back from
the edge,'' said Tim Testu, 54, who seven months ago faced a choice
whether to get a bone marrow transplant with only 50 percent odds
of surviving it, or try the new procedure, which at that point had
only been used in animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be better off playing Russian roulette,'' he said of his
chances with the regular bone marrow procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Testu, a marine engineer living in Port Townsend, was diagnosed
in 1991 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a slow but fatal form of
blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After his remissions began lasting shorter periods, he sought
help at Fred Hutchinson. Because he was an older patient showing
signs of increased resistance to chemotherapy, he was told he only
had a ``shockingly few'' number of months to live. Maybe two years
at the outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His treatment options were limited. More conservative treatment
options promised greater near-term survival, but posed greater risk
of relapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed me charts, kind of like investing in the stock
market,'' he said. ``You can choose aggressive and high risk with
the big return, or choose the sure thing, and not make as much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was told he was eligible for the new treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is cancer-free. ``I can't even believe my own good
fortune,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors are excited about his long-term outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point of view, we're remarkably optimistic about his
outcome,'' McSweeney said. ``The most encouraging thing is we can't
find any leukemic cells, even using our most sensitive tests, and
that's a prerequisite for being cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaby, a cook who lives south of Seattle, has had a similar
dramatic turnaround. He suffers from a congenital immune deficiency
condition, similar to the ``bubble boy'' disease. Five and a half
months ago he weighed only 80 pounds and his body was shutting down
little by little. He had violent chills and a running fever of 103
degrees. He could barely breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was watching him disappear before my eyes,''
said Toni Aaby, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believed that replacing his own defective bone marrow
with healthy cells from a donor might cure him, but doubted he
could survive the chemotherapy phase of a regular bone marrow
transplant. Instead, they told him about the new procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either that or nothing,'' Aaby said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the procedure, his health has been steadily improving.
He's now at normal weight and, as a side benefit of not having
chemotherapy, still has the long wavy ponytail he's been growing
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go back to everything,'' he said. ``Jogging,
skiing, water sports, baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new treatment, which is done completely outside the
hospital, patients have their own immune systems slightly
suppressed with oral medications, just enough so that when doctors
slip in donor bone marrow cells , the body doesn't immediately
reject them.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the two bone marrow systems _ the patient's and the
donor's _ set up shop together, existing in a state referred to as
``mixed chimerism.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that state is achieved, doctors infuse th patient with
lymphocytes from the same donor. Lymphocytes are a type of immune
system cell that can attack and kill cancer. Because they come from
a donor, they are more aggressive in killing cancer than the
patient's own lymphocytes.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is known as the ``graft-versus-leukemia''
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Because the patient already has some donor bone marrow in his
system, the donor lymphocyte cells aren't automatically rejected,
allowing them to do their work. Then, over time, the immune
suppression medication is removed, and the new, stronger donor
marrow gradually overtakes and eventually replaces the old bone
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be as if the patient were a personal computer,
plagued by some kind of virus, and they fix it by changing the
operating system from Win95 to Macintosh _ without tearing down, or
even turning off the machine,'' Testu said.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure hasn't worked for everyone. Two patients failed to
achieve the mixed chimeric state and rejected the donor marrow
before it could take hold. No patients who have undergone the
therapy have died.
</P>
<P>
   It will take two or three more years to refine a treatment
protocol for wider use, Storb said. Currently, it is considered
experimental and is not routinely covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There is a need for advances that would allow high-risk and
older patients such as Seattle Public Schools Superintendent John
Stanford, 59, to get bone marrow transplants with reduced risks,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, only about 10 percent of (all types of cancer)
patients are cured by chemotherapy alone,'' said oncologist and
researcher Dr. James Bianco, who heads Cell Therapeutics Inc., a
Seattle-based biotechnology company working on cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer cells become resistant to repeated rounds of
chemotherapy, making them increasingly difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
   And each time a patient undergoes chemotherapy, it reduces the
odds of success of subsequent treatments, such as a bone marrow
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   If an older patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, for
example, gets a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible in the
course of his disease, his odds of a cure are about 40 to 50
percent. The odds fall to less than 20 percent after multiple
rounds of chemotherapy, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a traditional bone marrow method, ``anyone over age 65,
most would die'' from the treatment, Storb said.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 50 and 60, there is a ``pretty high
mortality'' from bone marrow transplants, he said. In some cancers,
it's as high as 80 percent. For acute myelogenous leukemia, the
mortality rate from the bone marrow transplant itself is around 25
to 30 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to organs and risk of infection are two main
complications that can lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ability to repair DNA damage is lessened when we age,'' Storb
said. Many centers around the world won't even attempt bone marrow
transplants in patients older than 55. At the Fred Hutchinson
Center, the cutoff age is 65.
</P>
<P>
   However, leukemia strikes many patients over that age. Half of
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia , for example, are older
than 67. This type of cancer is not curable with conventional
chemotherapy, but 80 percent of patients younger than 50 can be
cured with a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, the aggressive type of
leukemia that Stanford has, would be eligible for the experimental
treatment only during a first remission, Storb said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the advanced stage of Stanford's disease, he would
not be eligible for the experimental transplant procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is currently undergoing tests in preparation for a
traditional bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   For Testu, the procedure has already given him a new shot at
life, and he hopes by being the first to try the treatment, it will
open the way for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hope here,'' he said. ``And a lot of
encouragement.''

WHEN WRITER BECOMES A CAM HAM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   In a shameless effort to boost readership, this column will soon
be the focus of a Web-cam, which means that for a not-unreasonable
fee anyone may log onto the World Wide Web and watch the amazing
and hitherto closely guarded process of cranking out the stuff that
appears in this space.
</P>
<P>
   Web-cam sites are proliferating. A recent Globe Living/Arts
story reported that each day hundreds of thousands of Web surfers
check in to various candid camera Web sites to watch people
``cleaning, opening the refrigerator, cooking spaghetti, working,
giving birth, putting on makeup, sleeping, even imitating Austin
Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   My editors reasoned that while column writing is not as exciting
as giving birth or putting on makeup, it's probably more
interesting than sleeping, although that remains to be seen. It may
depend upon who's sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   I feel like a pioneer, in a way, because eventually everyone
will have his or her own Web-cam site. Someday, I'm sure, we'll be
able to log on and call up anyone's life, anytime. True, there's at
least one obvious disadvantage to Web-cam Nation, but a complete
and total loss of individual privacy is a small price to pay for,
say, the ability to see just exactly what our leaders and lawmakers
are up to every minute of the day and night.
</P>
<P>
   With public mistrust of journalists and politicians running
neck-and-neck in the polls, offering up my working life, such as it
is, for scrutiny seems the very least I can do for journalism _
apart from writing these columns, that is. I have selfish reasons,
too, for wanting to expose myself on the World Wide Web. It's the
only way I'll ever get a book contract.
</P>
<P>
   I have no horrible sins to confess, no shameful secrets waiting
to be told. That's what it takes these days, to be a successful
writer, the kind of writer who gets big advances, big reviews,
appearances on Oprah and Larry King. I have never murdered anyone,
never posed nude, never had an affair with a celebrity or even with
a blood relative, never taken enough alcohol or drugs to be really
interesting. I've never even had a complete mental breakdown,
although I'm not ruling out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it may not be enough just to share my working life on
my own Web-cam site. I may need a gimmick, if I hope to get a book
out of it. It's far too late to lose my virginity on line, like
those two California teenagers threatened to do a couple of weeks
ago. That turned out to be a hoax. That Florida woman who gave
birth live on the Internet wasn't a hoaxer, unfortunately. But I'm
past the point of being able to have a baby on or off the Web,
although with the miracle of modern reproductive technology,
anything is possible. I'm thinking about cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe readers will have some other ideas. A team of Web-cam
consultants has been called in at great expense to help focus this
project. They suggested that the columns should be interactive,
that I invite readers to share in the whole exciting process, from
the frantic search for ideas right up to and including arguments
with the copy desk. They also suggested that henceforth I wear some
sort of skimpy costume, possibly spangled. However, my editors
pointed out that the whole object of the Web-cam experiment is to
attract readers, not repel them. So I will continue to write
wearing my usual oversized garments.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests, the consultant team noticed an increased
number of ``hits'' when I was at lunch and during bathroom breaks,
leading them to speculate that some Web surfers may prefer staring
at my empty chair to watching me work. I am not sure how to
interpret this. Maybe it's too early to draw any conclusions. See
you, or maybe not, at http://www.ohmygod.com.

 STOCKTON, Calif.: ... in the preseason.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rice, in fact, is convinced that Mariucci will not allow him to
get in any of the exhibition games. Is he right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uhh ... '' said Mariucci, ``I'd say that's a high
probability.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can tell Rice anything about the position he plays, but
it's up to the likes of Mariucci and his surrounding medical
experts to remind him of the position he's in. He is aging, and
those aren't character lines, marks of distinction, that are now
etched around his left knee. The first operation alone easily could
have ended the career of a lesser athlete. The second cut almost
assuredly would have been a ticket to some network broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Little about Rice's career has been ordinary. The son of a
bricklayer, born and raised in Crawford, Miss., he developed his
Velcroed hands while laboring at his father's jobsights. In the
sweltering summer heat of the Deep South, his brother Jim would
toss him two bricks at a time, and the wideout-superstar-to-be
would snare each one with a separate hand as they split apart on
their flight path up the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rice would be irate if a brick came back his way, and Joe
Rice was a demanding father who liked to keep the job moving. The
workplace was no place to drop the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (toughness came) just from my parents,'' Rice
explained to the San Francisco Chronicle early in the '95 season.
``As a kid growing up, I had to work for everything. Nothing was
given to me. When I would go out and work with my father, he was a
very demanding father, and I had to do my job. I couldn't give 50
percent. It had to be 100 percent, and that's the way I look at
football. It's all about going out there and enjoying something
that you do, but also knowing that while you're out there, you're
jeopardizing everything. One blow can end your career, so why not
give 100 percent while you're out there?''
</P>
<P>
   When he went down with the knee injury last August, it was the
first time Rice would miss a game because of injury in his career.
He had played 189 consecutive games with virtually no significant
damage to his body, a stat that, in the violent world of pro
football, may be more amazing than any of his accomplishments that
are tabulated in the rec-ord book. Perhaps no one ever will
outcatch him. Perhaps no one ever will outcondition him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a relentless work ethic,'' said Young, who has
delivered 75 TD passes into Rice's clutches. ``He has put together
world-class athleticism with a world-class work ethic, and there
aren't many who do that. It's usually that blue-collar athlete
who's out there working and working, but Jerry's that rare case
that blends the two. I can tell Michael Jordan's like that, too.
And that, to me, is what brings guys to that next level. It's what
separates the world-class athletes from everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Hill is part of the formula. Rice's offseason conditioning
regimen is based, in part, on a grueling 2 1/2-mile run up wooded,
mountainous terrain of San Carlos, not far from Palo Alto. As
training camp draws near, he puts more emphasis on sprint work. But
The Hill is the centerpiece of his endurance and his longevity. It
is what helped him report here two weeks ago, a day ahead of
schedule, ready to resume running his pass routes.
</P>
<P>
   Only now he runs with the same legs and a different attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I stood here and said that I'm not afraid,''
Rice said in his first media session upon reporting to camp.
``After coming off an injury like this, you are going to have some
second thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon reporting to the 49ers' new training facility here, Rice
was unsettled to find a pair of knee braces waiting for him in his
locker. When the knee cracked in December, he was wearing a brace,
and he was convinced then that the brace made the knee more
vulnerable to such a fracture. That's not necessarily a medical
opinion, but that of a man who has lived the pain. Greater
flexibility upon impact, he believes, could have prevented the
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was part of my trouble last time,'' said Rice, explaining
his reaction to seeing the braces again two weeks ago. ``I threw
'em in the garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing any injured player can do in training camp can truly
mirror what will happen in a game. Rice will spend the next month
preparing for the opener against the Jets, eventually immersing
himself in contact drills and offering up his head, shoulders, and
legs to the blows of what is often a beastly game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this time,'' said Rice, ``I can jump up and run
back to the huddle, and finish the entire game. ... Then I think
basically everything would be behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he jogs on the sidelines, works in the weight room, and
inches his way toward the day of reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   What awaits him is either an extension of his greatness or a
reminder, perhaps a final one, that all good things must end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about football,'' said Barton. ``There are no
graceful endings. It's not like baseball, where you play your last
game, hit a couple of homers, and wave goodbye with everyone
cheering you. In football, there's always this ugly hand ready to
grab you out of the sky and haul you down. It's nasty. And it
happens to everyone eventually, and I'm talking players,
management, everyone. It happened eventually to Thurman Thomas and
to Y.A. Tittle. It's just always there, ready to bring you down
with a crash.''

JUDE 
A Pilgrimage to the Saint of Last Resort 
By Liz Trotta 
HarperSanFrancisco, 270 pp., $24  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing about a religious figure who lived 2,000 years ago is
never easy. Sources of information can be scant and unreliable. And
when that person is St. Jude, perhaps the most revered but least
known of Jesus' 12 apostles, the challenge is even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Liz Trotta is both a skilled reporter and a
graceful writer. Her account of the fervent international devotion
inspired by Jude is an absorbing, even riveting tale. Trotta's
``Jude: A Pilgrimage to the Saint of Last Resort'' can be read as
religious mystery, spiritual quest, and inspirational literature.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to New York, Baltimore, Rome, and a remote corner of
Turkey, Trotta tries to shed light on this ``mysterious man who,
without historical or theological proof, has been delegated the
amazing burden of retrieving lost causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotta wisely avoids writing a biography. After all, it would be
difficult to provide a very detailed sketch of an apostle who has
only one spoken line in the entire New Testament. Yet, as Trotta
shrewdly notes, it is Jude's elusiveness that has helped make him
such an appealing person in our media-saturated,
celebrity-worshiping age.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of utter identification with the sound bite, he
stands in silence, mythless: Jude the Deliberately Obscure, the
guerrilla operating unseen in the mist, an apparition over the
horizon, the farthest out, remote _ yet hearing the weakest, most
desolate cries,'' writes Trotta, New York bureau chief for The
Washington Times and a former television network correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   She makes a convincing case that Jude is the right saint for our
times. He is the answer to our spiritual restlessness, to our sense
of unease even in times of material prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduates of the `Me generation,' those who sought to be
`Masters of the Universe,' seem to have discovered in their middle
age, at last, that they are not lords of their own destiny,''
Trotta writes. ``It is a time of internal transformation, a hunger
for personal experience of a higher power. Prayer _ the final
sensation _ is back in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotta is most compelling when she moves away from Jude to spend
time on vivid, humorous, and sometimes poignant portraits of the
people _ the sick, the dying, the lonely _ who follow the farmer
turned Christian martyr with ferocious passion. At a church named
in honor of St. Jude in Rome, Trotta meets Vitoria Ansini, who
believes Jude saved her life. In the early-morning hours of a day
in 1980, Ansini was hit by a bus. Though she lay in the street for
nearly two hours, Ansini tells Trotta, no other cars struck her.
Later, people who had been at the scene told Ansini that a
mysterious white light surrounded her body. Ansini is convinced it
was Jude's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Judean stories of the famous. In the 1950s
Danny Thomas made public his appeal to Jude to give him the break
that would let him escape one-night stands in sleazy clubs. Thomas
got his break. In gratitude, he built the Saint Jude Hospital for
children in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, except for the Virgin Mary, there are probably more
churches in the United States dedicated to Jude than to any other
saint. Jude brings in millions of dollars every year from
supplicants who buy books, ornaments, prayer cards in the thousands
of Judean churches and shrines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jude's remarkable ascendancy from a virtually unknown
first-century Christian messenger into a worldwide religious
phenomenon is testament to the power of belief. This is the message
Trotta's fine book leaves us with. The Judean movement is not built
on historical documents. Jude doesn't belong to the scholars or the
princes of the church. Jude belongs to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jude does not make his presence felt through history, or
iconography, or folklore, but by his endless indirect
manifestations to the millions who catch his invisible hand as a
first desperate clutch in their stretch toward God,'' Trotta
writes.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BATTLE MOVES TO WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Advocates on both sides of the affirmative action
debate do agree on one point: Well-mannered, overwhelmingly white
Washington state is the perfect arena for a face-off.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only state where conservatives were able to place
the issue on the ballot this year. That puts Washington, better
known for cafe lattes and computer software, at the epicenter of
the ongoing effort to end so-called ``preferences'' for women and
members of minority groups. That also means that the outcome here
could have implications nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of preferences say their movement could be made _ or
broken _ by the November referendum, which will ask voters to ban
the practice in state and local government, colleges, and
universities. They have the money and the early momentum, along
with ballot language that critics consider misleading, although the
ballot was a winner in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, we will have pumped new life into the movement to
end preferences,'' said Ward Connerly, whose American Civil Rights
Institute pushed through the initiative in California in 1996 and
later paid to jump-start the effort in Washington. ``If we lose in
a venue tailor-made for us, we'll have to rethink whether it's
worthwhile pursuing initiatives in other states.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, supporters have a clear sense of what is at
stake, here and nationally. And they believe the votes should be
there to defend affirmative action in a state where, because of the
paucity of minorities, the greatest beneficiaries of the policy are
white women and white men who have served in the military.
Washington voters, also known for their political independence,
have also elected members of minority groups to high political
office, including the nation's only Asian-American governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine that people will look to this state, which has a
reputation of being fairly liberal, and say, `If it's OK there,
it's OK here,''' said Carol Pencke, executive director of A
Territory Resource, a Seattle-based foundation that funds groups
that work to give women and minority groups equal opportunity and
opposes the ballot initiative. ``It'll be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on both sides of the measure known as Initiative 200
talk in terms of civil rights. But they disagree over the measure's
potential impact.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Initiative 200, among them Governor Gary Locke,
Starbucks, and the Boeing Co., the state's largest employer, say
minority enrollment at California's premier universities plummeted
after Proposition 209 barred preferential treatment. The Washington
initiative, they argue, would eliminate public recruitment programs
aimed at women and minorities and even those intended to interest
girls in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doors of opportunity are going to be slammed shut for women
and minorities all across the state if this passes. ... We don't
take our challenge lightly,'' said Kelly Evans, who is managing the
``No!200'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But initiative supporters, including the Senate majority leader
and the speaker of the House, insist that it would simply ban
preferences based on race or gender. They take a very different
view of what has happened in California, noting that outreach by
state colleges there has increased, with deans themselves speaking
to minority students about the benefits of attending the system's
star campuses in Los Angeles and Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire idea of different rules for different people
doesn't work in America anymore.''said John Carlson, who is leading
the effort to undo affirmative action in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the initiative's interpretation could be key.
In Washington, as in California, the ballot title emphasizes the
elimination of preferences without mentioning affirmative action.
The wording reverberates with voters.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Seattle Times newspaper poll showed that 64 percent of
voters would support Initiative 200 as worded on the Nov. 3 ballot.
But when told it would effectively end affirmative action, while
leaving federal and private programs unaffected, support fell to 49
percent. Still, more white voters continued to support Initiative
200 than to oppose it, in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, minority opposition to the measure is
considered almost inconsequential, since minorities make up at most
10 percent of the electorate and less than 17 percent of the
population. Still, the fastest-growing group in the state is
Hispanics, followed by Asians, then blacks and native Americans,
according to the state Office of Financial Management. But
Washington's largest minority group, Asian-Americans, does not even
qualify for a number of the state's affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Initiative 200 ``are going to have to change a lot
of minds,'' said Stuart Elway, president of Seattle-based Elway
Research, which conducted the poll. ``Their task is to convince
people it's going to end affirmative action. For supporters, it's
to convince people that it's just about preferences. What is clear
is that it's not clear what the effect will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to voters is increasingly seen as a way for opponents of
race-based preferences to circumvent state legislatures that have
proven as reluctant as Congress to bar the practice. During 1996
and 1997, 13 states introduced such legislation; none of the bills
passed, according to the Southern Regional Council, an
Atlanta-based civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jesse Jackson was saying the same thing as we are, to treat
people equal, he'd be cheered,'' said Scott Smith, a state
representative who started gathering signatures for Initiative 200
after failing to force a bill out of committee. ``I don't see what
the difference is if I say it. People want this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet voters have also proven reluctant to end affirmative action.
In Florida, too few signatures were gathered to hold a referendum.
Washington's signature drive was stymied until Connerly's
California-based organization stepped in with matching funds last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves California and Houston, where voters passed a
similarly worded initiative, then sank a follow-up referendum that
included the words ``affirmative action.'' A judge recently ordered
a new election, saying the city's revised language did not reflect
the intent of voters who petitioned to put the issue on the ballot.
``They really got lucky with the ballot title, which is poorly
worded and quite vague,'' said Martha Choe, a Seattle city
councilwoman who opposes Initiative 200. ``It's deceptive, because
it says do away with something when it will do away with other
things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said House Speaker Clyde Ballard: ``Affirmative action is a good
program and it will continue. But people are against preferences.
They call them goals, but if you talk to them on the side, they
say, `Yeah, they're quotas.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Washington, said Tom McCabe, a building industry executive
in Olympia who has been active in several recent initiatives, those
are fighting words. The people here tend to have a ``go along, get
along'' attitude that makes marching in the streets or public
protests almost anathema. The debate surrounding Initiative 200, he
added, is particularly contentious and emotional at the campaign
level.
</P>
<P>
   But among the people of Washington, there appears to be little
talk at all of Initiative 200. With the vote more than three months
off, the pro and con campaigns are still gearing up to get out
their messages. Bill Gates and Microsoft have yet to take a
position. Many voters, whether planning to support or oppose the
initiative, say they are ambivalent about their decision.
</P>
<P>
   As a white male, business consultant Larry Hobbs says he may
have lost opportunities to members of minority groups. Still, he
has had plenty of success and plans to vote against Initiative 200.
Although she might benefit from affirmative action, Linda Hoder,
who works at a cellular telephone company, says people should not
get jobs or college admissions they do not deserve. She plans to
vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative action isn't fair, but neither are people,'' said
Jim R. Allen, who sells real estate in eastern Washington. ``I
don't like it, but without it we'd lose too much of what we've
gained that has been good for the whole.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dennis Meadows, the director of the Institute for Policy and
Social Science Research at the University of New Hampshire, is
playing games with the future, _ and government, industry, and
educational leaders are playing along.
</P>
<P>
   According to the editorial board of Simon &AMP; Schuster's
``Encyclopedia of the Future,'' Meadows is one of the country's 100
most influential futurists.
</P>
<P>
   In his best-selling 1972 book, ``The Limits to Growth,'' which
Anthony Lewis of The New York Times decribed as ``a headline-making
report on the imminent global disaster facing humanity,'' Meadows
and a team of experts used a computer model to forecast global
population growth and its impact on economic systems and the
environment. They painted a bleak picture.
</P>
<P>
   But Meadows isn't satisfied with just crying wolf, he's created
a series of outdoor exercises and board games to help officials
contemplate large-systems management and reach solutions before the
environment is permanently damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows doesn't see himself as a ``futurist,'' because, he says,
``that term encompasses many different activities, like astrology
and science-fiction writing.'' A more apt term, he says, would be
``forecaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been creating a series of games to serve as models and
metaphors to help get people thinking about resource development
and the limits to growth,'' he said recently as he took a visitor
on a tour of the Browne Center at UNH, a 100-acre complex of
buildings and equipment devoted to outdoor education, experiential
learning, and team building.
</P>
<P>
   In his search for solutions to world problems, he has developed
several games that help focus thinking about resource development
and large systems management.
</P>
<P>
   The games include Fish Banks, which he developed to train
government officials in 1986. It has since been translated into 20
languages and has been used as a teaching tool throughout the
world. To play Fish Banks, participants are divided into teams to
catch fish, buy boats, and build fishing fleets that compete with
other teams in making money, while managing an imaginary fishery
without depleting it. In a training video for the game, he said it
was an attempt to develop ``a new kind of training method based on
computer-assisted role playing which conveys teamwork and managing
complex systems and containing substantive information about
real-world problems.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Strategem, which he developed to help players look at
the earth from a different perspective in an attempt to manage the
world's ``abundant but finite resources.''
</P>
<P>
   In Strategem, teams govern an imaginary country in an attempt to
build a balanced economy and manage renewable resources. The teams
consist of leader and Cabinet ministers responsible for population
growth, energy systems, social services, and other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes twinkled behind wire-rimmed glasses as he showed off a
wooden yurt that was recently contructed at the Browne Center
``without the aid of power tools.'' The yurt, which is lined with
benches and smells of freshly sawn wood, serves as a conference
room where participants in the outdoor education course discuss
lessons learned in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Browne Center is a component of the Institute for Policy and
Social Science Research at UNH. According to a mission statement,
it has two goals: ``to facilitate innovation in the teaching and
research programs of the University and help focus the intellectual
resources of the school on important problems of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the center opened in 1988, more than 8,000 students _
teachers, businessmen, and representatives of government and
private organizations _ have participated in the center's team and
consensus-building programs by playing games and meeting outdoor
challenges such as scaling a 13-foot wooden wall without outside
aid and traversing a telephone pole-sized log suspended 20 feet
above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows earned a doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He has taught at MIT and Dartmouth. He says he joined
the faculty at UNH in 1988 because of the university's commitment
to ``reach out to the community and seek practical solutions to the
problems that face it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem like a big leap from forecasting global population
in the year 2100 to prescribing steps for improved team
performance,'' he said, ``but throughout my professional life, I
have been a social engineer _ working to understand how to make
institutions work better in satisfying human needs. The difference
is that now I don't have to wait 100 years to see if my work is
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a consultant to the Rockefeller Foundation, and has
trained US officials in large-systems management, as well as public
officials in Africa, Germany, and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows has written several books in addition to ``Limits to
Growth'' and its 1992 companion volume ``Beyond the Limits.'' He's
working on a book titled the ``Systems Thinking Workbook.'' It will
consist of a series of games designed to assist in managing large
systems. When asked for an example, he quickly grabs a piece of
graph paper and a pen and offers to demonstrate. With a flourish,
he eagerly scribbles five marks on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``What number does this represent?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor guesses five.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Four,'' he says, and quickly scribbles four more slashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What number does this represent?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Three,'' he says. ``Try again. And this time look at my
other hand.'' He quickly scribbles five lines while holding up
three fingers on his other hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three,'' the visitor says confidently.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' he says. ``The solution to a problem is often
found in a direction you're not looking.''

AND HOW ABOUT THE LINCOLN-FORD-MERCURY MEMORIAL?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a lot of hand-wringing in Washington these
days about how to keep Social Security afloat when the baby-boom
generation hits retirement age. I'm pleased to report that I have
the answer: corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   I got the idea from Ralph Lauren. You know Ralph Lauren. He's
the tan guy in a T-shirt who is always surrounded by beautiful
women. The New York designer recently shook off his entourage to
join President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren earned a spot on stage with the Clintons by pledging $13
million to restore one of the museum's treasures: the flag that
inspired ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Francis Scott Key wrote a
poem, which later became the national anthem, after the flag
survived the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore
during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star-Spangled Banner was an inspiration to Francis Scott
Key, it's been an inspiration for me, and I want it to be an
inspiration for future generations,'' Lauren said in announcing his
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lauren doesn't write poems. He designs clothes, and
his flag sweaters are one reason that his company, Polo Ralph
Lauren, reported net revenues of nearly $1.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The product tie-in is obvious, but just in case anybody missed
it, the president gave Lauren's sweaters a big fat plug at the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most of us have _ well, maybe not most of us, but a
lot of us, including Hillary and me _ have those great Polo
sweaters with the American flag on it,'' the president said. ``I
wish I had one with the Star-Spangled Banner on it, because that's
the gift that he's given America today.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought you had to be tan, have tousled blond hair and live on
Cape Cod to wear those sweaters, but I think Clinton is on to
something with this cash-for-commercials program. He just didn't
take it far enough. How much do you think Lauren would have given
if Clinton had agreed to call the flag the ``Polo-Spangled
Banner''?
</P>
<P>
   We could do the same thing at the Washington Monument, where
Target is underwriting another restoration effort. Why not? Nearly
every sports facility in the country is already known by its
corporate sponsor. If we can have a United Center and a USAir
Arena, why can't we have a Target Washington Monument?
</P>
<P>
   Think about the possibilities. The Lockheed Martin Pentagon. The
Archer-Daniels-Midland Agriculture Building. The Excedrin/Maalox
Internal Revenue Service Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could announce the new corporate sponsors at a briefing
in the 1-800-FLOWERS Rose Garden, behind the Sherwin Williams White
House and near the Turf Builder South Lawn. (Victoria's Secret
might want to get in on the White House action, too, but I don't
think they'd make the approved bidders list.)
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on the Capitol would surely go sky high. Maybe we could
call it the NRA Dome in exchange for payments from the National
Rifle Association. If Democrats take charge, they could call the
entire Capitol complex Tort Village in honor of the Trial Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't just have to be buildings that get corporate
sponsorship. I'm sure the Walt Disney Co. would have picked up the
tab for Clinton's recent China trip if he had called it the Mulan
Tour. Guinness breweries and Stolichnaya Vodka could underwrite
forays to Ireland and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam Hussein acts up again, we could launch Operation
Ex-Lax, the mother of all ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As for that Social Security problem, that's not a problem _ it's
a marketing opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, anybody out there interested in sponsoring
a newspaper column?

KEEPING THE HOUSING ISSUE ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It has driven me crazy,'' Joe Kennedy was saying the other day
about the country's disastrous and ridiculously gridlocked housing
policies.
</P>
<P>
   As well he might. And should. And has.
</P>
<P>
   Down the home stretch of his congressional career, there is no
subject _ for obvious reasons _ that gets this guy's juices flowing
like the condition of urban housing, both by itself and as a
metaphor for the cities' treatment by the national government.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no subject more important to the In-box of
Kennedy's successor. And while Kennedy has wisely kept out of the
campaign, it is at least interesting that the one candidate who
keeps housing front and center is his almost-neighbor, former state
Representative Susan Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing Kennedy or his Boston-centered constituents
don't experience (whether it's cost, availability, quality, or
homelessness) that is not a direct consequence of this scandalous
situation.
</P>
<P>
   I had noticed from mid-July on that, as usual, Kennedy was in
the forefront of several efforts in the House to avoid Newt
Gingrich-led assaults on urban working families' most immediate
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as usual since 1994, the votes weren't there for success
(that will come defensively via President Clinton's veto, if
necessary). But keeping the goal of a return to sanity alive is no
small task; it's one that Kennedy and a too-small band of
colleagues has been performing for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy likes to point out that a minimum-wage family in Boston,
in order to rent the average two-bedroom apartment, would need to
shell out more than 90 percent of its income. At twice the minimum
wage, that apartment still gobbles more than half the family's
take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   Down here, in terms of national policy, it's important to
realize that fully 40 percent of the Draconian Reagan budget cuts
that still never came close to paying for those high income
focused, immense tax cuts back in 1981 came out of housing programs
for the less well-off.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to realize that while the opportunities lost
to Reagan's cuts were all restored and then some in education,
transportation, and most everywhere else, housing was the flagrant
exception.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, it's important to realize that Gingrich &AMP; Co. have
been trying to take another whack of 25 percent out of the system
since they won their majority four years ago, including the
programs to combat spreading homelessness. Only the voices of
people like Kennedy and Clinton's veto have blocked them.
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, deserves no special credit for that, and
as Kennedy points out, much responsibility for what he accurately
describes as a ``national abandonment'' stretching back to the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite, dramatically damning Kennedy fact: Of the more
than 15 million low-income families eligible under the law for
assistance under the government's housing programs only 3 million
currently receive any. And the GOP majority in Congress proposes
that even fewer families receive any.
</P>
<P>
   In Kennedy's view this is why record numbers of people are
showing up at shelters in an amazingly prosperous economy;
government policies are literally creating homlessness at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But, also in his view, they are creating overcrowding, and
several other major problems. For tens of thousands of
modest-income homeowners, a lack of accessible capital is keeping
them from making needed improvements to maintain their dwellings.
And for still more tens of thousands, the expiration of
generation-old incentives to landlords with low-income tenants is
literally pushing people out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, Kennedy has long supported and at various times
has proposed equalizing the tax breaks for renters that
mortgage-holders enjoy. The most common idea would make rent
payments tax deductible up to some moderate-income cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy worries that the politics of this is tough, and he's
right. However, at some point after this year's elections, tax cuts
are going to make it to the national table, and then the question
will be whether working families or the comfortable are targeted.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a passionate advocate of a new financing mechanism _
low-interest loans up to some reasonable maximum _ to help
homeowners make needed repairs and add rental units (a big deal for
the elderly).
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot of tough, determined political work, and it
is impossible not to notice Susan Tracy's concentration on the same
theme. In Brighton, Kennedy's home is up a big hill they call the
Bigelow; Tracy comes from the hill right across Oak Square from it,
called the Breck.
</P>
<P>
   As an up-from-the-grass roots activist, housing is in her blood.
She ran Boston's home-less effort for a certain former mayor who's
also in this race. It's one of her central issues, from fighting
evictions in the buildings where subsidies are expiring, to taking
full advantage of funding for lead paint removal, to expanding the
new financing mechanisms for home-buyers at the community level.
And the tax deduction for renters is a cause she champions.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of big issues in an urban district, from
health care to education to infrastructure. But housing hits people
literally where they live.

THE RESULTS OF CLINTON'S KOWTOW TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Monday, Communist China asserted the right to invade
Taiwan. Bill Clinton's diplomacy is bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The president's recent summit in China was graded by many a
success because he had managed to speak about the Tiananmen Square
massacre live on Chinese TV. In truth, Clinton's defense of human
rights was far from stirring. (They promote ``stability,'' he
said.) And it was undercut by his soothing assurance that ``there
are legitimate and honest differences in the way we look at this.''
(We call it murder, you call it crowd-control _ tomato, tomahto,
potato, potahto.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were broadcast _ but only once and in a
low-viewership time slot. There was no prior announcement, no
excerpt afterward, and no transcript in the next day's paper. The
president delivered his human rights message, such as it was, but
China's rulers saw to it that the fewest number of people were
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Taiwan message, by contrast, came through loud and
clear.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, speaking as if the lives of Taiwan's 21 million
people were his to bargain away, Clinton uttered the ``three no's''
of Beijing's policy toward its tiny island neighbor. ``We don't
support independence for Taiwan,'' he said in a precisely worded
exchange, ``or two Chinas; or one Taiwan/one China. And we don't
believe that Taiwan should be a member of any organization for
which statehood is a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Taiwan belongs to China. This was a deep, deep
kowtow, a thing no president had ever said. As a matter of law _
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act _ and as a matter of principle, the
American position had long been that Taiwan's political status was
a matter to be resolved peacefully between Beijing and Taipei. The
United States held open the door to any option, so long as it was
reached without violence. In practical terms, this meant that the
United States did not condemn Taiwan's efforts to establish
sovereignty by winning diplomatic recognition. And it did not
acquiesce in mainland China's claim of domination over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's pronouncement, a parroting of Chinese policy,
broke new ground. It was exactly what Jiang Zemin wanted to hear.
It slammed the door on any future for Taiwan other than
reabsorption into China. And it shined a green light that Beijing's
tanks are figuratively _ perhaps, literally _ ready to roll
through.
</P>
<P>
   And so last Monday, in its first military policy review in three
years, the Chinese state council repeated its determination to
bring about reunification with Taiwan. ``Beijing,'' the document
stressed, ``will not commit itself not to resort to force.'' For
good measure, the cabinet condemned ``hegemonism'' _ the United
States, in Communist-speak _ as ``the main source of threats to
world peace and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has had six years to take the measure of
the Clinton administration. In November 1993, a meeting of China's
senior foreign and military-policy specialists produced a detailed
report that began: ``Whom does the Communist Party of China regard
as its international archenemy? It is the United States.'' The
administration reaction to this gauntlet-fling was not to begin
treating Beijing as a deadly adversary, but to embark upon a
frantic program of appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   Most favored nation status was repeatedly renewed. Trade and
human rights were ``delinked.'' China was allowed to buy technology
with dual-use applications, from supercomputers to satellite
guidance systems. Hundreds of companies controlled by the People's
Liberation Army were permitted on US soil. Naked violations of
nuclear-proliferation agreements were winked at. And wads of
illegal campaign contributions were cheerfully accepted by the
president's political handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did the White House show a little resolve in the face
of Chinese belligerence. In 1996, as Taiwan prepared to hold its
first democratic election for president _ thereby finalizing its
transition to democracy _ Beijing began a campaign of naked
intimidation. It fired live missiles and practiced bombing runs off
Taiwanese waters. The island's ports were closed; fallout shelters
were hastily built. China warned America not to interfere, or Los
Angeles might go up in a mushroom cloud. After dithering for
months, Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Strait
of Taiwan. Even then, the administration refused to commit itself
explicitly to Taiwan's defense. And it balked at sending the
carriers through the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever reassurance those carriers secured for Taiwan in 1996,
Clinton's ``three no's'' scuttled it away last month. Jiang and his
fellow-despots have maneuvered the American president one step
closer to delivering Taiwan into their hands. Or to looking the
other way when Beijing decides to invade.
</P>
<P>
   The president's kowtow does more than embolden the world's most
powerful totalitarian power. It flies in the face of reality. For
Taiwan is not China's. It is manifestly an independent nation. It
is self-governing, it controls its territory, it manages its
foreign relations, and it ranks among the world's leading
economies. Above all, it is our friend, democratic and reliable. If
the 20th century taught the West nothing else, hasn't it at least
made clear what happens when great powers sacrifice their small
friends in order to appease ravenous dictators?

AND HOW ABOUT THE LINCOLN-FORD-MERCURY MEMORIAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a lot of hand-wringing in Washington these
days about how to keep Social Security afloat when the baby-boom
generation hits retirement age. I'm pleased to report that I have
the answer: corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   I got the idea from Ralph Lauren. You know Ralph Lauren. He's
the tan guy in a T-shirt who is always surrounded by beautiful
women. The New York designer recently shook off his entourage to
join President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren earned a spot on stage with the Clintons by pledging $13
million to restore one of the museum's treasures: the flag that
inspired ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Francis Scott Key wrote a
poem, which later became the national anthem, after the flag
survived the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore
during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star-Spangled Banner was an inspiration to Francis Scott
Key, it's been an inspiration for me, and I want it to be an
inspiration for future generations,'' Lauren said in announcing his
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lauren doesn't write poems. He designs clothes, and
his flag sweaters are one reason that his company, Polo Ralph
Lauren, reported net revenues of nearly $1.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The product tie-in is obvious, but just in case anybody missed
it, the president gave Lauren's sweaters a big fat plug at the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most of us have _ well, maybe not most of us, but a
lot of us, including Hillary and me _ have those great Polo
sweaters with the American flag on it,'' the president said. ``I
wish I had one with the Star-Spangled Banner on it, because that's
the gift that he's given America today.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought you had to be tan, have tousled blond hair and live on
Cape Cod to wear those sweaters, but I think Clinton is on to
something with this cash-for-commercials program. He just didn't
take it far enough. How much do you think Lauren would have given
if Clinton had agreed to call the flag the ``Polo-Spangled
Banner''?
</P>
<P>
   We could do the same thing at the Washington Monument, where
Target is underwriting another restoration effort. Why not? Nearly
every sports facility in the country is already known by its
corporate sponsor. If we can have a United Center and a USAir
Arena, why can't we have a Target Washington Monument?
</P>
<P>
   Think about the possibilities. The Lockheed Martin Pentagon. The
Archer-Daniels-Midland Agriculture Building. The Excedrin/Maalox
Internal Revenue Service Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could announce the new corporate sponsors at a briefing
in the 1-800-FLOWERS Rose Garden, behind the Sherwin Williams White
House and near the Turf Builder South Lawn. (Victoria's Secret
might want to get in on the White House action, too, but I don't
think they'd make the approved bidders list.)
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on the Capitol would surely go sky high. Maybe we could
call it the NRA Dome in exchange for payments from the National
Rifle Association. If Democrats take charge, they could call the
entire Capitol complex Tort Village in honor of the Trial Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't just have to be buildings that get corporate
sponsorship. I'm sure the Walt Disney Co. would have picked up the
tab for Clinton's recent China trip if he had called it the Mulan
Tour. Guinness breweries and Stolichnaya Vodka could underwrite
forays to Ireland and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam Hussein acts up again, we could launch Operation
Ex-Lax, the mother of all ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As for that Social Security problem, that's not a problem _ it's
a marketing opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, anybody out there interested in sponsoring
a newspaper column?

   When the Clinton library is built, do you suppose there'll be a

   I can remember when Washington interns had difficulty getting

   Because Monica Lewinsky apparently doesn't believe in dry

</P>

   It's interesting that we live in a time in which a 16-year-old

   Here's my idea of how to reform education, eliminate truancy,
and make school incredibly interesting for kids: Hire more teachers
like 32-year-old Julie Feil, who was convicted Friday of criminal
sexual conduct for doing the nasty with a 15-year-old boy in her
Hastings, Minn., high school class because she fell in love with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of the same kind of ``hands-on'' approach Clinton has
brought to government.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn is a lot more than the Red Sox first baseman.
</P>

   Nomar Garciaparra wears DiMaggio's number and plays like him,

   You could eliminate 50 percent of courtroom backlog by

   Hey, wouldn't it be great if that spot on Monica's dress turned

   Someday I'd love to see the Pope appear on his balcony and

<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ If etymologists ever feel the need to trace
the origins of beeperspeak, they'll have to research high school
life, circa 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Sweethearts, hoods, stoners, and loners all devised languages
that could be transmitted through their beepers, those sleek
pocket-size message centers religiously worn at the hip. When
paging a friend, they would dial in numeric codes instead of a
return phone number. The most widely known message, for example,
was 143, meaning ``I love you,'' the numbers signifying the letter
count of each affectionate word.
</P>
<P>
   But when beeperspeak surfaced, entrepreneur Norman Beauregard
was well out of high school and well out of the loop. Last year,
the 35-year-old from Attleboro, Mass., came up with what he thought
was a great idea: construct a beeper language in which numbers
could denote everyday words or phrases.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the concept wasn't all that novel. But
capitalizing on that concept was. And business is serving him well.
</P>
<P>
   Beauregard and two friends created ``The Universal Beeper Code
Book,'' a beeperspeak-English dictionary that comes in packages of
two for $4.95. About 22,000 packages have been sold nationwide to
gift shops and drugstores since December. The product also joined
the Web last week at www.thebeeperbook.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Beeperbook creators, Adam Three Inc. of Smithfield, are
banking on the unifying potential of the palm-size book. Sure,
teenagers have been communicating through pagers for years, but
each couple and set of friends had to invent their own esoteric
language. Think Beeperbook, think a united people: ``One book of
codes across the country,'' as Beauregard envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Small enough to fit in a wallet, the book assigns 270 words and
phrases to two- or three-digit numbers. Last year, Beauregard
invited to his home a circle of friends _ doctors, firefighters,
police officers, and lawyers _ to compile a list of commonly used
words. After six hours and a few beers, the group made the final
cut, which included terms like ``lunch,'' ``canceled,'' ``tee
time,'' and _ hey, why not? _ ``Beeperbook.'' Anything not
referenced in the book can be spelled out (A(EQ)01, B(EQ)02, etc.).
The last pages are blank, reserving codes 271 to 300 for personal
words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the high school codes, there is no method or reason to
the Beeperbook's matching of numbers with words, except that
everything is listed in alphabetic and numeric order. Even
Beauregard has no idea how to read a message unless he has the book
handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting anyone to memorize the book,''
said &UR;  &LR; Beauregard, who has applied for a patent on his creation.
``You just have to ask people when they're going out, `Do you have
your Beeperbook?'''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration came to Beauregard when he grew frustrated with
searching for a pay phone every time his wife, friends, or
associates paged him in the car. He would have to pull over, use
his calling card, and learn that his wife, for instance, wanted him
to pick up some milk on the way home. With the Beeperbook, she can
punch in 211-260-123 (``after work/ &QC; 
pick up/milk''). And he doesn't need to stop the car or make the
call _ he just needs to bring home the milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, our slogan was going to be `Saves time, saves
money,' but we had to change it to `It's fun, too,''' said
Beauregard, pretending to read his pager and eagerly flip through
the tiny pages. ``When you get a code, you get your little book
out. It's just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the humble surroundings of his Adam Three
office, the basement of the day-care center where he sends his
youngest son. There's no view, of course, and the unfurnished space
next to the office serves as a holding area for shipments. Adam
Three shares the office with Beauregard's partners, John Felici and
David Losardo of Cam Am Sales, a packaging and paper products firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Beauregard is familiar with launching small businesses from
modest means. At 18, the Woonsocket native started Keyboard
Concepts, which makes specialized computer keys.
</P>
<P>
   He fears no threat from the latest alpha-numeric pagers, which
have bigger screens and advanced technology to allow for word
messages. Users can read e-mail, weather and traffic updates, CNN
news, and stock quotes on the screen. But these models usually cost
$100 to $200 with a charge of $12 to $30 a month, whereas numeric
pagers can run as low as $50 with monthly fees under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Pager use in the country tends to skew toward people aged 18 to
34, and 80 percent are the numeric type, said a Motorola regional
spokeswoman, Monique Allen. Fourteen percent of the 50 million
pager users are teenagers. Pager makers are apparently trying to
woo this market by releasing models in leopard-skin patterns and
hot pink. ``The young generation wants the trendiest color,'' Allen
said. ``They're very fashion-conscious, and they want a hip and
trendy pager.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeperbook sales in Pawtucket's Alpha Page beeper shop are ``not
too good,'' according to 17-year-old sales representative Ana
Borges. People in their 30s are buying the books, but Borges's
teenage friends ``haven't even considered it, probably because we
have our own codes,'' she said. ``We have 143, which means `I love
you,' but to them, it means something like, `Pick up the milk.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young people comprise one market Adam Three particularly wants
to target. ``If you put the Beeperbook in their hands, they'll have
a ball,'' said company partner Losardo. In ProCom Wireless shops in
Texas, 14-year-olds to 20-somethings are buying the inexpensive
books because most of them still use numeric pagers, said sales
director Emmett Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After a hockey or soccer game, Beauregard's 10-year-old son,
Ryan, punches in the scores and ``won'' or ``lost'' when beeping
his dad.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's some fun in store for the zany and creative.

ISIAH BERLIN: THE LION OF LIBERALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he died last November, at 88, Isaiah Berlin had spent more
than six decades leading a life of relative obscurity as an Oxford
don. True, he was eminent enough to have served as president of the
British Academy, and to be the founding president of Oxford's
Wolfson College. Even so, he was more teacher and scholar than
administrator or public figure.
</P>
<P>
   Initially concentrating on philosophy and political theory, he
eventually specialized in something so comparatively abstruse as
the history of ideas. Of the 11 books he published during his
lifetime, only two appeared before Berlin turned 60 _ and one of
those was an anthology. Seven of the remaining books were essay
collections gathered by other hands (usually belonging, as in the
two books under review, to the indefatigable Henry Hardy). The
pursuit of a magnum opus did not drive Berlin. His two best-known
works, ``The Hedgehog and the Fox'' (a study of Tolstoy's view of
history) and ``Two Concepts of Liberty'' (a meditation on political
freedom), are, respectively, an essay and a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the death of this man who published so erratically and had
such a seemingly peripheral (if distinguished) career occasioned an
extraordinary response. The New York Times ran Berlin's obituary on
Page 1, and The New Republic put his photograph on its cover above
the words, ``When a sage dies, all are his kin.'' The most
remarkable tribute occurred in May, when The New York Review of
Books chose to publish the first surviving example of his writing.
What's so striking about this is that he wrote the piece (a short
story inspired by the Latvian-born Berlin's experience of the
Bolshevik Revolution) when he was 12. There is juvenilia, and then
there is juvenilia: It's as if anything that issued from Berlin's
pen ought to be considered sacred writ. It is not too much to say
that, at the time of his death, Isaiah Berlin was the most esteemed
intellectual figure in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   To understand this reputation, one must begin with the man
rather than the work. He was, by all accounts, one of the great
conversationalists, an individual whose vivacity and charm rivaled
his erudition. Edmund Wilson, not one given to gushing (especially
when the subject was English, male, or, worst of all, both), first
met him in 1949. Writing to a friend, Wilson described Berlin as
``a sort of double Russian-and-British personality. The combination
is uncanny but fascinating. We spent the whole time talking
brilliantly, covering rapidly, but with astonishing knowledge, sure
intelligence, and breathtaking wit, an incredible variety of
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's social gifts as much as his intellectual prowess helped
make him a supreme inside player in a supremely inbred culture. He
belongs to an august Oxbridge line that extends from Benjamin
Jowett in Victorian times through Berlin's friend Maurice Bowra in
the earlier years of this century to another of his friends, and
perhaps the last of this line, Noel Annan: a group of
scholar-mandarins whose influence and stature in the tight little
island of British intellect far outstripped their publication
record.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Berlin's place on such a list all the more impressive
is his having been Jewish and a native of a foreign land, two facts
he never sought to conceal. He championed Israel, and few writers
in English have been as illuminating on Russian literature (in
addition to the Tolstoy essay, ``The Proper Study of Mankind''
includes ``Herzen and His Memoirs'' and the profoundly moving
``Conversations with Akhmatova and Pasternak''). Yet while such a
background long ago became commonplace in American intellectual
life _ indeed, the one comparable figure on this side of the
Atlantic, the late Columbia University art historian Meyer
Schapiro, was a Lithuanian Jew _ it is still regarded as exotic, at
best, in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that during World War II Berlin served in the
British Foreign Service (so insightful were his weekly dispatches
from Washington on US politics that they were prized by no less a
reader than Winston Churchill), and his diplomatic instincts, in
several senses of the term, were highly developed. There was
something almost ambassadorial about Berlin, not just in his easy
ability to negotiate different cultures (academic and civic,
Russian and British, Jewish and secular) but also in the
uninflected lucidity of his prose and the consistent stance of
detached observer maintained in his essays.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, the classic stance of philosophical
liberalism: the traditional British ideology of liberty. Its great
champion was John Stuart Mill, but Mill drew on centuries of
national practice as well as theory. Berlin came to it from afar.
As a boy, he saw a man murdered in the streets of Petrograd by a
revolutionary mob. He then saw his family gain refuge in a country
with a tradition of individual liberty. That personal history
helped make Berlin more native than the natives in his fervently
measured belief in freedom. ``Fervently measured'' is an odd
phrase, but no odder than a philosophy that simultaneously seeks to
respect individual rights and social norms. Ever distrustful of
ideological camps, Berlin applied to himself the one label that
abjures labeling: ``pluralist.''
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing essay in ``The Proper Study of Mankind,''
which easily qualifies as the most comprehensive introduction to
Berlin's work, is, of all things, a tribute to Franklin D.
Roosevelt. As it happens, Berlin was a master of panegyric, a
talent shown to excellent effect in ``Personal Impressions''
(1981), the most readerly of his books. Both the examples included
here, ``Winston Churchill in 1940'' and the Roosevelt essay,
memorably demonstrate Berlin's abilities as a celebrant. But what
makes the latter so striking is the extremely uncharacteristic
passion Berlin displays. It is unusual for an Englishman to look to
the United States for models of political leadership. Yet Berlin
clearly sees FDR, the 20th century's great master of the middle
way, as the 20th century's paradigmatic political figure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at a time when Marxist-Leninism barely exists and the
infallibility of the market is worshiped almost equally in
classroom and boardroom, we forget what a narrow margin someone
opposed to both once had to tread. Berlin's was a lonely voice of
restraint and mediation during much of the middle portion of this
century, equally opposed to the seductive simplicities of left and
right. (This unemphatic yet devout commitment to liberalism is
another element in the reverence with which he was held.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The best that can be done, as a general rule, is to maintain a
precarious equilibrium,'' he writes in ``The Pursuit of the
Ideal,'' the first essay in ``The Proper Study of Mankind.'' ``That
is the first requirement for a decent society; one that we can
always strive for, in the light of the limited range of our
knowledge, and even of our imperfect understanding of individuals
and societies. A certain humility in these matters is very
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin readily concedes that ``This may seem a very flat
answer''; but when contrasted with the sanguinary outcomes of this
century's more soaring manifestos, flatness is a small price to
pay. Far more than flatness, Berlin feared (as he notes in ``Two
Concepts of Liberty'') ``the vivisection of actual human societies
into some fixed pattern dictated by our fallible understanding of a
largely imaginary past or a wholly imaginary future.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way of describing this fallible understanding would be
to call it the worship of abstract ideals at the expense of flawed
reality. This worship, as well as both the good and the bad it led
to, derived from the Age of Reason. That Berlin could write so
searchingly about its shortcomings owed not a little to his
possessing himself an Enlightenment sensibility _ rational,
measured, Mozartean even _ but one that had eaten of the fruit of
the Tree of Knowledge. The Enlightenment did not believe in sin.
The Berlin who as a boy had seen utopian beliefs bloody the snow in
Petrograd knew otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The unsystematic nature of Berlin's writings means there is
repetition in his work. Perhaps the single most repeated item is
the citing of a remark of Kant's, ``Out of the crooked timber of
humanity no straight thing was ever made.'' That Berlin should so
often quote the greatest of Enlightenment thinkers expressing a
sentiment so antipathetic to the Age of Reason makes perfect sense.
For it was in the clash and mingle between Enlightenment and
Romanticism that Berlin came to specialize as a genealogist of
ideas. No one else has examined so searchingly what he called (in
his essay ``Nationalism: Past Neglect and Present Power'') the
``elements in a great mutation in western thought and feeling that
took place in the eighteenth century'' and the reaction against
them in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   First published in 1979, ``Against the Current'' may be the most
representative of Berlin's books. This new paperback edition
includes an exhaustive bibliography of his works, something of no
small value for anyone interested in an author who published so
variously and so often obscurely, as Berlin did. That publication
history contributed to his reputation as well: In practice, as in
thought, Isaiah Berlin never embraced the obvious.

IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP WITH REBA MCENTIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``new'' Nashville is a hotbed of changing scenes and faces,
so you can't blame some veteran country acts for having trouble
figuring it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive, and there are so many new people in
here these days that I don't know half of them,'' says singer Reba
McEntire. ``I have to go to the awards shows and watch the CMT
(Country Music Television) videos to catch up and keep familiar
with everyone. It is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but here's the rub. The newcomers also have to keep up with
Reba _ and that's never been easy for anyone. She remains one of
the hardest-working entertainers in any genre. She always seems to
have a new record, a new movie, a new concert tour. If this woman
rests, it's not often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a doer,'' she says with candid simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she's doing another concert tour with Brooks &AMP; Dunn.
Together, they had the top-grossing country tour of last year _ and
decided to do it again after recording a duet, ``If You See Him, If
You See Her,'' for McEntire's new CD, ``If You See Him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any plans to tour again until the song came
up,'' McEntire says of the track, co-written by Tommy Lee James,
Jennifer Kimball, and Terry McBride. ``But it's like family going
out with them. We toured together in 1992 and 1993 as well. They're
very easy to get along with. I know all of their crew and band.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntire, who has won numerous Grammy and Country Music
Association awards, is virtually country royalty at this point in
her 22-year career. She could likely demand constant headliner
status. Instead, she's willing to do a co-billing with Brooks &AMP;
Dunn, which means that they flip-flop the headlining role from
night to night. (There are also two opening acts, in Terry Clark
and David Kersh.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get your ego out of the way,'' says McEntire.
``But, you know, the best slot on the show is really the third act.
We all say that. So I think we're all flip-flopping for that third
slot instead of closing! It's not an ego thing with us, because we
get along so well. They understand what I've done and I understand
how successful they are. So we really respect each other and like
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, unlike last year, McEntire is again able to use a
large-scale stage production, complete with the choreography she so
loves. She had cut that way back last year in the wake of a skiing
accident in Park City, Utah, in which she broke her knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until you see the stage now! I've lost quite a bit of
weight running around that thing,'' she says. ``And I worked with
my choreographer, Jerry Evans, and got some new dance steps. My leg
is doing a lot better. It feels good. I've also had a personal
trainer and done a lot of physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you appreciate coming back and just being able to
walk. You don't take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's been her philosophy ever since she was a girl
in Oklahoma, the daughter of a rodeo competitor. It also explains
why she expects to return to skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'll go back and try it again,'' she says of skiing.
``It's kind of the way I was brought up. If I got thrown off a
horse, my daddy would always say, `Go, get back on. No matter what,
you got to get back on.'''
</P>
<P>
   McEntire also has starred in many movies, including ``Gambler
IV'' (with Kenny Rogers), in which she played a reformed madam. And
she has an upcoming film, ``Forever Love,'' due on CBS-TV in
September, in which she plays a woman who wakes up from a 20-year
coma to discover that her husband has changed radically and that
her 2-year-old daughter is now 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very heart-wrenching story,'' says McEntire. ``It's a
serious dramatic role, but I'm comfortable with it. And it has some
funny things in it. The writing is really good. ... You cry and you
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   The only misgiving of her recent career is that she had to give
up a role in the blockbuster film, ``Titanic.'' She auditioned for
director James Cameron and won the role of Molly Brown (later
played by Kathy Bates), but needed to give it up to fulfill some
concert commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the part, but then he needed me for another three months
beyond the three months we had already scheduled. And I had my
concert venues selected by that time,'' says McEntire.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have no regrets. Everything happens for a reason,'' she
adds. ``It would have been a wonderful movie to be a part of,
because it will in the history books forever as one of the greatest
movies of all time. But you can't cry over spilled milk. You've
just got to keep going.''

NEW `LOLITA' RISKS OFFENDING FOR ART'S SAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's plenty of irony in the American fate of director Adrian
Lyne's ``Lolita.'' The movie, based on Vladimir Nabokov's 1954
novel about the love affair between a middle-aged man and a
12-year-old girl, was deemed too controversial for American cinemas
by the distribution companies. Then it was rescued from oblivion by
Showtime and given a home in the one medium that will make it
available to the greatest number of people: television. And then,
emboldened by Showtime's courage, the Samuel Goldwyn Co. last month
decided to widen the movie's potential audience even further by
bringing it to theaters after all, with a one-week run in Los
Angeles before its premiere on the cable network, followed by a
limited national release that includes Boston in September.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a manner familiar to the media age, a nice bit of
notoriety has given a huge boost to the prospects of ``Lolita.''
Fortunately, this movie mostly deserves the added attention,
despite a few tonal problems and a lag in pace about two-thirds of
the way through.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night at 9, Showtime will provide the country with its
first glimpse of Lyne's film. By the end, as Humbert hears ``the
melody of children at play'' in the distance and realizes he has
robbed Lolita of her youth, you may find yourself wondering what
the big deal was all about. Yes, Lyne's ``Lolita'' is more open in
its sexual theme than Stanley Kubrick's version ever could have
been in 1962. There are carefully choreographed scenes in which we
actually see Humbert and Lolita sexually engaged. But it is
nonetheless a profoundly bleak story in which Humbert's obsession
is taunting and destructive, a tragedy that doesn't glamorize his
relationship with his nymphet of a stepdaughter even as it explores
the fetishistic details of his attraction to her.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: Lyne's ``Lolita'' is not an ``issue movie''
with plastic people that preachily condemns pedophilia;
screenwriter Stephen Schiff has not been co-opted by our current
awareness of child abuse, and those who won't accept anything other
than a screed will remain hostile to it. But there is certainly a
moral center in Lyne's adaptation, and that is more than you can
say for many of the blood-soaked movies sitting on top of the
weekly box-office returns.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this ``Lolita'' so risky, so potentially offensive,
and so artistically interesting is that Lyne and Schiff layer the
relationship between Jeremy Irons's Humbert and Dominique Swain's
Lolita with enough ambiguity to engage you in Humbert's view of
himself as a beau. The story is told through Humbert's eyes, as the
newly sexual Lolita appears to seduce him, slipping him her tongue
during an innocent kiss, sitting on his lap, knocking her leg
against his on the porch rocker. He's an intellectual boarder in
her mother's house in Ramsdale, but she sees him as a conquest not
too unlike the boys in school. This perspective makes the movie all
the more creepily effective, though that is what probably kept the
distributors away. Humbert, a teacher of French literature, is not
the cliched child-abuser we are accustomed to vilifying, and at
points in the movie he looks quite the victim of love himself, as
Lolita's attentions begin to wander to a mysterious other. ``Who is
it?'' Humbert begs repeatedly during a sexual encounter. Late in
their time together, Lolita offers sex in exchange for a raise in
allowance, and in that moment Humbert appears as debased as his
young lover.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``Lolita'' is the extremely fine
performance by Jeremy Irons, who seems born to play this role. If
Lyne and Schiff were trying to bring us inside the twisted mind of
Humbert, they couldn't have found a more skilled actor to do it.
His Humbert is like a schoolboy in a man's body, all vulnerability
to the whims of Lolita and secret plotting to keep her. He allows
us to sympathize with Humbert, to see the humanity within his
distorted consciousness and his selfish acts, to feel his
self-loathing and remorse. His Humbert is a creature of tortured
desperation and compulsion, and not snakelike cool. Irons also
provides the movie with its too few humorous moments, drugging his
new wife, Lolita's mother, so that he won't have to have sexual
relations with her. He then tests to be sure she's asleep by
holding a blaring radio up to her head (it's playing ``I'm in the
Mood for Love'').
</P>
<P>
   At points, the serious atmosphere becomes a little tiresome.
Perhaps because his previous efforts (including ``9 1/2 Weeks'' and
``Fatal Attraction'') have been considered exploitive, Lyne seems
to work overtime not to let his ``Lolita'' seem like anything but a
``literary'' adaptation. He restrains himself from having nasty fun
at the expense of Humbert and his suffering, choosing instead to
dress the movie in an artiness and an excess of melodrama that wear
thin in the last 45 minutes of the movie. As the power struggles
between Humbert and Lolita grow more intense, it's not a far cry
from ``The Young and the Restless.'' One of the defining pleasures
of Kubrick's ``Lolita'' was its ability to deploy Nabokov's black
humor, mostly thanks to the perfectly droll presence of James
Mason. While it's important for Lyne to fully portray Humbert's
romantic feelings for Lolita, it's even more important for him to
take a step back from those feelings with a dose of edginess, or
garishness, or mean laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne also gives his ``Lolita'' an overly sensual look, as the
camera moves along at a languid pace, grazing 1940s Midwestern
landscapes soaked in earth tones and bittersweet sunlight. This
heightened atmosphere feeds into Humbert's dazed, love-struck state
of mind, as he and Lolita motel-hop through the backwash of
America, but it undermines the distortion and agony of Humbert's
passion. It made me think of movies like Louis Malle's ``Damage,''
which also starred Irons, in the way its composed beauty manages to
strip the life out of the torment. It's only when an armed Humbert
confronts his nemesis, Clare Quilty _ the man who stole his Lolita
and then spit her out, the man who is everything awful about
Humbert taken to an extreme _ that the movie rustles up a healthy
sense of ugliness. This violent ending is jarring, but it punctures
the increasingly numbing dreaminess of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As Lolita, Swain is fine in a very difficult role, as she needs
to be both a seductress and a carefree 12-year-old girl with a
fondness for jawbreakers. Swain effectively manages to merge the
sexual woman and the carefree child, reveling in the vibrating bed
in a motel room, or reading a comic book while having sex with
Humbert. Only Melanie Griffith as Charlotte, Lolita's mother, seems
out of place in the movie, more 1990s than 1940s. Her role is
fairly small, so it doesn't spoil the chemistry between Irons and
Swain, a chemistry that is consistently fascinating, frightening,
and, sadly, believable.

ASKING 401(k) QUESTIONS CAN PAY OFF LATER

<TEXT>
<P>
   In today's world of retirement planning, it pays to make a pest
of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true when it comes to 401(k) retirement
savings plans offered by employers.
</P>
<P>
   That's because some employers are doing a lousy job of telling
their workers about their 401(k) programs, according to the
Financial Literacy Center in Kalamazoo, Mich., which educates
consumers on the basics of personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   The center said employers make common mistakes when it comes to
401(k) presentations, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Talking over workers' heads and failing to explain basic
concepts of saving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Failing to explain how to save more money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Placing too much emphasis on maxing out contributions to a
401(k), which just discourages poor savers from doing anything,
when employers should be teaching that even a 1 percent
contribution can add up over time.
</P>
<P>
   If this describes your employer, don't give up. It's up to you
to make sure you ask the right questions so that you get the most
out of your 401(k), which for most workers is the foundation for
their retirement savings program. The quality of the answers you
get will only be as good as the questions you ask.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to sharpen your questions is to make a list of
them.
</P>
<P>
   One reason many employees don't participate in a 401(k) plan is
because they feel they can't afford to have a certain amount of
their pay set aside for savings. If you feel that way, ask your
employer if there is a financial adviser you can approach who will
help you find money in your budget that will enable you to save in
the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   A crucial question is, what are the fees with the company's
401(k) plan and how much of those costs are borne by the employee?
That's crucial because fees take a bite out of your investment
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of plans now _ especially mutual funds _ the employees
are paying all of the expenses,'' said Joel Wehner, head of the
Houston office of Buck Consultants, an employee benefits consulting
firm. ``They may not see it because it's built into the investment
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fees pay for administration of a 401(k) plan, a trustee or
custodian to oversee plan assets and for plan audits by
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Ask whether your company will match your contribution. If so,
how much is the match? For example, is it 50 cents on every dollar
you contribute?
</P>
<P>
   Plans that have a company match are a godsend because it's free
money.
</P>
<P>
   You should always try to contribute enough to get the maximum
match payment from the company. said Theodore Benna, president of
the 401(k) Association in Cross Fork, Pa., an advocacy group for
401(k) participants.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, companies will match your contribution up to 3 to 6
percent of your annual pay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matching often doesn't begin when you start a job, so ask how
long you have to work at your company before you are eligible to
receive employer matching of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Don't stop when you reach the match level because there are
still tax advantages to saving within these plans. Find out what is
the maximum contribution you can make to your 401(k). You
personally can contribute up to $10,000 a year, excluding any
employer contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, you and your employer can contribute up to 25 percent
of your annual pay.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the investment options available for your 401(k)
money. Don't stop with a list of the mutual funds. Before picking
one, ask for copies of their prospectuses and pay close attention
to the investment philosophy of each fund and its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Find out how each fund has performed over at least five years.
The fund's reports to shareholders should have the data. You may
also call the fund or go to the Internet at www.morningstar.net and
get the data from Morningstar, which is a mutual fund research firm
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar publications may also be found at many libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Also see how often you can change your investments and
contributions to your 401(k). Generally, you don't have to pay any
fees when you make these changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences for employees of not fully utilizing their
401(k) could literally mean the difference between a comfortable
retirement and a much more pinched existence in later life,'' said
Julyette Jacobs, director of 401(k) investor education at the
Financial Literacy Center.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !!! ``Un Air de Famille''  Family dysfunction, Gallic-style. More
sweet than bitter, though, even as a fragile truce shatters and the
baggage and recriminations are heaped on the table during an
after-hours birthday dinner at a family-owned bistro. With less
insight, finesse, and compassion, it could grow hard to take _ but
the film sympathizes with its characters, and you likely will, too.

 &UR; ! 1/2 ``BASEketball''  &LR; Anyone who's ever watched ``South Park''
knows a little bit of crude comedy goes a long way. More proof
comes in this film starring ``South Park'' creators Matt Stone and
Trey Parker, a sewer of body fluids and gay jokes that just goes on
and on and on. Come back, Chris Farley, all is forgiven! (R) Renee

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FR)!!! 1/2 ``Ever &LR;   &UR; After''  &LR; Delightful retooling of the
Cinderella story, with gorgeous 16th-century French costumes and
settings and a thoroughly modern sensibility bubbling through its
fairytale romance. Drew Barrymore's Cinderella doesn't wait around
for a prince to rescue her, or a fairy godmother to provide magic.
Anjelica Huston brings surprising faceting to the stepmother,
rescuing her from campy caricature. (PG-13)

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! ``The Negotiator''  &LR; Crackling-good fire-and-ice leads _ Samuel
L. Jackson's hostage negotiator turned hostage-taker to clear his
name, and Kevin Spacey's negotiator coolly doing the job Jackson's
cop usually does _ can't save this initially interesting action
thriller from crumbling into punched-up formula that pushes it away
from gritty credibility. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! 1/2 ``The Parent Trap''  &LR; Glossy, earnest, but not terribly
involving remake of the 1961 original. Lindsay Lohan spunkily
recycles the double role originated by Hayley Mills, playing twin
sisters separated since birth, meeting, then scheming to reunite
their long-divorced parents. Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid
bring charm to those roles, but can't do much about the transparent
string-pulling _ not to mention the questionable idea that kids can
get divorced parents back together if they really try. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! ``Polish Wedding''  &LR; First-time filmmaker Theresa Connelly knows
the territory _ the Detroit Polish enclave known as Hamtramck _ but
can't seem to serve it up in more than overpitched sitcom terms.
That wastes the performances of Lena Olin as a dissatisfied earth
mother and Claire Danes as her daughter, who can't see she's
inherited her mom's unruly DNA. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! 1/2 ``The Saltmen of Tibet''  &LR; An achingly beautiful, if slow,
documentary about a remote, nomadic Tibet community making its
long, tradition-rich caravan to a fabled lake to collect salt
needed to trade for the grain that will ensure the village's
survival. (Unrated) Renee Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``The Well''  &LR; Impressive, highly charged debut from Aussie
filmmaker Samantha Lang. It casts an ever-deepening spell as it
spins a dark story about the shifting dynamic between two women in
an isolated outback setting. Miranda Otto is the naive but sexually
precocious young domestic who quickly sees her effect on Patricia
Rabe's long-repressed single woman, after which they play out an
intense and mutually needy but untenable relationship. (Unrated)

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I was given a schefflera in bad condition. I bought
a large pot, good potting soil and repotted the plant. I started
feeding it 1/4 teaspoon of Miracle Grow every time I watered it. It
was outside in shade three-quarters of the day. I was watering it
every other day, 2 gallons at a time, as the pot was the largest I
could find. All of a sudden, a spottiness appeared on the leaves. I
have flushed out the soil twice with water. I was told to add
coffee grounds, and have done so once a month. Can you tell me what
is wrong and what to do?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know the heat and drought makes us want to water, water,
water. But sometimes we overwater. Make sure the soil is not too
wet, especially in the lower half of the pot. The roots may be in
moist-to-wet soil when you're watering. Test for dryness with your
fingers. An overly wet soil causes leaves to yellow. However,
inadequate water also causes yellow foliage. Scheffleras like a
lightly moist soil.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, city water can contain a lot of calcium, which ties
up the iron in the soil. When we apply a lot of city water and a
plant cannot absorb needed iron, as well as magnesium, the result
is yellowish leaves. A soil on the acidic side will enable some
plants to absorb iron and magnesium. Azaleas are a good example.
Some gardeners use coffee grounds to help acidify soils.
</P>
<P>
   I would try moving the plant to bright shade, avoiding direct
sun if possible. Scheffleras do not like such heat. The ideal
temperature range for these plants does not exceed 70, but wouldn't
we all love that?
</P>
<P>
   Carefully monitor the watering. You might try using softened
water, if possible. And only use diluted applications of a balanced
fertilizer with trace elements. A standard house-plant fertilizer
is good. Do not use one with a lot of phosphorus, the element
represented by the middle number in the fertilizer formula. You
could try a diluted fish emulsion. Every two weeks may prove
adequate. It depends on how frequently you water, since frequent
watering washes nutrients from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Epsom salt sprinkled around the pot, then watered
in, will boost magnesium levels. Iron chelate, applied according to
package directions, will boost iron supplies, and in turn, help
green up your plant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought a beautiful shrub, ``Duranta repens.'' I read in a
garden book that the berries are poisonous. I know that meant
poisonous to humans, but what about birds? I love my birds and will
destroy the plant before bringing harm to wild birds.
</P>
<P>
   A: The berries will not harm the birds. Lantana, too, is a plant
with berries harmful to people, but not so to birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duranta repens,'' or golden dewdrop, is a great shrub with
arching branches that matures to 6 or 7 feet in height, and flowers
in summer. It likes sun to partial sun and good drainage. Flowers
may be lilac-blue or white. The small berries are yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I planted morning glory seed in spring. The vines are thick
and beautiful, but no flowers. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is possible your morning glory has received an abundance
of nitrogen and therefore is putting on a lot of growth at the
expense of flowers. Morning glories bloom best in full sun and in a
soil that's not overly rich in nitrogen and that is on the dry
side. Perhaps yours will come around. Sometimes they flower best in
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a compost pile that provides beautiful dirt. How can I
make mulch, instead?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope I am understanding your question. The product you make
in your compost pile can be used as a soil additive or as a mulch.
We mix fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells,
leaves and some grass clippings in our compost pile. When these
organic materials break down, we have a wonderful dark, crumbly
substance that I use to mix in garden soil to boost nutrients and
improve drainage. I also use the compost as a layer of mulch in
established beds. This works like the bagged pine bark mulch you
buy at garden centers _ it helps modify soil temperature; helps
maintain soil moisture; replenishes nutrients, which in turn
promotes plant health; and discourages weeds. I think a dark, clean
compost makes an attractive mulch.

IN OLD BOSTON, PRESERVING THE EVEN OLDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BOSTON'S ``CHANGEFUL TIMES'' 
Origins of Preservation and Planning in America 
By Michael Holleran. Johns Hopkins University Press. 
337 pp. Illustrated. $39.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hundreds of visitors, guidebooks in hand, to be seen along
the Freedom Trail on any summer's day provide certain evidence of
the importance of Boston's historical sites in making the city a
tourist destination. But in the 1880s, two of the best-known of
those sites, the Old State House and Old South Church, came
perilously close to being demolished.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Holleran notes in ``Boston's `Changeful Times,''' the
city might have been not just less attractive to visitors but a
much different place in general. In reporting the efforts to
preserve these familiar sites _ and the unsuccessful battle for
should-be landmarks such as John Hancock's house on Beacon Hill _
Holleran, an assistant professor of planning and design at the
University of Colorado, is actually explaining how the Boston of
the late 20th century came to be.
</P>
<P>
   For as ``the center of the city has been remade almost
completely'' in the years since the Great Fire of 1872, Holleran
writes, ``it has been remade around its landmarks _ all of the ones
identified by 19th-century preservationists, and many more that
have been added to the list.''
</P>
<P>
   And the same civic spirit that saved the landmarks of Boston's
colonial and revolutionary past, Holleran notes, created the
environment that allowed ``neighborhoods built for permanence''
like the Back Bay and ``neighborhoods resolutely defended'' like
Beacon Hill to ``mostly retain their intended qualities after a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   There were early, invariably unsuccessful efforts to preserve
several colonial-era structures, mainly churches encroached upon by
expanding commercial districts _ indeed, the title phrase
``Changeful Times'' comes from the 1849 effort to save the Second
Church in the North End. But Holleran sees the fight to save
Hancock's brick mansion in 1863 as ``a pivotal event.'' Its loss
was a case of missed opportunities. At the last minute, after the
site just west of the State House had been purchased, the building
was offered to the state for free, but only if it could be moved.
That could not be arranged, and demolition proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of this loss, writes Holleran, ``Bostonians had
gone beyond regretting the loss of urban landmarks to try saving
one. In later years they would find energy in the realizations of
both how close they had come to succeeding and how great was their
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Just six years later, the congregation of Old South Church
decided to follow those of other downtown churches to the Back Bay,
assuming that the sale of the Washington Street structure to a
commercial developer would pay for the new church. Despite a
spirited public campaign _ sparked by the oratory of reformer
Wendell Phillips and the scorn of historian Charles Francis Adams _
the Old South Society won the right to dispose of the structure,
and it was auctioned off in June 1876 _ the irony of the timing
noted in a Boston Globe cartoon titled ``Centennial Patriotism
Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Demolition of the steeple had actually begun when a local
merchant secured a week's delay and set off a successful campaign
to raise money to save the structure, a banner hung from the
steeple asking: ``Does Boston desire the humiliation which is
to-day a part of her history since she has allowed this memorial to
be sold under the hammer?''
</P>
<P>
   Holleran correctly identifies the ``Brahmin aristocracy'' as a
key factor in making Boston ``one of the earliest centers of urban
preservationism.'' And as he sees it, the fact that the city's
wealth was ``held by a stable elite, closely identified with and
involved in community affairs, made for less resistance in Boston
than elsewhere to public regulation of property.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement of the city's old Yankee elite by an emerging
Irish leadership appears to have triggered more verbal conflict
than actual change. Typical was the threat by Mayor James Michael
Curley's building commissioner to tear down the colonial
Shirley-Eustis Mansion in Roxbury for building-code violations. A
further exploration of this issue would have been worth another
dozen pages or so, if not an entire chapter.
</P>
<P>
   This is an important book for understanding the development of
modern Boston _ both its physical structure and its historical
ambience. With its focus on what was preserved rather than what was
lost, ``Boston's `Changeful Times''' belongs on the shelf next to
Walter Muir Whitehill's classic study, ``Boston: A Topograpical
History.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of just how much the city ``has been remade around
its landmarks'' is all around. In recent years, the bank building
at Washington and School streets (now a bookstore) was tapered to
create a plaza across from Old South Church.
</P>
<P>
   And as for those tourists along the Freedom Trail, one does not
have to ask whether they would have been lured to Boston by the
``shaft or other monument'' &UR;  &LR; that was proposed to replace the Old
State House, or the ``attractive model of the old church'' that was
proposed to be placed on whatever building replaced Old South.

CURTIS THANKS HORROR FANS BY REVISITING `HALLOWEEN' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After making five horror films in three years, Jamie Lee Curtis
was tired of being America's scream queen.
</P>
<P>
   She'd screamed through her film debut in 1978's ``Halloween,''
the most successful independent film ever on a budget-to-earnings
basis. (Cost: $325,000; domestic gross: $47 million.)
</P>
<P>
   She'd also shrieked and cringed in knockoffs such as ``Prom
Night,'' ``Terror Train'' and ``The Fog,'' as well as a Halloween
sequel she couldn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it was time to move on. But now it's time to come back
_ in ``Halloween: H20,'' due in theaters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my career to `Halloween,''' Curtis said. ``I felt the
audience who'd given me that career deserved this.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, 39, hadn't made a horror film in 17 years. Instead, she
carved a career with riotous comedies (``Trading Places,'' ``A Fish
Called Wanda''), tender dramas (``My Girl,'' ``Forever Young'') and
a costly action romp (``True Lies'').
</P>
<P>
   But old ghosts die hard _ just like ``Halloween'' bogeyman
Michael Myers. So when Curtis saw the film's 20th anniversary lying
dead ahead, she decided to take another stab.
</P>
<P>
   She knows ``H20's'' title can be misconstrued as the symbol for
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Costner's water movie was so successful that we thought
we'd jump on the bandwagon,'' Curtis said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I came up with an ad line that was on the first
poster mock-up _ `Blood is thicker than water' _ tying in
beautifully to the `H20.' But the real `H2O,' obviously, means a
20th anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the movie didn't take any arm-twisting: It was her idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they'd been trying to get me back all these
years,'' Curtis said. ``I actually went after this. It was
completely my call.''
</P>
<P>
   She also helped steer the story.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Halloween,'' director John Carpenter introduced Curtis as
Laurie Strode, a baby-sitting teen tormented by Myers, a masked,
mute killer wielding large kitchen knives.
</P>
<P>
   Their saga continued in 1981's ``Halloween II,'' which resumed
the story on the same night and established Myers and Strode as
siblings. (She'd been adopted by another family after their parents
were killed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``H20'' _ the series' seventh film _ ignores four more sequels
that didn't feature Curtis' character. Instead, its story picks up
20 years later, when Strode has become headmistress of a prep
school in rural California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if we made a movie about Laurie and the horror of
horror films _ that this woman's life was devastated by Michael
Myers _ then we could give her a chance to redeem her life by
facing him,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   She took her idea to Carpenter and his co-writer on
``Halloween,'' Debra Hill. They went to Dimension, which owns the
rights to the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dimension hadn't released `Scream' yet, so we weren't catching
on the coattails of a hit,'' Curtis said. ``Of course, after
`Scream' came out, this went onto a faster track.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike `Scream' and its imitators, `H20' doesn't dote on teens
(though some do arise, including Josh Hartnett as Curtis' son).
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it's an adult's story, with Strode taking center stage,
Adam Arkin as a teacher who's her love interest and LL Cool J as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film is a thank-you note to my fans who have loved that
movie and supported me for 20 years,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guaranteed (Dimension) that the audience would be with us. I
joked that it was Field of Screams: If you build it, they will
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimension's chiefs were still nervous about the seriousness of
the film, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The redemption of a human soul that's been taken away by a
violent act is a heavy notion for a horror movie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I kept drilling this point to the writers: If you give
Laurie an opportunity to run away, and she runs, she'll be running
for the rest of her life. But if she turns around and faces her
fear, even if she dies, she'll get her soul back.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said Carpenter was unable to make the movie because of
conflicting projects. ``H20'' wound up with Steve Miner, who'd
directed two ``Friday the 13th'' films as well as ``Forever
Young.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``H20'' was finished, test-screening scores went through
the roof, and its release was moved from fall to early August.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz has been so strong that other films have scurried from
``H20's'' release date _ including Curtis' own ``Virus,'' now set
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Virus'' sounds scary (invading aliens consider humans a
virus), Curtis said it's ``pure sci-fi.'' Between ``Halloween II''
and ``H20,'' her only movie that was even marginally in the horror
genre was 1993's ``Mother's Boys,'' in which she played the
violently possessive mother of a fractured family.
</P>
<P>
   Staying away from the genre ``was very deliberate,'' Curtis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little bit of show-biz savvy I inherited from my family
clearly paid off in realizing, after I'd gotten a very nice
foothold, that if I continued to ply my trade in that field, I'd be
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents are actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, who divorced
when she was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis has been married for 14 years to actor-director
Christopher Guest; they have two adopted children and live in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis and her mother co-starred for Carpenter in 1980's ``The
Fog,'' and Curtis joined Leigh in Houston in 1977 when Leigh was
filming ``Murder at the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Now mother and daughter are reunited again: Leigh plays Curtis'
secretary in ``H20.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of many nods, homages and tips of the horror hat
sprinkled throughout ``H20.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother apes lines from the first `Halloween' movie,''
Curtis said. ``She also drives a car that's the same kind she drove
in `Psycho.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``H20'' also has audio of the late Donald Pleasence, who fought
Myers in all but one of the movies, and it features Nancy Stephens,
who played Pleasence's nurse.
</P>
<P>
   It includes Carpenter's familiar theme music, is shot in
Panavision like the first film, and shows clips from other horror
films.
</P>
<P>
   In this case it's from ``Scream 2'' _ just as the first
``Scream'' had clips from ``Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In one line I say, `Drive down to the Beckers,' and that's a
line from the first `Halloween' but uses a name from `Scream'
instead,'' Curtis said. ``You can really have fun with
connect-the-dots on these movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about milking this. We had this idea before `Scream'
came out. It just so happens the genre was reinvigorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it was always, `Look, we have one opportunity to make a
20th-anniversary movie, so let's take it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis realizes that horror films often fall into formulaic
ruts, but she still feels the genre should get more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent 20 years defending my work as an actor,'' she said.
``People don't understand horror. `Halloween' was the `Easy Rider'
of horror films, which is why it has so much resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked really hard on this new movie. The first sequel
wasn't very good at all, but this one is special. It's difficult
work for an actor, and I'm proud of what we did. I hope the fans
will be, too.'' &QL;

TAKE A GOOD LOOK BEFORE CONVERTING REGULAR IRA TO A ROTH IRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We retired this May, earning enough to qualify for IRA
contributions this year, but not so much as to affect our ability
to collect full Social Security payments. Our tax man suggested
that since this is the last year that we will be able to purchase
an IRA that we establish a Roth IRA for this year and also transfer
our exiting IRAs to Roth accounts. We know very little of this, and
don't understand most of what we've read, except that we would have
to pay taxes on our old IRAs if we transferred them to Roths. Each
IRA is about $50,000 and they are in bank CDs. Would a transfer be
advisable at our ages _ 62 and 64? We will be in the 28 percent
bracket for this year, and in 1999 we will have Social Security, a
small pension, and interest earned _ which we hope will mean we
will go down to the 15 percent tax bracket. Which way should we go?
</P>
<P>
   F.W., Orion, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With all respect to your tax adviser, I can see nothing to
gain either by establishing Roth IRAs for this year or converting
the traditional IRAs to Roth accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Let's do the math. If you were to convert the traditional IRAs
to Roths, you would be allowed to spread the tax obligation over
the course of four tax years. This would mean that $25,000 would be
added to your income in each of the next four years. This year that
$25,000 would be taxed at the 28 percent rate _ unless the amount
is sufficient to push you into a still higher bracket. In the next
three years, the same amount would be added to your income, and
again would probably be enough to drive you to a higher tax
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   In the alternative, if you retain the accounts as traditional
IRAs, you will have a little more control over your tax destiny.
For example, you might look at your tax situation each year,
determine how much money you might be able to withdraw from the
IRAs without taking you beyond the 15 percent tax bracket, and
simply withdraw that amount. With luck, over the long haul, most of
the money eventually would be taxed at only 15 percent, rather than
at the higher rates that you would pay through with a transfer to a
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule of thumb for a transfer to a Roth is that it is
inadvisable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when the
money is withdrawn than when the proposed transfer would occur.
Some people, and especially people who are a lot younger than you
are, might decide that they want to make a transfer because they
feel tax rates in general are likely to be higher in their later
years. And finally, some might make the transfer without regard to
the tax rates, but rather because they want to escape the schedule
of mandatory minimum annual withdrawals from traditional IRAs which
begin after the owner reaches age 70 1/2. Unless you fall into this
last category, I see nothing for you to gain by transferring to a
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, I see no reason you would profit by putting
your 1998 IRA contributions into Roth accounts. Since you're in the
28 percent tax bracket, you would cut your tax bill by $1,120 with
a traditional IRA. Compare that with the prospect of withdrawals at
the 15 percent, which might be made as early as 1999, and which
would bring a $600 tax bill if you are in a 15 percent tax bracket.
Yes, the growth of the account would also be taxed if you used the
traditional IRA, but especially when you are using CDs as the
vehicle for your IRA savings, the growth is not likely to be enough
to offset the difference between a 15 percent and a 28 percent tax
rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am as spooked about the market as you are. My wife and I
have IRAs with Vanguard. My total is about $803,000, of which
$603,000 is in the Vanguard GNMA fund, $20,000 in its Specialized
Gold and Precious Metals fund, $131,000 in a brokerage account, and
the rest in Vanguard Prime Money Market fund. My wife's $63,000
account is entirely in Vanguard GNMA. I am 66 and retired, and my
wife is 60. Am I too conservative?
</P>
<P>
   I also have IRAs with Janus, consisting of $96,000 in money
markets, $31,000 in Janus Worldwide and $3,000 in Janus Twenty. I
am thinking of moving $4,000 a month from the Janus money market
fund to Worldwide for four or five years as a dollar cost-averaging
approach. Should I do the same with Vanguard, moving funds from the
money market account into Vanguard Index Value fund?
</P>
<P>
   E.O., Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd say you're a good deal more spooked with our stock market
than I am. Your brokerage portfolio is heavily dominated by foreign
stocks; between that portfolio, the 25 percent of Janus Worldwide
that's in U.S. equities, and the small position in Janus 20, I
calculate just 2.7 percent of the total portfolio in domestic
stocks. (This calculation does not include the Vanguard Specialized
Gold and Precious Metals holding, which is about 20 to 25 percent
invested in US companies, but not necessarily US companies with
most of their operations here.)
</P>
<P>
   Are you too conservative? Yes, and you're too sour on the US
markets as well. While I agree that they're overvalued right now,
at age 66 you're simply too young to throw in the towel on the
world's strongest economy. I think a dollar cost-averaging program
moving the Vanguard money market account into Index Value is a good
idea _ a program of moving $1,100 a month into Index Value would
complete the investment within 49 months, presuming 5 percent
average returns from the money market.
</P>
<P>
   As for the more substantial amount of money in the Janus money
market fund, I agree that it should be moved to the equity side,
but I think you have enough overseas holdings already. I'd rather
see a dollar-cost-averaging program with tried-and-tested Janus
fund as the target for about 75 percent of this money, and with
Vanguard Specialized Health Care as the target for the balance.
(Incidentally, you have miscalculated in determining that a
sequence of $4,000 monthly withdrawals from the Janus Money Market
account would spread your investment over four or five years; it
would take only a little more than 25 months. A 48-month program
would entail moving about $2,200 a month, while a 60-month program
would require $1,800 monthly purchase of the stock funds; both of
these calculations again assume 5 percent money market returns.)
</P>
<P>
   Where would all of this take us? Currently the total equity
portion of the portfolio is 18.6 percent of the portfolio. If all
of the transfers discussed were completed at once (rather than
spread out over several years) the new portfolio would be 33.1
percent equities, and 17.3 percent of it would be in US equities.
Given the vagaries of the markets, it is of course impossible to
estimate what the actual percentages might be by the time the
investments are completed. But in any event, none of these moves
would affect the bedrock of your combined portfolios _ the
$666,763, or 66.9 percent of the total, in Vanguard GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   Are all of these suggestions too rich for your blood? Well, if
so, what about a compromise? You might doctor the formula by
building the equity side to 25 percent of the total portfolio,
which would entail moving only $64,184 of the money market accounts
into stock funds. Again, if you made this move I would go entirely
into US equity funds with this money. That would leave $130,658 in
the money markets. At this point you certainly have plenty of the
Vanguard GNMA fund, and I suggest that if you take this course the
$130,658 be evenly divided between Vanguard Short-Term Bond fund
and Vanguard Corporate High-Yield Bond fund.

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Cousin Cousine''  &LR; _ Jean-Charles Tacchella's
1975 French comedy is a marvelous recollection of wispy Gallic
romance at its best. Marie-Christine Barrault's breezy sexiness
sets the tone for a movie about infidelity that's remarkably
faithful to its aesthetic parameters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Quicksilver Highway'' &LR;  _ Christopher Lloyd stars as a bizarre
storyteller who weaves two horrifying tales in this surprisingly
effective chiller. Beware of graphic scenes, but it's a terrific
find. While the stories are visually engaging, it's Lloyd's
old-fashioned monologues that gives ``Quicksilver'' its zest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Jackie Brown''  &LR; _ Quentin Tarantino's homage to the
blaxploitation films of the '70s hits all the right notes but
mostly at the wrong time. Rent ``Foxy Brown'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Blues Brothers 2000''  &LR; _ The Blues Brothers without John
Belushi? C'mon. It's like Laurel without Hardy or Abbott without
Costello. Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Deceiver'' &LR;  _ A fine cast including Tim Roth, Chris Penn,
Renee Zellweger, Michael Rooker, Ellen Burstyn, and Rosanna
Arquette is wasted in the set-bound police procedural. The plot
meanders.

Dominican Republic in 15 minutes, and those aboard were in a
festive mood. Many arrived for this required drill carrying and
sipping tropical beverages. Others chatted about dinner plans or
exchanged jokes. One teen-ager bounced a basketball on the open
deck; another rocked to an apparent musical beat emanating from
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   As a ship's officer began detailing safety information over the
public-address system, crew members tried gamely to maintain order.
But only a few passengers paid attention. After all, this wasn't
school. Or the office. These weren't teachers. Or bosses. This was
vacation. Party time.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an unfamiliar experience, either.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, I was sitting on the sofa-bed in my stateroom,
mesmerized by dramatic pictures transmitted live by satellite to my
television screen. Pictures of another ship _ Carnival's Ecstasy _
partially engulfed in flames off the Florida coast. Pictures of
passengers, many wearing life jackets and no doubt scared for their
lives, huddled on another open deck.
</P>
<P>
   We know now that all aboard escaped serious injury, that the
blaze was quickly extinguished. But as I watched, my immediate
reaction was to pray that those Ecstasy passengers had taken the
safety drill seriously.
</P>
<P>
   I felt a special bond, too: Only a year earlier, the Society of
American Travel Writers' Editors Council had convened our annual
workshop aboard the Ecstasy. Our meetings were conducted at the
extreme rear of the ship _ now all but obscured by smoke in the
televised footage.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't feel was fear: I knew that this was a rare
occurrence. I knew that the Ecstasy _ like the vessel on which I
was traveling, like the jetliner that had brought me to the
Caribbean, like the thousands of hotels where I'd stayed over the
years _ had a good track record for safety. Not one passenger has
died in a fire aboard a cruise ship during this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But accidents do happen. And the Ecstasy should serve as a
reminder to all travelers _ on sea and land _ that understanding
and heeding safety regulations are not trivial matters.
</P>
<P>
   How many among us allow our minds to drift when a flight
attendant talks about oxygen masks and emergency exits? Do white
lights lead to red lights? Or red to white? Heard it all before,
you say? Not necessarily. Safety guidelines vary by aircraft. In
any case, how intrusive can a two-minute refresher course be?
</P>
<P>
   How many among us study the fire emergency instructions posted
near the doors of our hotel or motel rooms?
</P>
<P>
   I've never experienced a serious emergency on an airplane or a
cruise ship, but I've been rousted from hotel rooms in the dead of
night by fire alarms from Anchorage, Alaska, to San Diego. Some
were false signals, others real scares. Several rooms in one hotel
_ rooms precariously close to mine _ were reduced to ashes. So,
yes, I do memorize the nearest fire exits.
</P>
<P>
   I familiarize myself with all the controls of a rental car, too,
before starting the ignition. I learned the importance of that
ritual the hard way: Late for an appointment one afternoon in
Birmingham, Ala., I plunged into my rental vehicle, pointed toward
a freeway and suddenly found myself in a torrential rainstorm. No
matter where my frantic fingers fumbled, I couldn't locate the
windshield wipers. Ever experienced the sensation of blindness at
60 mph? It's a miracle the car didn't crash.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us at home respect the importance _ and legal obligation
_ of buckling seat belts in our personal vehicles. But when we go
on vacation and hop aboard a scenic trolley or tour bus or into a
taxi, our sound judgment is too often clouded by a quest for
carefree adventure.
</P>
<P>
   No matter our choice of escape _ frolicking in the surf just off
a remote beach or splashing in a crowded hotel pool; hiking and
camping in an unfamiliar wilderness or roaming the streets of a big
city; drifting on a sailboat in Galveston Bay or dancing on a
cruise ship in the Caribbean _ our safety, and that of all around
us, should be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   It is top priority with cruise-ship officials. Laws mandate a
passenger fire drill within 24 hours of departure; most occur
moments before or after the initial sailing. Typically, officers
and crew members participate in a separate drill every week.
</P>
<P>
   But effective safety-related communication, like all
communication, requires mutual participation. Our participation.
</P>
<P>
   During this recent cruise, several passengers were joking with
the captain about airlines showing ``Titanic'' on in-flight movie
screens en route to the Caribbean. The Titanic's fate, the captain
assured them, would never happen today, given advancements in
maritime technology. ``But ever since that movie became popular,
more passengers are asking about safety and thinking about safety,
and that's a good sign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me if I seem to preach; it's not my nature. It's not my
intention, either, to dissuade one person from getting maximum
enjoyment from his or her vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no need to be paranoid about travel. We just
need to be smart.

THIS SUMMER, HOLLYWOOD HAS MADE MORE THAN BIG NOISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overfed and undernourished. That's us culture consumers in the
junk-food '90s, penned up like cattle in a feed lot, blown up on
steroids, delivered numbed to the next pummeling. Or so it could
have been, a summer like any other summer on the way to the
millennium, if you stuck to the assaultive likes of ``Armageddon,''
``Godzilla,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``The
X-Files.'' Many moviegoers did. ``Armageddon'' is on its way to
selling $200 million worth of tickets in the United States. Even
``Godzilla,'' written off as a disappointment, took in over $100
million, a sum once regarded as significant money.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a message coming from the multiplexes this summer,
too. Drowned out in some quarters, perhaps, by the amped-up
decibels of the high-tech demolition derby of the week, but there
to be heard beneath the noisy clobber of movies that seemed visual
metaphors for big heavy things being dropped on our heads from a
great height: comets, reptiles, marketing campaigns. Unheralded,
but unavoidable, substance staged a comeback at the movies this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it. Two years ago, Hollywood could come up with only
one studio movie to enter in its own Oscar race, and that was a
romantic sports comedy, an enjoyable one, but hardly a pinnacle:
``Jerry Maguire.'' This summer, we have seen no less than four
films worthy of Oscar recognition, including the one that at this
point is the film to beat, Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' Its D-Day scene of the Omaha Beach landing already is an
instant cinema classic. It simply outdoes any previous war movie in
its ability to plunge audiences into the midst of war's carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Esthetically, Spielberg won the battle when he decided to film
``Saving Private Ryan'' in the gritty manner of a World War II
documentary newsreel, draining away color except for the color of
blood, wedding hand-held style to the chaos into which the soldiers
sent to rescue Private Ryan were plunged. Abandoning the usual
storyboarding, Spielberg shot the film in sequence, in
semi-improvisatory style, with a cast consisting largely of actors
who were filmmakers themselves, ranging from Tom Hanks to Edward
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Morally, Spielberg's film has the weight and depth it needs. Its
violence is not only justifiable, but indispensable, given his
determination to present the subject _ in equal parts heroic and
horrific _ truthfully. There's lots of brutal, unsparing death in
``Saving Private Ryan.'' But there's all the difference between the
deaths depicted here and the deaths in, say, ``Lethal Weapon 4.''
In the latter, the pileup of corpses is intended to entertain. The
death in ``Saving Private Ryan'' is depicted with dignity, with
serious intent. Context is everything. Not a special effect in
sight, and who needs one?
</P>
<P>
   Amusingly, it isn't a cadre of young reformers that has been
leading Hollywood away from empty special-effects spectacles and
back toward substance, but veterans who are growing old, yet
thinking young. The most radical film out of Hollywood this summer
may be Robert Redford's ``The Horse Whisperer.'' In a culture of
clamor, it's a 2 1/2-hour film about patience and the need for time
to be part of any healing equation. Stillness is the star of its
most memorable scene, in which Redford's empathetic horse healer
simply kneels in a field for hours and waits for a spooked horse to
calm down and walk back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a climate of insufferable cant where lively political
debate should be, along came Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth.'' His
California senator, too zonked-out with self-disgust to bother to
play the game any longer, starts running off at the mouth, refusing
to fall back on the usual cliches, making more sense the closer he
approaches delirium. He's Dostoevsky's Holy Fool, Southern
California style, ripping away the platitudes lying like tarpaulins
over the root causes of society's stacking of the deck against the
disenfranchised. ``Bulworth'' is too radical in its laser-beam
jeremiads to achieve megagrosses, but it remains a blast of fresh,
invigorating air in a climate otherwise drenched in the smug
flatulence of special-interest groups providing the customary wall
of sound that passes for political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``The Truman Show'' revisits a couple of meaty themes
that Jim Carrey only partly developed in his venturesome but
off-putting ``Cable Guy.'' Ironies pile up like snow in an Alpine
avalanche in ``The Truman Show.'' It's a film about the way TV has
colonized real life, becoming so pervasive and powerful that we
serve it instead of the reverse, taking our cues from it, shaping
our responses to its defining influence, falsifying ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the subject of so-called reality-based TV, the life
of Carrey's Truman is removed from reality and rendered synthetic.
With a surprising performance from Ed Harris, who trades in his
usual working-class guy to play god as TV producer, and a chance
for Carrey to layer some emotional appeal into his usual sunny fool
(turned, on this occasion, victim), ``The Truman Show'' is a
brilliant pop-culture fable. It will not be lost upon the observant
that this film inveighs against film's ultimate destination and
profit center. Yup, TV.
</P>
<P>
   Audience embrace of such seemingly retro films as ``The Mask of
Zorro,'' ``There's Something About Mary,'' and ``Out of Sight''
also makes one wonder if there isn't something blowing in the wind
at the multiplexes, something that speaks of rejection of the
merely effects-laden juggernauts. Although ``Zorro'' is animated by
the wit and style of Anthony Hopkins as the old Zorro and the
roguish tongue-in-cheek sexiness of Antonio Banderas as his
sucessor behind the mask, its motor is the exuberant gymnastic
swordplay that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. invented when he filmed it in
1920 _ effects executed by humans, not computers.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``There's Something About Mary'' _ in which Ben
Stiller, Matt Dillon, and Lee Evans play R-rated versions of Larry,
Moe, and Curly as they go into raunchy orbit around Cameron Diaz's
sweet, sunny, oblivious Snow White _ attests to a need to escape
the withering puritanism of current political correctness,
especially as it has been applied to the arena of sex in the era of
AIDS, with enthusiastic prodding from the conservative right. There
are times when base instincts become basic instincts, and while
it's silly to pretend that ``There's Something About Mary'' is more
than a lowlife guy film, its outrageous sex-soaked sight gags
obviously are meeting a widespread need that can't be blamed on El
 &UR; gfspanish &LR; Nino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight,'' in which George Clooney finally seems like a
movie star, relaxed and authoritative in a laid-back way, and
Jennifer Lopez dissolves any lingering incompatibility between
sexiness and toughness, is a throwback to the days of wit and
character and playfulness in crime thrillers, before they were
replaced with stridency. The rush to retro low-tech pleasures is
clear. So is the message it sends. Roller-coaster rides and
jackhammer music videos masquerading as movies are losing their
novelty value, especially if the roller coasters are empty and the
strummers are all playing air guitar.

MIXED MESSAGES ON TEEN BEER, TOBACCO USE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sometimes, we give mixed messages.
</P>
<P>
   A cigarette billboard that used to occupy a prominent space
along my normal route to work is no longer there, thanks to Texas'
lawsuit settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of hundreds of tobacco billboards to come down all
over the state in an effort to reduce the temptation for teen-agers
to smoke. The idea is to discourage young Texans from getting
hooked on a dangerous product that is illegal for them to consume
but that thousands of them consume anyway.
</P>
<P>
   These billboards carry other messages now. A handful even
display anti-smoking warnings. Most, however, simply hawk other
products.
</P>
<P>
   The one on my way to work was advertising a well-known brand of
beer last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the last time I checked the law, beer also was an illegal
product for teen-agers to consume, and there is absolutely no
reason to think that young people will pay any less attention to
the beer billboard than they did to the cigarette ad that it
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is that the tobacco industry
voluntarily agreed to remove its billboard advertising in Texas _
and agreed to cough up $17.3 billion _ to settle the state's
lawsuit over public health-care costs associated with smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers weren't acting out of the goodness of their
hearts. Their lawyers and accountants simply advised them that it
was better for business to settle than to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Texas didn't sue the alcoholic beverage industry, and beer
companies continue to exercise their right to advertise largely as
they choose. I don't argue with that because there are free speech
considerations inherent in advertising, although the content of
some beer ads, particularly on television, obviously appeals to
teens.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope that removal of the cigarette ads will prove to be
an important step forward in promoting healthy lifestyles and
respect for the law among young Texans. But there also is the risk
that well-intentioned grown-ups may simply be giving teen-agers
another excuse to laugh at them.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think that some young people haven't noticed the
conflicting signals.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lewis, a spokesman for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said
a number of teen-agers attending a MADD youth camp this summer
detected an inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were asking why is all the attention being focused on
banning tobacco and tobacco ads, and beer companies are getting by
with no attention at all,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue that there are some differences in the products,
namely that cigarettes, when used the way they were intended to be
used, can eventually kill you, although tobacco companies have
spent untold millions of dollars over the years trying to hide that
fact from people who got hooked on smoking as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol, when used in moderation, doesn't pose the same health
risks for most people, but the fact remains that both products are
equally illegal in the hands of minors.
</P>
<P>
   And more high school seniors use alcohol than tobacco, according
to surveys by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on tobacco billboards gave Attorney General Dan Morales,
other anti-tobacco crusaders and the tobacco industry itself a big
publicity splash. It wasn't as big as the size of the tobacco
settlement itself, but then few things are as big as $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It will be several years, however, before we know whether the
removal of the billboards and other anti-tobacco education efforts
that may be funded by the settlement money will have any
appreciable effect on teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state government also is attempting to clamp down in
less publicized ways on both underage smoking and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, before Morales negotiated the settlement of the
tobacco suit, the Legislature already had toughened state law
against teens caught smoking.
</P>
<P>
   People younger than 18 who are caught smoking or possessing
tobacco products can have their driver's licenses _ prized
possessions for most young people _ suspended for as long as six
months. But it also is too early to predict whether that sanction
will be the deterrent that health advocates hope it will be.
</P>
<P>
   A lot will depend on how actively police officers, who have
plenty of other things to do, issue citations to teen smokers. Most
young people, after all, can recognize the difference between smoke
and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers last year also enacted a ``zero tolerance'' law that
allows officials to suspend the driver's licenses of minors caught
driving with even a trace of alcohol on their breath.

PATERNITY CLAIMS TRAIL PATRIOTS STAR COATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Scattered among the family pictures
hanging on the walls of Sherri Hauser's modest condominium are
snapshots of New England Patriots All-Pro Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   For 6-year-old Bre'yana Hauser, the pictures are the only link
to her father, whom she hasn't seen in two years, according to her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asks where Daddy is and I tell her he is at work,'' Sherri
Hauser said of Coates. ``It's sad. He has never been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser is one of at least four women, only one of whom Coates
has married, who have five daughters among them fathered by the
football player.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth woman has filed papers in North Carolina seeking child
support for her 8-year-old daughter, but has been unable to get
Coates to submit to a paternity test _ something he did for two of
his other children.
</P>
<P>
   The private life of Coates, the highest paid tight end in the
National Football League, became public last week when he was
arrested for allegedly assaulting the mother of one of his children
outside his home in Franklin, Mass. He pleaded not guilty, and is
scheduled to be back in court Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the alleged assault, the 28-year-old Coates was
portrayed by his representatives as a responsible parent who has
provided financial support for his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been responsible,'' his agent, Michael George, said
Saturday. ``He has done what he is required to do and more.''
Coates has declined comment, as has his lawyer, citing pending
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   But court filings in North Carolina and South Carolina and
interviews with some of the women provide a more complicated
portrait of the star tight end.
</P>
<P>
   In three of the cases, Coates was reluctant to provide financial
support for his children, and did so only after the women filed
court action against him. In two of those cases, the courts ordered
the Patriots to deduct the child support payments from Coates's
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, Coates pays about $950 a month in child support
to each mother _ an amount that is less than 1 percent of his
average monthly gross pay from the Patriots. He has filed a motion
opposing an increase in support.
</P>
<P>
   Coates is hardly alone among professional athletes who have
fathered several children out of wedlock. In May, Sports
Illustrated produced a special report on the huge number of
professional athletes who have done so, quoting one NBA agent who
said he spends more time on paternity claims than contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, athletes have ample opportunities for sexual
encounters, and the increase in out-of-wedlock births is a societal
trend _ a 1995 study by the National Center for Health Statistics
found that the unmarried birth rate rose 54 percent from 1980 to
1992.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the number of out-of-wedlock children fathered by
athletes is staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Coates's former Patriots teammate, David Meggett, released by
the club earlier this year after being charged with sexual assault
_ a charge later dropped _ had five children with four women, none
of whom he married.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Coates has stressed the importance of good parenting.
Last year, he urged students at a school in Southport, N.C., to
respect their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is to pretty much obey your parents and do what you
can to complete your education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked of the dangers of life in the NFL and ``younger
guys who are not used to that kind of money and just blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile from the school where he spoke to the
impressionable youngsters lives a former college classmate of
Coates who says he is the father of her 8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Justina Evans said she showed the baby to Coates, who joined the
NFL in 1991, when they were in college and told him he was the
father. ``He just said the baby didn't look like him and walked
away,'' she said. It was the last time he saw the child, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of Coates said he has never heard of the woman.
North Carolina officials said Evans has had &UR;  &LR; an open child support
enforcement case against Coates &UR;  &LR; since 1990, but the case has been
stalled because Coates has not been tested for paternity. The
official could not explain why Coates had not been tested or if he
had been formally notified of the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who works full-time as a chef at a nearby island resort,
said getting financial support from Coates is not as important as
his acknowledging paternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not a big issue. We have made it so far,'' she said.
``I want my daughter to know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Hauser, who also met Coates at Livingston College in
Salisbury, N.C., said she was forced to go to court to collect
child support after Coates told her he would not pay.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of child support enforcement authorities in North
Carolina and South Carolina, she filed a complaint against Coates
in 1992. Coates insisted on a paternity test, which was conducted
in 1994. The test found he was the father.
</P>
<P>
   After the DNA test, the state of South Carolina ordered the
Patriots to withhold $985 a month from Coates' paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser, who works at a local hospital, is now back in court with
Coates. She wants more money for her daughter and sole custody of
the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past year (Coates) has failed to adequately provide
financially for the minor child,'' her complaint states. He ``has
not consistently exercised visitation with the minor child nor
appears to be concerned about her welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, Mamie Jacobs, also filed a court motion recently
seeking an increase in the $955 monthly payment she receives to
support their daughter, 7-year-old Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who lives in a small home on a rural road just north of
Columbia, S.C., declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Court records, however, reveal she also was forced to take
Coates to court. In a 1992 memo, a caseworker from the South
Carolina Office of Child Support Enforcement typed a note to a
superior indicating ``this man is not going to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, citing the three-year, $7.5 million contract Coates
signed with the Patriots last year, is seeking an increase in child
support.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, 1997, Coates filed a motion opposing Jacobs' request
for more money, saying she failed to ``allege any increase in the
child's needs to justify an increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Marshall, the Norton woman who was allegedly assaulted
by Coates last week, also had to file a lawsuit to prove he was the
father of their child and to collect child support. The couple has
a 3-year-old daughter, Destiny.
</P>
<P>
   After it was determined Coates was the father, the court ordered
support payments. Eventually, the couple reached an agreement that
is part of a sealed court record.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the settlement says the amount paid to
Marshall is several times what Hauser and Jacobs receive. In
addition, friends of Marshall say the pair have continued their
relationship since they first met in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The friends said Marshall and Coates were together as recently
as July 25. But the next night, Marshall spotted an unfamiliar car
parked in the driveway of Coates's house in Franklin. Suspecting
that it belonged to a new girlfriend, she knocked on Coates's door.
</P>
<P>
   When Coates came to the door, a fight started. In an account
backed by a neighbor, Coates said Marshall hit him first and that
he pushed her away in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, whose account was supported by a friend who was with
her, said Coates came out of the house screaming and pushed her to
the pavement. And when she pushed Coates back, he slammed her head
on to the hood of her car, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coates also has two children with his wife, Yvette, who remains
at the couple's home in North Carolina when he moves to
Massachusetts for the football season.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Yvette Coates said she is aware her
husband has children with other women and of the incident with
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   `I believe him. He did nothing wrong,'' she said. ``We are
definitely still together. We have already been through everything.
We are fine.''

RICE READY TO RETURN

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; STOCKTON, Calif. _ Dennis Quaid dropped back into the pocket,
cocked his left arm, and hurled a wobbly-but-catchable spiral
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   Reception, Jerry Rice, and touchdown. Smooth. Effortless. Right
to the Hollywood storyline.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we are talking about that Dennis Quaid and that Jerry Rice,
actor and recovering receiver, who spent Friday at the 49ers
training camp joined at the script in a two-man rehearsal aimed at
getting Quaid ready for the silver screen and Rice prepped once
again for the green, sometimes treacherous, pastures of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Quaid is making the rounds at NFL camps, part of his character
study for an upcoming Oliver Stone movie _ working title: ``Any
Given Sunday'' _ about an aging NFL quarterback. The 35-year-old
Rice is recovering from the cracked kneecap he suffered in
December, in his first game back following major knee
reconstruction, and he will not suit up tonight in San Francisco (6
p.m. EDT) when the 49ers face the Patriots in the exhibition opener
for both clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he's pretty good,'' said Rice, reflecting on the
aerial offerings of the thespian quarterback. ``He throws a pretty
good pass. I'm just trying to work with him on a few things. You'd
think he'd give me a cameo role in that movie of his, wouldn't you?
I've got to talk to him about that, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Rice, too, is only an actor on the football
stage, the one he has so dominated now for well over a decade. No
one has caught more passes, for more yards, for more touchdowns,
and for more points than Rice has in his 12-plus NFL seasons. All
that was true at this time last year, too, before he stepped into
Houlihan's Stadium in Tampa Bay for the season opener Aug. 31 and
had his left knee shredded like so much string cheese at a Sunday
picnic. Total damage: torn ligaments (both ACL and MCL), torn
cartilage, damaged posterior capsule, and damaged lateral condyle.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery made things better, and Rice's renowned work ethic
returned him to action faster than anyone expected, sooner in fact
than any athlete has been known to recover from major knee
reconstruction. On Dec. 15 at 3Com Park, he came back to the
lineup, and all was right again with the 49ers world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was miraculous,'' recalled veteran 49ers tackle Harris
Barton, recovering from knee surgery himself this year. ``Then, the
saddest thing that could happen, did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:53 of the second quarter, Rice picked off a 14-yard Steve
Young toss and landed in the end zone, for his record 166th career
touchdown, making him the first non-kicker in NFL history to break
the 1,000-point barrier. But he also broke his kneecap, the price
for landing on the surgically-repaired knee after being drilled by
Denver defenders Darrien Gordon and Steve Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   The second-guessing began immediately. What was he doing in
there? Wouldn't it have made sense for him to have called it a
season in August? But he played, cleared by the 49ers' medical
staff and urged on by his own burning, insatiable desire to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly eight months later, coach Steve Mariucci has yet to
allow Rice to compete in contact drills and it doesn't sound as if
Rice will play in any of the club's five exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could play easily (today),'' Rice said Friday as he left the
field following his game of catch with Quaid. ``There's no doubt in
my mind that come September (the opener is Sept. 6 vs. the Jets)
I'll be ready to play. Without a doubt (it's frustrating), because
I'm competitive, and you have to get yourself ready in training
camp and that pays off when the season starts ... ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But there is no season for Rice until Mariucci, now in his
second year at the helm, says there is a season. For the better
part of two weeks now, Rice's training camp has consisted of
playing catch with the likes of Quaid and Mariucci's young sons,
Stephen and Adam, and otherwise going about the business of
building his leg strength. The key to a healthy, strong, game-ready
knee, he says, is building up the surrounding quadriceps muscle. He
has been working at that for months, and he reported to camp two
weeks ago with his knee at a self-diagnosed ``90 percent''
readiness. He wants to get in there. Now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we're going to collide,'' said Rice, looking ahead to
the imminent banging of heads he suspects he'll have with Mariucci
and the club's medical staff. ``I mean, it's close ... they're
going to have trouble with me (this) week. You want to be out there
with the guys and (this) week is my coming-out week. I think
there's going to be some bumpin' heads, a lot of fightin' ...
(Mariucci) is being very stubborn, and the only answer to that
might be to take him behind closed doors and beat him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci must listen to his doctors, his training staff, his
superstar receiver, and ultimately himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which means I'm all ears,'' he said. ``The answer is, you play
him when it's time. Obviously, the main thing is to have him play
well for us this season. It's not of the utmost importance that he
plays every snap in the preseason.''

GARY SINISE AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he appeared in ``Forrest Gump,'' one of the
highest-grossing films in movie history, and received his first
Academy Award nomination for his memorable performance as the gruff
but vulnerable Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan Taylor, someone got the
bright idea to call Gary Sinise ``a mainstream movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it was written in at least one magazine, and on a
Web site devoted to the movie biz. True, Sinise has co-starred in
some of the biggest commercial hits of recent years, including
``Ransom,'' with Mel Gibson, and ``Apollo 13,'' with his ``Forrest
Gump'' co-star, Tom Hanks. His latest, ``Snake Eyes,'' is a big
summer crime actioner directed by Brian DePalma and starring
Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   But is Sinise truly a mainstream movie star, a name, a face, a
Travolta, a Cruise? If he is, well, someone forgot to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're above the title on a $75 million movie, you're
probably a mainstream movie star, and I believe the poster says,
`Cage: Snake Eyes,''' Sinise joked. ``I feel like I've been in some
mainstream movies, big, fairly accessible commercial films. But
I've yet to be the star in one of them. Besides, I'd probably make
a lot more money than I do if I was a mainstream movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sinise is not a mainstream movie star. He is not in the
rarefied company of those who, in Hollywoodspeak, can ``open'' a
film. He gets the scripts with fingerprints on them, reading for
the parts that already have been considered and rejected by other
actors. (His role in ``Snake Eyes,'' was offered to Will Smith,
then Al Pacino.)
</P>
<P>
   He is also, however, the kind of actor who makes you pay closer
attention to any film simply because he's in it. His performances
are spiced with sinew and authority, and he is a far better actor
than many who command more attention and bigger paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   While his name doesn't garner the biggest type in ads for
``Snake Eyes,'' which opens Friday, he's one of the film's most
compelling characters. Sinise plays Kevin Dunne, a strait-laced
Navy commander assigned to protect the secretary of defense at a
heavyweight boxing match in Atlantic City. There, he hooks up with
his old friend, Cage's Rick Santoro, a cop with his hands in too
many dirty pockets. While Dunne is distracted, the defense
secretary is murdered, and the two friends try to uncover how and
why the assassination occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Sinise became interested in the role because of the names
attached: Oscar-winning Cage and DePalma, who has directed such
films as ``Dressed to Kill,'' ``The Untouchables,'' and ``Mission:
Impossible.'' He also was drawn to the story, a coiling
sleight-of-hand unveiled from multiple viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne is the latest in a series of emotionally complex
characters Si-nise has tackled of late, most notably former Alabama
Governor George Wallace in the TNT miniseries, ``Wallace.''
Sinise's stunning portrayal of the man who once intoned,
``Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,''
earned him an Emmy nomination last month for best actor in a
miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Sinise has been in his native Chicago recently with his wife,
actress Moira Harris, who is performing in the play, ``Playboy of
the Western World'' at Steppenwolf, the theater company Sinise
cofounded in 1974. That's where he was when he got a call from his
personal assistant informing him about the Emmy nod. Though he's
been nominated for just about every major acting award, he says,
``I should quit if being acknowledged for an award ever becomes
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for my friends when they get acknowledged and
they're happy for me,'' Sinise said. ``But really we're all just
trying to stay working actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting the role of Wallace, Sinise knew little about
the fiery politician from his headline-grabbing moments. He knew of
the man who put his body between black students and their legal
right to an equal education in Alabama; the man who along with
Birmingham sheriff Bull Connor, turned hoses and dogs on black
women and children who dared to say ``enough''; the man put in a
wheelchair by a 1972 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Wallace, Sinise slipped into a swampy drawl
explaining the governor's reasoning for using cattle prods on civil
rights protesters:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, suh, you gotta understand,'' he said, arching his back,
perfectly capturing the Wallace of black-and-white newsreels.
``When you have these demonstrations you got to control these
things.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Sinise was compelled by the redemption song of Wallace's
later years, and by the man who went into a black church, bowed his
head, and begged forgiveness from the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film said so much about forgiveness,'' he said. ``That was
a movie to be made. I wasn't interested in just making a film about
a bigoted, racist governor.''
</P>
<P>
   His best supporting actor nomination in 1995 for ``Forrest
Gump'' brought Sinise greater attention, but television has
provided the best opportunity for him to flex his muscles in such
films as ``Wallace'' and HBO's ``Truman,'' with Sinise in an
award-winning performance as the no-nonsense president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still basically a character actor in the business,'' he
said. ``Until you prove yourself as a box office star, you're not
going to get offered those things. But I'm still driven by whether
I connect to the character, and does it make sense to me as a
movie. I've turned down things, possible commercial choices, but
they just didn't feel right. I turned down some starring roles in
features, but nothing I've ever regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipping Evian and sitting in a luxurious Four Seasons suite,
Sinise could be mistaken for a movie star. His personal assistant
is on hand, as is a man who fiddles with Sinise's hair before
photographs can be taken. His suite is enormous _ ``about as big as
my first theater,'' he quipped _ complete with a baby grand piano
and a dining table for eight. With striking blue-gray eyes, Sinise
is as intense in person as on screen, but he also possesses a sly
sense of humor as dry as Texas in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, which has spanned 25 of his 43 years,
Sinise has enjoyed success in film, TV, and theater, which remains
his first love. He has starred in such plays as ``True West,''
``Balm in Gilead,'' and ``A Streetcar Names Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace the process of doing theater, and how it
evolves. You have such an extended period of time to absorb a
character, change a character, and sink into one, and I appreciate
that process,'' said Sinise, who is also an accomplished stage and
film director, most notably of an adaptation of ``Of Mice and
Men,'' with John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through such an evolution and change in the character,
and you try so many things from night to night, you really feel
you've lived it. You can't replace that,'' he said. ``I did `The
Grapes of Wrath' as a play at Steppenwolf in Chicago for three
months, then we moved it to La Jolla, Calif., for three months, we
went to London for three weeks, we went to Broadway for six
months,'' he said. ``I got to do Tom Joad 400 times; Henry Fonda
did a couple of takes for each scene. He would have been extremely
jealous of me getting to play it that many times in the theater,
because I got to discover so many things along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 1998 has been ``a year for small jobs,'' Sinise said. He
will play an inattentive father in the upcoming ``Bruno,'' which
marks Shirley Mac-Laine's directorial debut. This year has been
``very slow in terms of what has presented itself, and what has
been available to me, which has been nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that mainstream movie stars do not fret about
such things. But Sinise has never considered himself to be anything
other than a hard-working actor, always eager for his next role,
always concerned his current role may be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there's fear and insecurity, but I'm comfortable when I'm
working, when I get started on something,'' he said. ``The down
time I'm getting better at _ you know, `Relax, the right thing will
come along.' But the longer it goes on, the more I worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a possibility that you'll go out of fashion and
things won't work, or you'll make the wrong decisions. Most actors
have such ups and downs, even people at the top of the their
game,'' Sinise said. ``Anybody with any real sense of what it's
like to be an actor would have a pretty straightforward humility
about what the actor's life is.''

LIGHTING UP ON THE BIG SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NANCY MARSDEN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Until now, little evidence has supported
the theory that tobacco companies use movies as advertising
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has long been aware that the Philip Morris Cos. paid to
``place'' Marlboro cigarettes and signage in ``Superman I and II.''
And lawmakers learned a year after the fact that, in 1988, the same
company shelled out $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in the
James Bond film, ``License to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the memos leaked from Brown &AMP; Williamson suggesting
that, back in the early 1980s, A-list movie stars accepted gifts
for smoking in movies. Luxury cars, jewelry, and cash payments of
up to $300,000 were allegedly channeled through a now-defunct
product placement agency, at a cost of $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, evidence subpoenaed in the Minnesota lawsuit against the
tobacco companies is raising new concerns about Hollywood's tobacco
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris document 2025863645 states that ``product was
supplied'' for more than 190 movies during the decade from 1978 to
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking, 14-page list of titles peaks in '87 and '88, when
the company supplied tobacco for 54 films, including youth fare
like ``The Dream Team,'' ``Crocodile Dundee,'' ``Robocop,'' ``Die
Hard,'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty films, such as ``The Muppet Movie,'' ``Grease'' and ``Jaws
II,'' were rated PG or G.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris calls the placements ``donations'' _ and indeed,
no record of payments has been uncovered. On the other hand, if
embedded advertising went for free, why did the company pay
$350,000 the same year for a role in ``License to Kill''?
</P>
<P>
   Eric Johnson, executive assistant to Minnesota Attorney General
Hubert Humphrey III, thinks that ``evidence may have been
destroyed, or communicated orally to avoid disclosure. Or business
may have been conducted by winks and nods.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, this advertising blitzkrieg belies Hollywood's
standard disclaimer _ that films don't influence behavior. If
movies could not recruit smokers, tobacco executives would not have
risked public censure.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing statistics confirm the power of product placement. Tom
Cruise put on a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses in ``Risky Business''
and the company charted 55 percent gains. Reese's Pieces candy
sales jumped 65 percent after an appearance in ``E.T.'' And when
Fonzie applied for a library card in ``Happy Days,'' library
registration increased.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to calculate the impact of the 190 product
placement salvos listed on Document 2025863645. Many of the movies
have traveled worldwide and are still circulating as favorite
videos. With the re-release of ``Grease'' _ one of the smokiest
films on the list _ the message plays on.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, different tobacco companies ``placed'' products
in the same movies. For example, in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
the cartoon character, Betty Boop, is a cigarette girl bearing a
tray of Camels _ an R.J. Reynolds brand. Lucky Strikes, made by
Brown &AMP; Williamson, also appear.
</P>
<P>
   And lest anyone tell you it's all about ``realism,'' there are
``generic'' smoking portrayals that look a lot like commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, three boys about 9 years old smoke cigarettes on
the bumper of a bus. When the main character leaps aboard, the boys
award him two of their smokes, which he pockets with a satisfied
smile. The encounter has nothing to do with the plot, but it does
contain a potent, pro-tobacco message geared to youth.
</P>
<P>
   As the children of the 1980s reached adolescence, teen tobacco
use rose dramatically _ 32 percent since 1991. Once addicted (after
about 100 cigarettes) the typical teen will continue to smoke for
16 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, between 1980 and 1998, Philip Morris has climbed from
63rd to 9th in sales on the Forbes 500 list of U.S. corporations.
In assets, the company moved from 87 to 45 and in profits, from 38
to 5.
</P>
<P>
   While smoking may at times be necessary for
``characterization,'' tobacco payoffs are unacceptable because they
provide hidden incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's $6 billion tobacco settlement bars payment _ direct
or indirect _ for cigarette placement in U.S. movies. ``You should
have seen how hard (the tobacco companies) fought it,'' recalls
Eric Johnson. ``Up until the final night, it was the last item they
conceded to.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd, given that Big Tobacco voluntarily banned product placement
eight years ago under pressure from the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both the film and tobacco industries insist that
the practice hasn't occurred since 1990. Why, then, was the product
placement provision so hard to swallow?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be that the Minnesota ban is legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   According to Humphrey's press release, ``Speculation abounds
whether secret payoffs may have been made to the makers of such
recent, smoking-intensive movies as ``Titanic'' and ``My Best
Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret payoffs would explain the dramatic rise in on-screen
smoking since 1990. Tobacco brands rarely appear in movies today.
But the American Lung Association found that in 133 top films
produced between 1994 and 1995, 82 percent of the lead or
supporting actors smoked.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 29 percent of movie characters smoked in the
1970s, according to Stanton Glantz of the University of California
at San Francisco. And only 14 percent of comparable individuals
smoke in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Even Richard Masur, president of the Screen Actors Guild,
reportedly thinks that some smoking portrayals defy credibility. He
cites the example of a cop, ``a heavy smoker, chasing a bad guy
down the street .... and never drawing a harsh breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Also perplexing is the sudden influx of tobacco dialog.
Characters no longer just smoke; they talk about it in lines that
often have the ring of commercial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Alec Klein of the Baltimore Sun uncovered a piece of
the puzzle. Dicey memos show that the Cigar Association, a trade
group funded by tobacco companies, paid brokers to ``place'' cigars
in recent films and television shows, including the blockbuster,
``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a short leap to speculate that generic cigarette placement
might be promoted in the same manner. Call it ``commodity
placement.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS anchorwoman Leslie Stahl asked the tough question in a 1996
``60 Minutes'' interview that was re-aired in May. Could ``under
the table'' payoffs be going on today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' replied Disney executive Joe Roth. But he didn't
think so. The public deserves a better answer. Tobacco is the
leading cause of death and disease in the U.S. Forty-three percent
of American teen-agers now use tobacco, and the numbers are
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical persons in both industries must take a stand and smoke
out the truth. Roth has initiated a policy discouraging smoking in
Disney's ``family'' films. And the Cigar Association announced it
will halt product placement.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America, told the Wall Street Journal in March, ``I
don't see a lot of smoking in films, and I see a lot of films.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they said in the '80s.

A FIRST NOVEL OF FLIGHT, REBELLION, AMID A NEW IRISH REVOLUTION

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LONG FALLING 
By Keith Ridgway. Houghton Mifflin. 305 pp. $22. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disproportionate output of serious young fiction writers by
Ireland seems a puzzle _ the whole country has a smaller population
than that of Massachusetts. It is less puzzling if one thinks of
Ireland not as a country but as a fractious family living on a
single acre. Everyone is related; everyone is in contact with the
same intense, conflicted, ingrown history and the same few richly
seasoned power centers; everything is personal. Irish society is a
perfect petri dish for literature; the wonder is that anyone is not
a poet or novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Dubliner Keith Ridgway's impressive first novel takes up all the
familiar elements: troglodytic patriarchial bullying, the silent
suffering of oppressed women, the rebellion of sons, the crushing
weight of a conservative religious/political/social system. He adds
a new element, homosexuality, but with an ironic twist: Not even
the outcast son, a sexual pariah, escapes an alliance with
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told mainly from two points of view, those of Grace
Quinn, an abused farm wife in her early 50s in County Monaghan, and
of her gay son, Martin. Grace lives alone with her husband, who is
not fully realized as a character but in his few appearances is
presented as a twisted brute. He unjustly blames his wife for the
accidental death by drowning of their firstborn, 3-year-old Sean.
When he learns years later that his second son is gay, he flies
into a violent rage, and Martin leaves home for Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   In the year before the present of the novel, the father, after a
night of drinking, kills a girl with his car on a dark country road
and receives a six-month sentence. He returns home even more
violent toward Grace than before. The night after a particularly
vicious predawn attack, which includes kicking for the first time,
she takes the car and waits at the narrow place in the road for him
to come home from the pub. When he appears on foot, she guns the
engine, runs him down and kills him exactly where he had killed the
girl earlier. At that moment, he is kneeling at the flower-strewn
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Grace washes off the car, sleeps well, then goes to Dublin to
visit Martin. She calls to tell him that his father has been
killed, but not that she was the killer. Arriving in Dublin, she
enters into the complicated personal life of her surviving son. His
lover, Henry, is in Paris on a film project and Martin is tormented
with doubts about Henry's fidelity. Martin and friends take Grace
to a club. Her odd behavior when the subject of her husband's death
comes up arouses the suspicion of Sean, one of Martin's gay friends
and a newspaper reporter. Sean wonders why the police do not regard
Grace as the prime suspect, and smells a good story.
</P>
<P>
   The action of the novel, set in 1992, takes place against the
background of the real-life X case. ``X'' was a 14-year-old girl,
pregnant by a rapist, who was enjoined by an Irish judge against
leaving the country to obtain an abortion. Amid a tremendous outcry
pitting religious traditionalists against a growing secular
sentiment, there were large public demonstrations and parades. In
the end, the High Court set aside the injunction and ruled that in
certain cases abortion was justified. By then, the girl had already
left the country and the pregnancy had miscarried.
</P>
<P>
   In a clever device, Ridgway has the fictional and real-life
stories proceed in concert. In each case, the truth about the
oppressive circumstances of a woman's life is at war with the
established general rules of law and society. Both women want to
get out of the country; both are victims of men but need other men
to help them. Sean is involved in the coverage of the X case, which
is on all lips, while he is thinking about how to crack the Grace
Quinn case and make a name for himself. The denouement of the novel
takes place in the middle of a demonstration against the X
injunction outside the General Post Office _ the site of the 1916
Easter uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain meaning of the father's gesture, kneeling just
before he is killed _ is it contrition or pious hypocrisy? _ is a
recurrent theme; almost none of the characters in the book are
exactly what they seem or what one expects. Born in Ireland but
raised in England by an Irish father who so hated his country that
he changed his name to Wilson, Grace's identity is ambiguous; her
Monaghan neighbors regard her as English. The local police
detective, representing law and order and the state, nonetheless
knows about the abuse Grace has received from her husband and wants
to help her leave the country. Despite his bitter and violent
rejection at the hands of his father, Martin's response when he
learns what his mother has done is surprising. Henry, suspected by
Martin of unfaithfulness in Paris, turns out to be a voice of
ordinary loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Long Falling'' (the meaning of the title eluded me)
reveals a society and a group of people groaning toward a
refashioning of traditional assumptions. They have their roles, but
they are all trying to break out of them. The novel might have been
titled ``The Great Escape.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not altogether clear as to the reasons, but I found the
novel unsatisfying, even as I admired Ridgway's talent and
ambition. In part, the symbolic background of the X case, and the
clear-cut roles of the characters (even though they strive to
modify them), tend to weigh the book down, to give it a freight of
significance that makes it seem creaky and unduly solemn. The
ironic picture of Sean standing against the bullet-scarred pillars
of the GPO was over the top.
</P>
<P>
   I also found the style heavy going. Ridgway is an able writer
with a fairly plain manner, but he lapses into flights of
unintelligible lyricism: At one point in her wanderings, Grace
``stood at a great height over the land that had taken her and kept
her and killed her child. She saw herself upon it, moving like the
ink of a red pen. Writing herself across the world, telling her
small, thin, story. Her sketch.'' Very pretty, but hard to believe
that an unintellectual, unartistic woman like Grace would ``see''
any such thing. Also, Ridgway frequently presents a clear thought
with a straightforward sentence, then follows it with a volley of
short sentences, or fragments, that muddy things up:
</P>
<P>
   ``Above her the steeple stretched to a point that she could
imagine better than she could see. She wondered how small it was,
how sharp, how still in the wind. She wondered how to get there.
Not literally. In another way, the way in which the steeple got
there, the evolving slate. The higher the smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it has symbolic meaning, but Ridgway's characters
frequently laugh without reason, and they cough so much that one
wonders if there was something going around in Dublin in 1992. And
there is an abundance of dead dialogue:
</P>
<P>
   ```How are you?' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh, I'm fine. A bit wet.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Here, get under the umbrella. I like the cap.'
</P>
<P>
   ```It's Henry's.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.'''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps I am an irritable reader. And these are all elements
of craft that might change as this talented writer goes forward.
``The Long Falling'' is an ambitious novel for its small size, full
of characters, Great Themes, and clever plotting. Speaking of
escapes, Keith Ridgway has escaped every cliche and most of the
stereotypes of modern Irish fiction. Without a doubt, he has the
gifts and tools for a long rising as a writer.

IN AUGUST FRANCE COMES TO A STANDSTILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 News Analysis  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Over the weekend some 5 million French families were on
south-bound highways advancing at a pace somewhat slower than that
of Adolf Hitler's armored columns during their 1940 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of the month-long August vacation when all true
French people are ready to endure every conceivable misadventure
and hardship in order to enjoy _ if that's the right word _ four
weeks of paid summer holiday guaranteed them under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Paris and other cities empty out as the French head for the
Mediterranean seaside and, in slightly smaller numbers, for the
countryside. Those remaining in the cities are hard put to find a
doctor, dentist or a butcher. Heaven help you if the plumbing
springs a leak in August. The plumbers are living it up on the
crowded beaches of St. Tropez, where no French celebrity would be
caught dead this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Whole factories shut down. One estimate puts the lost economic
activity resulting from the nation playing for an entire month at
10 percent of France's total production of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to one's vacation destination involves long hours in
traffic jams _ not surprising since nearly everybody goes on
vacation at the same time. Highway mishaps normally quadruple at
this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The vacationers arrive at their destination worn out and
frazzled, only to begin complaining immediately about the high
prices, as landlords, hoteliers and restaurateurs make a heroic
effort to rake in their year's profit during a single four-week
period.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Apparently, nothing will deter the French from taking
their August vacation all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ~~``There's a mystique about August vacationing that cuts across
all social classes,'' explains Thierry Longet, a history professor
at the University of Paris. ``Somehow, not taking off in August
would be considered a sacrilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Holidays, Longet observes, are more important to most French
than their work. ``(Vacations) have become life's main objective,''
he notes. ``Most French people would rather have more time off than
higher salaries. This is so although they already are entitled to
six weeks off (including two in the winter), more than anyone else
in the industrialized world.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend Pierre and his wife Nicole don't leave town in August
because, he says, ``it is the best time to be in Paris. There is
little traffic and plenty of recreational activities. The only
thing one must do is avoid places frequented by foreign tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pierre, a well-off lawyer, never admits to his French
friends that he and Nicole are staying home. He says they would be
shocked by such iconoclastic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit on an ingenious method of insuring that nobody finds
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep our windows shuttered,'' he explained. ``Anyone who
happens to know us and passes by thinks that we, too, are away for
the month.''

NO ROLE IS TOO REGULAR FOR TOM HANKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Tom Hanks is tilting back in his chair, balancing it on
two legs. His left hand is unconsciously playing with the plastic
cap to a water bottle. He's listening.
</P>
<P>
   He's hearing that his friend Steven Spielberg, who directed him
in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' just compared him to James Stewart _
certainly not the first time Hanks has heard himself compared to
the great ``everyman'' actor. But Hanks looks slightly
uncomfortable about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed that it continuously comes up,'' Hanks says.
``I mean, it's the highest praise you can offer to a guy like me.''
He chuckles slightly. ``But isn't it kind of insulting to Mr.
Stewart and his work?
</P>
<P>
   ``You get pigeonholed one way or another. But look, I'm just
this cheesy guy who is making movies now. There is no reason to
compare me to any of the great immortals. I don't think anybody
working right now compares to the great immortals.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the immortal Mr. Stewart would be too insulted by
the comparison. This ``cheesy guy'' has already gotten three Oscar
nominations _ he seems a shoe-in for a fourth this year _ and two
wins. And a Screen Actors Award and a ShoWest Convention Male Star
of the Year Award. A few more years, and Hanks is likely to be
considered one of the immortals himself.
</P>
<P>
   If Hanks is pigeonholed _ stereotyped _ as a common man, it's
not a bad rut to be stuck in. That kind of image offers so much
more leeway than, say, action hero or comedian. In the past five
years it has allowed Hanks to get the serious starring roles other
actors would kill for: a lonely widower dad in ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' a dying AIDS patient in ``Philadelphia,'' an idiot
savant in ``Forrest Gump,'' an astronaut in crisis in ``Apollo
13.'' And now a citizen soldier forced to make daily life and death
decisions in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Hanks gets parts based on character is obvious.
People respond to him. They believe and accept him as a genuine
person with deep inner emotions they can relate to. Spielberg
called it ``trust.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something that a performer can't just act. Or can he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always aware of some degree of countenance I'm going to
bring to anything,'' Hanks says thoughtfully. ``Everybody is.
Robert De Niro has a countenance: It's this weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring something different. You are forced to analyze your
work. Which is uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, I'm not a threatening guy. I don't carry some
massive rough and tumble thing. When I walk into a room, nobody
fears me. The characters I play are not real stand-out flashy
dudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' he says, laughing, ``I'm glad they compare me to
James Stewart rather than Van Johnson, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   And then, perhaps because Hanks is a nice guy, and because he
remembers that Van Johnson is still alive, he adds quickly, ``He
made some fine movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks even looks the part of the common guy. He has a nice
appearance, but with his undefined chin and a tall, thin head that
seems to place his narrow eyes smack in the middle, he looks more
like a friendly egghead than movie star.
</P>
<P>
   His dark curly hair is cut short, though certainly not as short
as it was as a soldier in ``Saving Private Ryan'' or as the social
misfit in ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   He's dressed in black jeans and heavy black leather shoes _ like
something left over from ``Private Ryan'' _ and a black jacket. The
only bright touch comes from his plaid shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks is at the peak of his career. Since the disaster of ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities'' in 1990, one of several low points in
what had been a roller-coaster career, his star has risen almost
constantly. Starting with his role as the manager of a women's
baseball team in ``A League of Their Own'' in 1992, all the films
he's done as lead actor have been hits. Even ``Toy Story,'' for
which he did only a voice, was a big success.
</P>
<P>
   Between starring roles, he directed a small movie, ``That Thing
You Do,'' taking a support role. It was a small box-office success
and earned mostly good reviews. And he produced the highly praised
miniseries, ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' for which he directed
an episode and played a small role.
</P>
<P>
   And now ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which has earned $73 million in
two weeks and has gotten the best reviews of the year, is his sixth
starring-role hit in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' acting was once not taken very seriously because of his
TV comedy background (``Bosom Buddies''), which led to light comedy
roles. In fact, Hanks began his career on stage in the mid-'70s
doing Chekhov and Shakespeare. But his performances do seem to get
richer and better as he goes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much respect for Tom,'' said Gary Sinise, who
supported Hanks in ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Apollo 13.'' ``If you
look at his first work in the movies up to the kind of work he is
doing now and the kind of taste and integrity for the projects that
he's choosing now ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him on the phone the other day that I thought his
performance in `Saving Private Ryan' is just sensational. He was
doing emotionally restrained work in `Apollo 13' because the
astronauts are very contained. In `Private Ryan,' he got to play so
many different sides, strength and vulnerability and fear, and he
did it so beautifully. Aside from `Forrest Gump,' it's his greatest
performance I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks gives the impression of not just looking and acting like a
regular guy, but of being one, too. That's certainly the image you
get from his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great example of whom I would love to be like in every
respect,'' said Matt Damon, Hanks co-star in `Saving Private Ryan.'
``It's something the young guys talked about on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the biggest star in the world. To see the way he is to
every single person who works with him on a film, to see how
accessible he is, and the demands put on him and the way he handles
it, it gives you no excuse to ever misbehave.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hanks made an impression on Damon as soon as the young actor
arrived on location for ``Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I walked on the set, this girl was walking
around with drinks for people. I was reaching for a soda, and I
looked over, and there was Hanks sitting in this foxhole, drinking
out of a canteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who could go to his trailer (between takes) and
order salmon from Alaska, and it would be there, you know? And he
sits in the foxhole and drinks out of the canteen, and that's how
it's going to be done. And he doesn't tell you to do that, he just
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in a very short time, that girl wasn't walking around with
drinks anymore. There was a group of people in their foxholes,
drinking out of canteens. That's just the way he is, and we all
really responded to the part in Tom that absolutely leads by
example and doesn't preach to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is at the top of his game, as successful as anyone could
hope to be, and he handles it with total class, all the time. That
made it great because everybody wanted to follow him on the film.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now, everyone has heard about the boot camp training the
actors went through before filming ``Saving Private Ryan.'' By all
accounts it was a rough ordeal: sleeping on the ground in the cold
and the rain for only three hours a night, and spending days in
rough training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the 44 days or whatever (was reported),'' Hanks says
with a sigh. ``It was six days. It was really quite miserable and
really humiliating, but it was worthwhile, every second of it. It
was cold, and you could only operate on three hours of sleep for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own agenda, and I was looking forward to it. Yes, it
was exhausting, but we all became so familiar with not just our
equipment but also the mind-set and the monotony and the
exhaustion, that when it came to shoot the movie, we were cold and
exhausted guys who were sleeping in the grass while they were
setting up the camera shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without boot camp, we would have all been a bunch of goofy
actors running around saying `pow, pow.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the third day of boot camp, most of the actors rebelled
against the indignities they were being put through. A vote was
held, and everyone voted to quit. Except Hanks. So they voted
again, and everyone voted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important that we treat that as our rehearsal,''
Hanks says. ``And that we not become a fractured unit. We were
going to be together for 65 days making this movie, and if we broke
into some sort a I-don't-want-to-do-this cliche, that is a palpable
thing that shows up on camera at the oddest times. We all had to be
on the same page every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, now we all look at each other and say thank
God we went through boot camp.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of dedication, along with his astounding
box-office success, that have made Hanks a sought-after actor. But
it has also allowed him the luxury of not doing just any project _
he certainly doesn't need the money _ and pursuing his obsessions,
such as the space program and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   (Asked if he has any other passions waiting to be brought to the
screen, he laughs. ``No, I'd better dig something up.'')
</P>
<P>
   Hanks says he chooses his roles the same way he always has.
Winning the Academy Awards haven't changed his criteria, or made
him look for harder roles. He just wants to do good work that
interests him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest thing in the world is to say yes to something you
want to do,'' he says. ``It's harder to say no because there's a
lot of money involved and a lot of great stuff out there, but you
read it and say, `You know, it doesn't do anything for me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``By now the Oscars are like, ancient history,'' he says,
grinning. ``When did I win? Nine years ago? Five years ago? (1994
and 1995.) Bunch of other guys have won since. I'm just in the
history books. &UR; '' &LR;

   LEUKEMIA-OLDER-PATIENTS (Seattle) Treating older patients with
leukemia is an agonizing dilemma for physicians. Doctors can
increase an older patient's odds of a cure with aggressive
treatment, such as a bone marrow transplant, but the treatment
itself can kill the patient. That's the conundrum Seattle School
Superindent John Stanford has faced at each treatment decision
point in his battle with acute myelogenous leukemia. Researchers at
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have begun testing a
new-generation bone marrow transplant procedure that could one day
be used for older patients who aren't eligible for traditional bone
marrow transplants, and for others who are too sick to survive the
conventional bone marrow regimen. So far, six people have tried the
new procedure, which is not being done anywhere else in the world.

ALTERNATIVE LEUKEMIA TREATEMENT GIVES NEW HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Treating older patients with leukemia presents an
agonizing dilemma for physicians. Doctors can increase an older
patient's odds of a cure with aggressive treatment, such as a bone
marrow transplant, but the treatment itself can kill the patient.
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, older patients may not have to make such a
difficult choice.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have
begun testing a new-generation bone marrow transplant procedure
that could one day be used for older patients who aren't eligible
for traditional bone marrow transplants, and for others who are too
sick to survive high-dose chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, six people have tried the new procedure, which is not
being done yet anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Gordon Aaby, 30, who had a transplant
with the new method a little more than five months ago and credits
it with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a traditional bone marrow transplant, this process
involves no high-dose chemotherapy or intense radiation, the two
aspects of the conventional method that pose the most risk for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new procedure uses natural immune system cells,
called lymphocytes, along with new bone marrow from a donor to
``sneak up'' on the cancer and kill it without chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very novel, very experimental,'' said Dr. Rainer Storb,
head of the Clinical Research Division's Transplantation Biology
Program at Fred Hutchinson. Storb and principal investigator Dr.
Peter McSweeney are conducting a pilot study of the new treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Its promise is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Once refined, it eventually could lead to what Storb termed a
``drive-through'' transplant, a non-toxic procedure with the
potential to cure or treat a wide variety of malignancies,
including acute myelogenous leukemia , and genetic blood disorders,
such as sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional bone marrow transplants use high doses of
chemotherapy and radiation to kill cancer cells, irreversibly
destroying the body's blood-making machinery and immune system in
the process. The donor's bone marrow then essentially replaces the
patient's own system with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically almost kill you and then bring you back from
the edge,'' said Tim Testu, 54, who seven months ago faced a choice
whether to get a bone marrow transplant with only 50 percent odds
of surviving it, or try the new procedure, which at that point had
only been used in animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be better off playing Russian roulette,'' he said of his
chances with the regular bone marrow procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Testu, a marine engineer living in Port Townsend, was diagnosed
in 1991 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a slow but fatal form of
blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After his remissions began lasting shorter periods, he sought
help at Fred Hutchinson. Because he was an older patient showing
signs of increased resistance to chemotherapy, he was told he only
had a ``shockingly few'' number of months to live. Maybe two years
at the outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His treatment options were limited. More conservative treatment
options promised greater near-term survival, but posed greater risk
of relapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed me charts, kind of like investing in the stock
market,'' he said. ``You can choose aggressive and high risk with
the big return, or choose the sure thing, and not make as much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was told he was eligible for the new treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is cancer-free. ``I can't even believe my own good
fortune,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors are excited about his long-term outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point of view, we're remarkably optimistic about his
outcome,'' McSweeney said. ``The most encouraging thing is we can't
find any leukemic cells, even using our most sensitive tests, and
that's a prerequisite for being cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaby, a cook who lives south of Seattle, has had a similar
dramatic turnaround. He suffers from a congenital immune deficiency
condition, similar to the ``bubble boy'' disease. Five and a half
months ago he weighed only 80 pounds and his body was shutting down
little by little. He had violent chills and a running fever of 103
degrees. He could barely breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was watching him disappear before my eyes,''
said Toni Aaby, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believed that replacing his own defective bone marrow
with healthy cells from a donor might cure him, but doubted he
could survive the chemotherapy phase of a regular bone marrow
transplant. Instead, they told him about the new procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either that or nothing,'' Aaby said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the procedure, his health has been steadily improving.
He's now at normal weight and, as a side benefit of not having
chemotherapy, still has the long wavy ponytail he's been growing
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go back to everything,'' he said. ``Jogging,
skiing, water sports, baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new treatment, which is done completely outside the
hospital, patients have their own immune systems slightly
suppressed with oral medications, just enough so that when doctors
slip in donor bone marrow cells , the body doesn't immediately
reject them.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the two bone marrow systems _ the patient's and the
donor's _ set up shop together, existing in a state referred to as
``mixed chimerism.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that state is achieved, doctors infuse the patient with
lymphocytes from the same donor. Lymphocytes are a type of immune
system cell that can attack and kill cancer. Because they come from
a donor, they are more aggressive in killing cancer than the
patient's own lymphocytes.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is known as the ``graft-versus-leukemia''
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Because the patient already has some donor bone marrow in his
system, the donor lymphocyte cells aren't automatically rejected,
allowing them to do their work. Then, over time, the immune
suppression medication is removed, and the new, stronger donor
marrow gradually overtakes and eventually replaces the old bone
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be as if the patient were a personal computer,
plagued by some kind of virus, and they fix it by changing the
operating system from Win95 to Macintosh _ without tearing down, or
even turning off the machine,'' Testu said.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure hasn't worked for everyone. Two patients failed to
achieve the mixed chimeric state and rejected the donor marrow
before it could take hold. No patients who have undergone the
therapy have died.
</P>
<P>
   It will take two or three more years to refine a treatment
protocol for wider use, Storb said. Currently, it is considered
experimental and is not routinely covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There is a need for advances that would allow high-risk and
older patients such as Seattle Public Schools Superintendent John
Stanford, 59, to get bone marrow transplants with reduced risks,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, only about 10 percent of (all types of cancer)
patients are cured by chemotherapy alone,'' said oncologist and
researcher Dr. James Bianco, who heads Cell Therapeutics Inc., a
Seattle-based biotechnology company working on cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer cells become resistant to repeated rounds of
chemotherapy, making them increasingly difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
   And each time a patient undergoes chemotherapy, it reduces the
odds of success of subsequent treatments, such as a bone marrow
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   If an older patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, for
example, gets a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible in the
course of his disease, his odds of a cure are about 40 to 50
percent. The odds fall to less than 20 percent after multiple
rounds of chemotherapy, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a traditional bone marrow method, ``anyone over age 65,
most would die'' from the treatment, Storb said.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 50 and 60, there is a ``pretty high
mortality'' from bone marrow transplants, he said. In some cancers,
it's as high as 80 percent. For acute myelogenous leukemia, the
mortality rate from the bone marrow transplant itself is around 25
to 30 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to organs and risk of infection are two main
complications that can lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ability to repair DNA damage is lessened when we age,'' Storb
said. Many centers around the world won't even attempt bone marrow
transplants in patients older than 55. At the Fred Hutchinson
Center, the cutoff age is 65.
</P>
<P>
   However, leukemia strikes many patients over that age. Half of
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia , for example, are older
than 67. This type of cancer is not curable with conventional
chemotherapy, but 80 percent of patients younger than 50 can be
cured with a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, the aggressive type of
leukemia that Stanford has, would be eligible for the experimental
treatment only during a first remission, Storb said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the advanced stage of Stanford's disease, he would
not be eligible for the experimental transplant procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is currently undergoing tests in preparation for a
traditional bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   For Testu, the procedure has already given him a new shot at
life, and he hopes by being the first to try the treatment, it will
open the way for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hope here,'' he said. ``And a lot of
encouragement.''

FOR COMBAT VETERANS, AVOIDING `PRIVATE RYAN' MAY BE THE BEST
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So powerful are the combat scenes in ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' Veterans Administration counselors across the
country are bracing for a possible wave of veterans who see the
film and rip open old emotional wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Loren Pankratz, who spent 25 years treating
patients in the VA hospital in Portland, Ore., says there is
something war vets can do to defend themselves against such pain.
</P>
<P>
   Don't see the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you enjoy action or war movies or you want to see how
Steven Spielberg handles this subject, great. Go,'' Pankratz said.
``But if it's something else _ if you think you should face
something about your past or that unless you see it you're not a
man or that seeing it will in some way help you to chase away the
memories _ think again. A picture like this is likely to do the
opposite. You'll reexperience the trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   While some psychotherapists believe that reliving trauma is
precisely the route to mental health _ especially for patients
suffering from post traumatic stress disorder _ Pankratz is not
among them. Along with his own professional experience in the VA
and in the Psychiatry Department at Oregon Health Sciences
University, he points to a vacuum of clinical proof that such an
approach works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there has never been a treatment shown to be
effective for true post traumatic stress disorder; it has a pretty
rotten prognosis,'' Pankratz said. ``Nobody can show that this
(reexperiencing) method has done any good. Quite the opposite. Two
extensive studies done in Israel in 1996 and Canada in 1997 refute
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli study, essentially a review of the world's research
on treating traumatic stress by focusing on the trauma, found no
significant successes. Treatment that focused the patient on the
future rather than the past did provide some patients some relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian study, another review of international research,
found that the most potent weapon against post traumatic stress is
the human animal's natural resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study basically shows that people tend to rise above the
most horrendous experiences and that there is no relation to the
amount of toxicity in the things that happen to you and how you
survive them.'' Pankratz said.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Patients Who Deceive'' (Charles Thomas Press),
Pankratz is convinced that ``post traumatic stress disorder'' has
lost its specific medical meaning and has become a catch-all term
for any number of psychological and emotional reactions. One woman
he encountered insisted that, because she had been told an
offensive joke at work, she was suffering from PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so eager these days to find pathology, they can't
get their nose out of trauma,'' he said. ``PTSD is not about
occasional nightmares or bad memories. It must follow directly from
the trauma, it's not the result of a bad life or unhappiness or
depression running in the family. It doesn't come and go, it's
persistent and significantly impairs your functioning in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Long a critic of therapy that dwells on previous trauma,
Pankratz says psychological tools like choosing not to talk or even
think about a trauma often help us put needed distance between
ourselves and pain. We ought to be grateful for the tools, not view
them as a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some pretty good evidence that denial is an effective
mechanism for avoiding trauma stress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the veteran who has spent decades focusing on post-war life
and turning away from the horror of Omaha Beach, Anzio, Bataan,
Korea or Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like a healthy, functioning person,'' Pankratz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Should such a person expose his most tender insides to a
three-hour movie that realistically depicts the horrors of war?
</P>
<P>
   Said Pankratz: ``Why?''

SEATTLE OPERA'S NEW $2 MILLION `TRISTAN' IS BOLD, EXTRAORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By R.M. CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In one bold, imaginative leap, Seattle Opera moved
Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' from the 19th century to the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Using diverse imagery such as Russian Constructivism,
Pre-Raphaelites and Philip Johnson's architecture, the production
gleams and glistens with brilliant ideas. There is not one ordinary
moment in the nearly five hours it takes to move through this
monumental example of the lyric theater. The extraordinary,
visually and aurally, draws our eyes and ears to the stage and
wholly engages us.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of conductor Armin Jordan, nearly
everyone in the production is doing his or her first ``Tristan.''
That was barely evident Saturday night at the Opera House. Tense
may have been the operative word backstage _ with dozens of critics
in the house along with an international audience _ but the result
was seemingly one, long phrase of music from the famous ``Tristan''
chord at the beginning of the Prelude, to the dying breath of
Isolde in the ``Liebestod'' at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tristan'' is celebrated for its complications and demands, as
well as its rewards. What makes Seattle's ``Tristan'' so
exceptional is its human scale set in a huge universe, the ability
to astonish and persuade, its clarity, intelligence and insight.
Air exists where often it does not. Still lifes of rare beauty are
created, then animated gloriously and provocatively.
</P>
<P>
   There was almost no weakness Saturday in terms of music or
staging or design. Wagner often spoke of the complete art work, or
``Gesamtkunstwerk.'' This production represents such a synthesis of
ideas, musical and dramatic, magnificently realized. Rarely has so
much thought been given to every aspect of a production. A bravo
for Seattle Opera general director Speight Jenkins, without whom
none of this would have occurred. He authorized a budget of more
than $2 million, making ``Tristan'' the largest single production
in the history of company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tristan'' succeeds and fails with the two title characters,
who occupy the stage for so long. Let it be said at the outset that
Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner are the kinds of singers one dreams of
for these roles but almost never hears. Both were engaged by
Jenkins for major roles at the start of their careers, and they
have repaid the favor by continuing to come here, now that they are
sought throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eaglen's soprano is one of size and strength, but also one of
lyric beauty. The high B-flats and C's are triumphant, and the
middle part of her voice mellifluous and a wonder by itself. While
her reading of ``Liebestod'' will grow, her portrayal of Isolde _
the longest role in a single opera _ is already one of compassion
and courage, defiance and nobility. She is the Isolde for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner is one of those rare heroic tenors more tenor than
baritone. What gorgeous sounds he produces, long-limbed and
remarkably sweet. He is still finding his way in this complicated
role, but his accomplishment Saturday was thrilling: the sheer
beauty of timbre he brings to Tristan, instead of worked-over
leather, and powerful expression. His third-act monologue was
riveting and deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   In her house debut, Michelle DeYoung, was a convincing Brangane,
attractive for the warmth of her characterization and lyricism of
her voice. Greer Grimsley, as the gruff and ready Kurwenal, has
never sung better, more fully, with greater passion. Peter Rose's
King Marke was also compelling, and poignant. I liked the singing
of Doug Jones (the sailor and shepherd) for its purity and
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan knows the score of this opera, and his knowledge shows in
every bar. His tempos were medium in speed: slower than Karl Bohm
and faster than Wilhelm Furtwangler, closer to Herbert von Karajan.
The Swiss conductor was a rock but not a boring rock. He produced a
ravishing silky sound from the orchestra, one I have never heard
from this pit, silk that is strong yet supple, beautiful but
rigorous. Glen Danielson's long English horn solo in the third act
deserves special praise.
</P>
<P>
   The work of stage director Francesca Zambello, set and costume
designer Alison Chitty and lighting designer Mimi Jordan Sherin was
of one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Zambello, who sought to equalize the human and heroic elements
of the opera, has done exactly that. Every gesture has reason
behind it, and scenes that often go dead in the theater spring to
life in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   To animate this opera with dramatic action is a huge task, but
Zambello has done that without stooping to silliness and gratuitous
action. Well, there is one exception: buff boys from local muscle
parlors, stripped to the waist, hair slicked back pretending to be
sailors in the first act. This almost camp mise-en-scene comes
perilously close to disrupting the intensity and meaning of the
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Chitty's set design is so potent and striking, it will long be
remembered for the way it illuminates the text and the characters
and the way it took advantage of the low, wide Opera House stage.
</P>
<P>
   The ship bearing Isolde from Ireland to Cornwall in Act I is
hardly of medieval design; rather, it evokes Russian Constructivism
in a sleek way: a handsome, luxurious space yet a prison for
Isolde. Panels open to reveal different sections of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The second act begins not in summer but bleak winter, snow
falling among giant birch trees. This could be Russia again, but
with the handsome glass pavilion center stage, I think more of
Johnson's famous glass house in Connecticut. This act is a triumph
of imaginative design, in which night and day are realized, the
terror and ecstasy of love illuminated. It is a series of coups de
theatre, including burning torches to signify the grim return of
day to the lovers. Chitty's third act is the least striking.
</P>
<P>
   Sherin is a lighting designer with a broad palette of
adventuresome colors and vivid imagination. Every scene she paints
with seeming abandon but in fact is carefully controlled. One
cannot imagine this production without her telling contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The production was intended to be complete. However, after the
dress rehearsal, Jenkins decided to take cuts in Acts 2 and 3,
about 12 minutes, to relieve pressure.
</P>
<P>

   SCI-CHILE-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ In the oven heat of day on the
high desert, cranes swing over the construction site, loaded trucks
groan up the winding road to the summit and workers in blue
hard-hats bend to their tasks around a gleaming machine anchored
inside one of the new buildings. It is the tableau of a mountaintop
being transformed by builders in the tradition of the Inca at
sacred Machu Picchu, but this time the lofty temples will be put to
the service of a modern scientific: cosmology. The worldwide
building boom in powerful astronomical observatories has now
reached this 8,000-foot mountain in the Atacama Desert of northern
Chile. By John Noble Wilford. (2500 words)

   SCI-MOTHER-CHILD (Undated) _ Challenging a popular belief about
human development, a researcher claims to have found that the
security of a baby's attachment to its mother does not influence
how well adjusted that child will be later in life. Events like
divorce, disease and accidents are far more important in shaping a
child's well-being at age 18 than early bonding with its mother. By
Sandra Blakeslee. (1650 words)

<P>
   SCI-MATH-FRAUD (Undated) _ Dr. Theodore P. Hill asks his
mathematics students at Georgia Tech to go home and either flip a
coin 200 times and record the results, or merely pretend to flip a
coin and fake 200 results. The following day he runs his eye over
the homework data, and to the students' amazement, he easily
fingers nearly all those who faked their tosses. There is more to
this than a classroom trick. Hill is one of a growing number of
statisticians, accountants and mathematicians who are convinced
that an astonishing mathematical theorem known as Benford's Law is
a powerful and relatively simple tool for pointing suspicion at
frauds, embezzlers, tax evaders, sloppy accountants and even
computer bugs. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Undated) _ When it first made headlines about
a decade ago, gene therapy seemed the answer to a prayer for
thousands of people with hereditary diseases. The idea is simple
and eloquent. Many inherited diseases are caused by a faulty gene,
which makes the body unable to produce some essential protein or
enzyme. Gene therapy would deliver the needed gene to a person's
cells, which would then begin producing the essential substance.
But gene therapy so far has not worked, mainly because it has been
difficult to get the genes to the desired cells efficiently and
have them produce enough of the needed protein. By Andrew Pollack.

   MARRIAGE-HEALTH (Undated) _ There is a brand new recipe for a
healthy life. The basic ingredients are a low-fat diet, regular
exercise _ and marriage. Countering conventional wisdom that
marriage is bad for women but good for men, a University of Chicago
researcher said she has found that marriage brings considerable
benefits to both women and men. It lengthens life, substantially
boosts physical and emotional health, and raises income over that
enjoyed by single or divorced people or those who live together,
she said. By Hara Estroff Marano. (1450 words.)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: A new
survey conducted has found that American men are again lagging
behind women in their concern for health. The survey revealed that

   SCI-CHILE-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ In the oven heat of day on the
high desert, cranes swing over the construction site, loaded trucks
groan up the winding road to the summit and workers in blue
hard-hats bend to their tasks around a gleaming machine anchored
inside one of the new buildings. It is the tableau of a mountaintop
being transformed by builders in the tradition of the Inca at
sacred Machu Picchu, but this time the lofty temples will be put to
the service of a modern scientific: cosmology. The worldwide
building boom in powerful astronomical observatories has now
reached this 8,000-foot mountain in the Atacama Desert of northern
Chile. By John Noble Wilford. (2500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOTHER-CHILD (Undated) _ Challenging a popular belief about
human development, a researcher claims to have found that the
security of a baby's attachment to its mother does not influence
how well adjusted that child will be later in life. Events like
divorce, disease and accidents are far more important in shaping a
child's well-being at age 18 than early bonding with its mother. By
Sandra Blakeslee. (1650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATH-FRAUD (Undated) _ Dr. Theodore P. Hill asks his
mathematics students at Georgia Tech to go home and either flip a
coin 200 times and record the results, or merely pretend to flip a
coin and fake 200 results. The following day he runs his eye over
the homework data, and to the students' amazement, he easily
fingers nearly all those who faked their tosses. There is more to
this than a classroom trick. Hill is one of a growing number of
statisticians, accountants and mathematicians who are convinced
that an astonishing mathematical theorem known as Benford's Law is
a powerful and relatively simple tool for pointing suspicion at
frauds, embezzlers, tax evaders, sloppy accountants and even
computer bugs. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Undated) _ When it first made headlines about
a decade ago, gene therapy seemed the answer to a prayer for
thousands of people with hereditary diseases. The idea is simple
and eloquent. Many inherited diseases are caused by a faulty gene,
which makes the body unable to produce some essential protein or
enzyme. Gene therapy would deliver the needed gene to a person's
cells, which would then begin producing the essential substance.
But gene therapy so far has not worked, mainly because it has been
difficult to get the genes to the desired cells efficiently and
have them produce enough of the needed protein. By Andrew Pollack.

   SCI-BOTANY-RAVEN (St. Louis) _ A new $146 million plant research
center in St. Louis promises to make the city an agricultural
Silicon Valley, proponents say. And the man largely behind the
city's prominence and the new center is Dr. Peter Raven, for 27
years the director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and one of the
nation's foremost botanists. But says his strength is in
biopoliticking, or networking to make things happen in the plant
world. By Nancy Beth Jackson. (1950 words)

<P>
   SCI-BURN-MASK (Undated) _ In an Ohio hospital, a group of
engineers, doctors and physical therapists are experimenting with
technology from the movie industry to produce a facial mask that
they hope will help speed the recovery of the 20,000 American
suffering serious burns each year. By Jane Ellen Stevens. (1350

<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Twenty-three software makers
responded last week to the issue of a consumer's control over his
own computer and declared ``don't ask, don't tell'' an unacceptable
competitive practice. The policy statement represents an effort to
correct years of abusive practices with a new industry standard
known as ``Ask, Tell &AMP; Help.'' By Rob Fixmer.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions: The moon and its
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: The human line has
emerged from Africa not once but twice. That is the ingenious and
far-reaching surmise proposed in the latest issue of Current
Biology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH PAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-HEALTH (Undated) _ There is a brand new recipe for a
healthy life. The basic ingredients are a low-fat diet, regular
exercise _ and marriage. Countering conventional wisdom that
marriage is bad for women but good for men, a University of Chicago
researcher said she has found that marriage brings considerable
benefits to both women and men. It lengthens life, substantially
boosts physical and emotional health, and raises income over that
enjoyed by single or divorced people or those who live together,
she said. By Hara Estroff Marano. (1450 words.)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: A new
survey conducted has found that American men are again lagging
behind women in their concern for health. The survey revealed that
while 76 percent of women had had a physical checkup within the
previous year, only 60 percent of men had done the same. And only
one-fourth of the men surveyed said they were interested in
improving their health and fitness. By Jane E. Brody. (1230 words)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ If etymologists ever feel the need to trace
the origins of beeperspeak, they'll have to research high school
life, circa 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Sweethearts, hoods, stoners, and loners all devised languages
that could be transmitted through their beepers, those sleek
pocket-size message centers religiously worn at the hip. When
paging a friend, they would dial in numeric codes instead of a
return phone number. The most widely known message, for example,
was 143, meaning ``I love you,'' the numbers signifying the letter
count of each affectionate word.
</P>
<P>
   But when beeperspeak surfaced, entrepreneur Norman Beauregard
was well out of high school and well out of the loop. Last year,
the 35-year-old from Attleboro, Mass., came up with what he thought
was a great idea: construct a beeper language in which numbers
could denote everyday words or phrases.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the concept wasn't all that novel. But
capitalizing on that concept was. And business is serving him well.
</P>
<P>
   Beauregard and two friends created ``The Universal Beeper Code
Book,'' a beeperspeak-English dictionary that comes in packages of
two for $4.95. About 22,000 packages have been sold nationwide to
gift shops and drugstores since December. The product also joined
the Web last week at www.thebeeperbook.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Beeperbook creators, Adam Three Inc. of Smithfield, are
banking on the unifying potential of the palm-size book. Sure,
teenagers have been communicating through pagers for years, but
each couple and set of friends had to invent their own esoteric
language. Think Beeperbook, think a united people: ``One book of
codes across the country,'' as Beauregard envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Small enough to fit in a wallet, the book assigns 270 words and
phrases to two- or three-digit numbers. Last year, Beauregard
invited to his home a circle of friends _ doctors, firefighters,
police officers, and lawyers _ to compile a list of commonly used
words. After six hours and a few beers, the group made the final
cut, which included terms like ``lunch,'' ``canceled,'' ``tee
time,'' and _ hey, why not? _ ``Beeperbook.'' Anything not
referenced in the book can be spelled out (A(EQ)01, B(EQ)02, etc.).
The last pages are blank, reserving codes 271 to 300 for personal
words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the high school codes, there is no method or reason to
the Beeperbook's matching of numbers with words, except that
everything is listed in alphabetic and numeric order. Even
Beauregard has no idea how to read a message unless he has the book
handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting anyone to memorize the book,''
said &UR;  &LR; Beauregard, who has applied for a patent on his creation.
``You just have to ask people when they're going out, `Do you have
your Beeperbook?'''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration came to Beauregard when he grew frustrated with
searching for a pay phone every time his wife, friends, or
associates paged him in the car. He would have to pull over, use
his calling card, and learn that his wife, for instance, wanted him
to pick up some milk on the way home. With the Beeperbook, she can
punch in 211-260-123 (``after work/ &QC; 
pick up/milk''). And he doesn't need to stop the car or make the
call _ he just needs to bring home the milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, our slogan was going to be `Saves time, saves
money,' but we had to change it to `It's fun, too,''' said
Beauregard, pretending to read his pager and eagerly flip through
the tiny pages. ``When you get a code, you get your little book
out. It's just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the humble surroundings of his Adam Three
office, the basement of the day-care center where he sends his
youngest son. There's no view, of course, and the unfurnished space
next to the office serves as a holding area for shipments. Adam
Three shares the office with Beauregard's partners, John Felici and
David Losardo of Cam Am Sales, a packaging and paper products firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Beauregard is familiar with launching small businesses from
modest means. At 18, the Woonsocket native started Keyboard
Concepts, which makes specialized computer keys.
</P>
<P>
   He fears no threat from the latest alpha-numeric pagers, which
have bigger screens and advanced technology to allow for word
messages. Users can read e-mail, weather and traffic updates, CNN
news, and stock quotes on the screen. But these models usually cost
$100 to $200 with a charge of $12 to $30 a month, whereas numeric
pagers can run as low as $50 with monthly fees under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Pager use in the country tends to skew toward people aged 18 to
34, and 80 percent are the numeric type, said a Motorola regional
spokeswoman, Monique Allen. Fourteen percent of the 50 million
pager users are teenagers. Pager makers are apparently trying to
woo this market by releasing models in leopard-skin patterns and
hot pink. ``The young generation wants the trendiest color,'' Allen
said. ``They're very fashion-conscious, and they want a hip and
trendy pager.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeperbook sales in Pawtucket's Alpha Page beeper shop are ``not
too good,'' according to 17-year-old sales representative Ana
Borges. People in their 30s are buying the books, but Borges's
teenage friends ``haven't even considered it, probably because we
have our own codes,'' she said. ``We have 143, which means `I love
you,' but to them, it means something like, `Pick up the milk.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young people comprise one market Adam Three particularly wants
to target. ``If you put the Beeperbook in their hands, they'll have
a ball,'' said company partner Losardo. In ProCom Wireless shops in
Texas, 14-year-olds to 20-somethings are buying the inexpensive
books because most of them still use numeric pagers, said sales
director Emmett Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After a hockey or soccer game, Beauregard's 10-year-old son,
Ryan, punches in the scores and ``won'' or ``lost'' when beeping
his dad.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's some fun in store for the zany and creative.
The book's vocabulary can allow sentence constructions like ``Thank
you for the doughnuts'' (176-84-70), ``Sorry, I lost your mother''
(169-104-115-210-128), or ``Just wanted to say, `I love to clean
diapers''' (243-104-247-57-66).
</P>
<P>
   And the old cherished declaration of ``I love you''? According
to the Beeperbook, 143 now means ``pharmacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quipped Losardo: ``We're breaking tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ON THOSE BEEPERS &QL; 
 &QL; 
Talk about a generation gap. The numeric codes traditionally used
by teen-agers, according to the Motorola Web site, can carry
completely different meanings in the new Beeperbook. &QL;

`PRIVATE RYAN' MEANS TEARS, TORMENT FOR VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union

   GUILDERLAND, N.Y. _ His gait was slow and measured as he left
the theater, but Harold Ripps' clenched fists and traces of
moisture beneath his eyes revealed his true feelings about the
movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old veteran of World War II had heard about the
film's graphic re-enactment of the D-Day invasion at Omaha Beach in
Normandy. But he wasn't prepared for the way the sounds of bullets
zinging and anguished screams of men dying on the screen brought
back his own memories of fighting in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more realistic than any movie I've ever seen,'' said
Ripps, who served with the 2nd Division of the 38th Infantry Unit
in Germany and France. ``It really struck home.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened last month, thousands of moviegoers young and
old have flocked to see director Steven Spielberg's testament to
the brutality of war. The film has struck a chord with veterans _
not only of World War II, but of Vietnam, Korea and the Persian
Gulf, as well _ unearthing long-forgotten or carefully buried
recollections of combat.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, veterans' hospitals have been inundated with
calls from men seeking help coping with disturbing memories
uncovered by the movie's realism. In some cases, the film's stark
portrayal of torn flesh and frightened soldiers watching their
friends die triggered what is called post traumatic stress disorder
in veterans who had never experienced such difficulties before,
counselors said.
</P>
<P>
   Having already experienced such outpourings of emotion from
veterans after the release of Vietnam War movies like ``Platoon''
and ``Full Metal Jacket,'' the Department of Veterans Affairs in
Washington extended the hours of its telephone hot line after
``Saving Private Ryan'' opened at the theaters. The line, which is
normally not staffed over the weekend, received more than 100 calls
in three days, said Laurie Tranter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these movies can be cathartic,'' said James C.
Garrett, a clinical psychologist at the Vet Center in Albany, N.Y.
``We've seen a lot of these kinds of movies cause some people to go
out and get the help they needed. This goes all the way back to
films like `The Deer Hunter' and `Apocalypse Now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 6.6 million of the 16 million men who fought in World
War II are still alive, according to Department of Veterans Affairs
records.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the opening scene of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which
depicts the first wave of the invasion at Omaha Beach, that evokes
the most visceral response from many veterans. The 25-minute scene
follows the soldiers as they storm the beach. Scores were mowed
down by German machine gunners, and terrified young men begged for
their mothers as they dodged bullets and cowered in the water
tinged crimson with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought back my most vivid memories of combat; I could even
smell the gunpowder,'' said John Howe, a Vietnam vet who went to
see the movie in memory of his father and father-in-law, both of
whom fought in World War II. ``The dance of death, we used to call
it. The smoke, the bodies _ it was all there.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe was an infantryman in the 101st Airborne Division, the same
company to which the fictitious Pvt. James Ryan belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Many have lauded ``Saving Private Ryan,'' saying it is a
particularly valuable teaching tool for members of younger
generations who have neither lived during wartime nor fought in a
battle.
</P>
<P>
   But not all veterans are rushing to join the crowds seeing
``Saving Private Ryan.'' For some, who are aging or infirm, the
movie is just not a priority _ particularly because it might
resurrect memories of an experience so horrifying and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure do think there's a need (for the movie) because it
gives people the idea of the hell us fellows went through,'' said
Thomas J. Callahan, 84, who was a warrant officer on the USS
Yorktown, an aircraft carrier lost during the Battle of Midway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if I want to see it, though. I saw my share of
combat, and I saw guys get killed. I know what they went through _
you never forget.''

   EUROPE-AIRCON (Rome) _ While America has embraced
air-conditioning, Europe has traditionally just taken summer
afternoons off. Stores in Italy closed for the noontime heat, and
Spaniards took siestas. In the evening, Europe sat outside in the
piazza. In the hottest weeks, the Continent simply shut down. But
the piazza has become polluted by exhaust fumes, and the pressures
of a global economy are increasingly forcing Europeans to work

percent in the first quarter, an even worse decline than the 2
percent reported earlier. By Mark Landler.

TALENTED FEMALE ARTISTS YOU MIGHT NOT SEE AT LILITH FAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN and MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no end to the number of excellent female artists out
there _ and the sad reality is, for every one that sells bunches of
CDs and plays the main stage at Lilith, several others are just as
talented and deserving. Some others you might enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   GILLIAN WELCH: Along with partner David Rawlings, the
California-born Welch makes music that seems to spring to life from
old Walker Evans photographs; they spin tales of dying miners,
morphine addicts, poor farmers, restless ghosts and moonshine
stills up in the hills. Welch's first CD, ``Revival,'' came out in
1995; the follow-up, ``Hell Among the Yearlings,'' was released
last week.
</P>
<P>
   SAM PHILLIPS: In the '80s, Sam (then going by Leslie Phillips)
cut Christian CDs for major genre labels Myrrh and Word. But in
1988, she began making secular CDs, which were more rock-oriented
and arty but still concerned with issues of spirituality.
``Martinis &AMP; Bikinis,'' from 1994, included her two best-known
songs, ``Baby, I Can't Please You'' and ``Strawberry Road,'' but
'96's ``Omnipop (It's Only a Flesh Wound Lambchop),'' is her
masterpiece, a strange and wonderful, richly textured CD. She is
married to Fort Worth-bred singer/songwriter/producer T Bone
Burnett, who has produced several of her CDs.
</P>
<P>
   PATTY GRIFFIN: This thirtysomething East
Coaster-turned-Austinite released one of 1996's best albums,
``Living With Ghosts,'' one of the most hauntingly gorgeous
acoustic discs this side of Springsteen's ``Nebraska.'' A full band
backs on her latest effort, this year's ``Flaming Red''; it's a
rewardingly eclectic album that fluidly moves from pop to lounge to
straightforward rock. She'll tour this fall.
</P>
<P>
   KATELL KEINEG: Born in Wales and now living in Ireland, Keineg
has released two unclassifiable, exotic CDs that blend in
everything from fairly straight-ahead folk-pop to rock to hip-hop
to Middle Eastern touches to Led Zeppelinish orchestration. Last
year's ``Jet,'' her second CD, included the semihit ``One Hell of a
Life,'' and she appeared on Lilith's second stage in some venues
last year.
</P>
<P>
   FREAKWATER: This duo pairs Kentucky natives and high school pals
Janet Beveridge Bean (who also drums in the great Chicago
indie-rock band Eleventh Dream Day) and Catherine Irwin. The two
began playing bars in Louisville and released their first,
eponymous CD in 1989. Since then they've released four more CDs,
all full of rustic, sad back-porch laments, including numerous
songs about dead children. The group's latest effort, the very
impressive ``Springtime,'' came out early this year.
</P>
<P>
   KELLY WILLIS: Record companies and this amazing Austin country
singer simply do not get along. Willis, whose voice echoes the
magical twang of Patsy Cline, has had at least two major labels
sign, then release, her, simply because she refuses to play by
their rules. Still, she perseveres: She collaborated with fellow
Texas musicians like Dale Watson and Asleep at the Wheel on a new
outlaw-country compilation, ``Wandering Eyes,'' and she's shopping
around a new record. Kelly Willis, we pray, will get her day.

   &UR; SCIENCE and HEALTH &LR;  (``a'' or ``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILE-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ In the oven heat of day on the
high desert, cranes swing over the construction site, loaded trucks
groan up the winding road to the summit and workers in blue
hard-hats bend to their tasks around a gleaming machine anchored
inside one of the new buildings. It is the tableau of a mountaintop
being transformed by builders in the tradition of the Inca at
sacred Machu Picchu, but this time the lofty temples will be put to
the service of a modern scientific: cosmology. The worldwide
building boom in powerful astronomical observatories has now
reached this 8,000-foot mountain in the Atacama Desert of northern
Chile. By John Noble Wilford. (2500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOTHER-CHILD (Undated) _ Challenging a popular belief about
human development, a researcher claims to have found that the
security of a baby's attachment to its mother does not influence
how well adjusted that child will be later in life. Events like
divorce, disease and accidents are far more important in shaping a
child's well-being at age 18 than early bonding with its mother. By
Sandra Blakeslee. (1650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATH-FRAUD (Undated) _ Dr. Theodore P. Hill asks his
mathematics students at Georgia Tech to go home and either flip a
coin 200 times and record the results, or merely pretend to flip a
coin and fake 200 results. The following day he runs his eye over
the homework data, and to the students' amazement, he easily
fingers nearly all those who faked their tosses. There is more to
this than a classroom trick. Hill is one of a growing number of
statisticians, accountants and mathematicians who are convinced
that an astonishing mathematical theorem known as Benford's Law is
a powerful and relatively simple tool for pointing suspicion at
frauds, embezzlers, tax evaders, sloppy accountants and even
computer bugs. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Undated) _ When it first made headlines about
a decade ago, gene therapy seemed the answer to a prayer for
thousands of people with hereditary diseases. The idea is simple
and eloquent. Many inherited diseases are caused by a faulty gene,
which makes the body unable to produce some essential protein or
enzyme. Gene therapy would deliver the needed gene to a person's
cells, which would then begin producing the essential substance.
But gene therapy so far has not worked, mainly because it has been
difficult to get the genes to the desired cells efficiently and
have them produce enough of the needed protein. By Andrew Pollack.

<P>
   SCI-BOTANY-RAVEN (St. Louis) _ A new $146 million plant research
center in St. Louis promises to make the city an agricultural
Silicon Valley, proponents say. And the man largely behind the
city's prominence and the new center is Dr. Peter Raven, for 27
years the director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and one of the
nation's foremost botanists. But says his strength is in
biopoliticking, or networking to make things happen in the plant
world. By Nancy Beth Jackson. (1950 words)

   SCI-BURN-MASK (Undated) _ In an Ohio hospital, a group of
engineers, doctors and physical therapists are experimenting with
technology from the movie industry to produce a facial mask that
they hope will help speed the recovery of the 20,000 American
suffering serious burns each year. By Jane Ellen Stevens. (1350

 &HT;    Boxing great tries experimental treatment for Parkinson's
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin and Mary War
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Muhammad Ali who danced around a
generation of heavyweight fighters and set the standard against
which all boxers are judged leans deeply into the armrests of his
chair and rises.
</P>
<P>
   He walks gingerly to a door frame, lingers, leans for a moment
into the wall with his right shoulder, and bidding his audience of
three to pay attention to the soles of his black high-top sneakers,
he levitates.
</P>
<P>
   In the moment, the years fall away, as does the Parkinson's
disease that has stolen his grace. In the moment, Ali is again, the
magician. And the magician has risen.
</P>
<P>
   He has come to suburban Boca Raton on a pilgrimage, he says, to
return to the days when he floated above the ring and punished his
opponents with a beauty so startling everyone looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make a comeback,'' Ali says, his gravelly voice
barely above a whisper. ``That's my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived last Tuesday from Canada to begin treatments with
Jerry Jacobson, a retired dentist and oral surgeon who lives in
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Inside an office at West Boca Medical Center, Jacobson is
surrounded by acolytes. They are the parents of children with
cerebral palsy and brain damage, and they believe in his magic.
They sing his praises. They believe that the Jacobson resonator
will deliver their children.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, too, has come to be saved. Modern medicine, the
establishment's best and brightest, have failed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to 15 different doctors,'' Ali says softly, his
expression flat. ``None of them have been able to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So The Greatest has sat, for five sessions now, on a cushion in
a $15 lawn chair between two black, eight-foot high circles. He has
sat and prayed that the self-described genius with the white hair
and white suit is telling the truth, and has figured out a way to
rejigger the particles of his body and deliver him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no cure,'' he says, again his voice barely audible.
``Maybe next year. In ten years. Next month.''
</P>
<P>
   His mind has never stopped working, his acuity has not been
diminished. He closes his eyes in mid-conversation as if he is
asleep, and reopens them a moment later, wide-eyed, in mock
surprise at the faces looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the most recognized man on earth,'' he says. ``Of all the
movies stars, of all the athletes ...'' He turns to a teenage girl
sitting nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw me on the street, would you recognize me?'' He
asks. The girls answer yes. ``Everybody knows who I am,'' he says.
A smile crosses his face.
</P>
<P>
   It is the face of the most recognized man on earth, and it is
waiting to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary boxer is just one of many celebrities Jacobson
says he's treated with his signature Jacobson resonance machine,
which emits a weak magnetic field. Jacobson is using the
electromagnetic machine to treat everything from a bad knee to
neurological disorders like Ali's.
</P>
<P>
   He is still working on proving the machine will help patients
overcome osteoarthritis in the knee so the Food &AMP; Drug
Administration will give him approval to mass produce the gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are built at NASA's Stennis Space Center in
Mississippi. NASA got involved with the help of U.S. Senate
Majority Leader Tent Lott, R-Miss., after Jacobson promised to mass
produce the machines in Mississippi if he receives FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers must treat at least 135 patients in the study for
the FDA. About 70 of them are patients at two centers at West Boca
Medical Center _ the Pioneer Services Medical Center and the
National Medical and Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital says it has no affiliation with the research. The
companies say they rent space from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 people are being treated for illnesses that are not
part of the FDA study. Most of the patients are seen in suburban
Boca Raton; the rest are being treated at clinics at West Gables
Rehabilitation Hospital in Miami-Dade County and at Coastal
Rehabilitation Medical Center in Gulf Port, Miss., Jacobson said.
The treatment is free to those in the FDA study. It costs others
about $100 a treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And more research is being done at Cornell University in New
York and University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Jacobson promised 11-year-old Angelie Diya that he
could cure her AIDS with his machine. The young girl had won over
many hearts when she told her classmates at Jupiter Farms
Elementary School that she had the disease. Diya has been to the
clinic for pain-relief treatments, said Fank Caviano, chief
operating officer of Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Parkinson's, Jacobson theorizes that his
machine's magnetic waves will awaken Ali's homeotic genes. He says
those are the genes responsible for making all your body parts what
they are. Making a liver, a liver; an eye, an eye; a brain, a
brain. They shut down after their initial work in young children.
</P>
<P>
   Once the homeotic genes are stimulated, Jacobson hopes they will
regenerate cells in Ali's brain and produce dopamine, which helps
us move. It is the lack of dopamine that results in Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough case,'' Jacobson said. ``He is a monumental
figure. An icon. We are doing everything in our power to help
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although homeotic genes are described in some medical literature
and universities' Web sites, they aren't listed in a widely-used
medical dictionary or a term familiar to Dr. Robert Brodner, a West
Palm Beach neurosurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   And Brodner, who has done brain surgery on about 60 people with
Parkinson's, said that regeneration within the brain is ``minimal
to nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So personally, I don't know what this fellow is talking about.
I only hope that he does,'' Brodner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quite believe this, but on the other hand it will be
interesting to see the affect and see if this is successful. Any
treatment that doesn't have the potential to harm a patient can be
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a miracle cure, the prognosis for people with
Parkinson's is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Some can last years without any noticeable affects. Some live
for more than 40 years with the disease. Others are almost
immediately bedridden and incoherent. These conditions make
patients susceptible to other problems like choking, pneumonia and
falls _ which can result in death.
</P>
<P>
   One strike against Ali, a four-time heavyweight champ, is the
relatively young age when the Parkinson's set in. Now 56, he was in
his early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Ali is not the only sports star to get Jacobson's treatment.
Professional Bowlers Association Hall of Famer Dave Davies// of
Boynton Beach was in constant pain for more than three years after
his right kneecap was broken. His pain disappeared after a partial
knee replacement last fall and after treatment at Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Golfer Doug Tewell, who works for the Golf Channel, also is
amazed by the pain relief he's received. He thought he was headed
for surgery on his right elbow. But after several treatments with
Jacobson in the last month, he is holding off on the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had trouble picking up glass with my right arm without
severe pain,'' he said. ``I went from severe pain and possible
surgery to winning $115,000 in two weeks.''

 &HT;    ShortTakes: Proliferation not all bad
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iran has joined the missile club. One of the most testy,
distasteful and unstable of regimes is getting all gussied up to
whack any country, friend or foe, in the Middle East All Iran lacks
is something sufficiently loathsome to top off its missiles _
nuclear, biological or vaporous.
</P>
<P>
   The missile club is not exclusive. Russia, China and North Korea
seem to be dispatching parts as fast as they can ship them to any
griper with hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much to do but fret. I have stolen _ and, I hope,
respectfully advanced _ an idea from Joseph Heller's great war
novel ``Catch-22.'' You will recall that at one point the U.S. Army
Air Corps hires itself out to the Germans to bomb its own bases,
thus saving money and even more inconvenience for the strapped
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario needs technological updating. How's this: The
missile-club nations agree to accommodate and install one doomsday
device for each country in the club. The devices will be exploded
only after a distinguished international committee determines war
is inevitable. Participating countries will then blow themselves
up, or, as the case may be, gas or sicken their populations. Care
would be taken that no one turns weak-kneed, or sneakily nurture a
``you-go-first'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of cash saved would satisfy any freshman Republican.
Additionally, the plan would fashionably exemplify government doing
things to people rather than for them.

(NOTE: This story has a sidebar slugged BEACH-TRAVEL.   There are
two color photos available from the NYTimes.) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGUNA BEACH _ If the grind is getting to you and you're
daydreaming of a quick escape, pack a bag and grab the car keys.
Salvation is little more than an hour's drive away.
</P>
<P>
   With its deep bays, beaches and coves, jagged bluffs and rock
formations, Laguna Beach is a picturesque sight reminiscent of the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In this city long known as an artist colony, there's plenty to
take in _ surf, sand, art galleries, shopping, restaurants _ and
through the end of August, live performances nightly of the Pageant
of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Laguna is about 75 miles from the Valley or Los Angeles,
depending on where you live _ and an hour and a half drive on a
good traffic day. Traffic congestion can add considerably to the
drive, so on a weekday plan to leave either after the morning
rush-hour traffic or around noon before the afternoon congestion.
On weekends, the earlier start you get the better _ so you can find
parking.
</P>
<P>
   On a Tuesday afternoon a few weeks ago, we found the beach town
sheer pleasure. It wasn't swarming and crowded with tourists and
beach-goers like we've experienced on summer weekends in the past _
and it was even easy to find parking spots, although you'll need
plenty of quarters to feed the meters; a quarter buys only 15
minutes in the city meters.
</P>
<P>
   Although we've been to Laguna numerous times during the last 20
years, on the way into town from the Pacific Coast Highway in
Corona del Mar, we decided to leisurely explore some of the
gorgeous beach scenery on this beautiful sunny day. First stop was
Crescent Bay Point Park. You can reach it easily by turning right
on Crescent Bay Drive (it's opposite 1570 N. Coast Highway), a
short dead-end cul-de-sac street. Park when you see the park's
sign. Get out and walk the small landscaped facility that offers a
glimpse of Crescent Bay, with its sunbathers and swimmers, and
miles of magnificent views along the shore. We stopped to talk to a
UPS delivery man perched in the gazebo on the cliff, eating his
lunch. He was quick to note that this site offered ``the best views
in the city.'' It's no wonder artists are attracted to this area.
(Entrances to Crescent Bay beach are located near the intersection
of Cliff Drive and Circle Way).
</P>
<P>
   After you've indulged in the scenery, return to Coast Highway,
turn right and continue south a few more blocks, and then turn
right again on either Fairview Street or Wave Street, and left onto
Cliff Drive. Park along Cliff Drive, get out and take in the pretty
stretch of shoreline that is along the clifftop in Heisler Park
with its trees and grassy areas. The views were peaceful and
awesome. Drive or walk south on Cliff Drive until you almost reach
Las Brisas restaurant. Then head past the back of the restaurant
down the path to the Main Beach, where you'll find beach-goers
soaking up the sun and others playing volleyball or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Across Coast Highway, you'll find the main village shopping
areas. There are plenty of shops, art galleries and specialty
boutiques to visit along Forest Avenue, Ocean Avenue, Laguna Avenue
and Main Steet. And you'll find plenty of restaurants sprinkled in
between.
</P>
<P>
   If you like Italian and Greek majolica, be sure to stop by Fiori
at 214 S. Coast Highway, with its ceramic imports ranging from huge
containers and pots to dishes, canister sets, cups, mugs and more.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many shops scattered south along Coast Highway.
If the weather is nice, the walk is invigorating. One of our
favorite galleries with quality originals is the Esther Wells
Collection at 1390 S. Coast Highway. Exhibitions change often, and
it's always interesting to see what's new.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, we picked up our car and drove south on Coast
Highway, turning right on several streets such as Oak, Brooks and
Cress to get a glimpse of the beach and some wonderful views. For a
fabulous view, turn right just south of the Surf and Sand Hotel on
Agate Street, then turn left on Ocean and exit on Pearl or Diamond
streets. Stop and get out and you'll get a view of the hidden
Wood's Cove. Of course, if you feel so inclined, you can spend some
time walking on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the Pageant of the Masters, an extravagant two-hour
show of living pictures or re-creations of classic and contemporary
works of art (paintings, sculptures, bronzes, etc.) _ with local
residents dressed, made up and posed (remaining motionless) to
resemble their counterparts in the original art pieces. Accompanied
by a full pit orchestra, live vocals, live narration, intricate
sets and special lighting, this year's nightly show in the
tree-lined amphitheater set in Laguna Canyon is themed
``Metropolis: Art of the World's Great Capitals.'' The show is
truly a labor of love for the team of 500 volunteers who will have
donated by the season's end an estimated 60,000 hours of collective
time to the pageant. Two casts, which perform on alternating weeks
during the two-month run (July and August), consist of about 300
members.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's pageant, you'll take an artistic tour of the
world, visiting Rome, Paris, Bangkok, Vienna and Washington, D.C.
The opening masterpiece in Act 1 replicates the marble Fountains of
Rome, including Neptune Fountain (Giovanni Ceccarina, 19th century)
and Fountain of the Four Rivers (Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1651) each
one nestled in the hills on each side of the stage, followed by the
awesome re-creation of the Trevi Fountain (Nicola Salvi, 1762) on
center stage. That is followed by a presentation of Claude Monet's
1867 oil painting ``Women in the Garden.'' Other standouts in the
first act include Edvard Eriksen's bronze of ``The Little Mermaid''
statue (1913) in Copenhagen, which evokes a moonlit night ambience;
Michelangelo's marble, ``The Pieta'' (1499); and ``Our Nation's
Capital,'' with re-creations of the bronze ``Freedom''; the oil on
canvas ``Washington Crossing the Delaware''; the steel ``Korean War
Memorial''; the bronze ``Vietnam Women's Memorial''; the bronze
``Three Soldiers''; and the bronze sculpture ``The U.S. Marine
Corps War Memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second part of the program, your eyes will feast on
living copies of such works as Winslow Homer's wood engraving ``Art
Students and Copyists in the Louvre'' (1868); the marble ``Venus de
Milo'' (artist unknown, 200 B.C); the oil on canvas ``At the Moulin
Rouge: The Dance'' (Toulouse-Lautrec, 1890) and works of Music City
U.S.A., including Thomas Hart Benton's (1975) oil on canvas ``The
Sources of Country Music''; and Kelly Akins' (1998) acrylic
paintings of Patsy and Hillbilly Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Sensational in their display and depiction are the re-creations
of the marble ``Mozart Memorial,'' the bronze ``Beethoven
Memorial'' and the gilt bronze/marble ``Strauss Memorial.'' As has
been the case in the numerous times I've attended over the years,
the program again closes with a living re-creation of Leonardo da
Vinci's most famous fresco, ``The Last Supper.'' Wherever your
seats, be sure to take binoculars so you can see the incredible
details of all of the works presented.
</P>
<P>
   Treat yourself if you've never been to the pageant before. It's
an experience of a lifetime, and one you'll not soon forget. The
professional caliber of the program is truly amazing _ but then
again, when you have top-notch artists working on such a venture,
you expect nothing short of spectacular _ and it is once again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant director Diane Challis Davy, now in her third season,
hopes that this year's pageant-goers will take away with them a new
interest in the excitement that art can bring to one's life. ``I
want them to have a new appreciation for art, not only in the
capital cities, but all around them in their own cities and
communities,'' she said. Each year, more than 200,000 people attend
the annual pageant, which started in the 1930s and has been going
strong ever since (except 1942-45 during World War II).
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to spend some time prior to the pageant perusing the
exhibits and juried show of some 160 artists in the Festival of
Arts displayed on the festival grounds. The show _ open from 10
a.m. to 11:30 p.m. daily _ includes only original works. All of the
items are for sale. You'll be admitted free with your pageant
tickets. However if you're not attending the pageant, you can view
the exhibits (an admission fee of $3 to $5 is charged).
</P>
<P>
   We arrived around 5:30 p.m. to allow plenty of time to peruse
the interesting works _ ranging from jewelry and glass to acrylics,
sculpture, furniture, mixed media, oil paintings, photography and
more. Our timing was great as we avoided any crowds _ and could see
the exhibits close-up without jostling for space or enduring any
wait. If you feel like getting a snack, Ruby's in a food court on
the grounds offers quick fare such as burgers and fries. Tivoli
Terrace, a restaurant in a garden-setting overlooking the exhibits,
offers more leisurely dining.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eat on the grounds, we opted to walk to the Laguna
Beach Brewing Co. on South Coast Highway for a few appetizer snacks
prior to the show. The really informal second-floor dining room
offers a good ocean view if you can get a seat next to the window.
The fare is rather mundane, but the brews were good.
</P>
<P>
   Art and craft fans also might enjoy visiting the Sawdust
Festival at 935 Laguna Canyon Road, and the Art-A-Fair at 777
Laguna Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to make time for a visit to the glass-facade Laguna Art
Museum (by Las Brisas at the corner of Cliff Drive and Coast
Highway).
</P>
<P>
   Dining choices in Laguna are numerous and varied _ ranging from
casual to more elegant. Las Brisas, 361 Cliff Drive, is the place
to stop for a margarita. The outside patio offers spectacular
cliff-top views. You also can sit in the window-lined interior.
Splashes in the Surf and Sand Hotel with ocean views is another
choice, but it's more pricey. Although it doesn't have a view,
Romeo Cucina on Broadway is one of my favorite casual places
offering Mediterranean/Italian fare. Cafe Zinc and Anastasia Cafe
are good quick lunch spots I'd recommend, too.
</P>
<P>
   Take a break _ and take in Laguna Beach for a day or two. The
scenery is breathtaking, and you'll feel like you've been in
another world _ and away much longer than you really were.

`MAXIMUM BOB' IS QUIRKY, IF NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a tropical disturbance roiling in the Gulf, the comparisons
to ``Northern Exposure'' are starting to build. Similarities are
undeniable: quirky script, interesting cast, summer launch. If
``Maximum Bob'' can retain the slice 'n' dice edge of its pilot
episode _ and if ABC has the sense to stick with it as word of
mouth spreads _ we might have a keeper here.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that ABC is committed to only seven episodes of
``Bob'' while it gives ``NYPD Blue'' a late-summer breather.
``Northern Exposure'' had a similar limited run in the summer of
1990 and disappeared for seven months before returning to CBS's
regular schedule in April '91.
</P>
<P>
   'Course, ABC's recent track record with pithy, provocative
programming is not reassuring. Jettisoned titles spring readily to
mind like cherished blasts from the past: ``My So-called Life'',
``Relativity,'' ``Cracker,'' ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   On the pith meter, ``Maximum Bob'' falls short. But provocative?
Those who know Elmore Leonard's work can assume even a TV version
of ``Maximum Bob'' will be about as politically correct as a burp
in church.
</P>
<P>
   Judge ``Maximum Bob'' Gibbs is the tasteless, tactless,
shoot-from-the-lip kind of full-meal deal TV viewers haven't seen
since Archie Bunker. In these delicately sensitive times, he's
bound to knot the knickers of some group dedicated to the ethical
treatment of something. If a band of Catholics can find fault with
the caring, compassionate priest of ``Nothing Sacred,'' someone is
bound to complain about Bob, who ignores the law, bullies
defendants, stereotypes ethnic groups and, with the help of an
ornery alligator, tries to frighten his semi-estranged and
completely loopy wife into leaving him.
</P>
<P>
   Bob is an all-around despicable guy, and Beau Bridges plays him
with relish and a side of ham. More to the point, Bridges makes him
believable and downright likable.
</P>
<P>
   So consider this fair warning. Pay a visit to ``Maximum Bob''
Tuesday night, and don't worry too much if the TV gets wet. Gibbs
lives in a place called Deepwater, Fla., after all, and he's the
creation of a novelist whose characters are splashier than anything
on ``Shark Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The title character is a flamboyant Florida hangin' judge who is
tough on crime, tougher on common sense. His rulings don't fit the
law of logic, but Bob is a politician, and flouting convention gets
more notice than flaunting congeniality. Living life large also
helps.
</P>
<P>
   Any performer would dive into such a role. In keeping with Bob's
big-boy persona, Bridges' dive of choice seems to have been the
cannonball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be accused of chewing the scenery,'' Bridges
told a group of TV critics recently, ``but when you get the green
light, hey, you know, go for it. You don't have too many times in
your career where you can get that wild and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, ``Maximum Bob'' was to have been a Barry Sonnenfeld
feature film in the manner of ``Get Shorty,'' another darkly funny
Leonard novel. But Leonard's gift for goofiness prompted Sonnenfeld
to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry decided he really wanted to do it as a television series
because he loved the characters and thought they would endure,''
said Barry Josephson, Sonnenfeld's production partner.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, ABC ordered 12 episodes plus the pilot, then halved
the order when executives decided on the summertime launch. ABC
won't say that it cut back out of fear that ``Bob'' might offend
advertisers, but a summer launch is certainly a lower-profile,
lower-risk option. If it catches on, terrific. If no one watches,
the world will have forgotten it in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, the Sonnenfeld camp seems willing to buy
ABC's reasoning. Though admitting to some hurt feelings when told
of the change order, Josephson said he is now enthusiastic about
premiering the show outside the clutter of fall or midseason
launches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured they only had six to seven slots for us and there
was no need to do 12,'' he said. ``Just do six or seven, see what
kind of a response we got, and then hopefully come back
midseason.''
</P>
<P>
   All seven episodes, shot in Florida, have been completed, so
cast and crew can do nothing now but wait for audience response.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges is philosophical about the chances of returning after
the seven-episode teaser. ``I learned a long time ago,'' he said,
``not to have any expectations as far as longevity goes in a
television series.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't mind another crack at playing Maximum Bob to the
max, even if Bob doesn't set well with the pooh-bahs of political
correctitude. As Bob says early in Tuesday night's episode, ``We do
things a little unorthodox around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges is happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry (Sonnenfeld) encouraged me,'' Bridges disclosed. ``He
said, `You've got an outrageous guy there.' So I can get about as
crazy as I can get because there are a lot of people that live in
Deepwater that can put me in line when I get too crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is a voluble public defender named Kathy Baker,
played not by Kathy Baker but by Liz Vassey (``All My Children'').
Baker, whose husband has left her for a dental assistant, arrives
in Deepwater on a temporary assignment but stays in town after
deciding there's no reason to go home to Miami and ample reason to
keep somebody like Judge Gibbs on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot episode, Vassey is charming and feisty, but the
least convincing of the principal players. She seems unsure if
she's performing in a drama or a comedy, which may have to do with
Sonnenberg's attempt to give TV audiences a lighter version of
Elmore Leonard. (Script writer and executive producer Alex Gansa
has explained that if a cancer were to occur in the book, it would
be malignant, and if there were one in the series, it would be
benign.)
</P>
<P>
   Sam Robards plays the other setup role more effectively, making
it clear that the widowed sheriff, Gary Hammond, is the voice of
reason in Deepwater.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum Bob's wife, Leanne Lancaster, is the opposite of reason.
Leanne is the one-time star of an R-rated underwater mermaid act
whose near-drowning gave her special psychic ability, not to
mention a second personality _ that of a 12-year-old slave girl _
who emerges when Leanne least expects it to. It may be a juicier
role than even Bob's, and an inspired Kiersten Warren squeezes
every drop from it.
</P>
<P>
   Though billed as a humorous drama, ``Maximum Bob'' is broader
and sillier than ``Northern Exposure,'' and it might be more
fitting to classify it as a seriocomedy in the tradition of another
Sonnenfeld film, ``Men in Black,'' and certainly in keeping with
last season's biggest surprise, ``Ally McBeal,'' which is competing
for awards in the comedy category.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's a refreshing summertime julep that would
improve ABC's lineup in all seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum Bob. Hourlong series about an eccentric judge in an
eccentric Florida town, based on the Elmore Leonard novel, starring
Beau Bridges, Liz Vassey, Kiersten Warren and Sam Robards.

GIVING MEN DIRECTIONS TO THE ROAD TO BETTER HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (JT)  
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hospitals all over the country are opening women's health
centers, offering breast and pelvic examinations, bone density
tests, blood and urine tests and counseling on nutrition, weight
control, stress management and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason these centers cater to women: Survey after
survey has shown that women pay more attention to their physical
and emotional well-being and are more likely than men to take steps
to protect their health and check out early signs of possible
disease. And once again, a new survey conducted for Men's Health
magazine and CNN has found that American men are behind the
preventive health eight-ball.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in April among 1,017 men and women by
Opinion Research Corporation International, disclosed that while 76
percent of women had had a physical checkup within the previous
year, only 60 percent of men had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolating from another survey's finding, researchers
estimated that of the nation's 87 million men, nearly 7 million had
not seen a doctor for a checkup in 10 or more years _ not since
Ronald Reagan was President. And only one-fourth of the men
surveyed said they were interested in improving their health and
fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Why Bother?
</P>
<P>
   As the population ages and the proportion of people over 50
years old grows, more and more are reaching the age when health
problems develop. Many of these problems can be easily treated and
reversed if detected early enough, which generally happens in a
regular physical examination. This kind of checkup also gives
doctors an opportunity to recommend measures that can help maintain
the health of a patient who has no pressing health problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation racing full speed into managed health care,
preventive health measures will assume ever-greater importance.
Under managed care, you can expect a gradual rationing of costly
therapeutic techniques, especially for older people. Insurers in
the not-too-distant future may, for example, refuse to pay for
coronary bypass surgery in people over 75, costly organ transplants
and possibly even certain cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most men and a large percentage of women as well
may be forced to change their health-care ways. The first step will
be to convince men, intellectually and emotionally, of the value of
preventive health practices. The next step will be to overcome what
seems like a gender-specific resistance to paying attention to
health and acting promptly and appropriately at the first inkling
of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   There are many explanations for the fact that women on average
live about seven years longer than men do. Not the least of them is
that many men fail to take the necessary steps to prevent
life-threatening diseases and get treatment while they can still be
readily reversed or cured without budget-blowing therapies.
</P>
<P>
   For men, there is no health professional comparable to a woman's
gynecologist who sees them on a regular enough basis to head off
serious health problems. The survey showed that women well
outnumber men in recognizing the importance of practicing healthy
habits and in believing that such habits can protect their health.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, three-fifths of the men who responded to the survey
confessed to concern about developing heart disease and prostate
cancer. They also worry more than women about colon cancer, AIDS
and liver disease. The time is long overdue for men to act on these
concerns by periodically undergoing certain health checks.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended frequency of such checkups depends on your age,
family and personal medical history and whether you have any
health-threatening characteristics, like smoking or a significant
weight problem.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the Signals
</P>
<P>
   The body often gives warning signs that something is amiss.
Unfortunately, men tend to ignore noticeable signals, thinking they
will go away with rest or time or that it is more manly to suffer
in silence. Only when the signals progress into a health crisis
that can no longer be ignored are they likely to seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the body's signals are not readily apparent
unless checked. For example, without a medical examination, it is
impossible to know if you have high blood levels of artery-damaging
fats, high blood pressure or blood sugar or abnormal substances
spilling into your urine.
</P>
<P>
   Half the men surveyed said they had not been tested for high
cholesterol, a leading and reversible risk factor for heart
disease, and only one-third had had a blood lipid test for
cholesterol and other blood fats in the previous year.
Three-fourths of the men had not been checked for signs of colon
cancer, a leading killer of American men but one that is curable if
detected early. Likewise, among younger men who face the highest
risk of testicular cancer, only 12 percent of those 25 through 34
had been checked for this easily detected and highly curable
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A 32-page pamphlet called ``Men's Maintenance Manual'' developed
by Men's Health magazine in consultation with the American Academy
of Physicians describes the following symptoms as worth paying
attention to:
</P>
<P>
   HEADACHE that persists for more than three days, prevents you
from doing your normal activities or is accompanied by vision or
coordination problems, difficulty talking or thinking clearly,
weakness in an arm or leg, fever or vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   CHEST PAIN that is sudden and severe and lasts more than a few
minutes, gets worse with exertion, radiates to the jaw, neck or
arms or is accompanied by sensations of squeezing or pressure in
the chest and dizziness, fainting, sweating, nausea or shortness of
breath.
</P>
<P>
   SORE THROAT that is severe and gets progressively worse, making
it hard to breathe or swallow, especially if accompanied by swollen
glands or a temperature of 101 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ABDOMINAL PAIN that is sudden and severe, lasts more than four
days, is only temporarily relieved by eating or standing up or that
recurs with constipation or diarrhea and bloating.
</P>
<P>
   BACK PAIN lasting more than three days that radiates down the
leg or interferes with work and perhaps is accompanied by numbness,
tingling and muscle weakness.
</P>
<P>
   URINATION PROBLEMS, including the need to urinate frequently or
difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine.
</P>
<P>
   TESTICULAR ABNORMALITY, such as tenderness to the touch or
unusual hardness or unevenness.
</P>
<P>
   SKIN CHANGES, including any sore that fails to heal or a mole or
birthmark that bleeds, develops irregular borders or changes color,
size or texture.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The second-graders fidgeted in their small chairs
and whispered to one another. Many, unsure, glanced down at their
opened science texts and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Their teacher, Louise Cooper-Lovelace, asked the question again:
A fin moves in the ocean. Does it belong to a whale or shark?
</P>
<P>
   One youngster answers correctly. A whale's fin bobs up and down,
Cooper-Lovelace repeats. A shark's fin rocks eerily from side to
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you swim like a crazy person,'' she adds, rotating her
tanned arms through the air in front of her. Her young audience
giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper-Lovelace's students at Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth
have come to expect survival tips tucked inside science lessons.
That's because their teacher knows first-hand about enduring and
outwitting Mother Nature. She has faced wilderness's wrath and won,
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   When Cooper-Lovelace isn't teaching, calling her students
``sweetie'' and pecking their heads with kisses, she trains and
competes in one of the fastest-growing and arguably most grueling
sports in the world _ outdoor adventure racing.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors prepare year-round for the days-long, multisport
contest in the outdoors. Four- to five-person teams hike, bike,
climb, rappel, swim, kayak, whitewater raft, and ride horses and
sometimes camels, through the world's most awesome and treacherous
environments.
</P>
<P>
   And because it's a race, competitors move on little sleep, often
only a few hours a night. Fatigue is their constant nemesis.
Roughly half of a race's estimated 50 to 60 teams do not cross the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began competing four years ago, Cooper-Lovelace has
traversed the outback and crocodile-infested waters in Queensland,
Australia. She has trekked through Patagonia in South America and
Lesotho in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   She planned to compete in the Raid Gauloises (pronounced
gal-WAHZ) in Ecuador in September. But she recently was diagnosed
with breast cancer and will return to racing next year.
</P>
<P>
   Racers who invest hundreds of hours _ and dollars _ practicing
and traveling to far-flung race locales insist they're sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sure there are some people who think I'm crazy,''
Cooper-Lovelace said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper-Lovelace, 44, of West Hills pushed her body through 56
marathons and seven Hawaii Ironman Triathlons before growing bored.
That's when she spotted adventure racing on television, turned to
friends and declared, ``This is for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and other uber athletes genuinely grew weary of
marathons and triathlons during the 1980s and 1990s. Restless and
lonely from years of solo endeavors, they eyed the sports terrain
for a new contest that promised challenges and camaraderie. The
stage was set for the first adventure race in New Zealand in 1989
that launched a new gauntlet for athletes like Cooper-Lovelace.
</P>
<P>
   Racers say it's the teammates that makes finishing such races
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they would be focused on themselves. Be like, `Hey,
look at me. I'm so cool.' Instead, there's this sense that we're
all in this together and, boy, isn't this a great adventure,'' said
Martin Dugard of Orange County, who has completed several races and
wrote about it in ``Surviving the Toughest Race on Earth'' (Ragged
Mountain Press; $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the physical and mental hurdles, adventure racing offers
seemingly mild-mannered suburban moms, dads and professionals the
closest approximation to that elusive yet undeniable experience _
outdoor adventure. The sport is about emulating Lewis and Clark,
but on a clock.
</P>
<P>
   Racers with enough disposable income and time, compete for the
same reason Americans spent $190 million last year on exotic
vacations, estimates Mike Epstein of Agoura Hills, producer of the
Hi-Tec adventure racing series held in the fall at Castaic Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not doing it as much to win as to be Indiana Jones,''
said Mark Burnett, founder of the Discovery Channel Eco-Challenge,
who until recently lived in Topanga Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to dismiss adventure racing as another ``extreme
sport.'' But adventure racing isn't about quick adrenaline rushes,
nor does it imitate established endurance events. An adventure
race's pace and pivotal orienteering skills make it unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't go at an Ironman pace for nine days,'' said Kirk
Boylston, 40, of Calabasas. Trust him. He knows.
</P>
<P>
   One of Cooper-Lovelace's former teammates, Boylston also
competed in marathons and triathlons before embarking on adventure
racing four years ago. Even climbing Mount McKinley in Alaska in
1994 left the regional manager of a sports apparel company,
Gramicci in Oxnard, unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boylston had honed the various sports required in
adventure racing, he had to learn to sleep, pack and eat just
enough.
</P>
<P>
   This quest to move efficiently has prompted racers to hack off
toothbrush handles. Others carry and use one toothbrush for an
entire team.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure racing also demands dexterity in orienteering or
navigation, one of Boylston's strengths. He can study a sparse
topographical map, look up and locate similar-looking terrain. He's
vital to a team because a wrong move means lost time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's this crucial marriage of mind and muscle that explains why
somewhat scrawny-looking racers have passed up beefy Navy SEALs. If
any racers expertly balance braun and brains, it's the New
Zealanders, Boylston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans carry a fridge on their backs,'' said Nelly
Fusil-Martin, co-founder of the Raid Gauloises.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Fusil _ a French radio journalist and sportsman, and
Fusil-Martin's former husband _ conceived adventure racing a decade
ago. The Fusils eventually found a race sponsor, the French
cigarette maker Gauloises.
</P>
<P>
   The thick-accented Fusil-Martin spends her mornings organizing
races with colleagues in Paris via three telephone lines and a fax
machine inside her Beverly Hills home-office.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never has competed in a race, nor does she plan to,
Fusil-Martin fashioned many concepts that make a race covering 300
to 400 miles possible. Teams carry small booklets that must be
stamped at checkpoints to verify completion and prevent shortcuts.
Racers must provide certification of their sports abilities to help
weed out unqualified competitors and potentially disastrous
results. So far, no deaths have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure racing's collection of seasoned talent explains why
many racers are in their 30s and 40s. The sport does not cater to
sprightly, teen-age phenoms.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure racing is also an equal-opportunity sport. Rules
mandate co-ed teams. The usual group combination includes three or
four men and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   But Boylston will race with three women in the Eco-Challenge in
Morocco in October. While men in general may be able to move faster
and carry more, racers say women seem to better access their fat,
or energy, reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Science aside, male racers dominate the sport. And women like
Cooper-Lovelace are scarce. Men often court her, hoping she'll join
their all-male clubs.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the sport's growth lies in shorter, modified
adventure races.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein and Dugard want to make a modified version of the seven-
to 10-day race an Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
   In whatever form, Dugard said, adventure racing has a future
because expedition remains timeless.
</P>
<P>
   Dugard first tasted the exhausting expedition in 1993 when he
covered the Raid in Madagascar as a journalist. He watched as
French athletes, seeking a reprieve from racing, lit up cigarettes
and sipped red wine. The vast wilderness spread out before them as
they enjoyed their treats in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you're living life,'' Dugard thought to himself. ``I
wanted to be a part of that.''

HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When Amy Drummond was born seven years ago, Kathy
Drummond counted her newborn daughter's 10 fingers and 10 toes and
breathed a sigh of relief that she was beautiful and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The new mom wouldn't know for nine more months that her
seemingly perfect baby had been born with a potentially fatal
disease called retinoblastoma, a fast-growing eye cancer that
affects about 1 in 15,000 newborns each year.
</P>
<P>
   When Drummond, a Glendale resident, noticed that Amy's right eye
was ``slow'' and the pupil looked milky in low light, she took the
baby to her pediatrician. He shined a light in the infant's eyes
and pronounced her perfectly healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the doggedness of a mother convinced something was not
right, Drummond insisted on a more thorough examination. This time
the doctor sat Amy in a darkened room so her pupils would dilate,
then took another look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked inside her eye and saw the tumor,'' Drummond said.
``If I had trusted my doctor the first time, it would have been a
horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrible indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, about 8,000 children a year are diagnosed with
retinoblastoma in one or both eyes, said Dr. A. Linn Murphree,
director of the Ocular Oncology Service at both Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles and University of Southern California School of
Medicine, and one of about 20 eye surgeons worldwide who treat
children with this condition. About 7,000 of those diagnosed die by
age 2, most of them in Third World countries, where they are never
treated because of lack of medical facilities or money.
</P>
<P>
   But as serious as this cancer is, few people had ever heard of
it until two Los Angeles-area soap opera stars _ Hunter Tylo of
``The Bold and the Beautiful'' and Matthew Ashford, formerly of
``General Hospital'' _ announced recently that they had children
born with the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Tylo's daughter, 6-month-old Katya, has had her right eye
removed; chemotherapy continues to try to save her left eye, in
which five more tumors were found. Ashford's 1-year-old daughter,
Emma, is undergoing chemotherapy that has shrunk tumors in both her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Murphree, the only surgeon in the Southwest region of the United
States who treats large numbers of retinoblastoma patients, calls
the eye cancer an ``orphan disease'' because it is relatively rare
when compared to other childhood diseases, so few major hospitals
or universities have established centers to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor and some of his patients are trying to remedy
that with the proceeds from an Aug. 21 benefit that will honor TV
talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell for her work with children. The
money raised will go to expand an eye-cancer research center at
Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Murphree, who was recognized as the nation's top surgeon in 1997
by the American College of Surgeons, is also designing a system for
doctors around the world to share via the Internet information on
eye-cancer cases, including diagnosis and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He's also campaigning to persuade pediatricians nationwide to
include dilated-pupil examinations as part of newborn and well-baby
checkups; it's the only way to diagnose and treat retinoblastoma
while children's lives and sight can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Checking a baby's eyes is a simple, inexpensive procedure _ the
only cost is a $30 bottle of eye drops that should last a
pediatrician for a month and a half _ but many doctors are
erroneously convinced that it would be too complicated and
time-consuming to dilate the eyes of every baby they see at least
once, Murphree said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see why they feel that way when you realize that most
pediatricians will see a tumor like this only once in a 30-year
career,'' said Murphree.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphree and researchers at Childrens Hospital, who have
pioneered eye-cancer treatment for the past dozen years, see 300 to
400 young patients a year with retinoblastoma, a cancer that's
caused by a single missing gene on chromosome 13, one of the 23
pairs of chromosomes that make up the retina's 3 million cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens at the time of conception or maybe at the first
cell division after that,'' Murphree said. ``(Tumors) tend to arise
in cells that have not finished differentiating ... A child's
retinas aren't formed completely until he's about 2{. The eyes grow
and the retina grows. That means there is a window of risk until a
child is about 2{.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cases of retinoblastoma are hereditary; others occur
spontaneously, with no family history of the disease. Childrens
Hospital researchers, armed with $15 million in private grants,
have isolated and cloned the retinoblastoma gene. They're now
working on a way to replace the defective gene and on new
chemotherapy methods.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors look inside the eye of a child with retinoblastoma,
they see tumors that look like blobs of creamy white floating in
the eyeball's viscous interior. Of children diagnosed with
retinoblastoma, 60 percent have tumors in only one eye. Forty
percent have tumors in both eyes, and 25 percent of those children
lose both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In 7,000 of the 8,000 children worldwide diagnosed with the
disease every year, the cancer spreads outside the eye, affecting
the brain. Those are the children who die.
</P>
<P>
   Childrens Hospital doctors save more than 98 percent of the new
retinoblastoma patients they see each year by administering doses
of chemotherapy to shrink the tumors, then zapping the remaining
tumor with a laser beam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't always save the eye, but we usually save the
patient,'' Murphree said.
</P>
<P>
   For a parent, a diagnosis of retinoblastoma is a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of babies and cancer just doesn't mix,'' said
Ashford, whose daughter was diagnosed when she was just short of 4
months old. He and his wife, Christina, thought Emma had a lazy
eye; their pediatrician referred them to a pediatric
opthalmologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took one look and said, `She has tumors in her eyes. ...
They're malignant; they're always malignant'.''
</P>
<P>
   As devastated as the Ashfords were by the diagnosis, they were
thankful to have caught the disease early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, they don't get children (diagnosed) until
they're 13, 15, 18 months old ... and by the time they come in, the
tumors are just blossoming in their eyes. They have to take the
eyes out and try to save their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   After Emma had begun undergoing chemotherapy, Ashford was
looking through photos taken of the family for their 1997 Christmas
cards. And in Emma's eyes, he could see the telltale white pupils.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the scariest thing. You realize you're looking at
tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ashfords have joined with the Tylos and director Tim
Zinneman (``A Small Circle of Friends,'' 1980; ``Impulse,'' 1984)
and his wife, who also have a child who was born with
retinoblastoma, to organize the upcoming benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday when Emma grows up, we'll be able to tell her,
`Because you had this, many children will have sight and will
live','' Ashford said.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that their child's life will likely be spared, parents
heave a sigh of relief, Murphree said. But when they realize that
to save that life, one or both eyes must be removed, a new wave of
panic sets in: Their child will not only be blind, but will be
disfigured.
</P>
<P>
   Murphree explains to frightened parents that the interior of
their child's eye will be replaced by an inert plastic implant,
which will be sewn in place permanently and covered by a thick
contact lens-like prosthesis with the color of the pupil matched to
that in the remaining eye. The lens, he tells them, will be
replaced as the child grows.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult concept to grasp _ until parents meet with
second-grader Amy Drummond. She whips off her glasses and goes
nose-to-nose with kids and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let them look at my eyes and see what their child is going
to look like,'' Amy said. ``I've had lots of people look at my
eyes, and only one's been able to tell which one's mine and which
one's fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy was 21 months old when she lost her eye; her prosthetic lens
was handpainted to match her left eye, which is a brownish green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I forget about it and I feel like I have two eyes,''
said Amy, who attends ballet and gymnastics classes, swims and goes
bike riding just like any other little girl. The only problems she
experiences are a lack of depth perception (that's resulted in her
overshooting the glass when pouring milk) and lack of peripheral
vision on her right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been near-accidents on the playground because she
can't see people coming at her from that side,'' her mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Tyler Dumm of Carpinteria, who lost both eyes
to retinoblastoma when he was 2{ and his right leg from the knee
down to bone cancer when he was 10, also offers pep talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to see doesn't bother me a whole lot,'' said
Tyler, who _ with the help of his friends as guides and lookouts _
bodysurfs, boogie boards, skateboards, skis, rides horses, throws
the shot and the discus on the Carpinteria High School track team,
and plays trumpet and keyboard in a band. In his honors classes,
where he takes notes in Braille and on a special computer, a single
B-plus marred his record of all A's this year. His future includes
college, possibly with a career ahead as a musician. Or maybe a
marine biologist.
</P>
<P>
   Which just goes to show that as terrible as retinoblastoma is,
it's not the end of the world for a child, say Amy and Tyler's
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Dumm said when she learned her son would be blind, she was
worried _ until she went to the Institute for Blind Children at
Childrens Hospital, to meet other blind youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know what we were going to be faced with,'' she
said. ``The kids were happy; they were playing, and that made me
feel like I could handle it.''

THE BIG BAND BOOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A big-band album reminiscent of '40s jump blues
pioneers Cab Calloway and Louis Jordan in the top 30?
</P>
<P>
   It happened for guitarist-singer Brian Setzer, the ex-Stray Cat
whose 16-piece swing outfit is finally turning a profit after six
years slogging around the country in two tour buses flying the
Cocktail Nation flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dirty Boogie,'' featuring the single ``Jump Jive an'
Wail,'' the original 1958 version of which by Louis Prima currently
fuels a Gap commercial, has climbed to No. 26 on the national album
chart, just a few notches behind the Cherry Poppin' Daddies, whose
theme song ``Zoot Suit Riot'' is a staple at rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me I was crazy,'' Setzer said from his Santa
Monica home. ``Club owners, managers, business people, record
companies _ all of them. But the fans kept coming, and that's what
kept it alive all these years. And it just keeps growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer's orchestra, modeled on the big band sounds of Gene
Krupa, Bobby Darin and Count Basie, features five saxophones, four
trumpets, four trombones and a rhythm section backing the leader's
orange Eddie Cochran-style '59 Gretsch electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in '92, when we booked our first shows in Los Angeles, I
didn't sell any advance tickets, and the clubs wanted to cancel the
gigs,'' Setzer, 39, recalled. ``I told them, `No way. We'll play
even if I have to pay the band out of my own pocket.' But somehow
the shows sold out, and I was able to say, `See!' The band kept its
head above water, and we got bigger and bigger. I guess we did it
the old-fashioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra started at the Roxy, moved up to the House of
Blues and the Hollywood Palladium, and Saturday headlines the Greek
Theatre for the second summer in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we've been around six years, this is just the
beginning,'' Setzer said. ``This is brand new.''
</P>
<P>
   Other swing shows this week include Squirrel Nut Zippers tonight
at the Palace and Royal Crown Revue opening for the
Pretenders/B-52's bill at the Universal Amphitheatre tonight and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 cult film ``Swingers'' clearly set the stage for this
retro revival. Part of the comedy was set at such lounges as the
Derby in Los Feliz, long considered ground zero for the swing
revival.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the current popularity of the new big bands, some
predict the trend will be fairly transient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something people really like at the moment,'' said Howard
Krumholtz, music buyer for Tower in West Hollywood. ``The feeling I
have is once the market gets flooded with bands doing this stuff,
the sales will drop off. But the ones that were there first, the
ones that made the initial impression, like Setzer's band and Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy, will probably do well for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there's still a hint of the Stray Cat about the
Long Island-bred Setzer, who hasn't entirely turned his back on the
popular '80s rockabilly band he fronted. He still wears the
pompadour and even retools one of the trio's biggest hits, ``Rock
This Town,'' on the new album.
</P>
<P>
   ``That song has turned into a classic,'' Setzer explained. ``It
won't die, and I have to play it live. I figured since I'm gonna be
playing it for the rest of my life, I'd get the best arrangement I
could. It doesn't sound anything like the Stray Cats now. It's like
I'm showing what I can do with the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer fan Terri Lindau caught the orchestra at the Greek last
summer and calls it one of the most memorable shows she attended
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally exciting,'' said Lindau, 36, an administrative
assistant who lives a few blocks from the Greek. ``He's a fabulous
player, and the big band is just great. It was loads of fun. I hope
he's able to develop the sound so he's not doing the same show year
after year.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Setzer says he would love to record a soundtrack
next, possibly a remake of Duke Ellington's 1959 ``Anatomy of a
Murder'' score, or a '50s film noir-style crime drama.
</P>
<P>
   On the orchestra's third and current disc, ``The Dirty Boogie''
(Interscope), No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani duets with Setzer on the
Leiber and Stoller-penned ``You're the Boss,'' originally sung by
Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret for the ``Viva Las Vegas''
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans like to throw things away,'' Setzer said. ``That's
why all this American pop culture is thriving in Europe. They
embrace it, and we throw it away. I mean, why is a '57 Chevy worth
$40,000 today?''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer, who co-arranges material with trombonist Mark Jones,
said he constantly hears from fans who ask where this jump blues
sound comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hear it on the radio and ask, `What kind of music is
this'?'' says Setzer, who has two kids. ``The guy on the job hears
it and thinks it's great and goes out and buys it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the miles put on his silver tour buses, Setzer says
he still gets a kick out of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of a road dog,'' he said. ``I really live for
it. Especially with this band, because I can't tell you people's
reactions when they hear this music. They just don't have big bands
coming through their towns.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in
stamping out political activity than drug addiction. Very few
university students on the campus could get away with engaging in
political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with
taking drugs. We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on
the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes
nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous
essay?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can
escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by
taking drugs. That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the
United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially
dependent on the opium crop. Do you think crop substitution in the
areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way. But basically I think that in order
to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the
people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through
intimidation and repression. First we would like to talk to the
people concerned and discuss the problem with them. That is what
democracy is all about. You talk over your problems with the people
because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
</P>
<P>
   As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course
against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they
are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure
that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that
the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find
other ways of earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma. Reports
describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one
needle. Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans
for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's
partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack
problems at their source. They seem to think that if they insist
the problem does not exist, it will simply go away. The best way to
deal with AIDS is through education. So we need a really widespread
AIDS education program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _
political, economic and medical. AIDS education would be just one
part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in
our country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because
that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want. We all
want justice and human rights. Since what we want will benefit all
the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.

   Q: How much personal danger do you feel? Have you been

<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the
most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took
over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as
a primary threat. She heads the country's popular opposition
movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family
history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against
British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated that same year
at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2. Aung San remains a legend and a
national hero in Burma. There are statues of him, streets named for
him and museums of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill,
which the SLORC yanked from circulation. His portrait on this bill
greatly resembles his daughter. Pro-democracy protesters have
adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag
of freedom. It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to
all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the
beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for
democracy in 1988. This was soon after a bloody takeover by the
SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under
house arrest. The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi,
whose was placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in
1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual
transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the
basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full
and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give
speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering
questions the people submitted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the
imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old
newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and
listen to the lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995
has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest. The authorities have
arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from
meeting with journalists and diplomats. If they leave her house,
her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of
Burma's horrific prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under
house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of
the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade
and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power
peacefully. Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the
horizon. Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain
steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997,
shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her
automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters. A mob of
thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded
the vehicle and smashed the windshield. It was, the world press
noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing
to intervene.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a
serious threat to your security. What were your thoughts in that
moment when your car was being attacked?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: It was quite interesting. (She laughs.) I was fairly
detached. I saw it all as an observer. There were all these faces
crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an
iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big
gash in my windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were
simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to
support us. One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit
angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down
and telling him not to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt
to harm us badly or even kill us. It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious
than the safety and security of the people in general.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of
Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that
deal with Burma. Is this an effective means of supporting
democratization in Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Very much so. We would like to see more of this. It's
consumer power. It's good to know that the people of different
countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help
Burma. I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the
world on your side than the governments of the world, even if
governments can be more effective in certain directions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called
``Visit Myanmar Year.'' Are you still calling for tourists to
boycott Burma?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way. I still oppose
``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away. Burma is
not going to run away. They should come back to Burma at a time
when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where
there is rule of law. They'll have a much better time. And they can
travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of
heroin on college campuses. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in
stamping out political activity than drug addiction. Very few
university students on the campus could get away with engaging in
political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with
taking drugs. We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on
the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes
nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous
essay?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can
escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by
taking drugs. That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the
United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially
dependent on the opium crop. Do you think crop substitution in the
areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way. But basically I think that in order
to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the
people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through
intimidation and repression. First we would like to talk to the
people concerned and discuss the problem with them. That is what
democracy is all about. You talk over your problems with the people
because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
</P>
<P>
   As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course
against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they
are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure
that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that
the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find
other ways of earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma. Reports
describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one
needle. Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans
for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's
partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack
problems at their source. They seem to think that if they insist
the problem does not exist, it will simply go away. The best way to
deal with AIDS is through education. So we need a really widespread
AIDS education program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _
political, economic and medical. AIDS education would be just one
part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in
our country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because
that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want. We all
want justice and human rights. Since what we want will benefit all
the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much personal danger do you feel? Have you been
threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the
people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?
</P>
<P>
   SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course
the official papers are always talking about ``annihilating'' our
forces. (She laughs again.)
</P>
<P>
   But we don't think about that too much. There's no time to be
thinking about such things.

   CERRO PARANAL, Chile _ In the oven heat of day on the high
desert, cranes swing over the construction site, loaded trucks
groan up the winding road to the summit and workers in blue
hard-hats bend to their tasks around a gleaming machine anchored
inside one of the new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It is the tableau of a mountaintop being transformed by builders
in the tradition of the Inca at sacred Machu Picchu, but this time
the lofty temples will be put to the service of a modern
scientific: cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide building boom in powerful astronomical
observatories has now reached this 8,000-foot mountain in the
Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The Atacama is one of the driest
places in the world, a vast expanse of barren hills and ridges
baked to many shades of brown.
</P>
<P>
   The blue waters of the Pacific Ocean to the west and the
snow-capped Andes to the east, both visible from the heights, only
tease like mirages and bring no refreshment to the sere landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But above, and this is what matters, the air is thin and
virtually free of water vapor, offering ideally stable and
transparent seeing conditions for astronomy. Nearly every night is
full-starred. Beyond the ordinary range of the human eye, though
manifest in technology's clever magnifications, distant galaxies
hurtle outward in headlong flight, challenging the keepers of the
new temples to decipher their messages about the beginning,
evolution and future of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Here a consortium of European nations is constructing what is
being called ``a telescope for the 21st century.'' It is not one
instrument but actually a planned complex of four equally large
telescopes and three smaller ones. When all the pieces are in place
and running in concert, in another five or six years perhaps, the
prosaically named Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory will
be the world's largest and technologically most advanced optical
telescope array.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the four big telescopes at Paranal is complete and
has passed all of its early tests. The ceremonial moment of truth
known as ``first light'' came in late May. For the first time, the
telescope's huge 8.2-meter mirror, some 27 feet in diameter, was
focused on familiar celestial objects to check its light-gathering
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The successful test brought relief, elation and the tonic of
rising self-confidence to the engineers and scientists of the
European Southern Observatory, the eight-nation group building
Paranal. They were meeting construction schedules and performance
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than ever, their goal of creating a facility with
observing powers in visible and infrared light that equal or
surpass anything else in the world seemed attainable.
</P>
<P>
   Their pride overflowed: For the first time in a century, Europe
was stepping to the forefront of observational astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   One day a few weeks later, Krister Wirenstrand, a Swedish
engineer supervising the preparations, stood on a steel platform
surrounding the completed telescope.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of it as a big machine. The mirror was ringed and
supported by heavy metal, 400 tons of weight resting on bearings in
oil, and accompanied by a maze of hydraulic pipes and wires to
microsensors and computer-operated motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much farther along than we expected to be at this
time,'' he told a visitor. ``We have had first light. We have found
no serious flaws or problems. Of course, there's still much to do,
much tuning, but we feel good about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, as stiff winds chilled the summit, astronomers and
computer specialists hovered over consoles in the dimly lighted
control room. They put the telescope through its paces, sighting on
galactic targets, tracking their motions and photographing them in
sharp detail. These kinds of hardware and software tests are
expected to continue until next April, when the telescope should be
ready for regular research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roberto Gilmozzi, an Italian astronomer, remarked that he
was ``at the end of the food chain in the preparation of the
telescope.'' His job was to oversee tests of the instrument's
ability to make telling observations. To illustrate, he called up
some recent pictures on his console video.
</P>
<P>
   There was Omega Centauri, a cluster of especially old stars. A
long exposure demonstrated that the telescope was able to track
objects continuously with high precision. It also produced sharp
images of individual stars in the cluster, showing the near-perfect
quality of the aluminized glass mirror.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular picture of Eta Carinae, a superluminous eruptive
star more than one million times brighter than the Sun, revealed
fine details of structure that, European astronomers have said,
were never before achieved with any ground-based telescope.
</P>
<P>
   And the spectacular picture of the Butterfly Nebula, taken
through blue, green and red filters, was a sheer esthetic delight.
This was another demonstration of the telescope's ability to look
into dense clusters and observe individual stars. ``It was even
better than we expected,'' Gilmozzi said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Turning from the pictures, Gilmozzi gave voice to an emotion
shared by many of his colleagues. Like any other science, astronomy
can be fiercely competitive, and European astronomers have long
chafed at their disadvantage in not having ready access to the most
powerful telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, Europe has not been in the forefront of
astronomy,'' he said. ``The VLT puts Europe back in the running,
very close to the head of the pack in astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   European astronomy had been set back by two world wars and
unfavorable geography. Low, damp and crowded, the continent had no
remote, arid heights to compare with those in the American West and
Hawaii. For much of the century, the 100-inch telescope on Mount
Wilson near Los Angeles and then the 200-inch Hale Telescope on
Palomar Mountain near San Diego set the standard, and American
astronomers were favored in getting access to the observatories.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans were slow to look for their own sites far from
home. The British established a joint Anglo-Australian observatory
on that island continent and set up telescopes in the Canary
Islands. Eight other countries _ Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland _ formed the
European Southern Observatory, with headquarters near Munich but
nearly all of its telescopes here in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Most are concentrated at La Silla, about 400 miles north of the
capital, Santiago. Paranal is farther north, near the port city of
Antofagasta. The United States also operates several large
telescopes in Chile, making its high desert the primary platform
for viewing the once-neglected southern skies.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers in the United States agree that, when in full
operation, the Paranal instruments would in some respects be the
world's most powerful telescope array. But they emphasize that this
would not render others obsolete, especially not the Keck
Observatory. The two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, in Hawaii,
remain the largest individual instruments, each with 10-meter, or
33-foot, mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keck will remain more than completely competitive,'' said the
observatory's director, Dr. Frederic Chaffee.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, the greater light-gathering capability
of the larger individual Keck mirrors is likely to continue
affording the best views of especially faint phenomena like the
most distant objects in the universe, the focus of much research in
cosmology nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   But Riccardo Giacconi, director general of the European Southern
Observatory, said that, once all the Paranal telescopes are
operating, they should provide astronomers rare insights and
discoveries into three of the great questions of modern
astrophysics: the beginning and evolution of the universe; the
formation in the remote past of stars and galaxies and other cosmic
structure, and the formation and evolution of planets, especially
planetary systems around other stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most astronomers think that one advanced aspect of Paranal's
telescope array will produce many discoveries of more of these
extrasolar planets. One evening in Santiago, when asked what would
be some of Paranal's first important discoveries, Dr. Maria Teresa
Ruiz, an astronomer at the University of Chile, replied in one
word, ``Planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for extrasolar planets and the enigmatic brown
dwarfs, objects larger than planets but not big enough for stardom,
will begin in earnest when at least two of the four large
telescopes and two of the smaller ones are available for operation
as an interferometric array, by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   This technique effectively creates a poor man's supertelescope.
Each telescope in the array must be kept extremely stable, better
than a fraction of one wavelength of visible light over several
hundred yards. Each then focuses simultaneously on a single object,
with computers combining the incoming light into a composite image
equivalent to what could have been produced by a telescope much
larger than any of the individual ones used. The entire array of
telescopes could be integrated for interferometry by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Such a clever technique should enable astronomers to distinguish
in the glare of nearby stars the presence of companion planets that
might otherwise have gone undetected. They could be objects the
size of a Jupiter or much smaller, perhaps planets with 10 times
the mass of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The European scientists are not ruling out the direct detection
of infrared radiation originating from the planets themselves,
which would provide data on their chemical composition,
temperatures and surface structure. The few extrasolar planets
found in recent years have not been observed directly, only
inferred from their gravitational effects on their parent stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong push in Europe to find planets,'' Gilmozzi
said. ``A good fraction of time will be dedicated to the search,
especially after all four telescopes are ready with
interferometry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observatories, including Keck, have similar plans to put
interferometry into practice. Dr. Stephen P. Maran, an astronomer
and spokesman for the American Astronomical Society, said, ``That's
going to usher in a whole new era of astronomical observation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Keck and Paranal epitomize astronomy's building boom. At
the moment, new telescopes are being planned or constructed
elsewhere in Chile and in Arizona, Hawaii and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Spain recently announced plans for a 10-meter telescope in the
Canary Islands, to be ready for first light in 2002; it is designed
as a segmented mirror like the Kecks. South Africa is planning a
9.1-meter telescope, in a mosaic design comparable to the
Hobby-Eberly telescope recently completed at McDonald Observatory
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the new observatories would have been
inconceivable before new technology in telescope construction
emerged a decade ago. Previously, the upper limit in effective
mirror size seemed to be Palomar's 200-inch telescope; anything
larger proved to be too heavy, unwieldy and expensive. Russian
experiences with a larger mirror were not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Then engineers began experimenting with lightweight mirrors made
of honeycombed glass or segments of thin glass pieced together.
Each of the 10-meter Keck mirrors is composed of 36 hexagonal
segments fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle, a complicated design
that would have been unworkable before the evolution of precise
computer controls. Reacting to electronic sensors, the computers
issue hundreds of commands a minute to make continuous adjustments
of each segment to maintain the mirror's optimal shape and position
at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans have devised a way to apply similar control
technologies, called active optics, to the largest telescope
mirrors to be made from a single piece of glass. The only way this
could be feasible was to keep the 8.2-meter-diameter glass
unusually thin, only four inches.
</P>
<P>
   And the only way to keep such a thin mirror from flexing and
warping like a giant floppy disk was to equip the back of the
mirror with dozens of pistons for applying pressure here and there
continuously to adjust the mirror shape.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the active-optics system depends on a high-speed
analysis of the mirror's image quality. Any deviations, the result
of slight changes in the telescope alignment, are registered, and
signals are instantly sent to make the required adjustments. The
Europeans first tested the system on its 3.5-meter New Technology
Telescope at La Silla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a mirror this big and this thin has
been produced,'' Gilmozzi said. ``Going from 3.5 meters to 8 meters
is a big jump, and this requires a good deal of testing of the
active optics. It works, but it still needs a lot of tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more advanced controls, called adaptive optics, are being
developed to compensate for atmospheric turbulence in telescope
images. With corrective signals sent as often as 100 times a
second, European astronomers said, adaptive optics applied to the
Very Large Telescope should produce images at least 10 times
sharper than the actual seeing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering more light, refining it to a sharpness unseen before,
probing the dusty heart of distant galaxies and stellar nurseries,
telescopes like those rising here on the high desert of Chile are
sending the same rush of excitement through astronomy as the
opening of the first Keck telescope did eight years ago, but no one
dares to predict how the view from Paranal will change thinking
about the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to predict what's going to be discovered,''
Chaffee of the Keck Observatory said. ``No one predicted that Mount
Wilson would find the expanding universe or Palomar would see
quasars.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June, a month after first light, the Very Large
Telescope gave astronomers a surprise, if not a discovery. A color
photograph of a galaxy 165 million light-years away in the southern
constellation of Centaurus revealed its strange crosslike
configuration, as if two galaxies had intersected.
</P>
<P>
   In the strange motions of stars, gas and dust, astronomers said
they could be seeing evidence of dark matter, the invisible stuff
that presumably makes up most of the universe and is one mystery
waiting for some telescope to solve, perhaps looking into the
full-starred night in the Atacama.

<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-AIRCON (Rome) _ While America has embraced
air-conditioning, Europe has traditionally just taken summer
afternoons off. Stores in Italy closed for the noontime heat, and
Spaniards took siestas. In the evening, Europe sat outside in the
piazza. In the hottest weeks, the Continent simply shut down. But
the piazza has become polluted by exhaust fumes, and the pressures
of a global economy are increasingly forcing Europeans to work
summers. So people are starting to demand air-conditioning.
Environmentalists are not amused, but there is an effort to make
air-conditioners kinder to the planet. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   ALBERTSON-AMERICAN (Undated) _ Albertson's Inc., the nation's
fifth-largest supermarket chain, will buy American Stores for $8.3
billion in stock and will also assume $3.4 billion in debt. The
deal will create the largest chain of supermarkets and drugstores,

based in Boise, Idaho, in California and the Southwest. By Dana
Canedy.
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ The Hang Seng index plunged 4.8
percent as hard evidence emerged of a downtown in the Hong Kong
economy. The market reacted with concern to a report by HSBC
Holdings, Britain's largest bank, that its drop in first-half
profits was worse than expected and that it had taken a charge for
bad loans that was more than four times the charge of a year
earlier. In addition, the government said the economy shrank 2.8
percent in the first quarter, an even worse decline than the 2
percent reported earlier. By Mark Landler.

<P>
   GM-BOARD (Undated) _ Developments as General Motors' board of

of Japan's currency. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-TELECOM (Madrid) _ When the Spanish telephone company
Telefonica came away with the largest single piece of Brazil's
telecommunciations privatization auction last week, the Spanish
carrier instantly doubled its holdings to more than $10 billion in
Latin America, where it was already the dominant ``foreign'' phone
provider.
</P>

industrial average was down 53 points at 1:15 p.m. By Sharon R.

   &UR; SCIENCE and HEALTH &LR;  (``a'' or ``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILE-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ In the oven heat of day on the
high desert, cranes swing over the construction site, loaded trucks
groan up the winding road to the summit and workers in blue
hard-hats bend to their tasks around a gleaming machine anchored
inside one of the new buildings. It is the tableau of a mountaintop
being transformed by builders in the tradition of the Inca at
sacred Machu Picchu, but this time the lofty temples will be put to
the service of a modern scientific: cosmology. The worldwide
building boom in powerful astronomical observatories has now
reached this 8,000-foot mountain in the Atacama Desert of northern
Chile. By John Noble Wilford. (2500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOTHER-CHILD (Undated) _ Challenging a popular belief about
human development, a researcher claims to have found that the
security of a baby's attachment to its mother does not influence
how well adjusted that child will be later in life. Events like
divorce, disease and accidents are far more important in shaping a
child's well-being at age 18 than early bonding with its mother. By
Sandra Blakeslee. (1650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATH-FRAUD (Undated) _ Dr. Theodore P. Hill asks his
mathematics students at Georgia Tech to go home and either flip a
coin 200 times and record the results, or merely pretend to flip a
coin and fake 200 results. The following day he runs his eye over
the homework data, and to the students' amazement, he easily
fingers nearly all those who faked their tosses. There is more to
this than a classroom trick. Hill is one of a growing number of
statisticians, accountants and mathematicians who are convinced
that an astonishing mathematical theorem known as Benford's Law is
a powerful and relatively simple tool for pointing suspicion at
frauds, embezzlers, tax evaders, sloppy accountants and even
computer bugs. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Undated) _ When it first made headlines about
a decade ago, gene therapy seemed the answer to a prayer for
thousands of people with hereditary diseases. The idea is simple
and eloquent. Many inherited diseases are caused by a faulty gene,
which makes the body unable to produce some essential protein or
enzyme. Gene therapy would deliver the needed gene to a person's
cells, which would then begin producing the essential substance.
But gene therapy so far has not worked, mainly because it has been
difficult to get the genes to the desired cells efficiently and
have them produce enough of the needed protein. By Andrew Pollack.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-BOTANY-RAVEN (St. Louis) _ A new $146 million plant research
center in St. Louis promises to make the city an agricultural
Silicon Valley, proponents say. And the man largely behind the
city's prominence and the new center is Dr. Peter Raven, for 27
years the director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and one of the
nation's foremost botanists. But says his strength is in
biopoliticking, or networking to make things happen in the plant
world. By Nancy Beth Jackson. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-BURN-MASK (Undated) _ In an Ohio hospital, a group of
engineers, doctors and physical therapists are experimenting with
technology from the movie industry to produce a facial mask that
they hope will help speed the recovery of the 20,000 American
suffering serious burns each year. By Jane Ellen Stevens. (1350
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Twenty-three software makers
responded last week to the issue of a consumer's control over his
own computer and declared ``don't ask, don't tell'' an unacceptable
competitive practice. The policy statement represents an effort to
correct years of abusive practices with a new industry standard
known as ``Ask, Tell &AMP; Help.'' By Rob Fixmer.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions: The moon and its
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: The human line has
emerged from Africa not once but twice. That is the ingenious and
far-reaching surmise proposed in the latest issue of Current
Biology.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-HEALTH (Undated) _ There is a brand new recipe for a
healthy life. The basic ingredients are a low-fat diet, regular
exercise _ and marriage. Countering conventional wisdom that
marriage is bad for women but good for men, a University of Chicago
researcher said she has found that marriage brings considerable
benefits to both women and men. It lengthens life, substantially
boosts physical and emotional health, and raises income over that
enjoyed by single or divorced people or those who live together,
she said. By Hara Estroff Marano. (1450 words.)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: A new
survey conducted has found that American men are again lagging
behind women in their concern for health. The survey revealed that
while 76 percent of women had had a physical checkup within the
previous year, only 60 percent of men had done the same. And only
one-fourth of the men surveyed said they were interested in
improving their health and fitness. By Jane E. Brody. (1230 words)

prominent Jewish art dealer who fled Paris for the United States
during World War II, filed suit in federal court against the
Seattle Art Museum to recover a Matisse painting that was
confiscated by the Nazis in 1941. The litigation, the first against
an American museum for art stolen by the Nazis from a Jewish
family, provides an inkling of how complicated it may be to unravel

THE SUMMER OF THIS CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 9.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In olden times, I used to file  &UR; copy &LR; . A stack of cheap beige
 &UR; copy paper &LR;  was on my desk for this purpose, and to crumple up
satisfyingly when I rejected my own lede, or to make paper planes
out of when the muse was absent. This was when  &UR; copy boy &LR;  was a
coveted job for a kid and not a managerial slur. I used to get into
arguments with the  &UR; copy editor &LR; . (``I don't care if Shakespeare
wrote  &UR; paint the lily &LR; , people say  &UR; gild the lily &LR; .'')
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a movement among upscale copy editors to call
themselves  &UR; language therapists &LR; . Copy paper went out with carbon
copies, and former copy-paper crumplers now float painfully though
the carpal tunnel of love. And I no longer file copy, or even
transmit data; ever at the cutting edge of the pointiest cusp, I
 &UR; provide content &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   If any word in the English language is hot, buzzworthy and
finger-snappingly with-it, surpassing even  &UR; millennium &LR;  in both
general discourse and insiderese, that word is  &UR; content &LR; . Get used
to it, because we won't soon get over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accent is on  &UR; content &LR; '' is an advertising theme that
Conde Nast publications has been running for the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   When Tina Brown, empress of buzz, left Conde Nast's New Yorker
for a Disney affiliate to create a magazine that _ living in
synergy _ would provide nonfiction material to become the basis of
movies, she summed up her future with: ``It's all about
 &UR; content &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This caused Maureen Dowd, the trend-sensitive Times Op-Ed
columnist, to ask: ``And what in heaven's name is  &UR; content &LR; ? Isn't
it just a pretentious word for substance, which was, anyway, a
pretentious word for ideas? Can  &UR; content &LR;  be synergized the way
milk is homogenized?''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks before, a magazine about the media named
Brill's Content burst upon the scene. ``Steve Brill came up with
the idea of  &UR; content &LR; ,'' says Bill Kovach, its external ombudsman
and my former Times colleague, ``to give the reader the
understanding that the purpose of the magazine was to review the
content of the writing of nonfiction journalism.'' To avoid
litigation with another publisher threatening to seek an injunction
to protect a trademark claim to  &UR; Content &LR; , the proper name was
added.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Noon, who made the earlier claim (his Content World
Publishing applied for the single-word trademark in 1991), says
``we named the magazine Content because it was going to be geared
toward people in the content industry. It covers how different
types of content can make it into digital media.'' (If you're
planning a publication about questions, be careful _ he has
trademarked Query.) Another magazine, published in London, Ontario,
that describes itself as ``paving the way to the information
superhighway,'' is titled Content London and has been in business
since 1996, the same year Canadian Content, a review of software
for educators, was born.
</P>
<P>
   As used narrowly in the computer world,  &UR; content &LR;  means ``the
information on a Web site''; more broadly, it means ``software
rather than hardware'' or ``data or other material to be provided
by online services.'' The phrase  &UR; online service provider &LR;  (OSP) _
used to describe such firms as America Online, Fujitsu Niftyserve,
or Compuserve _ led to the term  &UR; content provider &LR;  (which is not
shorthanded as CP, because some of us remember the Communist
Party). ``A service provider _ Earthlink, Prodigy, AT&AMP;T _ gives you
access, like a pipeline to a destination,'' says Paul Lewis, an
online advertising pioneer. ``A  &UR; content provider &LR;  is the outfit
that offers the stuff you want at the destination.''
</P>
<P>
   First use I can find is in the June 1, 1991, Byte, a McGraw-Hill
print publication: ``Compression will be handled primarily by the
 &UR; content provider &LR; .'' The phrase still requires explanation to the
Great Unwashed: reporting in The San Francisco Chronicle about a
Ziff-Davis venture, Jerry Carroll wrote: ``ZDTV will create 300 new
` &UR; content provider &LR; ' jobs. In case you're wondering what they are,
look no further. I'm a  &UR; provider &LR;  and what you're reading is
 &UR; content &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, president of electronic media at The New York
Times, recalls the predecessor phrase,  &UR; information provider &LR; , in
the days of videotext in the early '80s. `` &UR; Information provider &LR; 
morphed into  &UR; content provider &LR; ,'' he says, ``in the mid-'80s, when
it became necessary to include entertainment.'' (Martin uses verbs
like  &UR; morphed &LR; , zipping past the New Age types still mired in
 &UR; evolved &LR; .) The  &UR; content absorber &LR;  (that's you, formerly Dear
Reader) is undoubtedly experiencing the rush of insight made
possible by the prism of lexicography. When  &UR; information &LR;  _ the
name of the highway, the society, even the era _ needed a broader
term to encompass or subsume entertainment, the carapace of
 &UR; content &LR;  emerged.
</P>
<P>
   And as the profit-making  &UR; synergy &LR;  _ that combination of fact
and fiction in which the entertaining whole is hoped to be greater
than the informative parts _ attacks the world of journalism, it
has found its identity in the word  &UR; content &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the old, narrow, truth-rutted information
superhighway has morphed into nothing but a country lane, a
tributary of the ever-widening channel of Original Synergy.
</P>
<P>
   Access  &UR; content &LR;  before its stuff accesses you. But beware: this
is no vogue word or Conde Nast usage. The darkly sweeping reach of
 &UR; content &LR;  marks this coinage as a true millennialism. When every
story is partly true, who can then be false to any man?

   EUROPE-AIRCON (Rome) _ While America has embraced
air-conditioning, Europe has traditionally just taken summer
afternoons off. Stores in Italy closed for the noontime heat, and
Spaniards took siestas. In the evening, Europe sat outside in the
piazza. In the hottest weeks, the Continent simply shut down. But
the piazza has become polluted by exhaust fumes, and the pressures
of a global economy are increasingly forcing Europeans to work
summers. So people are starting to demand air-conditioning.
Environmentalists are not amused, but there is an effort to make
air-conditioners kinder to the planet. By John Tagliabue.

REEVALUATING SIGNIFICANCE OF BABY'S BOND WITH MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Challenging a popular belief about human development, a
researcher claims to have found that the security of a baby's
attachment to its mother does not influence how well-adjusted that
child will be later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Events like divorce, disease and accidents are far more
important in shaping a child's well-being at age 18 than any early
bonding with its mother, said the researcher, Dr. Michael Lewis, a
professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and director of the Institute
for the Study of Child Development at the Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The study is one of a number of research projects on attachment,
a field that is gaining attention as experts debate what happens to
infants and children when both mother and father work outside the
home.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis based his conclusion on a study of 84 children who were
examined at age 1 in terms of maternal attachment _ a popular
measure of social adjustment and mental health _ and again at age
18 in terms of adult attachment to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Secure attachment in infancy did not protect children from being
maladjusted at age 18, Lewis said, nor did insecure attachment in
infancy predict trouble during adolescence. He reported his
findings at a recent meeting of the International Society on Infant
Studies in Atlanta and in a book ``Altering Fate _ Why the Past
Does Not Predict the Future,'' published last year by the Guilford
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding attacks the gold standard for understanding how
babies and children develop: the so-called infant maternal
attachment measure, which infers well-being from the reactions of
babies who are temporarily separated then reunited with their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   According to many experts in child development, how the baby
reacts to the mother's return each time is critically important. In
general, if the baby cries, goes to the mother and is comforted,
the child is securely attached. If the baby ignores the mother and
is ambivalent to her return or if the baby cries but refuses to be
consoled, the baby is insecurely attached.
</P>
<P>
   To the adherents of attachment theory, this little mini-drama
speaks volumes about the child's psychological health and
profoundly influences that child's developmental course.
</P>
<P>
   Attachment theory is an offshoot of psychoanalysis and carries
many of Sigmund Freud's ideas into modern practice, said Dr. Robert
Cairns, director of the Center for Developmental Science at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. It argues that early
mother-infant relationships create ``internal representations'' in
the baby's brain and that these shadows lay the foundation for
psychological well-being and human personality throughout life.
</P>
<P>
   The mother is the critical figure. Early events are more primary
than later events. Given these beliefs, the challenge became how to
measure these ``internal representations'' in babies who cannot
talk, Cairns said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that behavior might imply something important about a
baby's mind, researchers in the early 1970s devised a test called
the Strange Situation. The test has many permutations but basically
a mother and her 12-month-old baby enter a room in which they meet
a stranger and find many interesting toys. After a few minutes, the
mother leaves and the stranger plays with the baby.
</P>
<P>
   After two minutes, the mother returns and the baby's behavior is
observed. A little later, the mother leaves the child alone in the
room again, waits two minutes and comes back in. Again the baby's
reaction is closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The original goal was to find a measure that would, in five
minutes, identify the structure of the course of human personality
development, he said. The infant's external behavior is said to
capture his or her internal model of the attachment relationship,
Lewis said, ``even though neglected and abused children often show
secure attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the nature of this early attachment emerges later in
life, especially during stressful times. A good attachment will
protect you while a poor attachment will make you more vulnerable,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This view now dominates infant and child psychiatry. The
cardinal rule is that the mother-child relationship is vital for
early life and determines subsequent social adjustment. Psychiatric
literature on adolescence treats attachment as a stable individual
characteristic, like brown eyes. Some theorists claim that adults
choose mates based on infant attachment status; insecurely attached
individuals will seek securely attached people to balance out their
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But life is not so simple, Lewis said. What happens to infants
is important but the notion that our early reactions are frozen
into the brain, unmalleable by later experience, is open to
question. To see if early attachment correlates with later
adjustment, Lewis found 84 children who had been evaluated at age 1
_ 49 securely attached, 35 insecurely attached _ and who were now
seniors in high school.

SPENDING ON GOVERNOR'S RACE MAY TO PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With newly released records showing that the
California gubernatorial primary cost an unprecedented $72 million,
political experts predict the general election in November might
look cheap in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate for
governor, and Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate, could
make the final stretch a nickel-and-dime fund-raising affair in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The two longtime politicians going after contributors, including
wealthy lawyers and owners of McDonald's fast-food franchises. But
in contrast to the largely self-funded primary campaigns of
Democrats Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman, Lungren and Davis are
raising money $1,000 at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign analysts believe the general election race between
Davis and Lungren might cost $40 million to $50 million. It could
easily beat the $40 million general election record set by
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson and challenger Kathleen Brown in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say it will never match June's election, in which
Checchi spent $39 million of his own money and Harman used $13
million of her own cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as the primary,'' said
Garry South, campaign manager for Davis, who said the campaign
plans to raise up to $20 million for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to raise as much money as possible. You have
to reach a certain threshold or else you're in serious trouble,''
South said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance filings sent to the secretary of state on
Friday show that both Lungren and Davis come into the race with
relatively meager war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who had to struggle to beat his two wealthy Democratic
challengers in the primary, came out with an unexpected
fund-raising edge over Lungren, who faced only token opposition in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   For the six-week period between May 17 and June 30, Davis
reported raising $113,500 per day to end up with $4.5 million in
cash on hand. Lungren raised money at only about half that pace,
collecting $55,813 per day, giving him $3.3 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three million dollars isn't exactly chopped liver,'' Southern
California political scientist Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said. ``But I
imagine Lungren would have liked to come out of the primary with at
least as much as Davis had.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably both be raising a lot of money. Davis has a
reputation as being one of the most prodigious fund-raisers in the
state. And I've heard Lungren has inherited a golden fund-raising
list from Pete Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the huge chunks of money that poured into the
primary, fund-raising for the general election is slow going.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day during the May fund-raising rush, Lungren
reported collecting eight $1,000 contributions from owners of
McDonald's restaurants up and down the state. At the same time,
Davis rounded up a $1,500 donation from a union for cement masons
and $2,500 from the International Association of Plumbing &AMP;
Mechanical Officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of the candidates is independently wealthy,'' said
Dave Puglia, campaign manager for Lungren. ``Both of them have to
go to donors and raise money the old-fashioned way. The real
contest is going to be who gets the most votes, not the most money.
I think it's going to be a very tight race.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' edge in the early financial reports comes as a surprise
to some experts, who expected Lungren to emerge from the primary
with a large pot of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lungren had only token opposition in the primary,
political scientists say California's first open primary _ in which
voters could cast ballots for any candidate, rather than being
restricted to voting within their declared party _ might have hurt
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Republicans could switch sides to vote in the
highly competitive race for the Democratic nomination meant that
Lungren had to spend money on advertising to avoid the potentially
damaging embarrassment of getting a low number of votes. By June
30, he had spent $7.9 million, while Davis spent a little more than
$9 million to win the three-way Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Davis captured 35 percent of the total vote, while
Lungren came with 34 percent. Thirteen percent went to Checchi and
12 percent to Harman.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategist Steve Merksamer dismissed the primary
results and early fund-raising reports as virtually irrelevant to
what will happen in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats were energized because they had a contest in the
primary,'' he said. ``The Republicans were not energized. But
they're getting energized now. The fact of the matter is they're
both going to have enough money to get their message out. Money
alone will not determine this election. If money were the only
factor, Al Checchi would be governor.''

 UNDATED: high school.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each person was interviewed for an hour at home to measure adult
attachment. Among other things, the teen-agers were asked to
describe early relationships with their parents, to generate
adjectives for each parent and provide memories to support the
adjectives.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews were scored by trained observers who examined how
specific memories were integrated into a general understanding of
the parent-child relationship. A teen-ager was deemed securely
attached if he presented a coherent story about his relationship
with his parents. A teen-ager was considered insecurely attached if
that story was fragmented, ambivalent or incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   Among securely attached infants, 57 percent were considered
well-adjusted at age 18 and 43 percent were found to be
maladjusted, Lewis said. Among insecure infants, 74 percent were
considered secure at age 18 and 26 percent were believed to have
remained insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis asserts that the critical factor in human development is
not security of attachment at age 1 but subsequent experiences in
family life. There are many critical periods in every child's life.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce played a primary role in their adjustment and ``to
understand a child's emotional and social development, you have to
look at his current life,'' he said. He added: ``We don't so much
remember the past as we reconstruct it in the light of present
events. Accidents and chance encounters are a major part of life.
The task is always adaptation to the present.''
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of attachment theory, however, are not ready to
give up on a method that in their view works. For example, Dr. Alan
Sroufe, a leading attachment expert at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis, conducted a long-term study several years ago and
found that, in his sample, infant attachment can predict
psychopathology at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with Mike Lewis,'' Sroufe said. ``His study is
weaker than ours and he used fewer children. I'm not surprised he
didn't find correlations. I also disagree with him on logical
grounds. Your behavior is always a product of your history and your
present circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that theme, Dr. Jay Belsky, a professor of human
development at Pennsylvania State University in University Park and
another well-known proponent of attachment theory, argues that
infant day care can disrupt attachment and may harm children in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand the present, you have to understand what the
child brings to the circumstances,'' Belsky said. ``Of course it
matters how development proceeds, but what happens early in life
makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over how much of a difference. Critics of
attachment theory, including Lewis, say that most researchers place
far too much importance on what happens in the first year or two of
life. Some proponents of the theory even argue that critical
mother-infant bonding begins at birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I visited a program in Philadelphia to foster the
social and emotional development of children of teen-aged
inner-city mothers,'' Lewis said. ``The program consisted of
placing the naked newborn child on the naked belly of the mother,
as if early bonding would somehow inoculate the child against all
future problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irving Lazar, a professor emeritus of child development at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, is even more critical of
attachment theorists. ``Of course babies need good mothers,'' he
said. ``It's important to feel loved and secure. But the so-called
attachment measure is ludicrous. The one-time observation of a
baby's reaction to its mother's return has no meaningful
consequences.'' All it does is make mothers feel guilty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns said that animal studies mostly supported Lewis. Studies
of other mammals separated from their mothers, including the monkey
experiments of Dr. Harry Harlow in which babies were raised without
mothers, show no permanent damage to the deprived animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow's monkeys treated their first-born babies ``like
basketballs'' and that is what got reported, Cairns said, but
babies born later to those same mothers were well-cared for. The
mothers adapted.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, people on both sides of the debate will say ``of
course both past and present are important,'' Cairns said, ``but
they really don't mean it.'' Many have entrenched ideological
positions which, if confined to an ivory tower, might be amusing.
These arguments, though, have important policy consequences for
American society, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the first year of life is all-important, then why bother
investing huge sums in later intervention programs? But if the
first year of life is not that important, and it is the quality of
your whole childhood that matters, how could we possibly change
things?

THE BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE: HEALTH, HAPPINESS _ AND MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By HARA ESTROFF MARANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a brand new recipe for a healthy life. The basic
ingredients are a low-fat diet, regular exercise _ and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Countering conventional wisdom that marriage is bad for women
but good for men, a University of Chicago researcher said she has
found that marriage brings considerable benefits to both women and
men. It lengthens life, substantially boosts physical and emotional
health, and raises income over that enjoyed by single or divorced
people or those who live together, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. Linda Waite, a professor of sociology,
presented her findings in July at the second annual Smart Marriages
Conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a public health issue,'' Dr. Waite said.
``People need to know the facts so they can make good decisions.
Marriage is good for everyone. But I'm battling a deeply
entrenched, if dangerous and false, belief.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that marriage damages women's emotional well-being
derives from the 1972 publication of ``The Future of Marriage''
(Yale) by the sociologist Jessie Bernard, who died in 1996 at the
age of 93. In it, she reported that married men are better off than
single men on four measures of psychological distress _ depression,
neurotic symptoms, phobic tendency and passivity. But married
women, she said, score higher on these negative traits than single
women.
</P>
<P>
   Although the findings were never replicated and were disputed
even then, they entered the lore of the field and of the culture at
large. ``They helped de-romanticize marriage'' at a time when that
was needed, said Dr. William Doherty, a professor of psychology at
the University of Minnesota. ``They matched the then-evolving
belief that marriage is an oppressive institution for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, researchers have come up with better measures
of emotional health, and on these, married women and men generally
score very well. Further, in the last two years several large
studies that tracked people in and out of relationships over a long
period have produced evidence that marriage actually causes
psychological well-being in both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dr. Bernard's material consisted of one-time
glimpses of people's lives. While both Dr. Bernard and Dr. Waite
based their conclusions on data from many studies, reducing the
likelihood that either was reporting a fluke, marriage itself has
changed in the intervening years in ways that generally make women
happier.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Waite told the conference that her curiosity was aroused
four years ago when she stumbled across ``the marriage mortality
benefit'' _ statistics showing that married men and women live
longer.
</P>
<P>
   In a large national sample of adults followed for 18 years
beginning at the age of 48, slightly more than 60 percent of
divorced and never-married women made it to 65, as opposed to
nearly 90 percent of married women. Widowed women, for reasons not
entirely clear, fared almost as well as married women. Among men,
however, those unmarried for any reason _ whether widowed, divorced
or never married _ had only a 60 to 70 percent chance of living to
65, versus 90 percent for married men.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dr. Waite has found that ``marriage changes people's
behavior in ways that make them better off.'' Married partners
monitor each other's health, for example. They also drink less
alcohol and use less marijuana and cocaine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From detailed reports on 50,000 men and women followed from
their senior year in high school to the age of 32 by University of
Michigan researchers, Dr. Waite discerned a steep increase in ``bad
behaviors'' among those who stayed single, but a ``precipitous
drop'' in bad behaviors like the use of alcohol or illegal drugs
among those who married.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing heavily on a study of 13,000 adults assessed in 1987 and
1988 and again in 1992 and 1993, Dr. Waite demonstrated the
positive impact that marriage has on mental health. The study,
conducted by two psychologists at the University of Wisconsin,
Nadine Marks and James Lambert, will be published in November in
the Journal of Family Issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that people who remained married reported
significantly higher levels of happiness than those who remained
single. The data showed that those who separated or divorced over
the five-year period became, in Dr. Waite's word, miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Men and especially women who married for the first time during
the course of the study experienced a sharp increase in happiness.
Remarriage, however, brought only a modest increase in happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Waite noted that Dr. Bernard similarly found married women
happier than single women, but relegated that fact to her book's
appendix.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, marriage appeared to reduce the degree of
depression. Men and especially women whose marriages ended over the
five-year period experienced high levels of depression compared
with those who stayed married. Single men as a group were depressed
at the outset of the study and became more depressed if they stayed
single.
</P>
<P>
   Compelling as he found these data, Doherty, the University of
Minnesota professor, noted that they represent population-based
averages. They do not mean that everyone is better off married than
single, or that people are bound to be happy and healthy if they
marry the wrong person.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shirley Glass, a clinical psychologist from Baltimore who is
recognized for her research on infidelity, echoed those caveats.
There are probably subgroups of women who are happy and some who
are depressed. One reason women are generally happier today is that
they are working more like men, she said. In addition, they are
reaping more satisfaction from roles other than wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional health also hinges on satisfaction with sex, and in
this realm marriage serves both men and women, but delivers a
special bonus to women. First of all, Dr. Waite said, married
people have sex twice as often as single people. Unmarried couples
who live together also have an active sex lives but, like unmarried
people, get less emotional satisfaction from it than married
people, the studies found.
</P>
<P>
   For married men, satisfaction hinges on sexual frequency,
fidelity and emotional commitment to the relationship. For women,
these elements are equally important, but just the fact of being
married added an extra kick to their sexual satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men make an investment in pleasing their partner because of
their ongoing relationship,'' Dr. Waite said. ``People who are
committed to a partner get more than sex out of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Married people also have more money. From her own analysis of a
National Institute of Aging survey of 12,000 people 51 to 61 years
of age, Dr. Waite found that married people have more than twice as
much money, on average, as unmarried people. Married couples not
only save more while enjoying some economies of scale, but married
men also earn up to 26 percent more than single men.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, married women earn more than unmarried women, but
only if they have no children. When they have children, ``they
trade some time earning for time with their children,'' Dr. Waite
said. If the women continue to work, she added, they have
difficulty getting child care, and experience stress trying to
balance two sets of demands.
</P>
<P>
   Married women are not only happier and wealthier than single
women, Dr. Waite found, they are also safer. Moderate domestic
violence (defined as as hitting, shoving or throwing things at a
partner) occurred half as often with married couples and cohabiting
couples engaged to marry than it did with cohabiting couples not
planning to marry.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that there is more to marriage than just a
social bond. There appears to be something specifically protective
about the long-term commitment that marriage entails.
</P>
<P>
   Committed gay couples are likely to enjoy many of the same
benefits, Dr. Waite said, as long as they promise to stay together
and receive social support from others for staying together.
</P>
<P>
   All told, marriage seems to be ``an unmitigated good'' for men,
Dr. Waite added. For women, marriage indeed brings increased life
satisfaction and happiness, but those benefits are ``part of a
package'' that also includes family demands that are sometimes
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, she suggested, this was what Jessie Bernard really
meant.

   ``The truth is,'' he said in an interview, ``most people don't
know the real odds of such an exercise, so they can't fake data
convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more to this than a classroom trick.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is one of a growing number of statisticians, accountants
and mathematicians who are convinced that an astonishing
mathematical theorem known as Benford's Law is a powerful and
relatively simple tool for pointing suspicion at frauds,
embezzlers, tax evaders, sloppy accountants and even computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The income tax agencies of several nations and several states,
including California, are using detection software based on
Benford's Law, as are a score of large companies and accounting
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Benford's Law is named for the late Dr. Frank Benford, a
physicist at the General Electric Co. In 1938 he noticed that pages
of logarithms corresponding to numbers starting with the numeral 1
were much dirtier and more worn than other pages.
</P>
<P>
   (A logarithm is an exponent. Any number can be expressed as the
fractional exponent _ the logarithm _ of some base number, such as
10. Published tables permit users to look up logarithms
corresponding to numbers, or numbers corresponding to logarithms.)
</P>
<P>
   Logarithm tables (and the slide rules derived from them) are not
much used for routine calculating anymore; electronic calculators
and computers are simpler and faster. But logarithms remain
important in many scientific and technical applications, and they
were a key element in Benford's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Benford concluded that it was unlikely that physicists and
engineers had some special preference for logarithms starting with
1. He therefore embarked on a mathematical analysis of 20,229 sets
of numbers, including such wildly disparate categories as the areas
of rivers, baseball statistics, numbers in magazine articles and
the street addresses of the first 342 people listed in the book
``American Men of Science.''
</P>
<P>
   All these seemingly unrelated sets of numbers followed the same
first-digit probability pattern as the worn pages of logarithm
tables suggested. In all cases, the number 1 turned up as the first
digit about 30 percent of the time, more often than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Benford derived a formula to explain this. If absolute certainty
is defined as 1 and absolute impossibility as 0, then the
probability of any number ``d'' from 1 through 9 being the first
digit is log to the base 10 of (1 (plus) 1/d). This formula
predicts the frequencies of numbers found in many categories of
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Probability predictions are often surprising. In the case of the
coin-tossing experiment, Hill wrote in the current issue of the
magazine American Scientist, a ``quite involved calculation''
revealed a surprising probability. It showed, he said, that the
overwhelming odds are that at some point in a series of 200 tosses,
either heads or tails will come up six or more times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Most fakers don't know this and avoid guessing long runs of
heads or tails, which they mistakenly believe to be improbable. At
just a glance, Hill can see whether or not a student's 200
coin-toss results contain a run of six heads or tails; if they
don't, the student is branded a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Even more astonishing are the effects of Benford's Law on number
sequences. Intuitively, most people assume that in a string of
numbers sampled randomly from some body of data, the first non-zero
digit could be any number from 1 through 9. All nine numbers would
be regarded as equally probable.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Benford discovered, in a huge assortment of number
sequences _ random samples from a day's stock quotations, a
tournament's tennis scores, the numbers on the front page of The
New York Times, the populations of towns, electricity bills in the
Solomon Islands, the molecular weights of compounds, the half-lives
of radioactive atoms and much more _ this is not so.
</P>
<P>
   Given a string of at least four numbers sampled from one or more
of these sets of data, the chance that the first digit will be 1 is
not one in nine, as many people would imagine; according to
Benford's Law, it is 30.1 percent, or nearly one in three. The
chance that the first number in the string will be 2 is only 17.6
percent, and the probabilities that successive numbers will be the
first digit decline smoothly up to 9, which has only a 4.6 percent
chance.
</P>
<P>
   A strange feature of these probabilities is that they are
``scale invariant'' and ``base invariant.'' For example, it doesn't
matter whether the numbers are based on the dollar prices of stocks
or their prices in yen or marks, nor does it matter if the numbers
are in terms of stocks per dollar; provided there are enough
numbers in the sample, the first digit of the sequence is more
likely to be 1 than any other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The larger and more varied the sampling of numbers from
different data sets, mathematicians have found, the more closely
the distribution of numbers approaches what Benford's Law
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the experts putting this discovery to practical use is
Dr. Mark J. Nigrini, an accounting consultant affiliated with the
University of Kansas who this month joins the faculty of Southern
Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Nigrini gained recognition a few years ago by applying a system
he devised based on Benford's Law to some fraud cases in Brooklyn,
N.Y. The idea underlying his system is that if the numbers in a set
of data like a tax return more or less match the frequencies and
ratios predicted by Benford's Law, the data are probably honest.
</P>
<P>
   But if a graph of such numbers is markedly different from the
one predicted by Benford's Law, he said, ``I think I'd call someone
in for a detailed audit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tests based on Benford's Law are so complex that
they require a computer to carry out. Others are surprisingly
simple; just finding too few ones and too many sixes in a sequence
of data to be consistent with Benford's Law is sometimes enough to
arouse suspicion of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burton, the chief financial investigator for the Brooklyn
district attorney, recalled in an interview that he had read an
article by Dr. Nigrini that fascinated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had done his PhD dissertation on the potential use of
Benford's Law to detect tax evasion, and I got in touch with him in
what turned out to be a mutually beneficial relationship,'' Burton
said. ``Our office had handled seven cases of admitted fraud, and
we used them as a test of Nigrini's computer program. It correctly
spotted all seven cases as involving probable fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest experiments Nigrini conducted with his
Benford's Law program was an analysis of President Clinton's tax
return. Nigrini found that it probably contained some rounded-off
estimates rather than precise numbers, but he concluded that his
test did not reveal any fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The fit of number sets with Benford's Law is not infallible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use it to improve your chances in a lottery,''
Nigrini said. ``In a lottery someone simply pulls a series of balls
out of a jar, or something like that. The balls are not really
numbers; they are labeled with numbers, but they could just as
easily be labeled with the names of animals. The numbers they
represent are uniformly distributed, every number has an equal
chance, and Benford's Law does not apply to uniform
distributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem Nigrini acknowledges is that some of his tests
may turn up too many false positives. Various anomalies having
nothing to do with fraud can appear for innocent reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the double digit 24 often turns up in analyses of
corporate accounting, biasing the data, causing it to diverge from
Benford's Law patterns and sometimes arousing suspicion wrongly,
Nigrini said. ``But the cause is not real fraud, just a little
shaving. People who travel on business often have to submit
receipts for any meal costing $25 or more, so they put in lots of
claims for $24.90, just under the limit. That's why we see so many
24s.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigrini said he believes that conformity with Benford's Law will
make it possible to validate procedures developed to fix the Year
2000 problem _ the expectation that many computer systems will go
awry because of their inability to distinguish the year 2000 from
the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   A variant of his Benford's Law software already in use, he said,
could spot any significant change in a company's accounting figures
between 1999 and 2000, thereby detecting a computer problem that
might otherwise go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I foresee lots of uses for this stuff, but for me its just
fascinating in itself,'' Nigrini said. ``For me, Benford is a great
hero. His law is not magic, but sometimes it seems like it.''

HIKERS WORK TO PRESERVE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES: FIRE TOWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HADLEY MOUNTAIN, N.Y. _ High above the rocky summit of this
2,675-foot peak, Adam Federman has been trying to paint the wooden
stairs of a fire tower _ the last step in the three-year renovation
of this elegant structure that had been locked up and abandoned in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, so many people have been visiting the restored
40-foot tower that Federman's paint job hasn't gotten very far. So
many visitors have been going up and down the steep stairway that
the paint wouldn't have time to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Originally built to help spot forest fires, lookout towers are a
part of Adirondack mountain lore. Dozens still dot the peaks in
upstate New York. But rendered obsolete by airplane observers and a
sharp decline in fires, most towers have been abandoned, with some
slated to eventually be torn down by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, a growing band of preservationists is starting to
restore these structures. In a bit of historic preservation akin to
the movement to turn abandoned railroad beds into bike paths, the
fire towers are being restored as mountaintop attractions for
hikers. A few, including the Hadley tower, even have interpretive
``summit guides,'' like Federman, to greet hikers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hadley Mountain fire tower, built in 1917, is just about
fully restored, with new guy wires, concrete footings, and sturdy
plastic windows on top.
</P>
<P>
   Some weekends, Federman, a 19-year-old college student who is
manning the Hadley tower as a summer job, has hosted more than 100
people who have come to climb the tower, which gets them well above
the trees and affords a 360-degree view. He answers questions like
where is Mount Marcy (you can't really see it from here) and he
hands out tiny ``I Climbed Hadley Mountain'' certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Fire towers have come a long way from their workaday origins.
Most were erected around the turn of the century, when the
Adirondacks were a vastly different place, said Jack Freeman,
research director for the Adirondack Mountain Club, a group that
promotes hiking and helps maintain trails in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, vast sections of the Adirondacks had been logged out,
leaving a scarred landscape of tree stumps and dead timber.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, tourists used to travel from the cities to
Adirondack resorts on coal and wood-fired steam trains that left
sparks in their wakes _ a recipe for catastrophic forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   By putting up a network of towers, forest rangers hoped to spot
and put out the fires early.
</P>
<P>
   They were equipped with hand-cranked phones, which usually had a
line to the watchman's home. The state hired local married men,
thinking that their wives would be around to get the phone calls in
case a fire was spotted. At their peak in the 1920s, there were
about 59 towers in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, steam trains gave way to automobiles as a
mode of transport and forest rangers began relying on hikers and
pilots to spot fires.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, though, was the regeneration of the logged
areas, which removed the tinderbox conditions. Major fires became
rare events, and by 1990 the last of the fire tower watchmen had
retired, marking the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   The towers were pretty much abandoned, with only about 30
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Their revival started a few years ago when hikers started
wondering why nothing was being done with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had been complaining,'' Freeman recalled. ``Isn't it a
shame that the state doesn't care enough about these magnificent
structures?''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the complaints to heart, Freeman helped organize local
groups to ``adopt'' and rebuild the towers in places like Hadley.
He also enlisted the Department of Environmental Conservation to
help with labor and other non-monetary support.
</P>
<P>
   So far, towers at Blue Mountain, near Blue Mountain Lake, Kane
Mountain near Caroga Lake and at Hadley have been renovated.
</P>
<P>
   A tower at Goodnow Mountain near Newcomb has also been fixed up
and maintained by the state university's forestry school.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, on Poke-O-Moonshine Mountain in northern Essex
County and Mount Arab in St. Lawrence County, are undergoing
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists also want to restore five towers in the
Catskills, including one atop Hunter Mountain that has been
nominated to the National Register of Historic Places. Similar
restorations are under way in Vermont and other states.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the driving forces for the restoration at Hadley was Roy
Fordham. He's been climbing Hadley Mountain since 1933, when his
parents purchased a summer camp near the foot of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   After a career making topographic maps for the federal
government, Fordham, 70, retired to his parents' cabin. By 1995 he
was involved in a local group working to renovate the tower. The
cost of the project was about $3,000 for material such as Lexan
clear plastic for the windows and new guy wires.
</P>
<P>
   Along with those busy stairs, Fordham's volunteers are painting
the hut atop the tower in a retro-looking aluminum color paint.
</P>
<P>
   On days with low humidity, or when a high-pressure front is
coming in, savvy hikers know the views will be spectacular and they
climb Hadley Mountain in droves.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, 5-year-old Nick Bollinger had his mom's
full attention as he clambered up the steep wooden stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi mom,'' Bollinger said, his voice barely audible over the
steady hum of a 20-mph breeze blowing through the tower's guy
wires.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason to worry, though, since the tower stairs are
partially enclosed in chicken wire.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hut, the wind noise suddenly stops _ blocked by the
thick plastic windows. The view is a classic Adirondack panorama of
deep green mountains that seem to roll on forever. To the
southwest, Great Sacandaga Lake glimmers in the noontime sun,
cutting through the haze like a signal mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on weather conditions, one can see the Green Mountains
of Vermont to the east, the Adirondack High Peaks to the north and
the Catskills to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts like Steven Engelhart, director of Adirondack
Architectural Heritage, a preservationist group, says there's
something magical about reaching a mountain summit and seeing a
tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are these wonderful sentinels on top of mountains,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the gene responsible for Hunter's syndrome was discovered
about 10 years ago, Joan Cohen was told by a doctor that it would
take only five years to develop a gene therapy for the rare
hereditary disease that afflicts her son.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen, who lives in Island Park, N.Y., is still waiting.
Even in its mild form, the disease often kills people by the time
they reach 35. ``It's like a time bomb,'' Mrs. Cohen said. Her
17-year-old son, Adam, is just 4 feet 11 inches tall and suffers
from leaky and enlarged heart valves, respiratory problems, and
deteriorated hearing. ``I'm sitting here with a kid that I know is
going to die and there's nothing I can do that will stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   When it first made headlines about a decade ago, gene therapy
seemed the answer to the prayers of thousands of people affected by
hereditary diseases. The idea is simple and eloquent. Many
inherited diseases are caused by a faulty gene, which makes the
body unable to produce some essential protein or enzyme. Gene
therapy would deliver the needed gene to a person's cells, which
would then begin producing the essential substance.
</P>
<P>
   But gene therapy so far has not worked, mainly because it has
been difficult to get the genes to the desired cells efficiently
and have them produce enough of the needed protein. Scientific
evidence of consistent improvement in patients is lacking so far,
although some patients have reported gains.
</P>
<P>
   Even as significant technology hurdles are being overcome, other
issues _ business ones _ may keep gene therapy from helping people
like Adam Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of gene therapy has shifted from inherited diseases
toward more common ailments like cancer, AIDS and heart disease _
all areas that could prove more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Many genetic disorders, and there are thousands of them, affect
anywhere from a handful to a few thousand people worldwide, hardly
a commercially promising prospect for the pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of gene therapy for genetic diseases doesn't
fit the business model,'' said Dr. James Wilson, director of the
institute for human gene therapy at the University of Pennsylvania
and president of the American Society for Gene Therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The situation raises the prospect that the Human Genome Project
will discover an abundance of genes responsible for illnesses, but
that no one will actually use those genes to help patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only genes for things like obesity and baldness that are
spurring further investigation,'' said Abbey Meyers, president of
the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 244 gene therapy trials registered since 1989 with the
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at the National Institutes of
Health, about 150 are for cancer and another 23 are for HIV. Only
33 are for diseases caused by a defect in a single gene, and 16 of
those are for cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited disease
among Caucasians. Seventeen tests cover 12 other genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Among trials registered since the beginning of 1997 the balance
is even more lopsided _ 53 for cancer and 8 for hereditary
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Although cancer has a genetic basis, it is an extremely
complicated disease and many experts think gene therapy will at
best become part of an arsenal of weapons achieving partial
results. By contrast, diseases caused by a single defective gene
could, at least in theory, be cured by gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rare genetic diseases that give you neat model
systems that are most likely to show success,'' said Dr. W. French
Anderson, director of the gene therapy laboratories at the
University of Southern California. ``So it's really ironic that we
can't get the funding to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he worked at NIH, Anderson participated in the first human
gene therapy experiments, performed on two girls with a rare
inherited immune deficiency. But now, he said, his gene therapy
work is directed at cancer, cardiovascular disease and arthritis
because that is where the funding is.
</P>
<P>
   Because the technology so far has not worked on a large scale,
the paucity of clinical trials aimed at inherited diseases has not
been a major issue. ``Without the breakthroughs in technology, all
the clinical trials wouldn't mean much in the end because they are
not going to be successful,'' said Dr. Savio Woo, director of the
institute for gene therapy and molecular medicine at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And some experts, as well as families with rare genetic
diseases, are confident that once the technology works, money will
become available. Gene therapy probably would be covered by the
Orphan Drug Act, which gives drug companies financial incentives to
develop treatments for rare disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some scientists say that recent improvements in
technology promise to bring the business issue to the fore in a few
years, and efforts to address it are starting.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of
Health have started to explore whether clinical trials of gene
therapy for rare genetic diseases could be compressed to make them
less expensive and require fewer patients. One proposal would
combine the first phase of trials, used to test for safety, and
later stages that test for efficacy, said Dr. Stephen Groft, who
directs the institutes' rare disease office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of
Southern California and the National Organization for Rare
Disorders are discussing a cooperative effort to raise millions of
dollars for gene therapy clinical trials on rare diseases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Many patient groups are raising money to finance research,
including gene therapy trials. The Fanconi Anemia Research
Foundation, for example, has distributed $2.7 million since 1990
for research on that disease, in which the bone marrow fails to
work. But many patient organizations are small and have been unable
to raise such large sums.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the government will have to finance clinical trials for
rare diseases. But the NIH, following a 1995 review of gene
therapy, believes that money should first be spent to improve the
basic science and technology rather than embarking on trials that
probably will not be very useful.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Williams, a professor at Indiana University who is
working on gene therapy for several rare diseases, said the N.I.H.
seems more willing to finance some clinical trials. But Williams'
first clinical trial will be for cancer, because the National
Cancer Institute has been more amenable to such trials than other
institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say that even if the technology does not work
yet, clinical trials could help speed development. ``If I had a
million dollars I couldn't suddenly treat 100 patients,'' said Dr.
Chester Whitley of the University of Minnesota, who wants to do
gene therapy for Hunter's syndrome. ``But I could treat one patient
and learn from that and then treat three patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if government funding was available, it would probably go
only through Phase I, the initial safety testing, at a cost of
roughly $200,000 to $600,000, researchers said. It would probably
be up to companies to do the more expensive later-stage trials.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies, particularly the new ones that are doing most of
the gene therapy work, say they cannot afford to spend money on
treatments for rare diseases because of the limited potential for
payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial value of a product in that area is going to be
less,'' said Dr. Stephen Sherwin, chief executive of Cell Genesys
Inc. ``In a business setting, you have to consider that.'' The
company, based in Foster City, Calif., is conducting seven gene
therapy trials _ five for cancer and two for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer is being emphasized also because risky treatments
traditionally are tested on terminal illnesses, Sherwin said. In
addition, the technical problems that have stymied the use of gene
therapy in inherited diseases may pose less of an obstacle in
cancer or cardiovascular disease, other scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with gene therapy so far is that researchers have
not been able to deliver the genes in large enough quantities to
the proper cells, or to have the genes ``expressed,'' or activated
to produce the required protein for a sufficient length of time.
</P>
<P>
   But for cancer, the genes usually would not need to be activated
forever. One approach, for example, calls for injecting genes that
cause the tumor cells to produce a protein that stimulates the
body's own immune system, which in turn would attack the tumor. In
clinical trials sponsored by Vical, a San Diego company, such an
approach reduced the tumors by at least half in 17 percent of
melanoma patients who had failed other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases, you don't
need expression forever,'' said Dr. Ronald Crystal, professor of
medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Crystal is
continuing work on hereditary diseases at his laboratory. But a
company he co-founded, Genvec, is concentrating on gene therapy for
cardiovascular disease, using genes for a protein to help grow new
blood vessels in tissues with inadequate blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that the search for cancer treatments has
increased spending on gene therapy technology, which will
eventually help people with genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the quickest route to solving cystic fibrosis is to take
a detour,'' said Dr. Alan Smith, chief scientific officer at
Genzyme Corp. The biotechnology company conducted eight
unsuccessful gene therapy trials for cystic fibrosis. Now it is
concentrating on cancer and cardiovascular disease as well as
Gaucher's disease, a rare inherited disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen also is hopeful that techniques developed for cancer
gene therapy will be applied to her son's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Other treatments for genetic disorders also are being tried.
Genzyme is treating Gaucher's using genetic engineering. The
necessary gene is implanted in vats of cells, producing the needed
enzyme, which is then sold to patients for about $150,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the ideal case, gene therapy would require a one-time
injection of genes that would then allow the patient to make his or
her own enzyme. But for a drug company, a one-time cure for a rare
disease might offer less chance of profit.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with gene therapy has been developing the
vectors _ usually partially disabled viruses _ that can deliver the
genes to the cells. But scientists say progress has been made, and
other techniques have been developed to do away with viruses
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to work in the next couple of years for many more
genetic diseases,'' said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, a gene therapy
pioneer at NIH who recently became chief scientific officer at
Kimeragen, a new company. Rather than inject entire genes, the
company's technology will just ``correct the typos'' in the
patient's own genes. Blaese said the company's first clinical trial

Crigler-Najjar disease.

   Avigen, a gene therapy company in Alameda, Calif., has improved
the condition of dogs with hemophilia B for 20 weeks with a single
injection of the gene for Factor IX, the missing blood clotting
agent. The company, which hopes to begin human trials this year,
uses a vector made from an adeno-associated virus, a type of virus
that has received little attention in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen's president, John Monahan, said the company would focus
on the more common inherited diseases rather than cancer. ``For
cancer,'' he said, ``there's not even an agreement on what the gene
should be.''

SCIENTISTS SAY HUMAN LINE EMERGED FROM AFRICA TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human line has emerged from Africa not once but twice.
</P>
<P>
   That is the ingenious and far-reaching surmise proposed in the
latest issue of Current Biology by Caro-Beth Stewart of the State
University of New York at Albany and Todd R. Disotell of New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusion emerges from an attempt to make sense of the
geographical distribution of living and fossil apes and Old World
monkeys. This special branch of the mammalian tree originated in
Africa but spread through Europe and Asia. The orangutan, for
example, is found only in southeast Asia but its close cousins the
chimpanzee and the gorilla live only in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Disotell drew up an evolutionary tree according to
the best current evidence from molecular clocks and cladistics and
then applied Occam's razor to search for the simplest pattern of
dispersal that would explain the known distribution of the species.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusion is that an early ape-like species dispersed out
of Africa about 20 million years ago, giving rise to the gibbons,
orangutans and other ape lineages. One of these descendant ape
species must then have moved back into Africa about 10 million
years ago, speciating into the gorilla, the chimp and the hominid
line that led to humans.
</P>
<P>
   This scheme, the two scientists note, requires only two
migrations whereas the alternative of keeping the ape line
permanently in Africa postulates six migrations out of Africa and
the implausible condition of a continuously open, forested land
bridge linking Africa and Asia via Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The theory explains the absence of ape fossils in Africa from 12
million to 10 million years ago, and predicts that the Arabian
peninsula would be a good place to explore for ape-like remains.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is not yet gospel, however. Its authors note that in
earlier presentations their ideas have ``aroused vehement
discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that similar proposals had been made before but had
been ignored. Paleoanthropologists who believed in a direct lineage
between extinct African ape species like kenyapithecus and the
hominids, she said, were deeply opposed to her thesis that ape
evolution was occurring outside Africa at this period.

MOVIE SPECIAL EFFECTS HELPS SCIENTISTS MAKE A BETTER BURN MASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By JANE ELLEN STEVENS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Vandegrift was savoring his retirement. After three decades
as coach of winning football and track teams at Lebanon High School
in Ohio, he was golfing with friends, planning some long-awaited
vacations with his wife, Rosie, and doing a little farming on six
acres outside town.
</P>
<P>
   One warm afternoon in June 1997, as he was driving his tractor
along a two-lane highway back to his house, the tractor's gas cap
popped off, gasoline sprayed out and soaked VanDeGrift from his
head to the tops of his legs, and a spark turned him into a ball of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists stopped to help, and 20 minutes later, VanDeGrift was
flown to Miami Valley Hospital in nearby Dayton. There, VanDeGrift
began the long, difficult road to recovery traveled by all burn
patients, with one big difference. He landed in a hospital where a
group of engineers, doctors and physical therapists was
experimenting with movie-industry technology to produce a facial
mask that they hoped would help him heal faster and reduce the need
for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, more than 2 million people suffer burns; between
8,000 and 12,000 die. Of the 75,000 who are hospitalized, 20,000
have major burns involving at least 25 percent of their total body
surface. These burn patients undergo weeks in intensive care,
followed by weeks in a burn unit, followed by years of
rehabilitation and reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems is the growth of scar tissue, which
is so hard and unyielding it looks and feels like the tendons of an
Olympic weight lifter. It grows relentlessly for a year or two. If
patients with extensive burns do not fight it every day, by
stretching it, massaging it and wearing tight garments that slow
its growth, their bodies will constrict into a ball.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the scar tissue on facial burns under control, patients
must wear a plastic mask. The mask presses on the scars and
restricts blood flow. Without blood to feed the tissue, scars
cannot grow.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, being fitted for a mask can be horribly painful
and claustrophobic. Patients must lie on their backs as a thick
layer of plaster is smeared over their faces. They must lie still
for 30 minutes and breathe through cocktail straws stuck in their
noses while the plaster sets. Some must be sedated.
</P>
<P>
   The masks made this way do not fit that well, in part because
the face muscle shift between standing and lying positions. Without
a proper fit, the masks do not press on the scar tissue enough.
Burn patients must still undergo several operations to cut away
scar tissue that contorts their mouths or keeps their eyes
permanently open or closed.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a three-dimensional scanning technology best known for
its use in the movie industry is replacing the old method. The
result is a painless process producing better fitting masks.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Whitestone, a biomedical engineer who was among the
original group of volunteers to adapt the mask technology, said:
``Burn patients can be fitted with a high-tech mask months earlier,
before their faces begin building enough scar tissue to withstand
the pain of fitting a traditional mask. The masks fit better, so
that means the growth of the scar tissue can be arrested sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Ause-Ellias, a Miami Valley Hospital physical therapist
with the volunteer group, said, ``Patients are much more willing to
wear these new masks.'' She and Ms. Whitestone have fit six
patients with masks made with the new technology. They believe that
patients who wear the high-tech masks will require fewer operations
than those who wear the traditional masks.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used to make the masks was devised 15 years ago
in Monterey, Calif., when an electrical engineer, Lloyd Addleman,
and his family invented a three-dimensional copier to make
life-size busts of people's heads.
</P>
<P>
   They found a niche in Hollywood's special-effects industry,
scanning dinosaurs for ``Jurassic Park'' and making images for
other films.
</P>
<P>
   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base snapped up the technology to
make more efficient oxygen masks and helmets for pilots. Then, a
group of engineers, physicians and prosthetics specialists
volunteered their time to make the first high-tech masks for burn
patients. Ms. Ause-Ellias led the project with Ms. Whitestone, who
has since launched Total Contact, a company that provides the
software and hardware to make burn masks.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after his accident, VanDeGrift sat on a stool as a
scanner circled his head for 17 seconds and swept his face with a
red laser beam that he could not feel. The scanner's camera
collected 512 profiles, and its computer noted the coordinates of
500 points along each line. VanDeGrift's face appeared on a
computer screen as a wire image with thousands of points.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to make a mold for the mask. Engineers at
Bastech Inc., an engineering company in Columbus, used computers to
slice the image of VanDeGrift's face into hundreds of cross
sections, each 1/5,000th of an inch thick. A green laser traced the
cross sections on the surface of a vat of liquid polymer and
hardened one thin layer at a time. Each hardened layer was dropped
into the liquid; the masks built layer by layer, from the chin to
the top of the nose. A day later, the molds were ready to be
smoothed.
</P>
<P>
   The final step _ making the mask _ was done at Fidelity
Orthotics, a company that makes prosthetics. Employees placed the
molds on a vacuum stand and heated sheets of clear plastic to 350
degrees until they were soft enough to shrink-wrap over the mold.
Off popped a mask. Holes were cut for eyes, nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a perfect fit,'' said Ms. Ause-Ellias as she put the
mask on VanDeGrift and marked the plastic with a grease pencil to
increase the size of the mouth hole.
</P>
<P>
   Other burn specialists call the technology promising, but at
$1,500 a mask, discouragingly expensive. ``The scanning laser
technology appears to make a previously tedious and labor-intensive
process much easier,'' said Dr. Robert Spence, co-director of the
Baltimore Regional Burn Center and associate professor of plastic
surgery at Johns Hopkins Medical School. ``The primary limitation
currently, in my opinion, is its high cost.''
</P>
<P>
   VanDeGrift wears his mask every day and every night. ``I'll wear
it as long as it takes,'' he said. ``It's pretty comfortable. It
gets itchy when I exercise, and it's hard to talk very well through
it. But I can forget about it.'' The only time he takes it off is
for a haircut, to eat or to announce high school football games for
the local radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ause-Ellias noted that the mask was already beginning to
make a difference. ``He's doing great,'' she said. ``He's healing
much faster than other burn patients.''

MOON'S ATMOSPHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q.(italics)Did the Moon ever have an atmosphere?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. It has one now, though it is a very thin and highly dispersed
collection of gaseous molecules, not suitable for breathing by
Earth creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of a lunar atmosphere was reported in 1933, based
on observation of the Moon using a mask that filtered out moonlight
in order to study the spectrum of light emitted by sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Although sodium is believed to be just a trace in the Moon's
atmosphere, it is studied because it is relatively easy to detect
and is used as a marker for other components, believed to include
potassium, neon, argon and helium.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 study of lunar sodium, by Boston University scientists
using improved instruments, determined that the atmosphere extended
at least 5,000 miles above the Moon's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The molecules, however, are few and far between, only an
estimated 10 million atoms per cubic centimeter near the Moon's
surface; Earth's atmosphere is about a billion times as dense.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of the atmosphere are believed to be the release of
gases from within the Moon by moonquakes (a phenomenon called
outgassing) and the loosening of molecules from the surface by the
impact of molecules from the solar wind or by meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   A few moons of other planets have much more impressive
atmospheres, like that of Jupiter's Titan, a thick haze of nitrogen
and methane, and that of Europa, a thin whisp of oxygen. &QL;

SNOOTY STARTS THE LONG SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday Aug. 5)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While I was away on vacation, Snooty the manatee turned 50.
</P>
<P>
   I usually try to schedule my vacations around Snooty's
birthdays, but this year the lure of Paducah in July was simply too
strong and I left Snooty to deal with this milestone (millstone?)
by himself as best he could.
</P>
<P>
   While I was tweezing Lyme-disease-carrying ticks off my ankles
and swatting horseflies the size of herons, Snooty was celebrating
the big Five-Oh in the comfort of his aquarium at South Florida
Museum in Bradenton, Fla. There was a great deal of press coverage
of the party itself, the birthday card contest, the
save-the-manatee campaign, blah, blah, blah, but nowhere did a find
a single mention of Snooty's state of mind, which just goes to show
what a sorry product American journalism schools are turning out
these days.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is speeding toward his 50th birthday faster than
a rogue asteroid, I think I have a pretty good idea what Snooty is
going through. When Snooty rolls out of bed in the morning and
looks at himself in the mirror, he sees a much different manatee
than he did 25 years ago. For one thing, he's put on a little
weight. I am no disciple of the cult of thinness, but even so it's
hard to feel good about yourself when you weigh 1,300 pounds, as
Snooty does.
</P>
<P>
   Snooty's weight problem must be especially depressing since all
he eats is lettuce, carrots, apples and other unappetizing stuff
that people gag down when they're trying to lose weight. How would
you feel if you weighed 1,300 pounds and had never had a pepperoni
pizza or a bowl of Cherry Garcia ice cream in your life? Pretty
unhappy, that's how.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is not the only indignity that Snooty has suffered as he
limps (paddles?) into the twilight years of his life. Last
February, for the first time in his life, Snooty was forced to
share his aquarium with another manatee, a 4-year-old punk named,
of all things, Newton. To say that Newton is annoying is like
saying the Pentagon is wasteful. Newton flits about the tank like a
1,000-pound mosquito, stealing the spotlight from Snooty, whose
dreams of a successful acting career are now pretty much dashed
unless they come out with a movie called ``Grumpy Old Manatees.''
</P>
<P>
   Snooty, without having any say in the matter, has led a
thoroughly chaste life. Now he finds himself confined with a much
younger manatee of the same sex. This is not to imply that Snooty
would ever allow himself to be anything but a model of decorum and
decency, but all of us have read those unfortunate stories about
Catholic priests and people who have been locked up in prison for
long periods of time. Clearly, this is not the kind of
``educational purpose'' that Snooty and Newton were meant to serve.
It is certainly not the kind of legacy Snooty had in mind, either.
He wants to be remembered as our county mascot, not our midnight
cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   If Snooty is typical of 50-year-old males (and there is no
reason to think he isn't) he isn't real amenable to change. Change
is confusing, and life is confusing enough when you're 50, without
added complications.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty is the age when you start thinking about the kids moving
out of the house, not new ones moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty is the age when you feel entitled to slow down a little
bit and you don't want some punk kid zipping under your chin like a
skateboarder wired on Jolt cola to remind you that you're growing
old.
</P>
<P>
   Hang in there, Snooty. It's all downhill from here.

THIS ISN'T YOUR FATHER'S CHRISTIAN OUTREACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Behind the covered windows of a Pipeline
Road storefront in a suburb north of Fort Worth, a room full of
teens, hands in the air, sways to the sounds of young people
jamming on guitars, drums and electronic keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Flashes of red, green, pink and blue shoot through the darkened
room. The glow of a large video screen offers minimal lighting and
a second glance at the band. A disco ball twirls slowly over the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 teens wearing tank tops, body piercings and a
rainbow of hair colors have filed into rows of folding chairs for
an experience that 15-year-old Jeremy Lyne of North Richland Hills
says has ``pretty much changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the scene of Youth WAVE church in Hurst may owe some of
its flavoring to musical grunge gurus, the smell of teen spirit
exudes no sourness here. In this independent church that ministers
to 13- to 25-year-olds, pastors Spencer and Cyndy Nordyke
purposefully channel this teen spirit as an expression of Christian
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching out to a group that has their own language,
their own dress,'' Spencer Nordyke said. ``We're not trying to pull
kids out of the church. We are trying to provide a nontraditional
setting for kids to come into.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to teens has long been a goal for many church
leaders, who have responded by offering special Sunday school
classes, Wednesday evening prayer meetings and socials. For youth
pastors of many denominations, the goal remains much the same:
provide religious leadership and education for youths who are
making life decisions as they feel their way through the secular
and spiritual worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, church leaders are expanding youth programs
beyond religious education and the occasional ice cream social or
trip to a pro baseball game, youth ministers say. A calendar of
events for youths can include a summer full of eye-opening mission
trips, weekend retreats, volunteer work and leadership training. In
some churches, the result has been a renewed emphasis on youth
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is very definitely a new interest in it,'' said
Philip H. Briggs, distinguished professor of student ministries at
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The desire for religion geared to youths comes in part from
teens themselves, who appear to be very much included in a national
religious awakening of their baby boomer parents, clergy say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really digging spiritually,'' said Betsy Godbold,
associate pastor of White's Chapel United Methodist Church in
Southlake, north of Fort Worth. ``We are going to have to meet that
challenge to provide programs that meet the spiritual needs of
these kids. It can't be just lightweight stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 youths are on the roster at White's Chapel United
Methodist, and about one-third of the ministry during the week is
geared to them, said the Rev. Marty Dunbar, who oversees youth
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Southlake church, Metroplex Covenant Church in
Colleyville offers a youth group, Crossfire. In addition to a
Wednesday night worship service in which youth pastor B. Marc
Bolling plays the electric guitar with the band, members of
Crossfire can take part in many weekly events. They can join prayer
team meetings, work on the group's Web site, and join the dance or
drama teams. Crossfire also sponsors a concert series of Christian
rock music that can attract a crowd from around the Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 2 1/2 years, the Wednesday night Crossfire services
have grown from about 25 teens to an average of more than 65,
Bolling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entertainment. It's not a production. It's a
service,'' he said. ``Everything we do is geared toward God.''
</P>
<P>
   At services such as Bollings' or those at Youth WAVE, much of
the emphasis is on helping teens forge an intimate relationship
with Jesus, a relationship that parents or adults may not
understand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a crucial relationship, Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God doesn't have any grandkids,'' he said. ``Every person must
have a personal encounter with a faith pilgrimage.''
</P>
<P>
   But teens are not the only driving force behind new youth
programs. Parents often expect their church to directly minister to
the spiritual needs of children and teens, Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find a church that we may not be totally happy with but
our kids are getting fed, I'm willing to stay in that church for
that benefit,'' said Donna Day of Keller, whose daughter Danyelle
attends services at Youth WAVE.

   Meeting the needs of the parents is also foremost in the minds
of church leaders, especially in growing areas with young families
willing to travel to the church of their choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a consumer society,'' Bolling said. ``Consumers go with
the best product they can find. When parents go to churches ...
they want to go to a church that can meet every need of their
family.''
</P>
<P>
   In a consumer society, Youth WAVE is probably an example of
niche marketing. Spencer Nordyke calls his church ``interest
group-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   He said youths have their own culture and it's his job to meet
their interests. That means keeping up with the latest in Christian
rock and understanding and ministering to the needs of suburban
teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in a circle singing `Kumbaya' isn't going to do it for
these guys,'' Nordyke said.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeremy Lyne, the result is a place where a 15-year-old can
worship on his own terms.

   ``I feel more free to be myself here,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To illustrate Benford's Law, Dr. Mark J. Nigrini offered this
example:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think of the Dow Jones stock average as 1000, our first
digit would be 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to a Dow Jones average with a first digit of 2, the
average must increase to 2000, and getting from 1000 to 2000 is a
100 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say that the Dow goes up at a rate of about 20 percent a
year. That means that it would take five years to get from 1 to 2
as a first digit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But suppose we start with a first digit 5. It only requires a
20% increase to get from 5000 to 6000, and that is achieved in one
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Dow reaches 9000, it takes only an 11 percent
increase and just seven months to reach the 10,000 mark, which
starts with the number 1. At that point you start over with the
first digit a 1, once again. Once again, you must double the number
_ 10,000 _ to 20,000 before reaching 2 as the first digit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, the number 1 predominates at every step of the
progression, as it does in logarithmic sequences.''

 &HT;    Finally, a do-not-call list for telemarketers
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Come Jan. 1, Georgia consumers will have another
weapon to fight unwanted telemarketing calls, especially those made
by Georgia-based telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Service Commission is establishing a ``do not
call'' list of consumers who don't want to be called by
telemarketers -- and telemarketers are required to use the list or
face fines.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly passed legislation this year authorizing
the no-call list. The law -- House Bill No. 71 -- became effective
July 1, but the list becomes effective Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Information explaining the list and forms to join it will be
included in October bills mailed by Georgia's telephone companies,
said Shawn Davis, spokesman for the PSC. There is no way to join
until the information is received.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will have to pay $5 to join the list, which is
expected to stop unwanted calls from most Georgia-based
telemarketing firms. Exempted from the law, however, are companies
that have a current or previous relationship with the customer,
political pollsters and candidates for public offices, and
religious or charity groups.
</P>
<P>
   The state also intends for the no-call list to apply to
telemarketers in other states, although it may be difficult to
enforce the law against out-of-state marketers that say the law
doesn't apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Reid, administrator of the Georgia Office of Consumer
Affairs, charged with enforcing the no-call list, said he has
``every intention of vigorously enforcing the law,'' including
legal actions in other states when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also will rely on consumer-protection officials in other
states to help us, and we expect they will,'' Reid said. In recent
years, consumer agencies and attorneys general in various states
have increasingly worked together to resolve interstate consumer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also a possibility, said the PSC's Davis, is the Direct
Marketing Association might add the Georgia list to its own no-call
list. The DMA is the nation's biggest association of major
telemarketing firms, most of whom honor the DMA's no-call list.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have unsuccessfully lobbied Congress for several
years to pass legislation requiring a national do-not-call list for
telemarketers. Eventually, a national list probably will be
established, but meanwhile a number of states have established
their own lists.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress did require telemarketers to establish
their own no-call lists of consumers who say they don't want to be
called. But the consumer has to tell each unwanted telemarketer
that calls -- and there are thousands of telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia consumer affairs office may issue civil fines up to
$2,000 for each violation of the no-call list. The law requires
telemarketers to identify themselves at the beginning of the call,
and not to use equipment that would block caller identification
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's one type of telemarketer that won't pay
any attention to Georgia's no-call list or any no-call list -- the
fraudulent one.
</P>
<P>
   This year the General Assembly passed House Bill 1420 that:
</P>
<P>
   -- Prohibits telemarketers from using couriers to pick up a
consumer's payment unless the goods are delivered with the chance
to inspect before payment is made. Con artists sometimes use
couriers to pick up cash or checks to avoid mail-fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prohibits telemarketers from requesting advance fees to
remove derogatory information from, or improve, a person's credit
history or credit record.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prohibits requesting or receiving advance payments to help
recover money lost in a previous telemarketing transaction -- the
``recovery room'' scams.

 &HT;    McPhail's speed could eventually win Johnson over
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Spill all the Miami Dolphins running backs out of the
bag and search for the basic parts of the killer running game Jimmy
Johnson hopes to build. Clearly, some assembly is required.
</P>
<P>
   Karim Abdul-Jabbar is good, for instance, with 15 touchdowns to
his credit last season, but he's not great. Bernie Parmalee is
credible, with six 100-yard rushing games as proof, but he's not
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie John Avery is sensational, but he's also on the sidelines
with training camp slipping away. Ray Nealy is strong but his
professional resume is weak, barely stretching beyond the practice
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Is there something left at the bottom of the bag? Wait, yes,
it's Jerris McPhail, the fastest man on the team, but whether he
qualifies as anything else is a question Jimmy has been asking
himself since spending a fifth-round draft pick on the East
Carolina curiosity two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Already McPhail has been tried as a kick returner, a third-down
specialty back and, during one wildly experimental stretch of
training camp last month, a full-time wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Johnson is a guy who looks after his talent,'' said
McPhail, returned to the backfield on the day Lawrence Phillips was
cut. ``Any time a coach puts a running back at receiver, you have
to wonder what's going on. But he could easily have put me out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely that would have happened long ago if not for one play.
Last October, on the simple off-tackle groaner that normally nets
Miami runners a migraine but little else, McPhail shot through the
line for a 71-yard touchdown. It was the third-longest run in Miami
history, just 6 yards short of the record shared by Leroy Harris
and Keith Byars, and it reminded Johnson that the only commodity he
loved more than raw speed during the glorious Dallas years was
speed bought cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not much else is remembered from that game, a 36-33
overtime loss to the previously winless Chicago Bears. What a shame
for McPhail, since nobody else in a Miami uniform popped a run
longer than 22 yards all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   In an offense so mundane, each spark of excitement must be
nurtured and preserved like the last torch in a guano-coated
cavern. That is why I point out to you that McPhail rattled off a
22-yard gain in Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage at the Orange Bowl
and that he produced a stubborn touchdown surge on fourth-and-1 and
that he carried the ball 18 times for 57 yards without injuring a
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   All of these accomplishments, fairly simple at first glance, go
so far beyond the Dolphin norm that you have to ask yourself if
McPhail has been paying attention in team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there was a knock on me about being able to read my
blocks,'' McPhail said. ``All that is coming together now. When I
get myself mentally prepared to take the ball on every down, I'll
be untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's running game may yet be fitted together without this
guy, but Jimmy would have to be a little disappointed by that. What
he wants now from Avery, a game-breaking jolt, he once expected
from McPhail.
</P>
<P>
   Put the spare parts of the Miami running game back into the bag
for now, but don't forget this uncatalogued extra. Something tells
me Jimmy will watch the films of this scrimmage and try again,
twisting McPhail a little tighter, hammering him just a little
harder, bending him to the will of a coach who won two Super Bowls
with speed and won't stop until he does it again.

 &HT;    Internet service firm to buy rival for $352 million
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Colorado-based Internet service company Verio
Inc. will acquire buy Hiway Technologies in a stock and cash deal
worth $352.4 million, the companies announced.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is made up of $101 million in cash and 8.67
million shares of Verio common stock, with Hiway shareholders
owning about 19 percent of the combined company on a fully diluted
basis after the deal. Hiway also gets to appoint one member to
Verio's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Hiway hosts more than 90,000 Web sites and employs 275, with 175
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Verio has more than 850 employees, hosting more than 60,000 Web
sites and offering Internet access to 100,000 subscribers, mainly
businesses. In the first quarter, its most recent, Verio lost $28.4
million on sales of $21.2 million. Verio (Nasdaq: VRIO) closed at
$29.12 Thursday, up 12 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   For Verio, the Hiway purchase represents the second acquisition
in two months in Palm Beach County. It bought West Palm Beach-based
Florida Internet Corp., another Internet access provider, for
undisclosed cash in June. Englewood, Col.,-based Verio has bought
more than 30 smaller Internet service providers since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It means that Verio's Northern California operation and Hiway's
Best Internet unit _ also based in Northern California _ will
combine, increasing Verio's regional revenue base by more than 75
percent. Verio also gets Hiway's group of 2,000 resellers for its
service around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy for Verio has been to acquire regional Internet
providers so that they could offer hands-on local service,'' said
Steve Silvers, a Verio spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Verio and Hiway deal weds companies that together host
more individually registered Web sites than any other Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   Verio approached Hiway after it had broken into another facet of
the Internet business _ Web-hosting. So far this year, it has
bought two Web-hosting companies other than Hiway _ TabNet of
California three weeks ago and iServer in Utah in February.
</P>
<P>
   For Hiway, the deal ends the company's plans for an initial
stock offering next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verio brings to Hiway what it was looking for in the first
place, a national infrastructure and high-speed network. They
needed the ability to grow, national accounting and billing
systems, as well as a national (Internet) backbone,'' Silvers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiway President Scott Adams said there are no plans for layoffs
and Verio expects to keep Hiway basedin Boca Raton in the Blue Lake
center, where it occupies 72,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything we need diverse locations so we can route our
Internet traffic to another location in case of a earthquake in
California or a hurricane in Florida,'' Adams said.

 &HT;    Maris' legacy reborn as three near record
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE _ They are among the millions of baseball fans who
grab the sports page first thing each morning to follow the Great
Home Run Chase of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years ago their father was involved in a similar
chase when he said: ``Records are made to be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Roger Maris Jr., the second of six children in the
Maris family of Gainesville, said: ``My family doesn't want to see
Dad's record broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marises have been saying that for years, well before Roger
Maris died of cancer in 1985. Now, however, they see the increasing
vulnerability of his record _ 61 home runs in 1961. It's right
there in fine print every time they open the Gainesville Sun to
check Dad's progress in the Chasing Roger Maris Chart.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they saw Saturday morning: After 108 games, Mark
McGwire _ 45 home runs, Ken Griffey Jr. _ 41 home runs, Sammy Sosa
_ 42 home runs (after 110 games). Roger Maris _ 41 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we'd have any ill-feeling toward anyone,''
Roger Maris Jr., 39, continued. ``Dad was proud of that record. We
definitely want him to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after everything he went through to get it. The
Marises remember the stigma he carried to his grave for achieving
what many baseball fans in 1961 hoped would never be accomplished.
The newspaper's chart doesn't mention any of that.
</P>
<P>
   But Maris' family _ his widow Pat and his brother Rudy and his
mother Connie and his six kids _ and all his old golfing buddies
see it as clearly as the black-and-white photograph of his 61st
home-run swing that frames the chart.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Maris sees the strangers who used to show up on her doorstep
in Kansas City, hoping for a peek of the porcupine-topped New York
Yankee who had sneaked home in late August 1961 to hold his infant
son Randy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   She sees the patches of skin on the back of her husband's head
where his crewcut was falling out, a reaction to the stress the
26-year-old slugger felt as he closed in on what was then
considered the most sacrosanct of baseball records _ Babe Ruth's 60
home runs in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' four sons, who have their dad's eyes and chin, were
either too young to remember 1961 or born later. But they remember
how the chase followed their dad to Gainesville, where he moved
after retiring in 1968. Their parents' red-brick house (with a
staircase bannister spoked with baseball bats) overlooks the
seventh green of the Gainesville Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Maris, who coaches a baseball team that plays at Roger
Maris Field, hears his dad on the links as he prepares to sink a
4-foot putt: ``Pressure? I don't know the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Maris, an amateur golfer born Aug.21, 1961 (``No home runs
that day''), has studied the old newsreels from that summer. He
sees the reporters around Dad's locker asking questions like, ``Do
you cheat on your wife?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Roger Maris Jr. hear the frustration in their dad's
voice as he chats with friends about his stormy relationship with
the New York media, how he thinks it probably denied him what he
always felt was his rightful spot in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 13 years after his death _ with his picture in the paper
every morning and the reporters calling to ask about him every day
and his name mentioned on TV every night _ it's as if Roger Maris
is alive again.
</P>
<P>
   It's like 1961 all over again. Only this time he and Mickey
Mantle aren't chasing Babe Ruth. This time he's being chased by
McGwire, Griffey and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, the underdog is Roger Maris. It says so right
there in the chart, where Griffey is on a pace to tie, Sosa is on a
pace to beat, and McGwire on a pace to shatter Maris' mark, a
record he held longer than the mighty Babe did.
</P>
<P>
   But it's August now. And Randy Maris knows, ``Dad hit quite a
few home runs at the end of the year.'' He sounds as if he's
certain of the outcome when he says, ``Dad's going to catch up here
pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he's hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his father died, Randy Maris met Mark McGwire at
a baseball card show in Orlando. Randy was shopping for memorabilia
to stock the Roger Maris Museum, which is a 70-foot-long display
case next to a pet shop at the West Acres mall in his father's
hometown of Fargo, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organizer heard who I was and introduced us,'' Randy Maris
said. McGwire, who hit 49 home runs the year before as a rookie for
the Oakland A's, was at a table signing autographs. ``He drops what
he's doing and comes over and shakes my hand ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't remember what we talked about. Real low-key
small talk. But he was a real classy guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire complained two months ago that he felt ``like a
caged animal'' because of the reporters who surrounded him during
batting practice, Randy Maris knew exactly what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's team, the St. Louis Cardinals, responded immediately
by limiting access to the slugger. Among the restrictions: all
pre-game interview requests at home must be arranged in advance;
he's available for 30 minutes starting 3 1/2 hours before the first
game only of each road series; and no live-shot TV interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees never did anything like that for my dad,'' Randy
said. ``He would sit at his locker and there would be throngs of
reporters. Then another wave would come in and they'd ask the same
exact questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Maris said her husband ``was probably the guinea pig with
reporters not knowing what questions to ask. I know it used to
upset him when he'd come to his locker and they'd ask him about
`this' home run. They had such a good team at the time and he felt
like the attention should be going to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a reporter asked Maris how the pressure was affecting his
sex life with his wife. ``You,'' Maris replied, rising from his
stool and pointing at the reporter, ``have exactly 10 seconds to
get out of the clubhouse alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, he blew off an interviewer so he could visit a
child in a hospital. ``The writer slammed him the next day, saying
Dad was `unconscionable' and `inconsiderate.' But when the writer
found out where Dad had been, there wasn't anything in the paper,''
Randy Maris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad was very blunt and he was very honest. The reporters
didn't like that. He was in the New York media market and everybody
wanted Mickey Mantle to break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   After Maris hit No.59, Oliver Keuchle wrote in the Milwaukee
Journal: ``If the record is to be broken, it should be done by
someone with greater stature and public appeal ... Maris is
colorless ... There just isn't anything deeply heroic about the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   That portrayal reflected the thinking of baseball's pro-Ruth
commissioner at the time _ Ford Frick, Ruth's friend and
ghostwriter. On July17, 1961, Frick decided that since the Babe's
record of 60 was set during a 154-game season, Maris would have to
break the record in 154 games _ even though the season had been
expanded that year to 162 games.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling became known as ``the asterisk,'' which was not
removed until 1992. It would symbolize the stigma that would follow
Maris forever.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris and the asterisk became one in the fourth inning of
the last game of the season, when he launched a 2-0 pitch from Red
Sox right-hander Tracy Stallard into Yankee Stadium's right-field
porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran those bases with his head down,'' Randy Maris said.
``Dad didn't want to show up Babe Ruth. He had respect for the
record. He ran straight to the dugout. And when he got there (his
teammates) had to push him out so he could take a curtain call.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Oct.1, 1961. Exactly two years to the day later, Mark
McGwire was born.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris arrived in Gainesville in the fall of 1968. ``I
think it was a Wednesday,'' said retired banker John Jennings Sr.
He was among the first in town to meet the famous Yankee slugger
and his brother Rudy after they had arrived at Gainesville Regional
Airport on the private plane of beer baron August Busch Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As the story passed around town goes, Maris and Busch, who owned
the St. Louis Cardinals, struck an informal bargain during the
Cardinals' clubhouse celebration after their 1967 pennant victory.
</P>
<P>
   Play for the Cardinals one more year, Busch is said to have told
Maris (whom the Yankees had traded to St. Louis after the 1966
season), and I'll give you a beer distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1968, after Maris took his final swing in the
Cardinals' World Series loss to the Detroit Tigers, the owner of
the Tampa distributorship had died. That triggered a domino effect
in Anheuser-Busch's Florida operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of those dominos landed Maris in Gainesville, where the
Maris family still lives in near-anonymity among the thousands of
football fans in Gator country. (Today, the Maris distributorship
remains closed while the family battles Anheuser-Busch in court for
control of it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the quiet town. He could just be Roger,'' said Azey
Stephens, a Fort Lauderdale distributor who worked and golfed with
Maris.
</P>
<P>
   He kept his familiar crew cut. He ran Maris Distributing from a
warehouse. He drove a white Mercedes. In the side pouch of the
front door, he kept a stack of photographs of his 61st home-run
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really hounded for autographs,'' Stephens recalled.
``We would be eating breakfast and people would come up to him and
say, `I saw you hit that home run.' But I never saw him turn anyone
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris Field at Oak Hall, the private school that Maris'
kids attended, was built in 1977 _ thanks to a quiet deal Maris cut
with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Maris held a grudge against the Yankees for the way
he was treated. He rejected annual invitations from the
organization to participate in Old-Timers games at Yankee Stadium.
Not long after Steinbrenner purchased the club, the new owner was
able to persuade Maris to pull on No.9 again. The Yankees retired
his number in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Steinbrenner's name can be found in the school lobby, on
a plaque that says ``$25,000 subscriber.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who didn't return phone calls for this article,
once said, ``To me, Roger Maris was one of the greatest Yankees of
all time. Roger was a most misunderstood young man. In my mind, the
Yankees treated him shabbily.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Gainesville links, Maris is remembered for his deft
play and practical jokes. The one locals talk about most was pulled
on Billy Martin, the late Yankees manager who came to town just
after making headlines for a fight with a marshmallow salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the second tee,'' recalled Paul Costello, a golfing
chum, ``and a guy from the pro shop drives up in a cart. `Package
for you, Mr. Martin.' Billy opens it up ... and it's a bag of
marshmallows!''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs as if the joke has just been pulled. ``Billy chases
Roger all the way down the fairway. Roger fell down laughing and
Billy fell down laughing on top of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``the 61,'' Maris' golfing buddies say they never asked.
Once in a while, Maris would volunteer an anecdote. ``I was
diagnosed with cancer before he was,'' Jennings said. ``And when my
hair started falling out, he said, `My hair fell out, too, once.'''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1983, Maris visited a doctor because of a nagging
sinus problem. It turned out to be lymphoma. After fighting the
cancer with experimental treatments at the M.D. Anderson Hospital
and Tumor Institute in Houston, he spent his final summer at a
house the family owns on a lake outside of Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1985, the same month Maris was buried in Fargo, the
Baseball Dugout opened across the street from the Holiday Inn where
Maris first lived when he came to Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' 1958 rookie card can be bought there today for $425.
That's $315 more than the hottest card on the market _ McGwire's
1987 rookie card. ``Everybody wants the McGwire rookie card because
everyone thinks he's going to break the record,'' said owner Chris
Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while someone will ask for a Maris card. But
most of the college kids here have never heard of him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug.16, 1961, Maris hit his 47th and 48th home runs at Yankee
Stadium. It was Babe Ruth Day to commemorate the 13th anniversary
of Ruth's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Ruth had been at the game,'' Maris recalled in his 1962
book Roger Maris At Bat. ``She had been asked what she thought of
the possibility that Babe's record might be broken. She had been
completely honest when she replied: `I don't want to see it broken.
These are two nice boys and they are Yankees, but I don't want to
see either of them erase the record.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Maris' widow, who met her husband at a high school
basketball game in Fargo, sounded just like him when she said:
``Naturally, records are made to be broken. And I'm sure it's going
to come down to that. You've got some good hitters out there
between McGwire and Griffey and Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've been through this before,'' she continued, alluding
to other failed chases over the last 37 years. ``We've still got a
little bit of time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he died, Roger Maris managed to get into the Baseball
Hall of Fame: He donated the bat and ball that produced home run
No.61. Today they are the only two items representing Maris in
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   When Kevin Maris talks about the chase, he is reminded of
another legendary milestone that fell recently. He was watching TV
that night in 1995 when Cal Ripken Jr. broke the Iron Man record of
2,130 consecutive games played by Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the outpouring of emotion at Camden Yards when the
game was stopped and Ripken walked the grandstand railings during a
22-minute standing ovation, shaking just about every hand in the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to see him appreciated the way Cal
Ripken was ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad brought a lot of fans to the game, just like McGwire
has brought a lot of fans to the game. I mean, even if you don't
like baseball you can't help but watch the home-run race,' said
Kevin Maris, who with brother Richard met McGwire on Saturday in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Dad would have definitely appreciated watching McGwire
go for it. I'll tell you one thing for sure: I know he's up there
watching it right now.''

 &HT;    Don't bet budget surplus on dry farms, lawmakers warn
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ With sales tax revenues soaring, interests are coming
out of the woodwork to spend an unprecedented budget surplus
expected to top $6 billion by the time the Texas Legislature goes
back to work in January.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some lawmakers are warning against moving too quickly to
spend the money in light of a drought they say can dry up the Texas
economy as surely as it is searing Texas farmlands.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged drought is hurting Texas' farming and ranching
industry. President Clinton last week declared the entire state a
disaster area. Sen. Bill Ratliff, chairman of the budget-writing
Senate Finance Committee, said this week he will hold hearings soon
to tally the financial damage. And Agriculture Commissioner Rick
Perry has crisscrossed the state, forecasting losses totaling $4.5
billion that he said could severely hurt Texas' booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas economists say they doubt the drought will
significantly affect the state's $641 billion economy because
agriculture makes up 1 percent of the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the sky is not falling,'' said Bernard Weinstein, director
of the Center for Economic Development at the University of North
Texas. ``Unless it (drought) lasts for several years, it won't have
a significant impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact largely will be felt by farmers and
businesses directly related to agriculture, said Thomas Saving,
director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&AMP;M
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a tractor dealer somewhere in Texas, you're not a
happy camper,'' Saving said. ``You won't even notice it in
Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by a half-dozen other Texas
economists. They said the state's economy is more threatened by the
Asian financial market than the relentless heat and lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about the growth in the '90s is it isn't
tied to a single-sector industry,'' said Jared Hazelton, director
of the Center for Business and Economic Analysis at Texas A&AMP;M
University. ``There is no dominant industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture once played a pivotal role in the state economy.
That changed as Texas shifted from a state reliant on natural
resources _ farming and ranching, forests, oil and gas _ to human
resources. Farming and ranching makes up 1 percent of the Texas
economy this year, according to the Texas Department of Economic
Development, which cited figures developed by the state
comptroller's office. That's down from 2.2 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   When related businesses are accounted for, farming and ranching
account for as much as 7 percent of the Texas economy, according to
the state Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But to hear some politicians tell it, the state economy and the
budget surplus _ if not the sky _ is falling fast in the wake of a
drought that is devastating Texas farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Perry said, ``There is no doubt that the relentless
heat and lack of rain are not only drying up our crops and our
pastureland, it's drying up the Texas economy.''
</P>
<P>
   No relief, he said, could mean no crops. ``If that occurs,'' he
said, ``we've got major, major economic problems all over the State
of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Perry's campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan clarified those
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he (Perry) was referring to was the impact on smaller and
more rural agriculture-heavy communities in Texas as opposed to the
Texas economy as a whole,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he (Perry) was saying is: Should this drought continue
and should agriculture continue to be hard-hit, the smaller more
rural communities in Texas that rely more heavily on agriculture to
keep their local economies going will be hard-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   If political posturing is high on the issue, it is because the
political stakes are equally high.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, earlier
this year lost a key endorsement by the Texas Farm Bureau AgFund to
his Democratic opponent, State Comptroller John Sharp. Beating the
drum for farmers no doubt has boosted Perry's posture with farmers
and with a public that still romanticizes farmers despite their
relatively small numbers. They make up less than 2 percent of the
Texas population.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the projected $6.3 billion surplus Sharp predicted
last month? He based the figure on an estimated $3.7 billion
unanticipated sales tax revenue currently on hand, plus another
$2.6 billion by January.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, on Thursday urged teachers'
organizations, which have designs on the surplus for a pay raise,
and others to put the brakes on spending the unprecedented windfall
in light of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody ought to calm down so far as this idea that
we might have $6 billion,'' Ratliff said. ``I think we ought to see
if whether after the agriculture industry in Texas has a complete
disaster, whether or not the economy of Texas is going spin off
that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and spend the money, economists say. The surplus is
safe because agriculture losses already have been factored into
Sharp's revenue estimates, said Clyde Walter, a spokesman Sharp.
That the Texas economy as a whole won't be significantly rocked by
the 1998 drought does not mean some areas of the state won't
suffer, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas economy is booming, but we have this one segment of
the Texas economy that is going to be facing significant losses
while the rest of the economy is doing very well,'' said Roland
Smith, economist for the Texas Agricultural Extension Office at
Texas A&AMP;M University.

 &HT;    GM strike hit employees harder than area economy
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The most expensive strike in General Motors Corp.'s
history cost the automaker more than $2 billion, slowed the entire
nation's economic output and disrupted the finances for about
200,000 workers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the nearly 4,000 workers at GM's Doraville minivan plant
went without a paycheck for about six weeks, the strike's effect on
metro Atlanta's economy was more like a pothole on a busy highway.
</P>
<P>
   Things are just starting to return to normal. Vehicles have been
in the pipeline to dealerships since GM and the United Auto Workers
settled their disputes last Tuesday. Doraville's administrative
employees and maintenance workers went back on the job the next
morning. Parts will be reaching Doraville on Monday, when the two
shifts of assembly line workers come back to the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, with its epicenter in Flint, Mich., had shock waves
felt nationwide. Parts suppliers laid off workers, GM dealerships
saw their inventory and sales shrink, and suddenly out-of-work
employees had to scrape by on unemployment checks.
</P>
<P>
   But in metro Atlanta, the effect wasn't as pronounced as it was
in other parts of the country. For example, the Doraville assembly
plant doesn't even make the list of the area's top 25 employers.
And only about 10 percent of the metro area's 2 million jobs are in
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to remember is that GM's employment is still a small
part of the portion of (manufacturing in) metro Atlanta,'' said
Roger Tutterow, co-director of Kennesaw State University's
Econometric Center.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the area's economy took a hit. The lost income
from Doraville workers ``cost the area a couple of million dollars
in buying power.''
</P>
<P>
   Local companies said they saw dwindling business but not to an
extreme level.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Knight, manager of Oga's Restaurant on Peachtree
Industrial Boulevard near the Doraville plant, said there was a
slight drop in business, but that it's picked up already since
salaried and maintenance workers began heading back to work last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree Industrial also is lined with car dealerships -- Audi,
Mazda, Ford, as well as three that sell GM cars. Most dealerships
keep a 60- to 90-day supply of vehicles on the lot, and dealership
managers such as Glen Evans of McNamara Pontiac are looking forward
to receiving new cars in about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Many were down to a 20-day supply, with some of the more popular
vehicles in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   The Doraville workers were forced off the job because of a lack
of parts from the striking Flint plants needed to build its
Chevrolet Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette, Pontiac Trans Sport and
Opel Sintra minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Autoworkers like 22-year GM veteran Tina Jackson learned long
ago they need to save money for possible strikes and layoffs. She
said after being laid off in the early '80s, she had to do things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore I'd never be in that condition again; I swore I'd
never be a poor rat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who spent all but this past year of her career in a
three-shift, 380-worker parts plant in Michigan, said she was
prepared this time and spent her time off traveling and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ronald, works for Pillsbury Corp., and together
they support her 10-year-old niece, Amber. Jackson said she spent
$1,600, and ``all the money came from me, (but) my husband wants me
to go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But other workers were hurt financially by the downtime.
</P>
<P>
   George White Jr. almost got evicted from his $680-a-month
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin N. White Sr., no relation, hopes one last unemployment
check will arrive so he can pay his electric bill. He's lost his
cable service and can't repair his broken-down car.
</P>
<P>
   Purvis Patterson spent his time frugally, frequenting the movies
and taking his daughter to Stone Mountain. He had saved some money,
but he was not making any major expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Doraville workers could file for unemployment benefits starting
June 25 with a maximum payment of $224 a week. The Georgia
Department of Labor issued 3,600 checks to union and salaried
employees starting the following week, said department spokesman
Sam Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Even though workers are heading back to work, their financial
problems may not be completely over. GM has challenged benefits
payments. If it wins its case, workers could be forced to repay the
money they received.
</P>
<P>
   and are not part of general tax revenues to the state. Being
back on the job at Doraville also means being back on the job at
other plants supplying parts for GM autos, including several
hundred workers at Johnson Controls' Suwanee car-seat plant.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing -- sending work to other companies, often nonunion,
to save money and increase efficiency -- was a key issue in the
strikes in Flint and is a continuing sore point between the
automaker and the union.

 &HT;    Ernest Holsendolph's Business Commentary: Trust of GM hangs in
balance at Saturn
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It was back in 1983, I think, when I interviewed
Roger Smith, then the boss of General Motors. Or what passed as
boss at GM. Here is what raised some doubts:
</P>
<P>
   I remarked to Smith what a pleasant surprise for General Motors,
to have the splashy success of the sporty little Pontiac Fiero. It
was a wonderful GM story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, isn't it wonderful,'' said Smith. ``I just wish I could
get those guys down at Pontiac to make more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's what he said. In other words, the chairman and chief
executive of General Motors was reduced to pleading with a division
to step up production, but was refused and had to shrug it off.
</P>
<P>
   It was clogged arteries of that kind that persuaded Roger Smith
and others it was time for an experiment, an attempt to show the
world -- and GM management, that there was a way to do business
differently. A way to be a responsive auto manufacturer. And thus
was born the idea of Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which finally took shape in the '90s, has been a
success. Saturn has been ``a different kind of car company,'' as
its marketing slogan suggests. Operating separately from the GM
structure, it has produced a plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., that has
been an American model of management and worker cooperation, with
the workers having a significant say in how things got done.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives and profit-sharing have helped the workers share
financially in the success of the Saturn product.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturn customers like me have fallen in love with the Saturn
style of customer relations -- the no-hassle car purchase, a
careful and caring vehicle service policy, friendly continued
contact with the company, and dealer involvement with the community
and the customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is because a lot of people care about Saturn, almost to the
point of feeling possessive, that made me very interested in labor
troubles that have the small company on the brink of its first
labor strike.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Smith is gone now, and there is evidence elements of the
powerful GM bureaucracy may want to see Saturn brought in from the
warm and friendly world it has created.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps already have intruded on the little Spring Hill
family.
</P>
<P>
   The use of outside components and parts seems to threaten the
job security, part of the fabric of the early Saturn operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer could care less where we get our McPherson struts
or door hinges as long as it doesn't change the buyer's ownership
experience,'' a GM official told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with David Ott, general manager of Saturn of Decatur,
about the changing atmosphere as seen from the dealer's level. Ott,
on Thursday, was just returning from a dedication ceremony for a
youth park his store and Saturn of Southlake had built in the
Edgewood community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, this whole topic was what we talked about
most at the annual dealers' meeting late last month in San
Antonio,'' Ott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a new plant, a second plant, in Wilmington,
Del., and so operations are no longer just in Spring Hill...
</P>
<P>
   ``And yes, some parts will now come from Europe and other places
if such purchases can help us produce quality products at the right
cost. I firmly believe that the new integration of systems will
benefit Saturn and help us be more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   But how will this change affect the Saturn mystique, style and
marketing -- especially if it is accompanied by labor strife?
</P>
<P>
   ``One GM official after another assured us that Saturn remains
General Motors' best hope of change,'' Ott said. ``They let us know
that it would be corporate craziness to turn our backs on the one
thing that is new and has been exciting at General Motors. They let
us know that, in order to protect what Saturn has become, the
company will never become another GM division. It will always be
like a subsidiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Saturn and the customers are concerned, there will
continue to be community projects, Ott said. And those evening
sessions at Saturn of Decatur, where car owners are invited to
spend time in the service shop learning how to do maintenance of
their own and getting to know the experts who care for the cars.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of thing that makes you hope enough civility
remains in the talks between GM and the Saturn UAW to have frank
discussions and an equitable new agreement that restores an element
of trust in Spring Hill. Now that the strike in Michigan has been
settled, GM can focus on Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Trust always seemed to be the pin that held together Saturn, its
production lines, car dealers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is a terrible thing to waste, especially with so much good
will hanging in the balance.

 &HT;    Reynolds' financial reorganization satisfies bankruptcy court
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Burt Reynolds is on his way out of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors for the actor ``still have some terms that we're
arguing over but we're substantially in agreement'' on his plan of
reorganization, their lawyer, Bob Gilbert, said from West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds declared more than $10 million in debts when he filed
for Chapter 11 protection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The plan now goes before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Hyman for
approval at a hearing tentatively set for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Reynolds would be out of bankruptcy protection and could
get on with his life,'' Jim Leshaw, one of Reynolds' lawyers, said
from Miami. ``Mr. Reynolds is very happy that the committee is
supporting the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the proposed plan, creditors would get up to $500,000 of
Reynolds' future earnings over two years, Leshaw said. An earlier
plan had offered $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds will still probably lose his beloved BR Ranch in
Jupiter Farms. His original plan would have given him the option to
keep the 160-acre ranch and tourist attraction for $4.65 million.
In the new plan, should a buyer make an offer, Reynolds would be
allowed to match the sales price. If he couldn't, the ranch would
be sold.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements filed by his lawyers, Reynolds'
financial problems started in the late 1980s when he lost $15
million invested in the Po-Folks. Gross revenues to Burt Reynolds
Productions Inc., which ran $8 million to $12 million a year in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, dropped from $6.2 million in 1992 to
$725,000 in 1995, his lawyers said.

 &HT;    New units will outshine U.S. package delivery at UPS
 &HT;    with UPS lessons
 &HT;    By Cynthia Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As UPS Vice Chairman John Alden likes to put it, unless and
until scientists figure a way to beam packages from place to place,
UPS will surely always deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, the chief of long-term business development says
its U.S. package delivery business -- making up more than 80
percent of UPS' $22.5 billion in revenue -- isn't the key to the
company's future.
</P>
<P>
   That lies in UPS Worldwide Logistics Group, which manages the
so-called supply chain for big manufacturers such as Allied Signal
Corp. and adidas. And its international operations, which now serve
219 foreign airports, are finally profitable after $9 billion in
investment and years of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that so-called e-commerce, such as UPS Document Exchange,
which uses the Internet to transmit securely coded documents. And
UPS is using its links to customers' inventories to step into such
services as financing and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comes from trying to look at where the industry and the
business world are going,'' Alden said. ``The last thing we want in
this business is to become a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the U.S. package delivery business, where margins are
razor thin and archrival Federal Express has merged with
ground-based package service RPS, that's not likely to happen:
</P>
<P>
   -- In a room inside a UPS warehouse in Louisville, Ky., rows of
technicians repair Gateway 2000 computers. Nearby, the computers'
shells are repainted to look new. While UPS rents the space to a
computer repair company, the relationship is part of a deal in
which Gateway customers send their faulty computers straight to
Louisville, and UPS returns them within days. Thanks to such
innovative arrangements, the Logistics Group's revenue reached $598
million last year, and logistics chief Dan DiMaggio projects it
will reach $900 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   -- During the disastrous opening of Hong Kong's new airport July
8, the airport's computer system crashed, but the one running UPS'
new air hub worked fine. While thousands of containers of cargo
stacked up at the airport, UPS diverted planes from the United
States and operated 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The government asked the company to bail out eight to 10 other
airlines that couldn't process their shipments, said international
chief Ron Wallace, who feels sure many of those customers will wind
up sticking with UPS. Since the crisis, UPS' shipments out of Hong
Kong soared 260 percent. In the first quarter, the unit posted
operating profit of $34.5 million, up from a $31 million loss, and
Wallace expects profitability to continue.
</P>
<P>
   -- On the Internet, the UPS Document Exchange will likely
cannibalize its own overnight letter service. But the company
figures it's better to eat oneself than let somebody else do the
eating. Just launched in June, the company says it's too early to
estimate revenues, but tech marketing manager Dave Ladner says the
opportunity is ``enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Meanwhile, UPS' move into financing and insuring companies'
inventories also won't materialize immediately. But Alden said UPS
is currently testing customer acceptance, and next year, the
company will launch initial tests with two major companies, which
it won't disclose.

 &HT;    Critics say UPS hasn't improved in its communications and
relations with workers after Teamsters strike
 &HT;    By Cynthia Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In the year since 185,000 striking Teamsters refused
to sort and deliver truckloads of packages for United Parcel
Service, the company has made its storied ``tightest ship in the
shipping business'' even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   For shareholders, UPS has wrung out every unnecessary dime to
make back the $1 billion in revenue it lost during and after those
15 days last August, posting record profits in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It wooed back its 1.6 million daily business customers with no
less zeal -- calling, visiting, providing incentives, introducing
new services.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those hourly workers? The strikers, whose plea
for more full-time jobs won the battle for public opinion? UPS has
labeled their strike ``irresponsible'' and has told them they need
to put it behind them and focus on customers.
</P>
<P>
   The union that represents those employees? UPS has all but spit
in its eye, continuing to blame former Teamsters President Ron
Carey, who has since been banned forever from the union because of
an illegal campaign financing scheme. And last month, UPS notified
the Teamsters it was moving to nullify its agreement to create
2,000 new full-time jobs this year out of existing part-time
positions, because it's carrying 4 percent fewer packages and now
employs 16,000 fewer people than it did before the strike, some of
whom it says have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, Teamsters once again toted picket signs and yelled
into bullhorns at parking lot rallies across the country, accusing
the company of reneging on its deal. The dispute raises the
question of whether UPS has learned the hardest and most important
lessons from that billion-dollar textbook laid out before it last
summer:
</P>
<P>
   -- That the notorious loyalty of the company's public
ambassadors, those drivers who deliver the packages, isn't as deep
as it once was -- and may not exist at all in the company's growing
part-time ranks.
</P>
<P>
   -- That it can't afford to underestimate the degree to which the
Teamsters have united employees against the company -- and that a
continued rocky relationship with the union may only strengthen
customers' resolve to never again rely on UPS to the degree they
did before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   -- That how the company communicates with all of its
constituents -- from employees to the public -- isn't a side issue,
but plays a critical role in whether UPS achieves all of its
business goals.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in crisis management, communications and labor relations
firmly believe that if UPS had understood those hard-to-face
realities in the year leading up to last summer's contract
deadline, the company would not have had to endure the strike in
the first place. And they believe the company wouldn't still be
battling the Teamsters -- much less in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded. Do they not understand the game that's being
played?'' said Larry Smith, a consultant with Louisville, Ky.-based
International Crisis Management. ``This is not a matter of being a
little bit pregnant. If you've got relationship problems with your
employees or customers, you need to go all the way to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just step back and hope they'll go away,'' Smith
added. ``If you don't mend your fences and repair your
relationships and get those employees feeling good about coming to
work every day, that could come back and bite you big time.''
</P>
<P>
   And repairing those relationships involves ``communication,
communication, communication,'' says Atlanta attorney Howard
Maverty, who advises corporations on how to deal with labor unions.
``If you've got labor relations or employee problems of any sort,
generally you're going to find it was caused by a breakdown in
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way UPS sees it, no major surgery is needed because last
summer's strike didn't reflect any fundamental problems at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people had nothing to do with the strike. Their voice was
never heard. It was caused by the union leadership,'' said UPS
Chairman Jim Kelly in an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   What's happened to Carey since, they argue, just proves he's the
culprit. Within days of the strike's settlement last August,
Carey's re-election as Teamsters president was overturned because
of a scheme to funnel Teamsters money into Carey's own campaign
coffers. The federal election overseer later barred Carey from
running again, and last week Carey was barred from the union for
life. Carey has continued to deny any knowledge of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone back and revisited everything from labor relations,
public relations and communications with our people and
shareholders and (looked at) how well we did everything,'' Kelly
said. ``There's always room for improvement, but given the same set
of circumstances, I don't know what could have been done to prevent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also points to how quickly it's bounced back.
``We're doing as well as we've ever done financially,'' said UPS'
top spokesman, Ken Sternad. ``The first quarter was our best ever,
and there's every reason to believe the second is also very, very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And where are the Teamsters today? Where are they? Who's
running them? What's their balance sheet look like? What are they
doing for their people? What are their lessons learned?'' Sternad
demanded angrily. ``Our lesson learned is we could do a few
cosmetic things PR-wise, which are important to our image. And it
certainly reinforced the value of communicating internally, of our
strong internal communications program -- all those things. Lessons
learned is we made a lot of good decisions for the long-term, best
interest of UPS.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sandy Springs-based delivery giant, the stakes remain
high -- just as they were before last summer's showdown. Like it or
not, the Teamsters represent about two-thirds of its U.S. work
force. Those workers are the muscle behind most of its $22.5
billion a year in annual revenue -- as well as the company's
all-important link to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   And given the pain and money the strike cost customers, they're
likely to be much more easily spooked by any sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to have continual conflict, should I as a
customer use this service?'' asks David Weil, a labor relations
professor at Boston University, who thinks the answer will be no.
``You know what they say -- fool me once, shame on you, fool me
twice, shame on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any effort UPS spends fighting the union takes time
and money away from its hot new growth areas -- logistics services,
international operations and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't concentrate on improving the business and fighting
the union at the same time,'' says Harley Shaiken, a labor
relations professor with the University of California at Berkeley.
``Workers are likely to be less willing to cooperate in any new
endeavor they might want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS also faces two class-action race discrimination suits -- a
sign its employee problems go deeper than its relationship with the
union. One of the cases, a glass ceiling suit filed by black
midlevel managers, has the backing of the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and is headed for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The other case, which claims black hourly workers are harassed
and consistently get the worst assignments, isn't yet certified.
But it's backed by the NAACP, and the media-savvy president of the
Oakland, Calif., chapter has already staged public events to
pillory UPS and air the plaintiffs' claims. At the least, the cases
make it imperative, PR consultants say, that UPS get better at
anticipating and planning for the potential mines that could erupt,
a la Texaco. If it doesn't, the company could find its reputation
once again being chewed up in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   All told, UPS' experience provides lessons in employee
relations, communications and crisis management for companies in
any industry -- unionized or not, making widgets or delivering
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS has been, from start to finish, a case study in what not
to do,'' says Robert Dilenschneider, a communications consultant
for companies that operate in politically charged environments.
</P>
<P>
   To those who understand UPS' history and corporate culture, it's
not surprising the company was caught off guard when the Teamsters
turned up the heat last July.
</P>
<P>
   In the 90 years since founder Jim Casey first started delivering
messages on his bike in Seattle, UPS had built a history of
employee loyalty. The way he saw it, those employees were the
bedrock of the company's success -- and they deserved to be treated
like it. Casey actually invited the union to represent his workers
in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, UPS won favorable and flexible contracts. It got
the green light to start using part-timers in 1962 and didn't have
to raise their starting wage from $8 an hour from 1982 until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Casey also instilled the company with modesty; it didn't even
have much of a marketing department until the 1980s and didn't have
more than a few public relations people on staff until the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So as last year's contract negotiations approached, UPS never
dreamed its drivers -- who made $50,000 a year with another $20,000
in benefits, the best in the industry -- would let the company and
its customers down. It also assumed the part-timers couldn't have
much of a beef, either, given UPS paid them full-time benefits,
including pensions.
</P>
<P>
   And while UPS and the Teamsters often had a testy time at the
negotiating table, they always worked it out. At the worst, the
Teamsters would agree to extend the contract and keep bargaining,
or put it out to a vote, at which point if the membership rejected
it, they'd bargain some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't anticipate a strike,'' said Kelly, who himself had
been at the bargaining table for UPS since 1976. ``There was no
logical reason for one to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   But UPS' view of logic and reason didn't necessarily jibe with
what was going on in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, longtime employees say increasingly stringent time
standards started to take precedence over Casey's golden rule of
how to treat employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I started, I always heard it was a real pro-employee
place to work,'' said Robby Hales, a driver based in Rome since
1986 and one of the few who will let his name be used, since many
fear retribution. ``But as profits went up, I guess they've seen
more chances to make even more profits. Since I started back then,
all I've really seen is immense pressure. ... It don't matter how
much you do or how well you work, it's always never good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many drivers, including Hales, are still proud of
steering UPS' trademark boxy brown trucks and wearing their
starched brown shirts. But now, they say it's got a lot more to do
with serving their customers -- many of whom they consider friends
because of their daily contact-- not any allegiance to the
corporation or its managers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers across Georgia, for instance, have been dismayed about
UPS' strict enforcement of what's known as the ``rural remote''
policy. Rather than deliver a package to a rural area when it
arrived, they were forced to wait a few days to accumulate more of
them, thus making the trip more profitable and cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``l feel like we're cheating the customers,'' said driver Bart
Johnston, whose daily route traverses sparsely populated Eckles
County in South Georgia. He cited several customers whose packages
got pulled from his truck because of the remote policy -- including
a woman waiting on her wedding dress. His loyalty, he said, is
``not to the company; it's to my customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the union is right on the money in arguing UPS' 4
percent volume decline and any resulting layoffs have to do with
the remote policy and pushing workers harder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UPS did more to make it clear it no longer viewed
itself and the unionized employees as being on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, just a year after a major contract negotiation with the
Teamsters, UPS announced it would more than double the weight of
packages the drivers would deliver, to 150 pounds from 70.
Employees felt betrayed; the union was outraged. No way, Carey
argued, did UPS not know of the plan during negotiations. And even
if it was a brand-new idea, he insisted the contract barred UPS
from unilaterally instituting the policy without the Teamsters'
consent.
</P>
<P>
   UPS rushed to federal court and got a restraining order barring
the Teamsters from striking until the issue had been through
arbitration. But Carey called a one-day walkout anyway, persuading
40 percent of the hourly workers to stay home. UPS and the
Teamsters then hammered out policies to minimize the risk of
handling the packages, known as ``over 70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters watchers figure UPS misread the turnout as a sign the
rank and file would never fully support Carey. He'd entered office
in 1991 as the man who would clean up the Teamsters' mob-riddled
past, and had spent three years forcing union locals into
trusteeship, stripping the ``old guard'' of their perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran into a snake pit in terms of the cooperation from the
local unions,'' said Rand Wilson, a Carey campaign volunteer in
Boston who was tapped in 1995 for a key communications post at
union headquarters. ``That really influenced his thinking about how
national negotiations would need to be approached, given the lack
of cooperation he was getting.''
</P>
<P>
   So more than a year before the UPS contract expired July 31,
1997, Carey started appealing straight to the rank and file. And he
figured out how to unite the seemingly disparate needs of full-time
drivers making $50,000 a year and part-time sorters making $8 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematics required it. Since 1962, the percentage of
part-timers in UPS' unionized work force had swelled to about 60
percent. And more than 80 percent of the new unionized jobs created
since the previous contract in 1993 had been part-time positions.
</P>
<P>
   Management needs ``to see that part-timers are informed and
involved as well,'' Carey explained in an October 1996 newsletter.
``They need to see part-timers wearing buttons, passing out
leaflets, coming to meetings and getting organized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters' education staff fanned out across the country,
showing members how to set up communications networks and talk up
the issues. Videos, newsletters and Teamsters magazines featured
UPS part-timers stressing how their issues affected full-timers,
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could start a school on what the Teamsters did right
regarding preparing their membership,'' said John Stamm, a labor
relations professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass.

 &HT;    Wall Street: August makes for a great time to be optimistic
about the market
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- August is to stock market bulls what October is to
bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average hit last year's peak of
8,259.31 in August.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Dow peaked at 2,722.40 in August -- and crashed two
months later.
</P>
<P>
   August 1982 was also important for bulls but for a different
reason.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the longest, strongest super-bull market
in history -- one that shows no sign of ending soon. Market
historians date the super bull from Aug. 12, 1982, when the Dow
closed at 776.92.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed at an all-time high of 9,337.97 just two weeks
ago. That's an increase of 1,102 percent since August 1982 for the
benchmark index by which most people track stock market trends.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Nasdaq composite of technology and smaller stocks
rose 1,166 percent from August 1982 to its recent high, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 1,059 percent and the Russell 2000
small-cap index 715 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers usually trigger the ``if only'' syndrome in
investors -- ``if only'' I had bought shares of Coca-Cola or Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   If you had, your shares (adjusted for subsequent splits) would
have risen 5,452 percent and 26,072 percent, respectively, between
August 1982 and Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The market had dropped to an August low in 1982 in response to
the deepest U.S. recession since the 1930s, accompanied for a time
by the highest inflation rates in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But the recession, engineered by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, broke the back of inflation, since which prices have
trended lower in a global pattern economists believe will continue
well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The byproduct of falling inflation and falling interest rates,
which accompanied it, has been rising corporate profits and the
almost exponential rise in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these trend lines have had their peaks and valleys
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The market suffered its shortest bear market ever in October
1987, when stocks crashed for reasons historians are still
debating.
</P>
<P>
   The next bear market occurred in the summer and early fall of
1990, exacerbated but not caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The
economy also dipped into a recession in 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts date the current bull market in stocks from 1990
and the latest expansion in the economy from 1991. Neither the bull
market nor the economy has suffered a serious setback since,
although the S&AMP;P 500 declined 1.5 percent in 1994 when the Fed
raised interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the economy, the government announced Friday that, Asia
and General Motors to the contrary, gross domestic product expanded
in the second quarter by a bigger-than-expected 1.4 percent annual
rate. Some analysts had anticipated a decline.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no mainstream analyst thinks either the bull market or
the economy will suffer anything more than routine corrections or
slumps over the next several years, conditions being what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this long-range optimism is based on factors such as the
large-scale adoption of computer technology, downsizing and other
business restructuring that improved productivity, and the surge of
investment by aging baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody suggests something catastrophic couldn't happen that
would upset all of these upbeat scenarios. But that's always
possible.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it might be a good idea to keep an eye out for
the next asteroid.

there was a way to do business differently. A way to be a
responsive auto manufacturer. And thus was born the idea of Saturn.

   UPS-LESSONS _ ATLANTA -- For shareholders, UPS has wrung out
every unnecessary dime to make back the $1 billion in revenue it
lost during and after those 15 days last August, posting record
profits in the first quarter. But what about those hourly workers?
The strikers, whose plea for more full-time jobs won the battle for

has told them they need to put it behind them and focus on
customers. (Mitchell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Peter Raven jumps up from the conference table at
midsentence and disappears out the door, returning loaded down with
a stack of fat books. He picks up the conversation as though he
never left.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my babies,'' he says, patting the latest volumes in
``The Flora of China'' and ``The Flora of North America'' series
chronicling ``survivors and new species.''
</P>
<P>
   While Raven, botanist, evolutionary biologist and director of
the Missouri Botanical Garden, has not been out there picking all
the daisies himself, his ``biopoliticking'' and networking lurk
behind the collaborative projects to catalog and understand plants
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The same biopoliticking behind the ``Flora'' series surfaced
last month with the announcement that the Missouri Botanical
Garden, Washington University, the University of Missouri and
Monsanto Co. would be partners in a new $146 million Donald
Danforth Plant Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say it will be the largest plant science center in
the world and turn St. Louis _ already renowned among botanists
because of the garden _ into an agricultural Silicon Valley when it
opens in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specialize in networking,'' Raven said. ``There is an
enormous kind of pleasure in working with people, helping them to
realize what they want to do. I like to link people.'' Jonathan
Kleinbard, a former University of Chicago vice president who
recently became the garden's deputy director, said his boss ``likes
to have 27 balls in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1971, when he left an associate professorship at Stanford
University with no more administrative experience than ``part-time
access'' to a secretary, Raven has turned a rather scuffy patch of
real estate in a decaying urban neighborhood into an international
center of biodiversity research and activism, a community magnet
and one of the nation's four largest herbariums.
</P>
<P>
   And, he quickly added, the fastest expanding collection in the
world, with 120,000 specimens added each year and at least a dozen
staff taxonomists collecting somewhere in the world at any given
time.
</P>
<P>
   When Raven arrived at the garden as a 35-year-old Californian
with no particular plan in mind, he found 85 employees and a budget
of $650,000. Today, he directs a staff of 354, including 55
researchers with Ph.D.s, and oversees a budget of $20 million. The
New York Botanical Garden, by comparison, has a staff of about 100,
including 30 Ph.D.s. Recently, the Missouri garden opened an $8.6
million research center, housing a 122,000-volume library, nearly 5
million herbarium specimens and the TROPICOS database _
http://mobot.mobot.org/Pick/Search/pick.html, which averages over
one million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   Known locally as Shaw's Garden, the place was created in 1859 by
Henry Shaw, a major landowner who made his fortune selling goods to
traders and pioneers headed west. An amateur botanist, Shaw worked
with George Engleman, a physician and botanist, to create a center
for education, research and horticultural display. Shaw also
endowed a school of botany at Washington University, a link between
garden and university that continues today with the director
holding a tenured seat on the faculty, teaching graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '20s, the garden had built a national reputation
for research and training, but by the time Raven arrived it was, as
he describes it, ``like an art museum with exhibits only in a few
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 acres were laid out in gardens _ most of the 79 acres
Shaw had set aside still looked like the treeless prairie it once
was. Raven set to work not only gardening but also building
support. A 1982 election gave the garden access to property tax
revenues, which now make up 28.9 percent of the budget. An
additional 30.4 percent comes from contributions, bequests and
memberships, now over 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over 250,000 people visit the garden each year, wandering
through the living rain forest, feeding giant carp at the fall
festival in the Japanese Garden, strolling through the Victorian
Garden or the Rock Garden or the English Woodland Garden or simply
admiring sculpture, tucked in everywhere, by Alexander Calder,
Henry Moore, Carl Milles or Frank Stella. Gardeners get tips; jazz
and gospel fans come to concerts. Children troop through on class
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Raven never misses a beat on getting people involved _ in St.
Louis and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Candide, he is not content to cultivate his own
garden. He travels the world _ Washington, Australia, India, China,
the Vatican are ticketed these days _ not to collect plants but to
stir others to action, build human networks and promote
biodiversity in the face of development. He makes speeches, lobbies
politicians and corporate leaders, puts scientists together with
research projects.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, he has been grand marshal of the Veiled Prophet Parade,
a St. Louis institution for some 120 years, and served on the
University of Missouri board of curators. When he was inducted into
the St. Louis Walk of Fame two years ago, he joined Henry Shaw,
Ulysses S. Grant, Josephine Baker, and Stan Musial as famous folk
with roots or other important links to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is any doubt of his local commitment, Raven says
``Missour-ah'' instead of ``Missour-ee.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   On the national level he serves as home secretary of the
National Academy of Sciences, chairman of the report review
committee of the National Research Council, and member of the
committee for research and exploration of the National Geographic
Society. He also serves on the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology and this year chaired a While House panel on
environmental and economic strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Raven has been a National Science Foundation fellow, a
Guggenheim Fellow , a MacArthur Fellow, belongs to academies of
science in more countries than Thomas Cook has tours , headed the
Botanical Society of America, the Society for the Study of
Evolution, the American Society of Naturalists, the American
Institute of Biological Sciences and then some. He has written 18
books and more than 450 articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the type of personality that likes to be interrupted
constantly,'' he said. ``I like a lot of things in play. I get
rejuvenated by noise and interruptions and have a great power of
recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Raven, born in Shanghai in 1936 into a family of American
bankers, counts as ancestors Mayflower pilgrims and a British
Redcoat, but the strongest DNA may come from the his maternal
grandfather's grandfather: Patrick Breen, who arrived in California
in 1847 after spending the winter snowbound with the Donner Party
in the Sierra Nevada . Of the 87 pioneers, only 46 survived,
including all 9 of the Breens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 62, Raven is doing what he began doing at age 6:
exploring nature. An only child, he read a book on insects when he
was sick in bed and then began growing caterpillars into
butterflies. That led to exploring vacant lots around San Francisco
in search of plant specimens. At 8, he became the youngest member
of the California Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   By 10, he was comparing field notes with Alice Eastwood, the
grand old lady of California botany, then 90. At 12, he joined the
Sierra Club and ended up sharing a tent with Ledyard Stebbins, who
has been called one of the foremost plant evolutionary biologists
of the century. At 16, he discovered a Clarkia franciscana, a
member of the evening primrose, which had not been seen in Marin
County since 1900; a subspecies, Dr. Ravenii, was later named in
his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly surprising, he chose academic studies in botany,
graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California at
Berkeley and obtaining a PhD from the University of California at
Los Angeles. He was networking even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a graduate student,'' he said, ``I had 15 other graduate
students working on the evening primrose. They said I was the only
graduate student to have graduate students.''
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, after a postdoctoral fellowship, he began looking
beyond botany toward evolution and biodiversity. He and a
colleague, Dr. Paul Ehrlich, came up with a theory of co-evolution,
a process in which species change as the species they interact with
change. But they also became increasingly worried about what was
going on in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began thinking about population,'' said Raven. ``In the
late '60s, we became concerned about plant extinction. We began to
put it all together. The real problem was that the kinds of things
we liked to study were disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he started worrying about how many more species were
disappearing than being created and about what was happening to the
rain forest before botanists had even started to find out what was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ticktock, ticktock. At the Garden's Climatron, a flashing
electronic bank counts down the disappearing acres of rain forest
second by second. Raven also frets about topsoil, the ozone layer,
skin cancer, cutting down forests without replacing them,
industrial wastes, global warming. His warnings often have him
labeled a pessimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1990s and the first few decades of the 21st century are
likely to be the most tumultuous and destructive of the natural
resources of our planet that we may ever face,'' he has written.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can either decide to be conservative in dealing with
biodiversity _ such species are of such fundamental importance to
us, and their loss is absolute and irreversible _ or we can
recklessly conclude, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that
what we are destroying is not important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone likes the strategies he chooses to try to save
ecological systems. He bets on multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it,'' Raven said, ``multinational corporations
are one of the best vehicles to achieve global sustainability.
Unlike governments, which can pretend there is no global warming
because they can live from election to election, the corporations
can't live in fantasy. They have to return value to shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the garden have been criticized by various groups for
working with corporations, particularly Monsanto, which is based in
St. Louis. The garden's new research center is named the Monsanto
Center and Monsanto is a major donor in the new plant science
center, which will explore genetic engineering, leading to
commercial applications.
</P>
<P>
   Raven dismissed such criticism as he spewed out numbers of
things that were disappearing, never to be replaced. A man with a
cause, he can wear out board directors, committee members,
politicians, academics and critics with his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is after Pope John Paul II. Raven will be going to Rome
three times in the next six months in an effort to persuade the
pope to join his crusade, and he plans to push hard for the concept
of ``sustainability,'' or preservation the earth's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get the pope to put sustainability higher on his
agenda, present it as a world problem,'' Raven said as though
talking to himself, ``then I would be very successful and happy.''

CHILDREN AND CAFFEINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   By JOHN O'NEIL (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in this Starbucks-crazed age, children are not big coffee
drinkers. But they do consume a surprising amount of caffeine, in
carbonated sodas and chocolate drinks _ and, a new study reports,
suffer the same symptoms of caffeine withdrawal as adults do.
</P>
<P>
   For the study, whose results are published in this month's issue
of the Journal of the American Academy of Child Adolescent
Psychiatry, researchers focused on decreased attention span, a
symptom of caffeine withdrawal. Led by Dr. Gail A. Bernstein of the
University of Minnesota Medical School, a team of psychiatrists
looked at 30 healthy school-age children who were given four sets
of response-time assessment tests over the course of a month.
</P>
<P>
   The first session established the young subjects' performance on
their regular diet of caffeinated beverages. Next, their caffeine
intake was increased to the equivalent of three cans of cola a day,
twice the average caffeine consumption for American children, and
they were retested a week later.
</P>
<P>
   For the third test, the subjects went cold turkey for a day,
then returned to their regular diet for a week before the final
session.
</P>
<P>
   The students' performance plummeted on cold-turkey day _ and a
week later, there had been little improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to prevent this phenomenon,'' wrote the
researchers, ``is to have children avoid consuming high levels of
caffeinated beverages.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will bring parts of drought-stricken north Texas
the first chance for showers in over a month Tuesday. However,
scorching heat and dryness will plague most of central and southern
Texas and interior Louisiana for at least one more day until the
cold front and the chance for clouds and rain shift farther
southeast. Additional showers and thunderstorms will precede the
cold front northward into Missouri. Some of the thunderstorms will
be strong to severe with damaging winds. Ample clouds, showers and
embedded thunder will surround low pressure from northern Indiana
to western South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a persistent ridge of high pressure will provide
partly to mostly sunny skies and comfortable humidity levels from
Maine to Alabama. The exception will be the Southeast seaboard,
where low pressure will affect coastal areas with isolated showers.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will develop again ahead of an unusually tenacious
cold front in central and south Florida, though northern Florida
will be mainly dry with lower than seasonable humidity levels. The
leading edge of the afternoon sea breeze will ignite a few showers
along the central Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, thunderstorms will percolate in the Rockies from
Wyoming to New Mexico, while interior regions farther west will
remain drier than they have been recently as the monsoon
circulation temporarily halts. The Pacific Northwest will continue
to be uncharacteristically hot and dry with the reception of
increased clouds along the coast. Interior California and the
deserts of the southwest will also be blistering hot.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Montana Downpour
</P>
<P>
   Downpours dumped 1.2 inches of rain at Billings, Montana, on
Sunday, marking the town's greatest single-day rainfall in over a
year. The availability of moisture in Billings is limited, given
that the Rockies west of the city provide a barrier against Pacific
moisture and that humid air from the distant Gulf of Mexico is
seldom able to reach Montana. On Sunday, a sluggish low pressure
system inched across the state. In turn, Gulf moisture had time to
circulate from the Plains into Montana. With destabilizing cold air
aloft, heavy storms erupted, bringing a month's worth of rain in a
day.

SEATTLE MUSEUM IS SUED FOR A LOOTED MATISSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heirs of Paul Rosenberg, a prominent Jewish art dealer who
fled Paris for the United States during World War II, have filed
suit in U.S. District Court against the Seattle Art Museum to
recover a Matisse painting that was confiscated by the Nazis in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, the first against an American museum over art
stolen by the Nazis from a Jewish family, provides an inkling of
how complicated it may be to unravel such claims, which are just
now surfacing more than a half-century after the war. The museum,
which said it was still researching the Rosenbergs' claim,
essentially asked the family to sue so that it could reach a
comprehensive settlement that would include Knoedler &AMP; Co., the
Manhattan art dealer, which purchased the painting in Paris in
1954, said the Rosenbergs' lawyer, Laura Hoguet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provided the museum with proof that it was stolen from Paul
Rosenberg, and they never told us any reason why that was not
correct, but they concluded that they could not do anything without
a legal proceeding,'' Ms. Hoguet said. The suit was filed late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John Reed, the museum's lawyer, said in a statement that the
museum had hoped for mediation of the dispute. ``Since a settlement
was not possible,'' he said, ``the museum is pleased that this
matter is now at issue so that the rightful owner of the painting
can be determined and the relative rights and obligations of the
parties, including the Knoedler Gallery, can be decided in one
forum.''
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of the painting, ``Odalisque,'' were unknown to
the Rosenbergs until last summer, when a grandchild of the couple
who donated it to the museum in 1996, Virginia and Prentice
Bloedel, a founder of the Canadian timber giant MacMillan Bloedel
Ltd., recognized it in ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to
Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art'' by Hector Feliciano. The
Bloedels, now deceased, had bought ``Odalisque'' in 1954 from
Knoedler.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Bloedel Wright, their daughter, who is a trustee of the
museum, notified the Rosenbergs. They filed a legal demand for the
painting last October, which was rejected by the museum on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for the Seattle Art Museum's forcing
the Rosenberg family to incur the expense and delay of bringing a
lawsuit,'' said Elaine Rosenberg, the widow of Paul Rosenberg's
son, Alexandre.
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano, who had traced the painting's provenance for his
book, was also mystified by the museum's action. ``This is a very,
very solid claim where you have documents all the way through from
the 1930s through the 1960s showing that the painting belonged to
the Rosenbergs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing guidelines adopted in June by the Association of Art
Museum Directors, in which members pledged to resolve claims
quickly, Feliciano said, ``I believe that if the Seattle Art Museum
applies to the letter all the guidelines of the AAMD, this claim
should be solved very quickly.''

BLACKS, WHO ONCE DOMINATED RACING, GAIN RECOGNITION AT HALL OF
FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GOTTLIEB  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ From the first Kentucky Derby in 1875
through 1911, black jockeys dominated. Winning trainers were black
and, like the riders, some learned the job as slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there aren't more than a handful of African-American
jockeys, trainers or horse owners in professional racing. Centuries
of dominance were snuffed out by racism and economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Observers see no new surge of interest among African Americans
on the horizon. But history is taking note of the early champion
jockeys and trainers. On Aug. 10, the National Racing Hall of Fame
will induct Ansel Williamson, an ex-slave who trained the first
Kentucky Derby winner in 1875 and in 1873 the winner of Saratoga's
Travers. The honor comes as writers and museums recognize blacks in
horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary story of athletes who dominated
America's first sport and were totally forgotten and written out of
history,'' said Edward Hotaling, who will soon publish his second
racing book, ``The Great Black Jockeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, a towering man known as ``Old Anse,'' trained
Aristides, the horse that won the first Kentucky Derby. The horse
was ridden by Oliver Lewis, who like 13 of the 15 riders was black.
Black jockeys clenched 15 of the Derby's first 28 runnings. They
dominated because they lived on the farms where they cared for
horses, and often started racing when they were 11 years old and
slightly built. In the 18th and 19th centuries, racing had a bad
reputation and once it became a status sport, whites wanted in,
said Lynn Rinau, a Kentucky author of two books on racing.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Williamson's personal life were never recorded, but
the Racing Musem said he was born around 1806 in Virginia and his
training career dates to the 1850s. He was owned by several people
before being freed by R.A. Alexander in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson trained the unbeaten Norfolk, who won the first
American event called a derby, held in New Jersey in 1864. He
worked for H.P. McGrath, training the horse known as Tom Bowling,
which won the Travers. In 1875 he trained Aristides, the first
Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a judge of horses he had very few superiors,'' read
Williamson's 1881 obituary. ``His conclusions were drawn from long
experience and were delivered with a quaintness of expression and a
brevity of style which pleased while it instructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinau said blacks were adept riders well before slave ships
brought them to America. In West Africa, they were known as strong
riders, racers and warriors atop nimble Arab horses. By 1700, elite
slaves in the South earned respect from their masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South was a gambling population and they bet heavily,''
Rinau said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who distinguished themselves landed on the front page of
the newspaper and some traveled freely. They were also some of the
best-paid American athletes. Still there were not more than 100
slave jockeys, and the glory could be short lived. ``When they
died, they buried them where they fell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, blacks stayed with the sport they were
familiar with. Isaac B. Murphy was the leading rider in 1894. Jimmy
Winkfield won the Derby in 1901 and 1902 and had a lucrative racing
career in Europe. Willie Simms won the Derby in 1896 and 1898, and
won each Triple Crown event.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the century, racism forced blacks out.
Sometimes, Rinau said, they were literally nudged off their horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had the Ku Klux Klan setting the tone and it was a pretty
horrible one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blacks increasingly moved north. Today, their
participation is small. Troy Lively is a successful steeplechase
rider out of Maryland, and Hank Allen is a long-tenured horse
trainer. Well-known black horse owners include Bery Gordy and rap
star Stanley Burrell, known as ``Hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Anse Williamson is the fourth black in the Racing Hall of
Fame and the first trainer.

STRAIGHT DROP RAISES SENSES TO THEIR PEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETTS, Calif. _ Some people get dizzy atop the Sierra Buttes.
Some get nervous, and others seem euphoric. It's the thrill that
makes this one of the best short hikes anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Perched atop the buttes, at 8,587 feet, there is a lookout
station that seems to float on air. It is set on such a small
pinnacle that it seems there is nothing but empty space below the
meshed-grate metal deck. At one spot, if you look straight down,
past your boots and through the grate, it can seem that directly
under you is a straight drop of about 1,000 feet of nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   I looked down, my heart raced and, hey, it was pointed out to me
that my jaw had dropped like an egg from a long-legged chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Buttes is located at the southern edge of the Lakes
Basin Recreation Area, about an hour northwest of Reno, Nev., one
of the Sierra Nevada's prettiest areas, and also one of the best
for summer vacations and camping, hiking, biking and fishing. It is
the Buttes that loom over it all, a series of stunning granite
spires, with an excellent trail right to the top.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the summit requires a 2.5-mile hike with a 1,700-foot
climb, with well-placed switchbacks to keep it from degenerating
into a wheezer of a buttkicker. You park at the Packer Saddle
Trailhead, which also serves as a trailhead for the Pacific Crest
Trail. The trailhead is located near Packer Lake (take the left
fork), with a good road in that even a minivan can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The hike climbs right off, at first gradually, then more steeply
but amid shade in forest. After a short respite at a mountain
terrace, it then climbs the last 700 feet elevation gain more
steeply, but with switchbacks all the way. Finally you emerge above
forest and approach the craggy spires. It takes most well under two
hours to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the sensations start. To reach the lookout requires
climbing three sets of metal stairs, two which jut out over open
space, and then finally to the lookout itself. It is positioned
atop the highest crag, on a tiny point of a rock, and it can feel
as if you are surrounded by free-fall on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The views, of course, extend for miles across the Sierra,
directly below to the Sardine Lakes, across to Volcano Lake,
northeast over the Gold Lakes Basin, to the south to French Meadows
Reservoir and beyond to Grouse Ridge and the Sierra crest. It can
make you want to explore the area for weeks to find all of these
revealed spots.
</P>
<P>
   But what really can get to you is that sensation of nothing but
air beneath your feet. I found myself walking scared, holding the
railing with a lock-grip, peeking looks straight down, with every
sense electrified. For anybody who loves to explore and walk, this
one is an absolute must-do.

BODYGUARD OF CONVICTED CARRIAGE OPERATOR CHARGED WITH PERJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM JACKMAN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The bodyguard of a convicted carriage
operator was charged Friday with perjury after investigators
accused him of creating a new identity and lying on the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The charge raised new questions about M.J. L'Donna'sconviction
last month on murder-for-hire charges, as well as the conviction
last year of five Kansas Citians for causing the 1988 explosion
that killed six firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, prosecutors said Friday, Thomas E. Butner took
the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   But in L'Donna's trial, Butner, 27, identified himself as Shawn
P. Butner. Prosecutors allege more perjury occurred in the L'Donna
trial, when they say Butner denied testifying or receiving payment
in the firefighters case. Defense lawyers had asked him about that
case to attack his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Court transcripts, however, show Butner did testify and
prosecutors said he was paid for his testimony in the firefighters'
case.
</P>
<P>
   L'Donna's lawyer, David L. Owen Jr., said Friday that he would
file a motion for a new trial in her case, based on the charge
against Butner. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said,
``I am proud of the fact we are coming forward with this
information. Rather than wait to see if it comes out randomly,
we're coming forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said L'Donna's guilty verdict should stand. ``We
believe that this is not a basis for a new trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butner was arrested Thursday afternoon by Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents and made his first court appearance
Friday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge John T. Maughmer. He
said very little, and Maughmer ordered him held without bond
pending a detention hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Butner declined to answer questions as he left the hearing in
handcuffs and leg shackles. ``I got nothing to say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the five defendants convicted last year of causing
the 1988 explosion that killed six firefighters watched Friday's
developments with interest. Butner and his sister, Cindy Butner,
testified in that case, and the defense lawyers said they would
consider using it in their appeal, which already is pending.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Osgood, attorney for convicted defendant Richard Brown,
said, ``This is characteristic of the type of witnesses, across the
board, that testified against Mr. Brown and his co-defendants.
Nothing that is revealed about these people would surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Robert Switzer, Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms special agent in charge, was asked how the bureau, which
handled both the firefighters and the L'Donna cases, couldn't
notice that the same man was testifying under different names. He
said the only federal agent who dealt with Butner on the
firefighters case was David True, who retired last spring, and
different prosecutors handled the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this before,'' Switzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn'' Butner testified that it was his brother, Tom, who had
testified in the firefighters' case. In February 1997, Tom Butner
testified that Richard Brown had repeatedly confessed his
involvement in the 1988 explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on the witness stand last year why he came forward in the
firefighters' case, Butner said: ``If I do something wrong, I pay
the crime. If they did it, why shouldn't they pay the crime?''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the same man apparently took the witness stand
again, claiming that L'Donna wanted him to kill a carriage
competitor and then her boyfriend. Instead, Butner approached the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and agreed to wear a hidden
microphone and tape his conversations with L'Donna.
</P>
<P>
   Those tapes became the crux of the case against L'Donna. A jury
convicted her on July 16 of providing Butner with a gun to be used
for murder and using a phone to arrange a murder.
</P>
<P>
   L'Donna is being held in a private jail at Leavenworth and could
not be reached for comment. But in a recent letter to The Kansas
City Star she continued to maintain her innocence as well as attack
Butner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a conspiracy,'' L'Donna wrote, ``between ATF, my
business competition and Shawn Butner, mobile phone records proved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She also criticized his testimony that he made money as a
``street fighter.'' She said that claim ``fell in the lies along
with (his claim) he had four wives and eight children.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Goodale, another carriage operator who a target of the
alleged murder plot, said Friday that ``she's still guilty. ... You
know, he could have said his name was Joe Blow or anybody. It
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hill and Switzer said the government moved quickly to
investigate Butner once it found out his alleged ruse. They said
the tip was e-mailed to the ATF's Web site in Washington on July
18.
</P>
<P>
   The task of investigating Butner's identity fell to Agent Ronald
W. Getty, who had handled Butner from the time he approached the
bureau in January, and wired him for sound before Butner's meetings
with L'Donna.
</P>
<P>
   According to Getty's affidavit in federal court, he found that
Shawn P. Butner, born in January 1969, lives in Denver and is a
cousin of Tom Butner. Shawn Butner said he hadn't seen his cousin
in many years and wouldn't recognize him.
</P>
<P>
   But Shawn Butner of Denver reportedly told ATF investigators
that another cousin visited his family about four years ago, and
some items turned up missing, including a list of all the family's
birth dates and Social Security numbers. Shawn Butner told the ATF
when he applied for a car loan earlier this year, he found his
Social Security number had been used in Missouri to run up credit
card debt of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Getty also found that another Shawn Butner obtained both a
Missouri and a Kansas driver's license in the winter of 1997, not
long after Tom Butner's testimony in the firefighters case. MORE

   As an artist about to leave on a long trip to Italy, I called a
storage company to have someone pack the artwork in my studio. The
packer arrived the next day with stacks of flattened cardboard and
balls of twine. I went back to my easel as he began unfolding the
pieces of cardboard and fitting them to the paintings, tying and
securing. From time to time I watched as he made one neat package
after another, thinking to myself, ``What a monotonous job day
after day.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, we took a coffee break and he asked me if I was a
painter, either oblivious to what he was packing, or just to make
conversation. I admitted I was, and this provoked a thoughtful
silence. Then he said, ``Do you do this every day?'' I said I did
indeed. Another silence. Then in a sympathetic voice he said, ``It
must be boring.''

a volume of poetry by Gerard Manley Hopkins. As the salesclerk rang
up the purchase, she said briskly, ``That comes to $10.66.''
</P>
<P>
   Without thinking, he replied, ``The year of the Norman
invasion,'' and was given a blank stare in return.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain himself, he said, ``You know, the year the
Normans invaded England, William the Conqueror and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blank stare. But as Garcia handed over his money, the
young clerk looked up, somewhat awestruck, and said, ``Wow, can you
do that with any number?''

   John Schiff was jogging in Central Park, wearing his Nolan Ryan
T-shirt with a picture of the retired pitcher on the front and
facts of his career on the back. As he jogged along, he realized
someone was pacing behind him. After three minutes or so, the man
behind him put on speed and called out as he passed: ``Thanks for
the information. Good reading.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Grand Opera Company has been giving free Wednesday
evening performances at Central Park's ``Summerstage'' for more
than two decades. Vincent La Selva, the artistic director, answers
the telephone himself in the company's small office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he began keeping a record of some of the telephone
queries put to him on performance days:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you people intend to do about the weather?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go to the free opera in Central Park. How much
does it cost?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If admission is free, do I get a refund in case of rain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a special cast in case of rain or is it the same
one listed in the newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At what time will you know if it's raining or not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the performance starts at 7:30, what time does the
conductor come in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Stiffelio' is postponed because of rain, does it change to
`Rigoletto'?''
</P>
<P>
   During an afternoon rush hour, a man boarded the A train at the
World Trade Center. ``Attention, ladies and gentlemen,'' he
intoned, his voice piercing the humid air of the subway car,
``Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The man standing in front of Adam Cohen didn't have to think
twice. He turned to his companion and said, ``I hope he's not
waiting for a train, or he's going to be late.''
</P>
<P>
   As good a definition as any: H.D. Causbie overheard an obviously
relaxed diner addressing a companion at the Boat Basin Cafe: ``This

   At 71, I sit down on a bus seat with a sign giving priority to
elderly riders and notice I'm seated next to a younger couple.
Enter a woman my age and the man of the couple immediately gets up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, aren't you nice,'' the woman says, and sits down next to
me.
</P>
<P>
   The man who stood up says, ``Well, that's one advantage of being
elderly.'' The woman my age nods her head.
</P>
<P>
   The young man follows with ``But there must be others.''
</P>
<P>
   I break in and say loudly, ``No, that's about it.'' The whole
front of the bus breaks into laughter.

   Craig and Nancy Sobocinski were shopping for mattresses with
their 3-year-old son, Alec. The hours went by, the number of stores
visited increased and Alec became restless.
</P>
<P>
   As he was wandering through the last store, a young salesperson
invited him to try an adjustable bed. He climbed up, and she
proceeded to show him how the control pad lowered and raised the
bed, and even made it vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   Alec was unimpressed. ``Can you make it fly?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   It was New Year's Eve, and West Moss was in a fancy hair salon,
getting her hair styled professionally for the first time. She was
nervous, and not certain that she would be able to explain what she
wanted to the stylist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like my hair like Mary Tyler Moore,'' she said shyly.
Which Mary Tyler Moore, he wanted to know _ ``Laura Petrie or Mary
Richards?''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, returning to the same salon, she asked for the
same stylist. He didn't recognize her but she felt a surge of
warmth when he came over and asked what she'd like. ``Audrey
Hepburn,'' she said. ``Holly Golightly or Sabrina?'' he replied.

<P>
   William D. Harney telephoned to make a grooming appointment for
his French bulldog. He was asked for his name. ``Bill,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``And your dog's name?'' ``Simon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice at the other end sounded surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest thing,'' it said. ``The call before yours was
also to groom a French bulldog _ but the man's name was Simon, and
his dog's name was Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia E. Noonan, walking along Madison Avenue with a friend,
encountered what must be the city's most enterprising panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, ladies,'' he chirped. ``Have you any spare credit cards?''
</P>
<P>
   While I was living in Manhattan and on my way to the Museum of
Natural History, an approaching pedestrian and I simultaneously
spotted a $10 bill on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The man, closer to the bill than I was, picked it up and put it
in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   As we passed, he handed me a five! What a town!

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ the firefighters case.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit states that Getty then took the fingerprints of
Shawn Butner and Tom Butner to a police fingerprint examiner. The
prints matched, the affidavit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Hill acknowledged that Butner had been paid for his testimony in
both cases. He would not say how much Butner received for his
participation in the firefighters case.
</P>
<P>
   In the L'Donna case, court records showed Butner was paid
$4,116.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, defense attorney Owen tried to attack Butner's
credibility by alleging that Butner had claimed to have testified
in the firefighters' case, when he hadn't. When Butner denied
participating in that case, Owen argued to the jury that Butner
learned from his ``brother Tom,'' how to make money by testifying _
by approaching the ATF, rather than Kansas City police.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Owen asked Butner, ``Did you know the ATF
paid for testimony from witnesses?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Butner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did Tom and Cindy (Butner, his sister) get paid (for
their firefighters testimony)?'' Owen asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Butner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever tell anyone you testified in the firefighters
case?'' Owen asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not,'' Butner replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever tell anyone you turned in the people responsible
for the firefighters case?'' Owen asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Butner said, then added, ``only Don Crumpley,'' a
co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't tell him you had been paid?'' Owen asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Butner said.
</P>
<P>
   Crumpley later testified that Butner told him he had been paid
for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Butner spent much of his time on the witness stand listening to
the tapes he secretly made of his talks with L'Donna, and
explaining the background and context of each conversation. The
tapes appear to show L'Donna agreeing to pay Butner $5,000 to kill
her boyfriend, John Encell.
</P>
<P>
   But L'Donna's comments were somewhat guarded, and never
explicitly direct Butner to commit murder. She did hand Butner a
loaded pistol during one meeting and she paid him $500 cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the firefighters case, Butner admitted on the witness stand
that he offered to wear a secret recorder in 1995 to capture
Richard Brown making admissions. Police and ATF agents declined
Butner's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Getty said he was disappointed with Butner's apparent
identity change. He said Butner reportedly obtained new driver's
licenses after being named on warrants in Clay County.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County Sheriff Bob Boydston confirmed Friday that Thomas
Butner is wanted for a January 1997 moving violation and for
leaving the scene of an accident. Shawn Butner has no criminal
record, authorities said.

TOBACCO'S REACTION TO RULING ON SECOND-HAND SMOKE NO MORE THAN
LUKEWARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Tobacco industry advocates and smoker's rights
activists have greeted the latest challenge to the second-hand
smoke threat as an important breakthrough, but they shouldn't get
their hopes too high.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than a judicial ruling to neutralize the
effect of the Environmental Protection Agency claim of a link
between ambient smoke and cancer. Since it was unveiled a few years
back the EPA study has been used to exile tobacco companies and
their customers to the margins of American society.
</P>
<P>
   Those who take their science seriously never were impressed with
the EPA's claim than environmental tobacco smoke was a major
carcinogen. A federal judge said as much when ruling that the EPA
``committed to a conclusion before the research had begun'' and
made hash of the process to get the answers it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many who understood this initially chose to ignore
the weakness of the EPA claim because they believed the means
justifies the end.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for instance, a story surfaced in the British
media claiming the World Health Organization was withholding from
publication a study disproving the second-hand smoke theory. The
study allegedly even found a protective effect that helped those
exposed to second-hand smoke develop a resistance to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If even partly valid, the story would have been a blockbuster.
Beyond its shock value, there was the irony of WHO having been a
leading advocate of eradicating tobacco use. The U.S. media,
however, didn't show any interest in the development.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when the federal judge in North Carolina challenged
the EPA's second-hand smoke claim, tobacco's foes responded by
saying the ruling wasn't worth taking seriously because it happened
where tobacco is king in response to an industry legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sour grapes? Perhaps, but the lack of concern by smoking's foes
would seem to have merit given the ho-hum public response to the
judge's finding. I happened to be vacationing in North Carolina at
the time and it really wasn't that big a deal along Tobacco Road.
It was undoubtedly a bigger deal than it was in places where
tobacco isn't important to the local economy, but the lack of
spirited reaction in North Carolina was as remarkably surprising as
it was significant.
</P>
<P>
   This can be nothing less than heartening to the antismoking
forces. On the other hand, it also tells the industry and tobacco
consumers that what happened was something less than earthshaking.
Some speculate that the finding, if upheld on appeal, can be used
to undercut smoking bans and litigation based on the EPA's
research.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this thinking is that it ignores the fact that
tobacco use is more a political than legal issue. Politically, the
industry and smokers have no chance of translating legal victories
into major rights victories unless they're willing to become a
political force.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't likely for a group that, although it's 40-million
strong, allows itself to be brow-beaten and dispatched on daily
guilt trips at whim. The industry is obligated to fight for its
rights in court, of course, but it's missing the boat by not
organizing its customer base as a political force.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Camel may sell cigarettes, but what smokers really need is a
political rallying point. It's the only thing that makes sense for
a business and its customer masses in an era of interest-group
power politics.

   As an artist about to leave on a long trip to Italy, I called a
storage company to have someone pack the artwork in my studio. The
packer arrived the next day with stacks of flattened cardboard and
balls of twine. I went back to my easel as he began unfolding the
pieces of cardboard and fitting them to the paintings, tying and
securing. From time to time I watched as he made one neat package
after another, thinking to myself, ``What a monotonous job day
after day.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, we took a coffee break and he asked me if I was a
painter, either oblivious to what he was packing, or just to make
conversation. I admitted I was, and this provoked a thoughtful
silence. Then he said, ``Do you do this every day?'' I said I did
indeed. Another silence. Then in a sympathetic voice he said, ``It
must be boring.''

   Matthew C. Garcia stopped in at his local Barnes &AMP; Noble to buy
a volume of poetry by Gerard Manley Hopkins. As the salesclerk rang
up the purchase, she said briskly, ``That comes to $10.66.''
</P>
<P>
   Without thinking, he replied, ``The year of the Norman
invasion,'' and was given a blank stare in return.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain himself, he said, ``You know, the year the
Normans invaded England, William the Conqueror and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blank stare. But as Garcia handed over his money, the
young clerk looked up, somewhat awestruck, and said, ``Wow, can you
do that with any number?''
</P>
<P>
   John Schiff was jogging in Central Park, wearing his Nolan Ryan
T-shirt with a picture of the retired pitcher on the front and
facts of his career on the back. As he jogged along, he realized
someone was pacing behind him. After three minutes or so, the man
behind him put on speed and called out as he passed: ``Thanks for
the information. Good reading.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Grand Opera Company has been giving free Wednesday
evening performances at Central Park's ``Summerstage'' for more
than two decades. Vincent La Selva, the artistic director, answers
the telephone himself in the company's small office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he began keeping a record of some of the telephone
queries put to him on performance days:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you people intend to do about the weather?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go to the free opera in Central Park. How much
does it cost?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If admission is free, do I get a refund in case of rain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a special cast in case of rain or is it the same
one listed in the newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At what time will you know if it's raining or not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the performance starts at 7:30, what time does the
conductor come in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Stiffelio' is postponed because of rain, does it change to
`Rigoletto'?''
</P>
<P>
   During an afternoon rush hour, a man boarded the A train at the
World Trade Center. ``Attention, ladies and gentlemen,'' he
intoned, his voice piercing the humid air of the subway car,
``Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The man standing in front of Adam Cohen didn't have to think
twice. He turned to his companion and said, ``I hope he's not
waiting for a train, or he's going to be late.''
</P>
<P>
   As good a definition as any: H.D. Causbie overheard an obviously
relaxed diner addressing a companion at the Boat Basin Cafe: ``This
is delightful. It's a poor man's cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   At 71, I sit down on a bus seat with a sign giving priority to
elderly riders and notice I'm seated next to a younger couple.
Enter a woman my age and the man of the couple immediately gets up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, aren't you nice,'' the woman says, and sits down next to
me.
</P>
<P>
   The man who stood up says, ``Well, that's one advantage of being
elderly.'' The woman my age nods her head.
</P>
<P>
   The young man follows with ``But there must be others.''
</P>
<P>
   I break in and say loudly, ``No, that's about it.'' The whole
front of the bus breaks into laughter.

   Craig and Nancy Sobocinski were shopping for mattresses with
their 3-year-old son, Alec. The hours went by, the number of stores
visited increased and Alec became restless.
</P>
<P>
   As he was wandering through the last store, a young salesperson
invited him to try an adjustable bed. He climbed up, and she
proceeded to show him how the control pad lowered and raised the
bed, and even made it vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   Alec was unimpressed. ``Can you make it fly?'' he asked.

<P>
   It was New Year's Eve, and West Moss was in a fancy hair salon,
getting her hair styled professionally for the first time. She was
nervous, and not certain that she would be able to explain what she
wanted to the stylist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like my hair like Mary Tyler Moore,'' she said shyly.
Which Mary Tyler Moore, he wanted to know _ ``Laura Petrie or Mary
Richards?''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, returning to the same salon, she asked for the
same stylist. He didn't recognize her but she felt a surge of
warmth when he came over and asked what she'd like. ``Audrey
Hepburn,'' she said. ``Holly Golightly or Sabrina?'' he replied.

<P>
   William D. Harney telephoned to make a grooming appointment for
his French bulldog. He was asked for his name. ``Bill,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``And your dog's name?'' ``Simon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice at the other end sounded surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest thing,'' it said. ``The call before yours was
also to groom a French bulldog _ but the man's name was Simon, and
his dog's name was Bill.''

   Patricia E. Noonan, walking along Madison Avenue with a friend,

   While I was living in Manhattan and on my way to the Museum of

spotted a $10 bill on the sidewalk.

MAN'S IDENTITY STILL A MYSTERY AT HIS FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the end, Chang Ho Chang's life remains as
much a mystery as when he was found two years ago wandering in
front of an Olathe, Kan., social service agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1996, the then 64-year-old Korean man was found
carrying a bag of clean clothes and a note that said: ``Please take
care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The note identified the man as Chang Ho Chang. He had no other
papers, and efforts to identify him in the area's Korean community
hit dead ends.
</P>
<P>
   Chang died Thursday at 8:55 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are no closer to finding out who he was than we were
years ago,'' said Young Lee, former president of the Korean
American Society of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really unbelievable and impossible to think this could
happen. It is a sorrowful time.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 Korean-American business leaders on Friday attended a
45-minute service for Chang in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders solicited funds to buy Chang a new shirt and
flowers for the viewing, and the funeral home cut $100 off the $600
funeral as a gesture of condolence. Traditional Christian hymns
were led by the Rev. Park Jee Yong.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's death certificate is littered with unknowns, but here is
what is known.
</P>
<P>
   After he was found two years ago, Chang was taken to the
University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., where he
was diagnosed with a degenerative brain condition that causes a
disoriented state much like Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought that Chang may have had two or three grown
children in the area and that his wife may have died the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   One interpreter thought Chang said he originally was from Seoul,
South Korea, and that his surname might be Suh. Publicity generated
about 50 phone calls and tips to KU campus police while Chang was
at the medical center, but nothing materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Campus police forwarded Chang's fingerprints to the FBI's
national identification center in Washington and the Kansas Bureau
of Investigation headquarters in Topeka, where the case was given
low priority.
</P>
<P>
   With no official name, official efforts to identify Chang
failed. Without solid leads, all appeals for help were rebuffed by
government agencies, including the federal offices of Immigration
and Naturalization, Medicaid and Social Security and Missouri's
Division of Family Services and Division of Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that fear of prosecution silenced those in
Chang's ethnic community, a culture that prides itself on stoic
individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Chang spoke only rarely, and then in Korean, particularly when
he was hungry. Because of his mental state, he was unable to
communicate effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big smile that would come out of the blue,'' said
Carla Berkel, the director of the Alzheimer's unit at Oakwood Manor
Nursing Home in Kansas City, where the man eventually came to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rub his cheeks and out would come that smile,''
Berkel said. ``We never had any trouble with him.''
</P>
<P>
   A family ``adopted'' Chang, visiting once a week. Family members
spoke with him in Korean but never once got a clue to his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Korean business leaders gathered in Overland Park on Friday
after the funeral service to try to make sense of Chang's death.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter with a Korean newspaper, a tax collector, a preacher,
a senior citizens representative and a member of the Federation of
Korean Associations all spoke of individuality, respect and the
importance of family.
</P>
<P>
   For Kiutae Bae, president of Bae Brothers Co. of Overland Park,
Kan., the day was one of mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   There was shame in the fact that the Korean community would
abandon one of its elders in such a public way. There also was the
pride he expressed in the American social service system that cared
for Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a system in place to better communicate so
this does not happen again,'' he said. ``There is no shame in
asking for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Lee wore black on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know we will never give up,'' said Lee. ``We
will never give up trying to find this man's family. I'm sure
they're out there.''

hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd
never expect it.

   If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to
tell him is, `God is crying.` And if he asks why God is crying,
another cute thing to tell him is, `Probably because of something
you did.`
</P>
<P>
   If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed
out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years,
because I was thinking about doing that anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right
there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to
read good books.

owed me a lot of money.`

balls of twine. I went back to my easel as he began unfolding the
pieces of cardboard and fitting them to the paintings, tying and
securing. From time to time I watched as he made one neat package
after another, thinking to myself, ``What a monotonous job day

   After a while, we took a coffee break and he asked me if I was a

silence. Then he said, ``Do you do this every day?'' I said I did
indeed. Another silence. Then in a sympathetic voice he said, ``It

TOMMY HILFIGER HAS ARRIVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tommy Hilfiger arrived on the fashion scene
waving the American flag and he can't seem to ease his grip.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the apparel mogul was discovered by rappers and rock
and sports stars and well before he opened a glitzy celebrity store
in Beverly Hills, he had a flag-like logo. His shirts and boxers
with red, white and blue patriotic motifs were winners with middle
aged men in suburbia. And his book, published last year, was called
American Classic: A Style Book.
</P>
<P>
   He is still playing the Americana theme. His upcoming
advertising campaign uses a White House mockup as back drop for
photography. ``We wanted to use as a theme what the White House
represents to the American people _ a symbol of hope,'' says a
Hilfiger quote in the press release.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes, shot in Los Angeles with models such as Tyra Banks
and Jason Shaw, evoke images of the White House Lawn, the Oval
office, the Roosevelt room and the rose garden. The sets in L.A.'s
Griffith Park were from movies such as ``Dave'' and ``American
President.''
</P>
<P>
   A tie for the sky?
</P>
<P>
   Who else but Nicole Miller, the fashion designer best known for
pop culture print ties, sexy dresses and a penchant for parties,
would design the decor of the airplane that will airlift the
winners of Harrah's Entertainment Inc. casino promotions later this
month?
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen couples, including two people chosen in Kansas City,
will be flown on a tour through Atlantic City, Lake Tahoe and Las
Vegas. Milller says she is using lemon yellow and cherry red in
casino icons such as roulette cards and slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be a yawn for her. Her irreverent statusy tie prints
decked with the likes of champaign bottles, theater tickets and
dice during the '80s conversational tie rage put her business on
the map. She only has to turn to her archives.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the wrestler look.
</P>
<P>
   How does a man choose a swimsuit? Let us count the ways: A slim
man should wear a slim suit (so his trunks don't balloon in the
water) says the August GQ. A flat front trunk will deemphasize a
stomach. A short guy looks best with short shorts. And if you are a
bit round and a few pounds over on the scales, an unbuttoned sports
shirt around the pool is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It's better to look as if you're going to a barbecue, says GQ.
And puleeze, unless you're in top, triathlete shape, just say no to
Speedo briefs.
</P>
<P>
   A TV moment.
</P>
<P>
   The recent couture shows in Paris have gotten more attention
than usual, in part because they were featured in a prime time ABC
special and in part, because some were so way out there in lavish
opulence and theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   As for the television show, it seemed to be a good idea gone
awry. Couture, of course, is the old-world, ultimate in clothing
luxury. The clothes are made to order and costs easily run in the
$30,000-to-$40,000 and up range. Customers include maybe 200 to 300
Americans at most and some Eastern princesses.
</P>
<P>
   But cable television has traditionally framed fashion in lively,
high-speed terms. And by comparison, ABC hosts Anne Archer and
Isabella Rossellini seemed stiff, stilted and burdened with a slow,
academic script. The guests looked uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the clothes, there may be some signals of things to come
to the mainstream. For instance, industry observers believe the
feathers and Christian Dior's play on Pocahontas may inspire a new
wave of Western and American Indian derivatives on the fashion
scene.

   &UR; DEEP THOUGHTS (Hilarious) By Jack Handy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without
hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd
never expect it.
</P>
<P>
   If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to
tell him is, `God is crying.` And if he asks why God is crying,
another cute thing to tell him is, `Probably because of something
you did.`
</P>
<P>
   If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed
out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years,
because I was thinking about doing that anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right
there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to
read good books.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that after I die, people will say of me: `That guy sure
owed me a lot of money.`

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says he's looking forward'' to testifying in the
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky case. Sounds like a little perjury right there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Linda Tripp has also given prosecutors her dress,
which is also stained, with spaghetti sauce, beef gravy, custard
pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You all see Linda Tripp's press conference? The theme of it
was, 'I am you. I am just the average person.' Assuming the average
person tapes their friends and then stabs them in the back.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to say the state of California does not have the
powerball lottery. We don't need it. We have legitimate ways of
earning money in this state. We want money, we spill coffee on
ourselves at McDonald's. We go to Denny's and cry about not getting
service. We marry wealthy women and sue for alimony. We earn our
dough.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As an artist about to leave on a long trip to Italy, I called a
storage company to have someone pack the artwork in my studio. The
packer arrived the next day with stacks of flattened cardboard and
balls of twine. I went back to my easel as he began unfolding the
pieces of cardboard and fitting them to the paintings, tying and
securing. From time to time I watched as he made one neat package
after another, thinking to myself, ``What a monotonous job day
after day.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, we took a coffee break and he asked me if I was a
painter, either oblivious to what he was packing, or just to make
conversation. I admitted I was, and this provoked a thoughtful
silence. Then he said, ``Do you do this every day?'' I said I did
indeed. Another silence. Then in a sympathetic voice he said, ``It
must be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   _ HENRY S. GILLETTE
</P>
<P>
   Matthew C. Garcia stopped in at his local Barnes &AMP; Noble to buy
a volume of poetry by Gerard Manley Hopkins. As the salesclerk rang
up the purchase, she said briskly, ``That comes to $10.66.''
</P>
<P>
   Without thinking, he replied, ``The year of the Norman
invasion,'' and was given a blank stare in return.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain himself, he said, ``You know, the year the
Normans invaded England, William the Conqueror and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another blank stare. But as Garcia handed over his money, the
young clerk looked up, somewhat awestruck, and said, ``Wow, can you
do that with any number?''
</P>
<P>
   John Schiff was jogging in Central Park, wearing his Nolan Ryan
T-shirt with a picture of the retired pitcher on the front and
facts of his career on the back. As he jogged along, he realized
someone was pacing behind him. After three minutes or so, the man
behind him put on speed and called out as he passed: ``Thanks for
the information. Good reading.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Grand Opera Company has been giving free Wednesday
evening performances at Central Park's ``Summerstage'' for more
than two decades. Vincent La Selva, the artistic director, answers
the telephone himself in the company's small office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he began keeping a record of some of the telephone
queries put to him on performance days:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you people intend to do about the weather?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go to the free opera in Central Park. How much
does it cost?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If admission is free, do I get a refund in case of rain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a special cast in case of rain or is it the same
one listed in the newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At what time will you know if it's raining or not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the performance starts at 7:30, what time does the
conductor come in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Stiffelio' is postponed because of rain, does it change to
`Rigoletto'?''
</P>
<P>
   During an afternoon rush hour, a man boarded the A train at the
World Trade Center. ``Attention, ladies and gentlemen,'' he
intoned, his voice piercing the humid air of the subway car,
``Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The man standing in front of Adam Cohen didn't have to think
twice. He turned to his companion and said, ``I hope he's not
waiting for a train, or he's going to be late.''
</P>
<P>
   As good a definition as any: H.D. Causbie overheard an obviously
relaxed diner addressing a companion at the Boat Basin Cafe: ``This
is delightful. It's a poor man's cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   At 71, I sit down on a bus seat with a sign giving priority to
elderly riders and notice I'm seated next to a younger couple.
Enter a woman my age and the man of the couple immediately gets up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, aren't you nice,'' the woman says, and sits down next to
me.
</P>
<P>
   The man who stood up says, ``Well, that's one advantage of being
elderly.'' The woman my age nods her head.
</P>
<P>
   The young man follows with ``But there must be others.''
</P>
<P>
   I break in and say loudly, ``No, that's about it.'' The whole
front of the bus breaks into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALFRED GESCHEIDT
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Nancy Sobocinski were shopping for mattresses with
their 3-year-old son, Alec. The hours went by, the number of stores
visited increased and Alec became restless.
</P>
<P>
   As he was wandering through the last store, a young salesperson
invited him to try an adjustable bed. He climbed up, and she
proceeded to show him how the control pad lowered and raised the
bed, and even made it vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   Alec was unimpressed. ``Can you make it fly?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   It was New Year's Eve, and West Moss was in a fancy hair salon,
getting her hair styled professionally for the first time. She was
nervous, and not certain that she would be able to explain what she
wanted to the stylist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like my hair like Mary Tyler Moore,'' she said shyly.
Which Mary Tyler Moore, he wanted to know _ ``Laura Petrie or Mary
Richards?''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, returning to the same salon, she asked for the
same stylist. He didn't recognize her but she felt a surge of
warmth when he came over and asked what she'd like. ``Audrey
Hepburn,'' she said. ``Holly Golightly or Sabrina?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   William D. Harney telephoned to make a grooming appointment for
his French bulldog. He was asked for his name. ``Bill,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``And your dog's name?'' ``Simon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice at the other end sounded surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest thing,'' it said. ``The call before yours was
also to groom a French bulldog _ but the man's name was Simon, and
his dog's name was Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia E. Noonan, walking along Madison Avenue with a friend,
encountered what must be the city's most enterprising panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, ladies,'' he chirped. ``Have you any spare credit cards?''
</P>
<P>
   While I was living in Manhattan and on my way to the Museum of
Natural History, an approaching pedestrian and I simultaneously
spotted a $10 bill on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The man, closer to the bill than I was, picked it up and put it
in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   As we passed, he handed me a five! What a town!

THE MINIMALIST LOOK IS BEING AUGMENTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: What will you be adding to your closet come cold
weather?
</P>
<P>
   A feather boa? A choker necklace Kate Winslet would envy?
Earrings long enough to bounce against your neck when you toss your
head? An embroidered jacket? With sequined lining?
</P>
<P>
   If your shopping list was weighted more toward sweaters, mittens
and boots, some revisions may be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Serious fashion trend trackers are veering a bit from the basics
these days to follow a new wave of decorative ornamentation.
Subtle? Yes. But it's more exuberant than anything seen since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, philosophical shifts are fuel for the fashion arena.
Within the 1970s alone, bell-bottomed, hot-panted women morphed
into no-nonsense, conservative preppies. The overdone pouf-skirt
excesses of the '80s gave way to a clericallike austerity in the
early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The simple, minimalist style that emphasizes shape and fabric
over detailing, trims and other distractions has long dominated the
world of designers and apparel manufacturers. Noted names like
Calvin Klein and Helmet Lang have been in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash in part to the '80s, it coincided with the dressing
down of America when even business executives adapted knit shirts
for the office and the best restaurants were challenged to enforce
a dress code. It also came at a time when books on simplifying
one's life were creeping up the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of the accessories industry, designers dropped
jewelry and eventually hosiery from runway shows. The biggest trend
in accessories in recent years has been toward subtlety. (Remember
Y necklaces?) And celebrity observers at events such as Oscar
ceremonies nodded off at the ongoing parade of simple slip dresses.
</P>
<P>
   But recently such embellishments as embroidery, contrasting
trims and touches of glitz have begun to resurface. ``It's a
happening thing,'' says Dana Buchman, the designer best known for
her business suits. ``It's all over,'' says Hal Rubenstein, the
fashion director for InStyle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Trend forecaster and retail consultant David Wolfe says the
trend is on the way up. ``It has a foot in the door. I know because
so much of what has been successful now has been embellishment,''
says Wolfe, fashion director with the New York-based Donegar Group.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly viewers of ABC-TV's haute couture special late last
month took in lavish doses of extravagant ornamentation through the
visions of such designers as Christian Dior's John Galliano and
Alexander McQueen. While the shows were theatrical and exaggerated,
they showcased miles of feathers (Dior featured Pocahontas), rich
colorful embroidery and sumptuous textiles, all of which will have
a trickle-down impact. ``I kept thinking just a piece of that
fabric could be a lapel on a jacket,'' Wolfe says. Donatella
Versace appeared to have woven feathers into some fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   On a more realistic planet for fall, the new thinking is
manifested in, say, fur boas, a feather collar, fur trims, new lacy
chokers, embroidered handbags, embroidered scarfs and a velvet
appliqued pattern snaking up a shapely jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a drop-dead jeweled skirt tempered with a sporty
cashmere sweater as shown by Badgley Mischka design team, or it's a
metallic-patterned jacket softened with a simple white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more discreet'' than in the 1980s, says Gina Tovar,
the Chicago-based fashion director of Nordstrom stores. It may be a
texture, she says, the glimmering lining of a coat or a metallic
rim around a hem. As for herself, she is envisioning a new fur boa.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Reynolds, the buyer for Halls Plaza, a Kansas City
specialty store, added a feather boa to her own wardrobe earlier
this year. And she is upbeat about jackets and sweaters with fur
cuffs or maribou trims and glimmering patterns. It's ``fun and
lighthearted. It's like having a new palette.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchman, the designer, says, ``women are tired of totally plain,
slightly masculine, hard-edged clothing'' and ready for feminine
softer styles. For her, it can be jackets with touches of beading
and, in one case, her navy velvet decorated with steel gray
embroidery. Both can be worn for day into night. ``It's almost like
private embellishments only you know you're wearing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   On a more opulent note, Todd Dean has bought Alexander McQueen's
ready-to-wear for his Kansas City store, Loma Vista Hardware, where
the fall stock will include McQueen's long skirt decorated with a
red sequin Asian pattern on one side and a man's jacket decked with
a sequin cherub motif.
</P>
<P>
   He says people who want to be out front are ready for change
after fashion's generic mode. ``Everyone wants this burst of
energy. Everyone wants to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   To Marylou Luther, the syndicated fashion columnist, the shift
may be in part triggered by the millennium. ``Traditionally fashion
always goes baroque at the end of the century,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, credit goes to the fashion pendulum that
routinely swings from one extreme to another and the ongoing search
for something new. After designers ``have exhausted minimalism,''
Luther says, ``what do they do other than maximalism?''
</P>
<P>
   InStyle magazine's Rubenstein sees the shift as a natural
evolution after people tired of minimalism. ``Once you buy it, you
own it. There is nowhere to go'' with it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly another boost comes from the media. Decorative clothes
``frankly make better pictures,'' Luther says. And designers want
the attention of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ and ultimately the key to acceptance _ ornamentation
gives women an opportunity to set themselves apart from the pack.
``We have been living in the minimalist trend for too long. Women
have lost the ability to create our own identity,'' says Irenka
Jakubiak, the editor in chief of Accessories magazine, a trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Embellishment, Rubenstein says, ``helps women individualize
their look. It personalizes a wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the idea will start for many women with jewelry.
Jakubiak predicts increased popularity for long earrings and
choker//bibs, especially in dark metal with stones, along with
feather pieces and decorated bags.
</P>
<P>
   Will more decorative clothing mean higher prices? Not
significantly in Buchman's view. ``If you have hand embroidery,
it's going to add something, but I don't think they are out of
line,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Steele, the fashion historian at New York's Fashion
Institute of Technology, says manufacturers and designers will
simply seek alternative, less costly resources. ``It doesn't mean
you're adding more value. Ultimately it's costlier to buy simple
fabric from Italy than to have embroidery done in Asia,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile no one expects the stylish simplicity of the moment to
go away. Minimalism ``is easy to take care of. It shows how well
the clothes are cut,'' Rubenstein says. ``But women want to look
pretty. It just comes down to a nice balance.''

   GIFORUM _ WASHINGTON _ Fifty years after it was founded as an
advocacy group for Hispanic veterans, the American G.I. Forum will
take its place alongside other veterans' groups that hold federal
charters. Congress, suspending a 10-year moratorium on charters,
recognized the forum during votes today in the House and Friday in
the Senate. The charter arrives in time for the forum's national
convention and celebration of its founding in Corpus Christi,
Texas. ``It's a good to get what you've been after for 50 years,''
said Gil Rodriguez, outgoing commander of the forum's Austin
chapter. ``It's a good beginning for the second'' 50 years.

   MISSILE _ In the controversy over whether sensitive technology
was transferred to China following a crash of a commercial
satellite in the winter of 1996, Republicans have blamed the
Clinton Administration for weakening controls on the export of
commercial satellites by giving the business-friendly Commerce
Department the power to approve satellite licenses. But documents
provided by the White House to the various congressional committees
investigating the matter show that Republicans were pushing for the
very same changes behind the scenes. In fact, one document
indicates that Michael Armstrong, former CEO of Hughes Electronics
Corp. and head of a presidential panel on exports, told White House
officials that he had the support of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

 &HT;    CONGRESS GRANTS LONG-AWAITED FEDERAL CHARTER TO HISPANIC
VETERANS GROUP
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House of Representatives voted Monday to
bestow a federal charter on the American G.I. Forum, an advocacy
group for Hispanic veterans that had waited almost 30 years to
receive the same charter as other veterans' groups and national
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote in the House broke a six-year-old moratorium on
federal charters and delivered a symbolic but meaningful honor to
the G.I. Forum, as its members gather for their national convention
this week in Corpus Christi, Texas, and mark the group's founding
there 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get what you've been after for 50 years,'' said
Gil Rodriguez of Austin, a Navy veteran who was elected last month
as first vice commander of the G.I. Forum's Texas organization.
``It's a good beginning for the second'' 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal charter, approved Friday in the Senate, places the
G.I. Forum on the same plane with Disabled American Veterans, the
American Legion, Jewish War Veterans Inc. and other veterans'
groups. Those groups earned a federal charter earlier because their
members are primarily veterans, while the American G.I. Forum from
its beginning has comprised groups of veterans, women and youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three are considered equal,'' said Arthur Solis (Note:
accent over the ``I'') of San Antonio, legislative liaison for the
G.I. Forum. ``Our organization is a veterans' family
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   After Congress balked 30 years ago at recognizing the group,
founder Hector P. Garcia and other leaders ``decided we weren't
willing to change our organization,'' Solis said, so the charter
drive was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Congress decided that it was issuing too many
federal charters, which convey no benefits. By the time an informal
moratorium was imposed in 1992, such groups as Little League
Baseball Inc., the American Symphony Orchestra League and the
Society of American Florists and Ornamental Horticulturists held
federal charters on the same par with the veterans' groups. A
formal moratorium, with a tiny window for exceptions, took effect
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the G.I. Forum decided to seek out one of those
exceptions: ``As the organization has matured, it has become more
and more involved in veterans' issues,'' Solis said. ``We felt the
need to have a federal charter to recognize our work on behalf of
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   The G.I. Forum was also looking for a tribute to its founder,
Dr. Garcia, who died two years ago. Garcia, a decorated veteran of
World War II, formed the organization in 1948 in Corpus Christi to
help Mexican-American veterans obtain treatment from veterans'
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal charter is seen as honoring Dr. Garcia, and it
would be a fitting tribute to his sacrifice and tireless work,''
Solis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had many well-deserved awards and accolades,'' including
the Presidential MeDIT

 &HT;    Bergman introspection meets Woo's violence
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a ``Death Wish'' movie directed by Ingmar Bergman, or a
Harold Pinter play directed by John Woo, and you'll have some idea
of Takeshi Kitano's remarkable ``Fireworks'' (``Hana-bi'').
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the top prize at the Venice Film Festival _ the first
Japanese picture so honored since Akira Kurosawa's ``Rashomon'' in
1950 _ ``Fireworks'' arrives stateside with Quentin Tarantino's
seal of approval. That's become less of a recommendation to those
of us weary (and wary) of his film-geek penchant for the too-cool
movie.
</P>
<P>
   But this film, which Kitano wrote, directed and stars in (under
his acting alias, ``Beat'' Takeshi), is something quite special.
It's cool, all right, but it's so much more. Scenes of
contemplative tenderness or deadpan humor alternate with furious
explosions of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano's fondness for fractured chronology renders a simple plot
summary the most difficult thing about ``Fireworks.'' But here are
the basics (consider this summary as you would opera notes,
incomplete but a leg up): Nishi (Kitano) is a hard-boiled,
tough-guy detective whose beloved wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) is dying
of leukemia. While he's visiting her in the hospital, he briefly
abandons his longtime partner, Horibe (Ren Osugi), on a stakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Horibe is badly wounded and paralyzed for life. His family
leaves him and he sits alone in his wheelchair thinking about
suicide. Meanwhile, another cop Nishi cares about is killed in the
line of duty, leaving his young widow penniless. Finally, some
thuggish yakuzas from whom Nishi borrowed money are calling in
their loan. Overcome with remorse and guilt, Nishi sets out to make
things right. Or at least as close to right as they'll ever be
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts of violence are as bloody, brutal and unexpected
as a chopstick in the eye (don't laugh; it happens). But when Nishi
isn't killing or maiming someone, the movie is suffused with comic
pathos and a sweet melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   Visually rich and formally paced, the picture as a whole echoes
Kitano's on-screen self-assurance and meditative bravado. Rarely
without his shades and radiating the stoic macho of Charles
Bronson, he occasionally suggests an Asian John Garfield with his
measured intensity and opaque eyes.
</P>
<P>
   What's astonishing about ``Fireworks'' isn't how very cool it
is, but how very human it is. The vicissitudes of life _ nasty or
funny, reflective or heartbreaking _ have rarely been expressed so
eloquently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fireworks''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring ``Beat'' Takeshi. Directed by Takeshi Kitano.
Subtitles. Not rated but there is extreme violence.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Eloquent and original mix of tenderness and
brutality, of poignancy and violence.

 &HT;    COLUMN: It's nice to open doors others can't go through
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I worried that I'd have to present my transcripts at the door.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't terrible, but they weren't going to get me in here.
They didn't get me in when I graduated, and I could imagine the
people at the sign-in desk looking them up and down, looking at
each other, looking at me and, having sized me up, saying, ``Get
lost, pal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a social gathering, but not open to just anyone. I was
along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do,'' my wife said as we pulled into the parking
lot of the Capital City Club, ``just keep your mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd do the talking. She had the key.
</P>
<P>
   In Phi Beta Kappa, the key is the proof you made the grade. Or,
I should say, the grades.
</P>
<P>
   I was not Phi Beta Kappa. I was Phi Delta Theta. Rather than a
key we had a secret handshake.
</P>
<P>
   That handshake hasn't done me much good since I graduated, and
it wasn't going to help me here. This was a meeting of the Atlanta
alumni chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. My wife is a member; I was the
barbarian at the gate. You can let him in, but you don't want to
give him the run of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I introduce you,'' she said, ``just nod and smile. You can
say hello, but don't get drawn into any conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   I've played the part before, the swizzle stick in my wife's
drink. When we lived in North Carolina, she belonged to something
called Alliance Francaise, a talky group of Francophiles who'd get
together and speak French. I'm not much for cocktail parties in any
language, but I went once, nodding on cue and nibbling on the
cheese and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they ignored me, but I could have told them that I'd read
Sartre, too. In the English translation, of course. I could have
told them I'd read most of ``Being and Nothingness'' _ what I took
to be the nothingness part _ and I knew all about Proust and his
cork-lined room. But I wasn't a part of anyone's conversation. And
somehow I didn't think they were talking about Sartre or Proust.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at the Capital City Club, my instincts told me the bar was
set a little higher. The first thing I heard upon being admitted
(``He's with me,'' my wife said) was one person saying to another,
``Yes, I taught him internal medicine at Emory.''
</P>
<P>
   We darted the other way, toward the cheese and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why, but Phi Beta Kappa seems to follow me
everywhere. The small handful of significant women in my life,
every one of them, has been Phi Beta Kappa. They couldn't have been
too smart. But they had that key. I couldn't show 'em much more
than a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best editors I'll ever write for was also a Phi Beta
Kappa, and she found it deeply amusing that the Raleigh alumni
chapter, desperate for a speaker, invited me of all people to
address it one year. We shared an office and shared confidences,
and I like to think there was a mutual admiration. There was on my
end anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked you?'' she said with a smirk I still miss. ``Remind
me to bring in my key tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion,'' I said, ``they didn't ask me to join them. They
asked me to instruct them.''
</P>
<P>
   But as I stood mute and muzzled at the Capital City Club, I had
the distinct feeling there would be no petitions for enlightenment.
It was just as well. I was starting to feel almost comfortable.
Everyone was speaking English, and no one grilled me on my GPA.
</P>
<P>
   More than just intelligent, they were open and friendly, none
more so than Angelika Pohl, Christina James and Carolyn Weber. I
was the tag-along spouse, not quite up to snuff on his transcripts
but well-trained and generally presentable. Unless somebody's set
the curve beyond reasonable reach, you could give me a solid B.
</P>
<P>
   And I had always thought these people grade-grubbers. I left
wishing I had grubbed for one or two more A's myself. That key is
rather nice.

 &HT;    A new Spin on white rappers
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choose your Beastie. The September issue of Spin ($3.99) is
giving single-issue purchasers their choice of the three Beastie
Boys on the cover. The redesigned magazine, with expanded coverage
of fashion and music, profiles the beer-chugging, groupie-grabbing
white boys and asks how the group became the elder statesmen of
hip-hop. Good question.
</P>
<P>
   Newsmags urge the Prez to tell the truth
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest soap opera (``As Monica Turns''?) heats up
this week, and magazines from Newsweek to The New Yorker weigh in
with their spin on what President Clinton should do. Perhaps the
best advice comes from former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos:
``If he's shaded the truth, it's time to amend the record,'' he
writes in Newsweek ($2.95). ``If he's lied, he should tell all,
apologize and hope for the best.'' In another development, Newsweek
reports that Linda Tripp and literary agent Lucianne Goldberg
plotted to get the ``evidence-stained'' dress from Monica Lewinsky
either by theft or deception.
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95), meanwhile, explains why Lewinsky decided to
testify (to get immunity for herself and her mother) and offers the
up sides and downsides of Clinton's options. The preferred option,
of course, is to tell the whole truth, Time says. Especially if the
DNA tests are incriminating.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.79) agrees with Stephanopoulos that
truth is the best defense, but hard-liners _ namely Hillary Rodham
Clinton and lawyer David Kendall _ reportedly favor continued
denial.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton gets caught in a lie, there still may be hope,
Jeffrey Rosen writes in an intriguing article in The New Yorker
($3). Citing previous political sex scandals, Rosen says
heavy-handed attempts to prove guilt sometimes spark public
outrage. In 1820, for example, Queen Caroline of England was
accused of adultery. Prosecutors trotted out bodyguards and
chambermaids to testify and even produced semen-stained sheets. A
vote to impeach the queen was shelved at the last minute because of
angry demonstrations in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A PERFECT 10: Editors at Men's Health ($3.50) expect readers to
flip over their 10th anniversary issue. Literally. The September
issue features an upside-down ``flip cover'' that offers two
magazines in one. The regular cover has the usual half-naked guy
with six-pack abs, while the flip cover has the same guy in an
Armani suit. Part of the magazine includes such articles as ``99
Best Health Tips Ever'' and ``The Baldness Pill.'' On the flip
side, men can learn how to build the ultimate wardrobe and get the
best haircut. Though not as flashy as some of its counterparts,
Men's Health has quietly built a circulation of 1.5 million readers
_ more than that of GQ and Esquire combined.
</P>
<P>
   MORE FOR MEN: Bob Guccione Jr., son of the Penthouse publisher,
launches some slick competition for Esquire and GQ this week with
Gear ($2.99), a men's magazine sans centerfold. There's lots of
good reading here, from an article on ``La Femme Nikita'' star Peta
Wilson to an interview with Matt Damon before he became famous. But
the most interesting _ and most inexplicable _ piece is Guccione's
interview with rival Hugh Hefner of Playboy. Interviewed in his
trademark silk pajamas, Hefner discusses everything from the merits
of Viagra to his ``almost-date'' with Gloria Steinem when she was
an editorial assistant at Help magazine. According to Hefner,
publisher Harvey Kurtzman tried unsuccessfully to fix them up. ``He
was convinced we were made for each other romantically,'' Hef says.
Shortly after that, Steinem went undercover for Show magazine to
write her first-person account as a Playboy bunny.
</P>
<P>
   MAY-DECEMBER MATCH-
</P>
<P>
   UPS: Judging from the latest spate of Hollywood films, you would
think there are no actresses ``of a certain age'' to be found. Jack
Nicholson, Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas have been paired with
Helen Hunt, Anne Heche and Gwyneth Paltrow _ women young enough to
be their daughters. People ($2.79) talks to older actresses such as
Jane Fonda, Bette Midler and Meryl Streep about Hollywood's
generation gap. Fonda, 60, says it's a battle that can't be won.
``You know, in a big close-up on a big screen, seeing wrinkled lips
kissing wrinkled lips, it's not as appealing.''

 &HT;    St. Louis singer finds success in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The attention now coming to R&AMP;B singer Wendell Brown, a St.
Louis native and now an Atlantan, is proof once again that working
hard enough at the grassroots level can pay off. His ``Sing a Song
for You'' video single is, according to Radio &AMP; Records magazine,
the most-added on the Urban Contemporary and Urban Adult playlists,
and it's gotten there without a big-bucks, major-label campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for Brown's success goes to Raw Deal Records of College
Park, Ga., a fledgling label created by T.C. Payton and Thom Mueed
because they felt Brown's talent deserved a spotlight. They
produced his just-released album, ``Make It Good for You'';
introduced Brown to Atlanta at a listening party; finagled him some
airtime on BET; booked him on a cerebral palsy telethon, and gained
additional exposure by getting his music played in theaters via
Movie Tunes. Brown says it ``took a trip to Atlanta'' to make his
music begin to happen, because here's where he found someone else
who believed in him.

 &HT;    TV series based on best seller doesn't show much
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Maximum Bob'' is a condescending insult to insult comedy. It's
smart enough to know better _ based on Elmore Leonard's best
seller, the premiere of tonight's summer series (10 p.m. EDT on
ABC) stars Beau Bridges and is directed by Barry Sonnefeld (``Men
in Black,'' ``Get Shorty''). But it quickly out-smarts itself and
takes the low road, winking and smirking the whole way, just to let
us know it's in on its own joke.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the joke? We're deposited in Deepwater, a Florida
swamp burg billed as ``The Biggest Little City in the South.''
You'll recognize it: no southern cliche goes unturned. Citizens not
married to first cousins are married to brothers or sisters.
Everybody's either possum-vittle skinny or Goo Goo Cluster plump.
Women are there to be leered at. And did we mention everybody's
really, really stew-pid ?
</P>

   Running things is Judge Bob Gibbs (Bridges), a politically
ambitious, politically incorrect bench sitter who revels in
endless, lawless sentencings. 'Course, most locals love him, at
least until pretty public defender Kathy Baker (Liz Vassey) arrives
from Miami and is appalled by what she finds (after Gibbs sentences
her client to the electric chair for drinking a beer, then hits on
her, Baker wonders if he's late for his ``golf date with Rush
Limbaugh'').
</P>
<P>
   But Baker isn't that appalled: by the end of the hour, she's
decided to relocate to Deepwater. What at first repulsed her turns
out to be merely colorful (``One thing I'll say for him, he sure is
horny for a man his age,'' she admits of the judge) and, what the
heck, without her it's goodbye series.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other shows that successfully set themselves in Oddville,
USA (``Northern Exposure,'' ``Twin Peaks''), making us feel
deficient for not being eccentric, ``Maximum Bob'' cruises its
streets to point and laugh at the weirdos. It starts out
promisingly _ tourists watching a trio of underwater mermaids
eating bananas and drinking sodas _ and it has a bright, neon look
that perfectly captures both Florida and the irony that's promised
and never delivered. Kiersten Warren is memorably flaky as a
mermaid turned Gibb's mystic wife Leanne; you could drop her in
Cicely, Alaska, and she'd get along just fine.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing here adds up, and it's clear nothing is meant to.
``Maximum Bob'' is smart, but it never takes the time to think.
This is a series that knows it's gone in seven weeks _ if it isn't
killed off first.

U.S. PURSUIT OF RAUL SALINAS HAS BEEN TROUBLED FROM THE START  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When the young chief of Switzerland's drug police
arrived here in late 1995 to inquire about $132 million found in
Swiss bank accounts belonging to the influential elder brother of a
former president, he knew enough about Mexico's political
underworld to be wary of his official hosts.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had he been whisked from the airport by a squad of
burly Mexican plainclothesmen, for example, than he began to wonder
if he wasn't being kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen it in the movies,'' the official, Valentin
Roschacher, said, recalling what turned out to be merely some
aggressive police security measures en route to his hotel. ``I
thought, `Are these guys the good guys or the bad guys?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two years later, Roschacher and his men have
learned enough about organized crime in Mexico to follow a
complicated financial trail and information from convicted drug
traffickers to the conclusion that Raul Salinas de Gortari earned
vast of sums of his money by assuring the safe transport of cocaine
through Mexico to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Swiss are preparing to use that evidence in a
civil court action to confiscate the fortune of Salinas, the elder
brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a much
larger and more experienced group of law enforcement officials in
the United States has been unable to make a similar case of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those officials say they may yet win criminal
indictments. Privately, though, others acknowledge that
Washington's pursuit of Salinas has been troubled from the start,
with turf battles among law enforcement agencies and federal
prosecutors, disputes over the handling of witnesses and complaints
from agents in the field of meddling and a lack of interest by
higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy with which both governments have proceeded makes it
impossible to fully evaluate their evidence before it is presented
in court, and Salinas has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials are also quick to note that they
have sought to build a criminal case, which entails a higher
standard of proof than the Swiss will face.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the unlikely initial success of Roschacher's small
detective team has turned an unflattering mirror on Washington's
handling of what U.S. officials once described as a watershed
effort to combat not just the flow of drugs through Mexico into the
United States, but the complex system of official corruption that
has long allowed it to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is even more striking, officials say, because the
Swiss appear to have relied almost entirely on witnesses and
information that were first uncovered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like the mouse that roared,'' one former senior
American law enforcement official said of the Swiss authorities.
``They were blocked almost every step of the way. But they just
kept going and kept going, and they finally made a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the investigations will definitively resolve the
question of the Salinas family's alleged collusion with the drug
trade remains far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   A partial account of the Swiss and U.S. inquiries, assembled
from government documents and dozens of interviews, suggests that
neither has penetrated into the brothers' inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   But some experienced investigators have concluded that Raul
Salinas could have been a valued asset for the traffickers even if
he could not necessarily pick up the phone and call off police
raids. He might have been paid off, they said, just to provide an
impression of acquiescence at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul Salinas was not somebody who protected a truck with a gun
as it went to the border,'' Roschacher said in an interview at his
office in Bern, the Swiss capital. ``What we are talking about is a
system _ a system in which a person can give orders to someone who
gives orders to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas, who remains in a maximum-security prison cell in
Mexico on charges of ordering the murder of a prominent politician,
has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence. He has insisted that most
of the money in his accounts was given to him by major Mexican
industrialists for an investment fund that he was to establish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had any kind of dealings with drug traffickers,
nor have I received any benefit or money from any drug
trafficker,'' he told the Swiss attorney general, Carla del Ponte,
in a handwritten letter from prison two months ago. ``The source of
my money, and of all the money that I managed, is legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas, who left office just before the Mexican economy
collapsed at the end of 1994 and left the country soon afterward,
has never been charged with any crime. He lives in Ireland and the
south of France, one of his old friends said, waiting impatiently
for some judgment more generous than the one a bitter Mexican
public has handed down.
</P>
<P>
   Within months after the Swiss police found Raul Salinas' bank
accounts on a tip from American drug agents, his case had entangled
some of Mexico's biggest businessmen, as well as banks in Mexico,
the United States, Britain and France. Initially, though, Swiss
officials saw nothing remarkable in the notion that a foreign
leader's relative might have stashed illicit wealth in their banks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `It's just a case like any other case,'' Roschacher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hidden fortunes of Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines
or Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, the Salinas accounts presented an
opportunity for the embattled Swiss to show that dirty money would
no longer be safe in their vaults. There was another incentive as
well: Whatever part of Salinas' money the government could
convincingly tie to drugs, officials said, it would be able to keep
under Swiss law.
</P>
<P>
   In Bern, the Swiss capital, Roschacher had three hard-working
detectives and the support of Mrs. del Ponte, the plain-spoken
prosecutor who has earned a wide reputation for pressing to open up
Switzerland's banks. He didn't have much else.
</P>
<P>
   After years of collaboration with American law-enforcement
agencies, Swiss officials assumed they could count on help from the
United States. Instead, banking and credit card records took months
to arrive. Interviews with convicted drug smugglers and other
witnesses from United States court cases were sometimes slow to be
granted, sometimes postponed and sometimes refused.
</P>
<P>
   By the second half of 1996, with the Swiss under pressure to
show progress, tempers began to rise. At one point, officials said,
as Mrs. del Ponte was trying to interview one American-supplied
informant in the presence of a fastidious federal prosecutor from
New York, she exploded in anger and later fired off a letter to her
counterpart, Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have had difficulties coordinating our
procedures,'' Mrs. del Ponte said euphemistically, emphasizing her
gratitude for the American help that eventually arrived. ``Of
course, when I am over there and the public prosecutor says to me,
`You cannot ask this question,' I am going to get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, law-enforcement officials had far more
investigative resources and more knowledge of the mechanics of
Mexican corruption. But they also found themselves struggling to
move their sometimes-rivalrous agencies and prosecutors in the same
direction at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors that circulated about Raul Salinas during his
brother's presidency had centered on the notion that he had grown
rich from the kickbacks of Mexican businessmen whom he might have
helped to win lucrative deals from the state. American
drug-enforcement, Customs and FBI agents had also received reports
linking him to at least two major Mexican cocaine smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-enforcement officials said the reports were startling, but
not enough to merit a special inquiry. That view quickly changed
after the discovery of the Swiss accounts, but after some
bureaucratic struggle, it was the FBI's office in New York, where
Salinas had also banked, that was finally assigned the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials said the inquiry was important because its
targets were high-profile: Salinas, who had moved tens of millions
of dollars through Citibank, and officers in the bank's
private-client section, who appeared to have helped him without
trying very hard to verify the legitimacy of his funds. Still,
people familiar with the probe said it was not a primary focus of
the bureau office, which soon consumed by its investigation into
TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a big man-burner,'' one former senior official said,
noting that the inquiry focused more on the trail of financial
transactions rather than on the history of Salinas' alleged
misdeeds. ``It was a paper chase.''
</P>
<P>
   At offices of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington,
Mexico and Texas, agents were turning their attention to Mexico's
new cocaine kingpin, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Again, there was a
thin record of informants who said Raul Salinas had met with
Carrillo and his associates, received money from the trafficker's
operations, or helped assure the movement of his loads.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they knew they would be hard-pressed to turn such
intelligence information into witnesses who could stand up in court
and convincingly accuse the brother of a former Mexican president.
But some complained that the greater challenge was navigating the
disparate and sometimes competing investigations going on around
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For months after Mrs. del Ponte's confrontation with the New
York prosecutor, two officials said, the Swiss authorities' access
to American informants all but dried up. They had yet to solidly
link Raul Salinas to the drug trade. And the outcry over
Switzerland's handling of the bank accounts of Nazi victims was
adding to pressure on the government to prove its vows of greater
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Then, little more than a year into the effort, the
investigators' luck began to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to talk to witnesses who knew a lot about what
had happened in Mexico,'' Roschacher said. ``For the first time,
they were people who knew things concretely _ `I was there; I saw
that' _ and not by hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long thereafter, though, Swiss investigators also began to
see the confidentiality of their witnesses start to erode as
information leaked to the news media, particularly in Mexico,
raising questions about Salinas' accusers.
</P>
<P>
   One such witness, officials said, was Marco E. Torres, a Mexican
smuggler who pleaded guilty to drug charges in the United States in
1996 and received a reduced sentence for his cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   According to two officials familiar with his statements, Torres
said he arranged the protection of cocaine shipments with Raul
Salinas and paid him one large bribe himself after a drug seizure
in Mexico in 1993. But parts of Torres' account, including his
claim to having known the Salinas brothers for years, were refuted
by Salinas' lawyers after they were first reported last year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Roschacher said he was not sidetracked by such particulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as no one can say, `He is a notorious liar _ we have
checked and what he says is wrong,' then for us he is a witness and
we take a look at him,'' he said. ``Our case is not built on Marco
Torres. His credibility is good. But we have several others who are
as good or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials would not name those other witnesses, saying
their identities would only be disclosed to judges who will review
the matter if, as expected, lawyers for Salinas challenge the
confiscation of his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in early 1997, for reasons that remain unclear, the
spigot of American assistance opened wider. The Justice Department
arranged for Swiss interviews with almost a dozen more witnesses,
officials said, including at least three convicted drug smugglers
who offered detailed information linking Salinas to specific
payoffs. Mexican officials also produced records showing that
during the last half of his brother's six-year administration, Raul
Salinas had made huge deposits in Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mrs. del Ponte said the evidence made it clear
that he had been ``directly involved in receiving money for
protecting the shipment of tons of cocaine through Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how Salinas might have arranged such protection _
despite never working in law-enforcement and having left the
government altogether in 1992 _ was a question law-enforcement
officials struggled to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they determined that Salinas had dealings
with several senior Mexican law-enforcement officials, each of whom
has since been accused publicly of taking bribes. But the only one
of those former officials to ever be charged with drug offenses,
Mario Ruiz Massieu, has shown little promise as a government
witness.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that drug-enforcement agents in Mexico
City, Houston and El Paso who tried to build their own case against
Salinas were able to find several informants by the spring of 1997
who told of drug payoffs that Raul Salinas supposedly received. Two
of those witnesses, in particular, gave detailed accounts of having
seen Salinas meeting with major drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most important informants were taken from Mexico to
Texas, officials said, where they submitted to lie-detector tests
and appeared at first to be telling the truth. But under what
agents described as unusual high-level pressure to recheck the
men's stories, they were given further tests in which they appeared
to be less candid. In May 1997, officials said, the United States
Attorney in San Antonio abandoned the case entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was an enormous political component to the
case,'' one former law-enforcement official who worked on it said.
``But the Justice Department, without ever saying so, appeared not
to want us to deal with the political targets. They wanted us just
to concentrate on the drug traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions have been raised following the announcement in
April by Citibank's parent company, Citicorp, that it will merge
with Travelers Group Inc. _ a $70-billion corporate marriage that
could conceivably snag if the bank is ensnared in a major
money-laundering case. Justice Department officials declined to
discuss the Salinas investigation in detail. But they denied that
their problems in making a case had anything to do with political
or foreign-policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Still more doubts about Washington's coordination of the Salinas
case were raised by two other key witnesses, a Chilean-born
computer expert named Guillermo Pallomari and a Colombian cocaine
trafficker named Jose Manuel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Pallomari, a former aide to the main boss of the Cali cocaine
cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, fled Colombia in August 1995
after threats on his life and was interviewed by American
drug-enforcement agents for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   But officials familiar with the debriefings said he was never
asked in detail how the Colombians had protected their shipments
through Mexico, and some officials were stunned to learn what
Pallomari, now a protected witness, told the Swiss last Nov. 19 at
a Federal prison facility in southern Virginia where American
officials took him to be debriefed.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials familiar with his debriefings and a
partial transcript of his statement recently published in the
Mexican newspaper El Universal, Pallomari said the Colombians began
to strengthen their partnership with Carrillo, the Mexican
trafficker, in about 1992, after problems with their operations in
the Caribbean. Rodriguez Orejuela also tried to replicate in Mexico
the network of political protection he had established in Colombia,
Pallomari said.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, the informant said, Cali bosses drafted a manual on
political corruption and sent a copy to Carrillo. They also
funnelled some $80 million in bribe money to Mexico _ about half of
which was supposed to have gone to Raul Salinas to assure the
compliance of his brother's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pallomari said the money was sent with cocaine loads, deposited
with front companies, or paid through a Bolivian intermediary whom
the Colombians stationed in Mexico. On one occasion, he said, Raul
Salinas intervened at the Colombians' request to get back most of a
five-ton cocaine load the police had seized in Acapulco in early
1994 with American help. Pallomari also showed the Swiss how
payments to Mexican politicians were reflected in a partial set of
1994 accounting ledgers that were seized from the Cali cartel by an
elite Colombian police unit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Pallomari's story had some inconsistencies, but
they did not question that it might have been vital to the
drug-enforcement agents in Texas who were then trying to tie
Salinas to Carrillo `s enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, those agents did not learn even the outlines of
Pallomari's account until a year and a half after he came under
American protection. When law-enforcement officials from around the
country caucused in El Paso in January 1997 to assemble the
available evidence against Carrillo's organization, officials said,
Pallomari's information was about the best they had against
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   But Pallomari was unavailable. Federal prosecutors in Miami said
they could not loan their witness until they had finished their own
case against the Cali gang. Long before they did, the
drug-conspiracy case that might have linked Salinas to Carrillo
collapsed when the trafficker died after plastic surgery last July.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. prosecutors were apparently even less successful in
coordinating the information offered by Ramos, a former lieutenant
to the Colombian drug cartel based in the city of Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   According to two people familiar with Ramos' case, he approached
prosecutors in Houston in 1991, the year he was sentenced on drug
charges to two life terms in prison. He had met Raul Salinas in the
late 1980s, he told them, and had contracted with him to arrange
and protect the landing of drug planes in different parts of
northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One American official said doubts lingered about part of Ramos'
account, and his credibility was challenged by a federal prosecutor
who did not believe he had been forthright about another Colombian
drug operation that had been discovered in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramos also offered unusual documentation to corroborate his
claims: encoded payment ledgers, photographs and even a special
Mexican passport he had received under the carefully chosen alias
``Alejandro Salinas.'' Still, two people familiar with the case
said Ramos was all but ignored until late 1997, when the U.S.
Customs Service arranged for him to be interviewed by a federal
prosecutor in New York and then by the Swiss authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked on the door several times,'' one of those people
said. ``He was rebuffed each and every time.''

   NEW YORK _ The director Andrei Serban, late of the Romanian
National Theater and now the head of Columbia University's graduate
acting program, returns to the Public Theater after a 16-year
hiatus with Shakespeare's ``Cymbeline,'' at ``Shakespeare in
Central Park.'' The production stars Michael Hall as Posthumus
Leonatus and Liev Schreiber, seen recently in the films
``Twilight'' and ``Sphere,'' as the nasty Iachimo. ``Cymbeline''
begins previews Tuesday night and runs through Aug. 30.

   NEW YORK _ Talk about life imitating art. Just minutes before
``Civil Disturbances: Battles for Justice in New York City,'' an
installation by the activist collective Repohistory, was scheduled
to open on May 19, the city prohibited the use of lampposts to
display public art. On July 23, the city reversed itself and
granted a permit to the collective.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning in St. Andrew Plaza in Foley Square,
Repohistory will install the last 12 of 40 street signs. No mere
pedestrian aids, these: The 21-by-36-inch metal signs present
visual histories of landmark issues in public-interest law. A red
background frames a T-shirt-clad woman to honor Berkman vs. FDNY,
which opened the door for women to become firefighters in New York
City; ``R' You Looking at Me?'' floats above a figure of a child in
a sign referring to Marisol vs. Giuliani, the pending class action
suit about child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The signs line the sidewalks near the courthouses in which many
of these cases were heard. A favorite of Repohistory: a tribute to
Bery vs. City of New York, the 1996 ruling that secured public art
as a form of free speech.

   Brian Dennehy will play Willy Loman in ``Death of a Salesman''
at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, with Robert Falls directing. The
two teamed up at the Goodman on ``The Iceman Cometh,'' ``Galileo''
and ``A Touch of the Poet.'' Previews for ``Salesman'' begin on
Sept. 29; the play runs through Nov. 8. Dennehy's current project
is ABC's miniseries of Tom Clancy's ``Net Force,'' with Scott
Bakula and Kris Kristofferson.

   The Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore can finally dust off much
of its renowned Egyptian art collection, thanks to an award of
$325,270 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The award,
to be used for the reinstallation of the collection in the wing
known as the 1974 Building, which is undergoing an $18.5 million
renovation, will provide display space for artifacts not seen since
the early part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The new space will leave visitors with the sense of being
transported back 5,000 years to an ancient Egyptian temple, a
museum spokesman said. But time travelers must wait: The wing won't
reopen until the spring of 2001.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pierre Bonnard is the big draw at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City this summer. The National Gallery of Art in
Washington is celebrating Mark Rothko. The Children's Museum in
Boston, meanwhile, has mounted its own blockbuster, starring Arthur
Read. As just about anyone age 8 or so and under knows, Arthur Read
is not a painter. Arthur is a smart, sweet, slightly neurotic,
8-year-old aardvark whose family life, adventures and problems are
chronicled in the best-selling children's book series by Marc Brown
and in the spinoff public television show.
</P>
<P>
   True to his last name, Arthur loves to read. The son of an
accountant and a caterer, he has a gutsy, pesky 4-year-old sister
named D.W., a baby sister named Kate, a gang of loyal friends and a
taskmaster of a third-grade teacher named Ratburn. Arthur was a
natural for the Children's Museum, said Lou Casagrande, the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to find kids' cultural icons whose values and
message we can get behind,'' Casagrande said. ``We want to be hip
and relevant to kids and families. We don't want to be dealing with
esoteric topics all the time, but yet we don't want to go to the
other extreme of just being total fun because we are in the
educational business.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Children's Museum is not Disneyworld. ``We
would not do Pocahontas,'' Casagrande said. ``We would not do
anything related to Disney movies. Disney creates a presentation
standard that we aspire to. We just don't think their message is
deep enough and rich enough for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the crowds of families that have been lining up for
``Arthur's World,'' as the exhibition is called, children don't
require the museum to be Disney. Arthur opened in May, and
attendance is up 40 percent this summer over last summer. The show
is to run for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's partner in ``Arthur's World'' is WGBH, the Boston
public television station, which produces the Arthur series. Brown,
who is 51 and lives in Hingham, Mass., is a consultant. He dreamed
up the aardvark in 1976 when his young son asked him for a bedtime
story about ``a weird animal.'' Arthur is a worrier. He worries
that his nose is too long. He worries that his friends will make
fun of his new glasses. Despite his obvious talent, he worries that
he is not a good writer.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a lot like Arthur. And while his books have sold more
than 10 million copies, he says it was a bit overwhelming to show
up at the opening and see a 22-foot-tall inflatable Arthur seated
on the museum roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the strongest desire to shout, `Arthur, what are you
doing up there?''' Brown said. ```Arthur, get away from the edge,
get back!'''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Museum, which was founded in 1913 by science
teachers, is considered a pioneer in the hands-on, object-based
approach to learning. It is not a place for standing in front of
works of art and speaking in hushed voices.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, the staff has made the decision not even to
hang children's artwork on the walls. Children aren't particularly
interested in that sort of thing, says Joanne Rizzi, the museum's
cultural program director, who developed the Arthur exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum is not intended to be about children but for
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Part school, part community center, part playground, it is a
place where children can float handmade boats along a 28-foot,
800-gallon tank that is a model of the Fort Point Channel outside
the museum's window. They can put on life jackets and climb aboard
the Minnow, a life-size boat. As part of an exhibit about
construction, they can design and build skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   The other afternoon boys and girls from about age 2 to 8 were
hanging out in the Read Family Kitchen, reading Arthur books in the
Town Library, and lining up to meet Arthur (a stoical, unidentified
museum staffer sweating in a heavy costume). They were racing
through the Backyard Sleepover, with tents and flashlights and
sound effects, modeled on the one in the book, ``Arthur's First
Sleepover.'' And they were joining in a 25-minute play produced by
the museum's resident theater company, Citystage Company, about
Arthur's pet business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is, `Here's this great character,''' said Ms.
Rizzi, who was touring the exhibit. ``Use this place to explore.
Play in it, have a good time in it. And read, read, read.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ferguson, who was accompanied by his mother, Fran
Ferguson, was at a table in the library, writing Arthur a note:
``Hi, Arthur. I like you because we have something in common. We
are both in third grade and are 8 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. ``I have teacher trouble, too,'' said
Russell, who has 20-20 vision but often wears a pair of plastic
glasses in homage to his spectacled aardvark hero.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Carbonneau and her three children, Daniel, 8, Michaeala,
6, and Colleen, 4, were visiting from New Hampshire. ``We love
Arthur,'' said Mrs. Carbonneau, an occupational therapist. ``He's
like my family. The dad works, the mom works, they have problems,
they figure them out.''
</P>
<P>
   While other museums don't necessarily have to consider children
in creating exhibitions, the Children's Museum can't afford not to
think about adults. They are the ones, after all, who bring
children to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Arthur is that adults like Arthur, too,'' said
Leslie Swartz, vice president for development. ``He's not annoying.
He's a sympathetic character.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the museum's best-known shows, ``The Kids Bridge,''
developed by Ms. Rizzi and Aylette Jenness, was about cultural
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Being that he is an aardvark whose friends include a rabbit
named Buster and a bear named Brain, Arthur certainly transcends
race and ethnicity. ``It's purposefully designed to do that,''
Brown said. ``That's why I use different animals. You immediately
eliminate skin tone and any relationship to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur has plenty of problems, but one thing he does not have to
deal with is divorce. The Reads are happily married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready for his family to divorce, too,'' said Brown,
who went through a divorce shortly after he began the Arthur
series.
</P>
<P>
   But the author and his second wife, Laurie Krasny Brown, have
written ``Dinosaurs Divorce'' (Little, Brown), a catalog of divorce
information for families. And Brown says he would like his next
show at the museum to deal with divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to use Arthur's celebrity to do other things that
aren't as sexy,'' he said. ``Life is a series of problems, and this
is one of them.''

`MAXIMUM BOB' IS QUIRKY, IF NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ed note: Fixes spelling of Sonnenfeld in 5th to last graf)
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a tropical disturbance roiling in the Gulf, the comparisons
to ``Northern Exposure'' are starting to build. Similarities are
undeniable: quirky script, interesting cast, summer launch. If
``Maximum Bob'' can retain the slice 'n' dice edge of its pilot
episode _ and if ABC has the sense to stick with it as word of
mouth spreads _ we might have a keeper here.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that ABC is committed to only seven episodes of
``Bob'' while it gives ``NYPD Blue'' a late-summer breather.
``Northern Exposure'' had a similar limited run in the summer of
1990 and disappeared for seven months before returning to CBS's
regular schedule in April '91.
</P>
<P>
   'Course, ABC's recent track record with pithy, provocative
programming is not reassuring. Jettisoned titles spring readily to
mind like cherished blasts from the past: ``My So-called Life'',
``Relativity,'' ``Cracker,'' ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   On the pith meter, ``Maximum Bob'' falls short. But provocative?
Those who know Elmore Leonard's work can assume even a TV version
of ``Maximum Bob'' will be about as politically correct as a burp
in church.
</P>
<P>
   Judge ``Maximum Bob'' Gibbs is the tasteless, tactless,
shoot-from-the-lip kind of full-meal deal TV viewers haven't seen
since Archie Bunker. In these delicately sensitive times, he's
bound to knot the knickers of some group dedicated to the ethical
treatment of something. If a band of Catholics can find fault with
the caring, compassionate priest of ``Nothing Sacred,'' someone is
bound to complain about Bob, who ignores the law, bullies
defendants, stereotypes ethnic groups and, with the help of an
ornery alligator, tries to frighten his semi-estranged and
completely loopy wife into leaving him.
</P>
<P>
   Bob is an all-around despicable guy, and Beau Bridges plays him
with relish and a side of ham. More to the point, Bridges makes him
believable and downright likable.
</P>
<P>
   So consider this fair warning. Pay a visit to ``Maximum Bob''
Tuesday night, and don't worry too much if the TV gets wet. Gibbs
lives in a place called Deepwater, Fla., after all, and he's the
creation of a novelist whose characters are splashier than anything
on ``Shark Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The title character is a flamboyant Florida hangin' judge who is
tough on crime, tougher on common sense. His rulings don't fit the
law of logic, but Bob is a politician, and flouting convention gets
more notice than flaunting congeniality. Living life large also
helps.
</P>
<P>
   Any performer would dive into such a role. In keeping with Bob's
big-boy persona, Bridges' dive of choice seems to have been the
cannonball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be accused of chewing the scenery,'' Bridges
told a group of TV critics recently, ``but when you get the green
light, hey, you know, go for it. You don't have too many times in
your career where you can get that wild and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, ``Maximum Bob'' was to have been a Barry Sonnenfeld
feature film in the manner of ``Get Shorty,'' another darkly funny
Leonard novel. But Leonard's gift for goofiness prompted Sonnenfeld
to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry decided he really wanted to do it as a television series
because he loved the characters and thought they would endure,''
said Barry Josephson, Sonnenfeld's production partner.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, ABC ordered 12 episodes plus the pilot, then halved
the order when executives decided on the summertime launch. ABC
won't say that it cut back out of fear that ``Bob'' might offend
advertisers, but a summer launch is certainly a lower-profile,
lower-risk option. If it catches on, terrific. If no one watches,
the world will have forgotten it in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, the Sonnenfeld camp seems willing to buy
ABC's reasoning. Though admitting to some hurt feelings when told
of the change order, Josephson said he is now enthusiastic about
premiering the show outside the clutter of fall or midseason
launches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured they only had six to seven slots for us and there
was no need to do 12,'' he said. ``Just do six or seven, see what
kind of a response we got, and then hopefully come back
midseason.''
</P>
<P>
   All seven episodes, shot in Florida, have been completed, so
cast and crew can do nothing now but wait for audience response.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges is philosophical about the chances of returning after
the seven-episode teaser. ``I learned a long time ago,'' he said,
``not to have any expectations as far as longevity goes in a
television series.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't mind another crack at playing Maximum Bob to the
max, even if Bob doesn't set well with the pooh-bahs of political
correctitude. As Bob says early in Tuesday night's episode, ``We do
things a little unorthodox around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges is happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry (Sonnenfeld) encouraged me,'' Bridges disclosed. ``He
said, `You've got an outrageous guy there.' So I can get about as
crazy as I can get because there are a lot of people that live in
Deepwater that can put me in line when I get too crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is a voluble public defender named Kathy Baker,
played not by Kathy Baker but by Liz Vassey (``All My Children'').
Baker, whose husband has left her for a dental assistant, arrives
in Deepwater on a temporary assignment but stays in town after
deciding there's no reason to go home to Miami and ample reason to
keep somebody like Judge Gibbs on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot episode, Vassey is charming and feisty, but the
least convincing of the principal players. She seems unsure if
she's performing in a drama or a comedy, which may have to do with
Sonnenfeld's attempt to give TV audiences a lighter version of
Elmore Leonard. (Script writer and executive producer Alex Gansa
has explained that if a cancer were to occur in the book, it would
be malignant, and if there were one in the series, it would be
benign.)
</P>
<P>
   Sam Robards plays the other setup role more effectively, making
it clear that the widowed sheriff, Gary Hammond, is the voice of
reason in Deepwater.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum Bob's wife, Leanne Lancaster, is the opposite of reason.
Leanne is the one-time star of an R-rated underwater mermaid act
whose near-drowning gave her special psychic ability, not to
mention a second personality _ that of a 12-year-old slave girl _
who emerges when Leanne least expects it to. It may be a juicier
role than even Bob's, and an inspired Kiersten Warren squeezes
every drop from it.
</P>
<P>
   Though billed as a humorous drama, ``Maximum Bob'' is broader
and sillier than ``Northern Exposure,'' and it might be more
fitting to classify it as a seriocomedy in the tradition of another
Sonnenfeld film, ``Men in Black,'' and certainly in keeping with
last season's biggest surprise, ``Ally McBeal,'' which is competing
for awards in the comedy category.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's a refreshing summertime julep that would
improve ABC's lineup in all seasons.
</P>

`DREAM CHILDREN': A MAN AMONG WOMEN AS DELUDED AS HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, Oliver Gold, the philosopher ``hero'' of A.N.
Wilson's 17th novel, seems like a satire on Iris Murdoch's
charismatic genius figures _ one of those charming, controlling
priest-types who surround themselves with admiring groupies and
disciples. There is a more sinister side to Oliver, however, and
the gradual revelation of his secret life will turn ``Dream
Children'' from a typical Wilson comedy of manners into something
darker and more disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, we're told, has been hailed as ``the Ruskin or the Mill
de notre epoque'' and is rumored to be working on a great novel
that would ``take its place beside Mann, Proust, Dostoyevsky.''
He's the sort of man whose idea of a good time is holing up alone
in a cabin and re-reading the complete works of Hegel in German.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is idolized by students, respected by colleagues and
worshiped by women. In particular, worshiped by the women with whom
he shares a house at 12 Wagner Rise in London: Catharine Cuffe, a
former student who thinks of herself as his intellectual soul mate;
Cuffe's friend, Michal Rose, a social worker, who falls
passionately in love with him; Michal's mother, Janet, a literary
hanger-on who desperately covets his intellectual cachet; Michal's
10-year-old daughter, Bobs, who sees him as a playmate, father
figure and best friend, and Bobs' nanny, Lotte, an odd young woman
with a hysterical streak.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly placid household at 12 Wagner Rise (another one of
those insular little worlds that Wilson loves to depict) is
abruptly shaken one morning when news arrives that Oliver is
planning to get married _ not to one of his longtime admirers, but
to a vile American interloper named Camilla Baynes. The arrival of
Camilla and her redoubtable mother, Rosalie, sets off a series of
confrontations and subterfuges, and those intrigues will in turn
threaten to expose Oliver's deepest, most shameful secret.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, Oliver has a passion for little
girls _ more specifically, a passion for little Bobs, his ``dream
child,'' with whom he has been having an ``affair'' for several
years. Oliver is not just a dirty old man with no regard for the
emotional damage he has inflicted on the child; he's also a wildly
selfish egotist who believes his status as a genius entitles him to
play by different rules than the ``evil, lumpen people'' who would
regard Bobs as his victim.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has concocted a host of rationalizations to reconcile his
actions with his assertion that his life ``had been a dedicated
pursuit of virtue.'' He has even convinced himself that his secret
diaries recording his obsession with Bobs will one day be
recognized as a work of art, superior to Rousseau's
``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, however, Oliver knows that people are not
ready for his ``great love story,'' and he's distraught that
someone _ no doubt one of the women at 12 Wagner Rise _ has stolen
a copy of his secret manuscript. Should he be exposed as a pervert,
Oliver thinks, he will have to kill Bobs, and then kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   These melodramatic events are related by Wilson's omniscient
narrator with cool aplomb, and nimbly orchestrated to re-examine
two of the author's perennial themes: the dichotomy of innocence
and experience and the difficulty of knowing another human being.
Wilson has modulated his usual light, comic voice to accommodate
his dark subject matter, producing a novel that's both chilling in
its depiction of a madman and biting in its portrayal of a group of
self-deluding bohemians.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every character in this novel is revealed to be in the
grip of a serious delusion. Oliver, of course, convinces himself _
and his groupies _ that he is a kind of ``secular saint.'' Cuffe
tells herself that she really understands her former professor.
Michal pretends that she has found in Oliver the perfect baby
sitter for her daughter. And Janet persuades herself that she is
still a player in the literary world. Needless to say, the price of
their collective illusions will be the shattered innocence of a
10-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson uses his sharp wit to capture the foibles of his
characters: he coyly mocks their fondness for trendy bohemian poses
and eviscerates their penchant for using convoluted intellectual
arguments to justify their moral lapses. With his supporting cast,
however, he tempers his satiric impulse with sympathy and
psychological insight to show just how ordinary people may find
their own weaknesses creating an emotional snowball that can
flatten themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   For all its allusions to ``Lolita,'' ``Dream Children'' does not
have the complexity or nuance of Nabokov's masterpiece _ but then
it does not aspire to. Still, it marks a darkening and deepening of
Wilson's ambition; it's a far cry indeed from his early, purely
comic novels like ``Love Unknown'' and ``Who Was Oswald Fish?,''
which often seemed like simple display cases for his fluent writing
talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream Children'' may start out, like so many Wilson novels, as
an innocuous domestic watercolor, but it ends up mutating into
something closer to one of those creepy Balthus paintings of
children that reverberate with menace and dread.

CONCORD GROUP SAYS NOW IS THE TIME TO FIX SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Martha Phillips, the director of the
deficit-fighting Concord Coalition, said Monday that a rare
combination of factors makes this a ripe time to repair the Social
Security System, which says it faces financial difficulties in
coming years as the number of retirees rises sharply.
</P>
<P>
   She said those factors include a relatively small retired
population, a relatively large working population, plus a strong
economy and a president who understands Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, we've got a window of opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security analysts say the retirement program will run out
of money in the 21st century as baby boomers retire and outnumber
workers, who contribute to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is exploring different solutions to the funding
problem, including a boost in Social Security taxes and cuts in
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips made her comments during a debate over whether to make
changes in the Social Security System. The debate was sponsored by
the Preamble Center, a nonprofit economic research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., another participant, said Congress is
too willing to postpone consideration of Social Security's future.
Lawmakers need to find a solution while the current system is
financially secure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of Social Security has been based on confidence,''
he said, and changes should be made while Americans still believe
in the system.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to solve the problem, Kolbe and Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, last month introduced legislation that would
allow individuals to invest two percentage points of the current
12.4 percent payroll tax in private markets instead of paying the
entire tax into the system.

NEW ZEALANDER WITH AIDS SEEKS RETURN TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A New Zealand AIDS patient who lived and worked
in San Francisco for most of the 28 years he spent in this country
plans to risk arrest by returning this week in defiance of U.S.
immigration policy barring HIV-infected foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Christopher Arnesen, 56, say the move could provoke
a confrontation with Immigration and Naturalization Service agents.
The man is scheduled to arrive at the San Francisco International
Airport Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm extremely concerned,'' Arnesen said in an
interview Friday from Christchurch. ``But there are principles
involved here and if I back down now, it would be a disappointment
to the people who have supported me.''
</P>
<P>
   INS District Director Thomas Schiltgen declined comment on the
case Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Arnesen is a one-time tour guide and photographer who lived in
San Francisco from 1966 to 1994 as a permanent resident under
federal law. He said he contracted the human immunodeficiency virus
_ which has since developed into AIDS _ from a 1984 blood
transfusion in Rwanda, following a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   He has paid nearly $200,000 in Social Security taxes, he said,
and now wants to claim a monthly disability benefit of $726 owed to
him, he said, since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Catch-22, however, and only federal authorities _ or a
judge _ can cut through it: The Social Security Administration
requires one month of residency in the United States every six
months before it pays benefits to foreigners who have worked here.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS won't let Arnesen back in under a federal
``loathsome or contagious diseases'' law barring many visitors who
have AIDS or other communicable illnesses, or who are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Arnesen, who has no relatives in the United States, said he
returned to New Zealand after being diagnosed in 1993 to be near
his family and because a Social Security representative said he had
to apply for disability benefits from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was patently false. But Arnesen's attorneys
acknowledge they have no proof he was misinformed because he hasn't
been able to provide the name of the Social Security representative
or the date he met that person.
</P>
<P>
   Growing more and more ill, he was unable to return to the United
States to renew his permanent residency status within the required
12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute arose as to whether Arnesen had legally ``abandoned''
his permanent residency status. Eventually, he won that part of the
battle, but now that he is better because of improved AIDS drugs,
the INS won't let him back in because of his medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These policies are just wrong,'' said one of Arnesen's
lawyers, Kristen Jensen of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. policy excluding foreigners with AIDS is the harshest and
most restrictive of virtually any country. The other issue is that
Chris completely embraced this country. He paid into the system the
way every citizen and permanent resident does. He did everything
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when he became too sick to contribute any more and was
entitled to get something back, this gauntlet was thrown down for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security spokeswoman Linda Claramo said her agency had
reviewed Arnesen's case, determined he is eligible for benefits and
felt ``very sympathetic'' to him. But it can find no exception to
the law requiring residency, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has reciprocity agreements on pension and
disability benefits with 14 nations, but no agreement with New
Zealand. As a result, attorneys said, there are 18,600 non-U.S.
citizens in New Zealand and other nations who are entitled to
Social Security benefits but can't get them without fulfilling the
two-months-a-year residency requirement.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Small wine makers, increasingly cut off from
joining the point-and-click world of Internet commerce, are turning
from statehouses to courthouses in their feud with the wholesalers
who control much of the United States' $90 billion alcohol trade.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past half-dozen years, direct wine sales quietly
blossomed into a $300 million a year business and many wineries say
their only entree into some states is by mail order and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But they collided with a government-sanctioned system where
licensed wholesalers control the flow of wine, beer and liquor
between manufacturers and retailers. Direct shipments violate state
laws and threaten to carve profits from the powerful middlemen who
have dominated the industry since Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen states have made it a felony to sidestep the
hour-glass-shaped system. Several others are considering similar
measures and Congress also may act soon. Altogether, 44 states
place some restriction on direct shipments.
</P>
<P>
   In a counterattack, the wine industry has won five straight
legal skirmishes with opponents of direct wine shipments. And its
strategists are discussing a more ambitious challenge to the entire
system with an eye on the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind set in the wine industry has been to go at this
legislature by legislature, but we haven't had enormous success,''
said Bill Nelson, vice president of the American Vintners
Association. ``Ultimately, it may not be possible to get the states
to drop the barriers that protect local wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may require a court test,'' Nelson said. ``My personal view
is leaning that way.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more California wine makers share Nelson's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our mission,'' said Bill MacIver, president of
Matanzas Creek Winery in Santa Rosa, California, and the Coalition
for Fair Trade, an industry organization in the forefront of the
direct-shipping fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wine makers say that they're fighting for survival in a
competitive market and that wholesalers, with a near-monopoly
stranglehold on distribution systems, are unable or unwilling to
stock inventories from the nearly 2,000 small wineries across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the wholesalers have a distinctly different view.
</P>
<P>
   They present themselves as an efficient collector of state
excise taxes on alcohol _ and the final bulwark against underage
drinking, citing well-publicized sting operations in New York,
Maryland and elsewhere that tracked Internet wine orders by
teen-age decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers are trying to enlist anti-smoking groups in the
fight against direct shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes on their radar, I can't see them doing anything
else,'' said Doug Metz, executive vice president of the Wine and
Spirits Wholesalers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers group represents 200 of the largest wine, beer
and spirits distributors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating their lucrative position in the alcohol trade, the
largest wholesaler, Miami-based Southern Wine and Spirits, which
does business in California and seven other states, had revenues of
$2.3 billion in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Both the wine industry and the wholesalers finance large
lobbying operations in Washington and all 50 state capitals, and
they are among the most generous campaign contributors, accounting
for more than $1.1 million in donations to congressional candidates
in the 1997-98 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over direct shipping involves a 65-year-old regulatory
scheme that grew out of Prohibition and stands on three legs:
politics, policy and profits.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, alcoholic beverages were prohibited by the U.S.
Constitution. But the dry years were anything but dry in many parts
of the country. New York, Ohio and some other states virtually
ignored the law and some California vintners used a
sacramental-wine loophole to make millions.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition ended in 1933 when the 21st Amendment was ratified
and Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon Act. Between them, these gave
states the authority to regulate alcohol sales, leading to a
present-day patchwork of wet and dry counties and the lone
exception to federal authority over interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Through the three-tier system, manufacturers are required to
sell their beer, wine and liquor to licensed wholesalers, who are
the sole suppliers for stores, bars, restaurants, sports arenas and
other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone except these small wineries consider that question
closed,'' said Art DeCelle, general counsel of the Beer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The system is lucrative. In 1996, the most recent year for which
estimates are available, Americans spent $96 billion on alcoholic
beverages _ almost all of which passed through a licensed
distributor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   California, which produces more than 90 percent of the wine in
the country, is one of several states that have created exceptions
to the three-tier system to allow vintners and craft brewers to
sell wine or beer that they produce in tasting rooms or brew pubs.
The system is hardly universal: Visitors to the Jack Daniels
distillery in Tennessee, for example, can't buy samples there. It's
a dry county.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 100 wineries in the country produce more than 150,000
gallons a year, according to the American Vintners Association.
With their inventory, they have plenty to supply wholesalers across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most wineries produce much less and can't provide enough to
supply wholesalers that don't want to deal with odd lots of a few
dozen cases. For them, vintners say, the only way to expand their
market is to sell a few bottles at a time by mail order or the
Internet to customers outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000-case Brutacao Winery in California's Mendocino County
has arrangements with distributors in about 15 states but makes
additional sales via direct shipment. It had to cancel deliveries
to Georgia after the state declared such imports a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is another state that has made direct shipments a
felony. Brutacao, which used to ship about four cases a year on its
own, has signed up with The Great House of Wine, a Web site
designed to comply with the state law by aligning itself with a
licensed wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's four cases of wine that we would ordinarily not be able
to sell,'' said Steve Brutacao.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers, however, have challenged some of those arrangements
in court. So far, those efforts have failed, most recently last
week in Massachusetts where a judge ruled that wholesalers could
not use federal courts to block direct shipments by Virtual
Vineyards through Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers have had some successes in state legislatures,
pressing the felony measures that passed in Florida, Georgia,
Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana and Kentucky. And even in
wine-friendly California, they bottled up a resolution opposing
federal legislation against direct shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The federal proposal, which would authorize federal courts to
enforce state criminal statutes against direct shipments, is
stalled in the House Judiciary Committee but wholesalers believe
they may be able to push the measure through the U.S. Senate by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also pending in Congress is a bill to make it a federal crime
for courier companies like United Parcel Service to deliver alcohol
to a minor. One courier, Airborne Express, quit shipping alcohol
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several widely publicized sting operations, vintners
insist that shipments to minors aren't a significant problem, and
their view is shared by Manny Espinoza, chief of the California
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wine Institute, which represents many of the largest
vintners, direct shipment is given a high priority. But officials
there are reluctant to drop lobbying efforts in favor of lawsuits.
``We still think state-by-state is a smart way to go, but it's hard
sailing,'' said Bobby Koch, senior vice president of the
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost more than $1 million and take as long as five
years to get a challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court, but looking at
the mixed record in state capitals and recent successes in court,
others say the time is ripe for a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our only chance,'' MacIver said.

 LABELS STILL CAN'T SUGGEST WINE'S HEALTH BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A four-month standoff over labels touting the
health value of sipping wine shows little sign of ending any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of wine-industry lobbying, federal regulators
were prepared to approve labels distinguishing wine from beer and
other alcoholic beverages earlier this year but postponed action
indefinitely following complaints from Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some vintners are optimistic about a breakthrough this fall, but
Thurmond vowed to prevent any relaxation of the warning that
currently appears on all wine bottles.
</P>
<P>
   He also has introduced legislation to make the warnings more
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the regulatory decision, Thurmond's bill is bottled up and
unlikely to move before the Senate adjourns for the year in early
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not move,'' Thurmond's spokesman John DeCrosta
said. ``But if it doesn't move, it will be one of the first bills
introduced next year.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCrosta added, ``The only change he's willing to see is for
that warning label to get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's less the legislation than the ability of a single
senator to tie up business that creates leverage for Thurmond, who
sponsored the 1988 measure that required labels warning that
alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause birth defects and
that it can impair driving ability.
</P>
<P>
   Before any new labels can be used, they must be approved by the
U.S. Treasury Department, which regulates alcohol at the federal
level. Treasury also has three appointees awaiting Senate
confirmation, any one of which could be blocked by Thurmond if the
new labels are authorized over his objections.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 6 letter to Thurmond, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
flatly stated that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
``plans to approve the use of these labels'' but an ATF spokesman
said it's unclear when _ or if _ final action will be taken on the
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``No final decision has been made,'' ATF spokesman Art Resnick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners, who want to separate themselves from the beer and
liquor industries, have spent the past several years trying to
persuade federal regulators to add labels to wine bottles
encouraging people to consult their physicians or Food and Drug
Administration dietary guidelines about the benefits of wine
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   FDA guidelines say that moderate consumption of wine can reduce
the risk of coronary disease for some people. They also warn,
however, that heavy use can contribute to cancer, heart attacks,
liver disease and other maladies.
</P>
<P>
   But lobbyists for the wine industry, who were confident of
approval as recently as March, now say they don't know when a
decision will be forthcoming. ``This has been going on too long for
me to make a prediction,'' said Bobby Koch, senior vice president
of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: NEWPORT FOLK, HOW IT'S CHANGED

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Newport Folk Festival tour, which presented nine
singers and songwriters at the Jones Beach Theater on Sunday,
invokes an illustrious name.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport Folk Festivals of the early 1960s, held in Newport,
R.I., were watersheds of the folk revival, the postwar movement
that brought ``hootenanny'' into the American vocabulary and put a
guitar in every dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Newport festival continues (ending in Los
Angeles on Sept. 20), the Film Forum begins a weeklong engagement
on Friday for ``Festival,'' Murray Lerner's documentary of Newport
Folk Festivals from 1963 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the film and the festival in the same week _ with Joan
Baez in the lineup of both _ leads to one conclusion. While the old
Newport might recognize and appreciate its descendant, it would
certainly be surprised at what the young whippersnapper is up to.
</P>
<P>
   Between Newport then and Newport now, the notion of folk music
has been transformed. It was already happening in the years that
``Festival'' documents, when sacred-harp hymn singers and Delta
bluesmen shared lineups with pop hit-makers like Peter, Paul and
Mary (who, unfortunately, dominate the film).
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s Newport festivals, the divergent strains of
tradition, protest, personal statement and pop ambition were all
revolutionized by Bob Dylan. ``Bob really created a whole mess,''
Loudon Wainwright III said admiringly at Jones Beach. When the dust
cleared, what emerged as ``folk'' was a gentle strain of pop.
</P>
<P>
   At Jones Beach, the word ``folk'' designated a texture _ music
centered on acoustic guitar, or piano in a pinch _ and a style of
songwriting that prizes introspection, storytelling and literary
touches. Sincerity prevailed, though not entirely; Wainwright and
the Violent Femmes had their own kinds of irony, sly and wild-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   The current folk audience expects to hear memories, character
sketches and hints of philosophy; it expects to share intimate
thoughts and reflections shaped by a songwriter's gifts. And the
voices were generally earnest, though John Hiatt cut loose with
soul-style whoops and hollers; two of his songs cited a figure the
old folk singers tried to ignore, Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Current folky songwriters reveal private preoccupations. At
Jones Beach, Suzanne Vega sang with breathiness and precision about
desire _ illicit, remembered, new _ and about power differences,
between David and Goliath or a child and his abusive parents. Marc
Cohn sang hymnlike ruminations about history's aftermath in the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Nanci Griffith, whose group reconstitutes the sound of the Band,
sang about journeys, lost love and a halcyon past; the chirpiness
is weathering out of her voice, though she still has a taste for
saccharine messages.
</P>
<P>
   At the old Newport, and in much of the 1960s revival, folk was
used in its more academic sense, designating music created and
transmitted by nonprofessionals. Most of the performers in
``Festival'' weren't telling their own stories or singing their own
songs; their material is by Traditional, Anonymous and
half-remembered blues and gospel sources.
</P>
<P>
   They presented themselves as preservers and disciples of
venerable styles, holding onto music that was homemade and proud of
its distance from the machinations of commercial pop. Performers
certainly had egos, but they were careful to preach their humility
and loyalty to roots.
</P>
<P>
   David Bromberg, making a rare appearance, was a partial echo of
the old Newport. He played embittered my-baby-left-me blues and
picked light-fingered, curlicued leads on his acoustic guitar. He
adds his own tangent to tradition: garrulous rants that land
halfway between Bible Belt preaching and Borscht Belt comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Violent Femmes, meanwhile, honored tradition by twisting it
completely. Harking back to the influential ``Anthology of American
Folk Music,'' the 1958 collection of rural performers singing
harrowing stories of death and misfortune, the Violent Femmes used
the sounds of Celtic ballads and skiffle blues to carry tales of
sociopaths and drug casualties; Tony Trischka, a banjo virtuoso,
sat in with the Femmes while Gordon Gano sang about a father
throwing his daughter down a well.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the folk revival _ a part that would echo through rock,
punk and hip-hop _ was the idea that everyone could be a musician.
``Festival'' shows crowds arriving at Newport carrying not just
guitars but also banjos and setting up at the campgrounds to plunk
washtub basses and tap along on junk percussion. When Bob Dylan
asks an audience to lend him an E harmonica, at least three are
heard as they land on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Baez pops up often in ``Festival'' to add a harmony, and
she did the same at Jones Beach, singing with Bromberg and with Ms.
Griffith, who returned the favor during her set. Still, the
audience didn't seem to be carrying any instruments, and when Ms.
Vega cued it to sing along on ``Tom's Diner,'' they couldn't carry
a tune either.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1960s, folk was starting to divide. But topical
songwriters papered over their differences with pure archivists by
using old melodies to carry new agitprop. Bruce Cockburn held onto
that legacy, playing a Bo Diddley beat on a bodhran and singing
about land stolen from indigenous people. But the core of his set
was musical, not verbal: intricate, resonant guitar patterns that
were inextricable from his meditations on trouble and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baez tried to squeeze current songs, like Richard Shindell's
``Reunion Hill,'' into didactic categories like anti-war; she also
sang the oldest song in the program, the union anthem ``Joe Hill.''
But the way she sings it now, it's not a rallying cry. It's a
tribute to an individual: one more sign of folk music's
metamorphosis from the people's music to music that gets personal.

BRITAIN JOURNAL: LORDS OF THE MANNER BUT MAYBE NOT OF THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Now is not a good time to be a peer of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   Derided by the foreign secretary as ``medieval lumber,''
routinely lampooned for being out of date and out of touch, the
country's 700 or so hereditary peers, whose titles pass down from
generation to generation, are living on borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next year, the Labor government is likely to
introduce legislation that will strip all of them _ the dukes, the
marquesses, the earls, the viscounts and the barons _ of a right
that has been theirs for centuries, the right to sit and vote in
the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is simple. ``If I were in an aircraft and the
pilot said, `I am not a pilot myself, but my grandfather was a
pilot,' I would leave the plane at once,'' said Tony Benn, a Labor
member of Parliament who enjoyed a brief, shining moment as the
second Viscount Stansgate, but who went to court in 1963 to strip
himself of the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went to a dentist and he said, `I am not a dentist, but
my dad was a dentist in the 1920s _ open your mouth,' I would not
listen to him for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk understandably raises the hackles of people like Lord
Hastings, the 22nd in a baronial line that snakes spectacularly
back to 1290.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to repeat certain stereotypes and make fun of
us,'' Hastings said. ``Admittedly, the system is not democratic,
and nowadays everything has to be democratic. But hereditary peers
are not just landowners who are sitting there drawing rent.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to drive home that point, the House of Lords, the upper
house in Britain's legislature, has spent the last few months
demonstrating that there is life in the old institution yet.
Exercising its right to thwart the government by delaying
legislation by up to a year, it voted down, on more than 31
occasions, measures passed by the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent case, the lords overwhelmingly defeated a
measure that would have lowered the age of consent for gay sex to
16 from 18. The measure had been passed by a wide majority in the
Commons, and its defeat threatened to scuttle the government's
criminal justice bill, one of the legislative centerpieces of the
parliamentary session that ended on Friday. The government was
forced to give in and drop the measure from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's tabloid newspapers, which tend to portray the
aristocrats in the House of Lords as a bunch of Monty Pythonesque
upper-class twits, showered them with praise this time, calling
them members of the ``People's House of Lords.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the lords' debate included this remark from the
earl of Longford: ``A girl is not ruined for life by being seduced.
A young fellow is.'' (``Lord Longford is 92,'' Andrew Rawnsley
wrote in The Observer of London, ``but he acts like a man twice his
age.'')
</P>
<P>
   While the government says that such votes show the dangerous
ability of an unelected body to block the will of elected
representatives, defenders of the hereditary peers say they prove
just the opposite. Although the House of Lords is overwhelmingly
Conservative, they say, it serves as a valuable check on any
government too prone to using its huge majority to rush
ill-conceived legislation through the Commons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a reforming government which has introduced a number
of far-reaching bills that, in some cases, have not been very well
drafted and not very well thought out, and it is our duty to point
that out,'' said Lord Bridges, one of 323 ``cross-bench'' peers in
the House of Lords, meaning he has no party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   And Lord Raglan, another cross-bencher who, at the age of 70, no
longer attends the House of Lords much, said approvingly that the
lords had ``been showing some fight'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we don't have any constituents and you can't get
sacked, you are much freer to follow your own ideas,'' said Raglan,
who has never lived down his maiden speech to the House of Lords in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Lords, I am sorry that I have only just arrived,'' he told
the house then. ``I have had a series of misfortunes with my motor
car. I am covered in oil and quite flustered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite their heroic last stand, the peers are having a hard
time getting past formidable image problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't have any special qualifications or qualities
_ they might be prats, drug addicts, halfwits or deadbeats _ and
there's no reason for them to tell you or me what we should do,''
said Hilary Boyd, a writer whose grandfather was an earl but who
has no title of her own, because the peerage passed down the male
line of the family.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that in between discussing the pressing
issues of the day, members of the House of Lords have a tendency to
meander off on weird tangents.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, Lord Blyth initiated a debate about the
problem of spitting in public, particularly by sports figures. This
prompted Lord McIntosh, speaking on behalf of the government, to
concede that, yes, ``spitting is an unpleasant habit which sets a
poor example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spitting is one thing, but chewing gum is another,'' Viscount
Long declared. ``Would it not be an idea for the government to
introduce a bill banning chewing gum altogether?'' (It would not,
McIntosh responded.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty silly when you see some of them who are not
particularly bright,'' said Lord Finn, who, as the second son of an
earl, is not entitled to sit in the House of Lords. (The seat is
held by his brother, the Marquess of Bath, whose entry in ``Who's
Who'' includes the fact that a permanent collection of his own art
work is on display in his own house.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help when you see somebody who is a peer and is a
drug addict,'' said Finn. ``You think, `Oh my God, that man is a
hopeless case and he can come out of prison and he can sit in the
House of Lords.' That gives a bad name to the whole lot. They
should keep the good ones and sack the other ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest headache surrounding the impending lords reform is
that the government doesn't know what it will replace the
hereditary peers with. The current House of Lords includes 477 life
peers _ who are appointed by the government and who can't pass
their titles on when they die _ but the prospect of an upper house
full of government appointees doesn't hold much appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Dean, a life peer since 1983, said it wasn't fair to write
off the hereditaries, as peers generally call them, just because
they happened to be the son of the son of somebody who once
hobnobbed with a monarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bit unfair to lampoon them as a bunch of bloody
dumbos and nincompoops,'' said Dean, who was plain old Joe Dean
when he ran the Manchester City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are very talented and clever,'' he continued,
``and the life peers aren't overburdened with geniuses any more
than any other group.''

SOFTWARE MAKERS OFFER TO HELP ... THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)   (af)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With great fanfare, 23 software makers last week issued a policy
statement titled ``Ask, Tell &AMP; Help,'' promising to end a problem
that has frequently infuriated Windows 95 users _ programs that
automatically install themselves as ``default applications,'' the
software the operating system calls upon to open all files of a
certain type.
</P>
<P>
   A closer examination of the policy suggests that it might be
less a sincere effort by the developers _ including Netscape
Communications, Novell, Real Networks and Sun Microsystems _ to
restrain their own practices than an attempt to restrain Microsoft
from absorbing their products into the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, default applications are a great convenience
because they allow you to open a file by simply clicking on it.
</P>
<P>
   Most users want control over which program opens each type of
file, but some applications commandeer this responsibility without
notifying you.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that signed on to the policy statement pledged to
forgo such sneak attacks. But Microsoft Corp. is missing from the
list and it is Microsoft's Windows operating system _ specifically
the Windows registry _ that regulates which application opens any
given file type.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, a major reason that default applications are a
problem is that Windows makes changing such defaults mind-numbingly
complicated. For example, three years after the release of Windows
95, millions of users are still trying to figure out how to get
that persistent digital barnacle, the Inbox, off their desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is a declaration of restraint, promising that
henceforth each program will do three things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask the user for permission before becoming a default
application.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell the user of any limits on its ability to read and/or
write the types of files it is proposing to handle by default.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help users find other applications to open files that the
program itself cannot open.
</P>
<P>
   The third point is especially interesting. It states, ``If we
encounter a specific file that we cannot read or play, and if there
are other programs (freely downloadable over the Internet) from
other vendors that do play that file, we will point the user to
information on how he or she can download the third-party
program(s).''
</P>
<P>
   Has a wave of altruism rushed over the software industry? No.
What is really happening here is that these companies want
Microsoft to point you to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   From a technical standpoint, the pledge will work only if each
application obeys rules in the way it interacts with the operating
system, and those rules, for better or worse, are established by
Microsoft. But Yusuf Mehdi, the marketing director for Windows,
said on Friday that Microsoft had never been told of the principles
or consulted about them, much less asked to sign them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sneak attack on Microsoft,'' said Albert Lill, vice
president and research director of the Gartner Group, a management
consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. ``It sounds really great on
paper. Who could argue with it in principle? But it's untenable.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration's timing is also interesting. It came one week
after Robert Glaser, the chairman of Real Networks, complained to
the Senate Judiciary Committee that Microsoft's Windows Media
Player, a program that aggregates video and audio programs and then
acts as the default application for all of them, ``broke'' the
latest test version of his company's software.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Glaser was misinformed. A quick examination
by several independent companies revealed that a bug in Real
Networks' own software had caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that the declaration is an attempt to steer
attention away from Glaser's false accusation and back to the
larger issue: Microsoft's assertion of the default rights over
multimedia files.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that this and other examples of unauthorized
defaults ar a real issue, Lill pointed out that Microsoft ``owns
the guts of the system,'' that is, the Windows application
programming interfaces, which set out the rules for how any program
must interact with other programs and files.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Real Networks had played by the rules and wrapped its
player around Media Player, this wouldn't have been an issue,''
Lill said.
</P>
<P>
   So should software developers simply roll over and let Microsoft
dictate all the terms? No, Lill said, but the solution is a
dialogue rather than a statement of principles that he insists are
``technical nonsense'' and ``pure PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi is more diplomatic, describing the statement as ``a pretty
narrow view of a much broader and complicated issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that ill-conceived Windows defaults like Inbox are
``bumps along the learning process,'' Mehdi nonetheless insists:
``We're learning, and we're eager to cooperate with developers to
solve these problems. We couldn't survive if other companies
stopped developing programs for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves Windows users frustrated for want of a
solution, stranded somewhere between Mehdi's assurances of good
will and the perception on the part of 23 developers that they had
to make a public assertion of principles, however unworkable, to
get Microsoft's attention.

KODAK TO ACQUIRE MEDICAL IMAGING BUSINESS FROM IMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co. will buy Imation Corp.'s medical imaging
business for $520 million in cash, the companies announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal takes Imation, a potpourri of imaging businesses spun
off from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. in 1996, out of a
$535 million business that was strategically superfluous, even
though it accounted for much of Imation's recent growth and nearly
a quarter of its $2.2 billion of revenues in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal lets us focus more sharply on data storage and other
work-flow solutions,'' said William Monahan, Imation's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For Kodak, the deal has symbolic as well as strategic value. The
photography giant has been shrinking this year, lopping employees
and ancillary products as it labors to cut costs, fight erosion in
consumer films and stanch its bleeding digital portfolio. Last
month Kodak burst out of its earnings doldrums, announcing a 35
percent gain in second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread applause on Wall Street _ Kodak's stock rose
12 percent the day it released its earnings _ analysts cautioned
that Kodak still had to prove that it could increase its revenues.
They see the Imation acquisition as providing such proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kodak is no longer on the defensive, but is buying more
sales,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert,
Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   That is, in fact, how Kodak executives characterized the deal.
``This is another piece of the new Kodak, one that is central to
accelerating our growth,'' said Daniel Carp, Kodak's president.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Greene, Kodak's vice president for finance, said, ``This
demonstrates our willingness to enter transactions that have
strategic value and are sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few Wall Street naysayers emerged on the deal, positive
reaction could not save Kodak's stock from sliding in reaction to
jitters about shaky economies in Asia. Kodak shares closed at
$81.625, down $2.25, Monday. Shares of Imation, which said it would
use some of the $520 million to buy back stock, closed at $17.375,
up $1.5625.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Kodak, the acquisition comes none too soon. Although Kodak
commands about 30 percent of the global medical imaging market,
most of its products are commodity-type X-rays based on
conventional film technology. Imation, in contrast, is a leader in
the faster-growing market for so-called dry laser imaging, a hybrid
film and digital technology that translates digital readouts from
magnetic resonance imaging machines and other diagnostic equipment
directly onto film, without chemical processing.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak will introduce its own dry product in November, but as
Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., said, ``It would
take a really superior mousetrap to displace Imation in the
dry-process market.''
</P>
<P>
   All medical imaging companies are facing squeezed margins, as
hospitals and managed care groups band together into huge
purchasing cooperatives to force prices down. Kodak is no exception
_ although health imaging provided $1.6 billion, or about 10
percent, of Kodak's revenues last year, analysts say it provided a
lower percentage of profits. Imation lost money in medical imaging
last year, and barely broke even in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak says the acquisition will not dilute its earnings, and
will probably add to them after a year. While Kodak will not
discuss job-paring plans, analysts say that job cuts will be made
to keep Imation from dragging down Kodak's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a really sharp increase in revenues for Kodak to
break even without cutting at least 10 percent of the combined
staff,'' said Jack Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Kodak will buy X-ray film from Imation's
plant in Ferrania, Italy, for two years. The companies also settled
a lawsuit in which Kodak accused Imation and 3M of buying trade
secrets from a Kodak employee in 1992. The settlement terms were
undisclosed.

BLASTING AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even when members of Congress appear to be all
heart, they don't use their heads _ because they have their hands
out.
</P>
<P>
   They still love guns and those hefty campaign contributions from
the gun lobby despite a graphic lesson right under their noses of
the violent consequences of uncontrolled access to weapons that can
kill.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional leadership presided last week over moving
ceremonies honoring two brave police guards who were slain
protecting others from a berserk gunman in the Capitol. Emotions
ran high. Tears were shed. Genuine humility in honor of courage was
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this touching sentiment extended into the
legislative chamber, where the hard-nosed business of gun
protection went on as usual. The stark contrast between what the
legislators were saying and what they were virtually simultaneously
doing demonstrated once again that the gun lobby owns a majority of
Congress, or has at least a long-term lease on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mere hours before the eulogies in the Capitol Rotunda, the
Senate voted to block a proposal to ban imports of large-capacity
assault weapon ammunition clips that hold more than 10 rounds.
Assault weapons with large-capacity clips were used to mow down
children in recent schoolyard shootings in Arkansas and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Republicans joined the Democrats in favor of the ban,
which would have closed a loophole that keeps aging assault weapons
armed and circulating despite a 1994 ban on further manufacture of
the guns themselves. The timing of the vote was a dramatic
coincidence even though it seems like a deliberate insult to the
dead policemen.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more, lots more. Just days before the police
officers were killed with a .38 caliber pistol, more than 60
senators voted to kill two amendments that would have tightened
control of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment would have required new guns to come with trigger
mechanisms that would serve as child safety locks. Sounds sensible
to me, but not to the gun-lovers in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The other amendment would have made parents who left their
weapons where children could find them responsible for any crime
committed by those children with those weapons. Russell Eugene
Weston Jr., accused of killing the Capitol Hill police officers,
stole the pistol from his parents. He was not a kid, but he was a
prohibited from owning, purchasing or possessing a gun because he
had been committed to a mental institution in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also recently passed a third amendment pushed by the
National Rifle Association that is designed to hobble efforts to
make it harder for criminals to buy guns. Shades of the Wild West.
Everyone hit the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would prohibit the FBI from funding a new instant
crime-record check by imposing a fee on gun purchases, as
originally proposed. The database is supposed to be up and running
by Dec. 1, but putting its financing in doubt is a political
setback.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect may be to kill the proposed checking system
outright by starving it for money. Alternatively, it means raising
taxes in general or taking funds from some existing program, making
it much more difficult to pass a bill financing the crime-record
check.
</P>
<P>
   Such a centralized checking system is meant to supplant the
Brady law _ named after White House Press Secretary James Brady,
who was wounded in the attempted assassination of President Reagan
_ which will expire in November unless extended. The Brady law
requires a five-day waiting period between buying a gun and
actually taking possession of it. The instant-check system would
allow licensed gun dealers to quickly determine whether a customer
has a disqualifying criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate amendment, of course, is perfectly compatible with
Majority Leader Trent Lott's recent call for ``a well-armed
public.'' He supports a pilot project to turn police stations into
``citizen self-defense centers'' where the cops would train anybody
who comes in off the street in the use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP House and Senate leadership thinks as one on the gun
control issue. Since the Republicans took over both houses, there
have been no new gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, whose office Weston was
headed for and whose personal guard was one of the victims, has
fought for two years to repeal the ban on assault weapons. He
opposed the Brady law when it passed in 1991 and still does. After
the school shootings, he said, ``This has nothing to do with gun
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Capitol shootout, the House was set to hold
hearings on extending the legal right of all citizens to carry
concealed weapons. The bill would create a national standard
allowing those with a permit to carry a firearm in one state to use
that same permit in the 29 other states that allow concealed
weapons. But members did have the sensitivity to temporarily cancel
the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA needn't worry, however. The hearings will be
rescheduled. The public safety be damned. There are elections to be
financed.

LEWIS REWROTE THE RULES IN A HIGH-TECH MEDIUM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a high-tech medium, television usually requires effects more
special than a talking sock.
</P>
<P>
   But Shari Lewis was so gifted a puppeteer, ventriloquist, and
entertainer that she was able to rewrite the rules and win 12 Emmys
before dying Sunday at age 65 of complications from uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the diminutive, red-haired dynamo also experienced
television's fickle side, and was absent from the tube for long
periods as cartoons took over children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will forever be identified with her most indelible
creation: a cantankerous little puppet named Lamb Chop. As much of
a high-maintenance prima donna as Miss Piggy, Lamb Chop was
nobody's sheep. Her screechy voice was even heard in the halls of
Congress. On programs such as ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' she made
the sort of mischief that gave a vicarious thrill to millions of
children watching at home _ while demurely professing her innocence
all the while.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Lewis means that yet another reassuring figure from
television's early years is gone from the scene. In the past month,
Robert Young of ``Father Knows Best,'' Buffalo Bob Smith of ``The
Howdy Doody Show,'' and singing cowboy Roy Rogers also have passed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed both ageless and tireless. It was easy to forget
that she had introduced Lamb Chop as far back as 1957, on ``The
Captain Kangaroo Show,'' before going on to create and star in such
shows as ``The Shari Lewis Show,'' ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' and
her latest, ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was someone who seemed to get younger as she got older,''
said children's TV activist Peggy Charren, a friend of Lewis's.
``She had more energy than anybody I know. She was Charlie Horse
and she was Lamb Chop, and some of those conversations between the
two of them were achingly funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The ebullient Lewis filled her shows with music, comedy,
riddles, puns, and easy-to-digest lessons about life. The
educational impulse was present off-camera too; Charren said Lewis
was as much activist as entertainer, ever concerned about expanding
the array of choices for children on television.
</P>
<P>
   During a memorable day in 1993, Lewis brought Lamb Chop to
Capitol Hill to make an impassioned plea to broadcasters to improve
children's television programming. ``We need the best you grown-ups
have to offer,'' Lewis had the puppet say. ``If you give it to us,
we will give you the good stuff back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis herself had a broad definition of ``the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lewis noticed that few TV programs seemed geared
toward Jewish children, so she came up with such primetime specials
as ``Lamb Chop's Special Chanukah'' and ``Shari's Passover
Surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Conscious that television seldom tried to foster an appreciation
of music, Lewis created a show designed to do just that, ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did was look at what was missing on television and
try to fill the gap,'' said Charren.
</P>
<P>
   Potier recalled seeing Lewis perform last year in Dallas at a
PBS meeting. ``She did a song-and-dance with Lamb Chop, very fast
back and forth, singing the whole time,'' said Potier. ``She had to
change her voice each time, and throw her voice. It was
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis began astounding spectators at an early age. She first
pulled a rabbit out of her hat at the age of 4, appeared on her
first TV variety show at age 13, and starred in ``Facts 'n' Fun''
on NBC at 18. &UR;  &LR; She cemented her status as a leading children's
entertainer with ``The Shari Lewis Show,'' which ran Saturday
mornings on NBC from 1960 to 1963 before being canceled as
children's television shifted its focus to animation.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a half-hour syndicated puppet show called ``The Shari
Show'' in 1975, it would be three decades before Lewis regained a
prominent place on television. A resilient trouper, she took her
act to Las Vegas, appeared on game shows, and even conducted
symphony orchestras. She also wrote more than 60 children's books,
and in 1986, entertained children from around the world at a White
House Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis returned triumphantly to television with ``Lamb Chop's
Play-Along,'' which premiered on PBS in 1992. Before Lewis stopped
production on it last year, the show had won five Emmys. Then, in
January, Lewis introduced ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She cut
short production on the show six weeks ago when she began
undergoing chemotherapy treatments. Among the events she had to
miss was the ``Charlie Horse Music Pizza Jam Session,'' an event to
celebrate PBS' children's programming, at the Children's Museum in
Boston on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After developing pneumonia during chemotherapy, Lewis died
Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She leaves her husband,
Jeremy Tarcher; her daughter, Mallory Tarcher; and many grateful
parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew what parents would like for their kids, and
fortunately, the kids liked it,'' said Charren. ``She had that
magic touch.''

GLIMMERGLASS OPERA: TWO TALES MOVED UP TO MODERN TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ During intermissions at the Glimmerglass
Opera one hears with surprising frequency how remarkable it is to
find an opera company, let alone a successful and adventurous one,
``in the middle of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the shores of Otsego Lake are far from the opera
world's traditional corridors of power, but now that the
23-year-old company is allied with the New York City Opera _ they
share administrative and artistic staffs, singers and productions _
the real question is whether Glimmerglass is a farm team for the
New York company, or the tail that wags the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Shared new productions are staged first at Glimmerglass, where
they benefit from luxurious rehearsal time. And the productions are
unquestionably seen to better effect in the attractive, comfortably
intimate 912-seat Alice Busch Opera Theater than at the cavernous
New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's festival runs through Aug. 24, and all four of its
productions will make their way to City Opera: Puccini's ``Tosca''
and Handel's ``Partenope'' arrive in the fall; Verdi's ``Falstaff''
and Virgil Thomson's ``Mother of Us All'' are due in future
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Glimmerglass has long cherished the notion that excavating the
psychological truths within a work, or presenting a director's
conception of them, is what a contemporary production should do. If
the director's insights clash with the text of the piece, or with
the spirit and conventions in which the composer worked, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes of this sort occur in both of the works that are
destined more immediately for the City Opera stage, but they weigh
on each work differently.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lamos has wrenched ``Tosca'' from its original setting,
during the Napoleonic wars, to World War II. Making Scarpia and his
henchmen jackbooted Nazis may sharpen the sense of good vs. evil
for a postwar audience. But don't the libretto and the music
(starting with the ominous opening chords) make that clear enough?
</P>
<P>
   The libretto's references to the political landscape of
19th-century Italy dangle awkwardly in this setting. Nor is the
idea particularly fresh: It was first explored in a 1947 Italian
film, ``E Avanti a Lui Tremava Tutta Roma.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Michael Yeargan's stark, sleek sets, Constance
Hoffman's costumes and Robert Wierzel's harshly atmospheric
lighting make for some striking stage pictures, and although
Stewart Robertson's orchestra played scrawnily through much of the
show, the second act was electrifying. The production could work if
not for Lamos' character exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpia, for example, crosses himself regularly during the first
act, but after he declares that Tosca makes him forget God, he
grabs his crotch, drops to his knees and masturbates while all
around him nuns and boy choristers sing the Te Deum that ends Act
I.
</P>
<P>
   Provocative tastelessness that makes a point is one thing; here
it is juvenile, even a bit insulting in its implication that
audiences might not apprehend Scarpia's depravity and lust for
Tosca without being batted over the head.
</P>
<P>
   Other touches _ making the Sacristan a spastic, or having Tosca
take a compact from her purse and check her makeup after murdering
Scarpia _ were moves one might expect in a parody by the Gran Scena
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, the production's drawing card is Amy Johnson, who sang
Tosca's music with a touching fervency and a strong, attractive
timbre. Michele Bianchini's Scarpia was dry but serviceable in the
Saturday afternoon performance, and Ian DeNolfo's heldentenor
approach to Cavaradossi worked only intermittently, as did his
ability to keep on pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Handel's rarely heard ``Partenope'' is a long, involved comedy
in which the title character, the founder and queen of Naples, is
surrounded by suitors. Arsace, her favorite, has ditched Rosmira
for her, but when Rosmira turns up disguised as a man, Eurimene,
Arsace realizes he is still in love with her. Armindo is too shy to
declare his love to Partenope, and when Emilio, the prince of a
neighboring city, offers the choice of marriage or war, Partenope
fights and wins.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Negrin's production, heard on Friday, moves the action
to the present, more or less: Partenope moves and dresses like a
1920s flapper and is portrayed as sex-obsessed, but Paul Steinberg
has dressed the others in various shades of downtown trendiness,
and Negrin has them behave like Generation X-ers.
</P>
<P>
   John Conklin's sets are beautiful and efficient. As in
``Tosca,'' temporal displacement raises questions: Contemporary
culture doesn't really accommodate the relationships Handel
presents here, yet the result is so entertaining that one willingly
suspends disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The production has an extraordinary cast: David Daniels'
countertenor is fully supported, flexible and irresistibly
transparent, and he uses those qualities to bring depth and scope
to Arsace's music. David Walker's countertenor is nearly as lovely,
and he conveyed Armindo's combination of modesty and nobility
affectingly.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Saffer's high-spirited portrayal of Partenope was
dramatically and vocally commanding, and Jennifer Dudley as
Rosmira, John McVeigh as Emilio, and Eduardo Chama as the oracle
Ormonte made strong contributions. Harry Bicket, an English
conductor who specializes in early opera, drew a stylish
performance from the orchestra.

CLINTON, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT MEET AT WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton welcomed Colombia's
president-elect, Andres Pastrana, to the White House in a friendly
meeting Monday that signaled a significant change in US anti-drug
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would help Colombia end a 30-year-old guerrilla
war while pursuing cocaine and heroin traffickers who have paid off
the country's congress, courts, and police.
</P>
<P>
   While aides said Clinton did not promise a specific aid package,
the meeting itself was a reward for Pastrana, a free-market
advocate who was seen as Washington's favorite in Colombia's June
21 elections. The White House rarely invites a Latin American
president-elect in for a talk, and officials said Monday's visit
followed a sharp debate between the State Department and law
enforcement agencies about how to deal with disorder in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting marked a reversal of Washington's relationship with
Bogota and a rebuff of Colombia's current president, Ernesto
Samper, who has been denied entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Samper took office four years ago amid accusations by Pastrana
and others that he took millions of dollars in donations from the
Cali drug cartel. After Samper failed to crack down on drug traffic
and corruption, the State Department revoked his travel visa in
1996 and twice rejected, or ``decertified,'' Colombia's anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today marks a new beginning in the US-Colombian relations,''
Pastrana told reporters as he left the White House and headed to a
luncheon with Attorney General Janet Reno and other high-ranking
officials, hosted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. ``The
years of mistrust are now behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, the administration had simply planned to
send a group of State Department officials to see Pastrana in
Bogota before his inauguration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But a lobbying effort by Colombia persuaded the White House that
Pastrana should be invited, according to officials who requested
anonymity. They said the State Department's Latin American
specialists have urged the White House to cooperate fully with
Pastrana as he tries to forge peace, while the Pentagon and drug
policy adviser Barry McCaffrey have argued that he is too eager to
make concessions to guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very mixed message going to Colombia because we
have some people in the US government supporting peace but Colombia
has the largest US military aid program in the hemisphere,'' said
Coletta Youngers, an Andean expert at the non-profit Washington
Office on Latin America. Washington gives Colombia about $100
million a year in aid and anti-drug assistance.
</P>
<P>
   US officials agree that Colombia _ the second-largest
Spanish-speaking country in the hemisphere after Mexico _ is an
imporant ally to woo. Colombia is the world's leading producer of
cocaine and leads the hemisphere in kidnappings and per capita
homicides. While the country is not in danger of collapsing,
Colombian guerrillas and traffickers have plagued neighboring
countries, including Ecuador and Venezuela, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is under more pressure than most any other country in
the hemisphere,'' said Viron P. Vaky, senior fellow at the
Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ``It's facing the most
difficult security problems and it's central to any worldwide
global drug strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the administration decided how to deal with Colombia,
officials have disagreed over who should head the US delegation to
the inauguration. Pastrana's cooperation is considered so important
that some officials wanted Albright to attend, but she will be in
Italy for the wedding of her spokesman, James P. Rubin. McCaffrey
demanded that he head the group, officials said, but the White
House thought that would send the wrong message to a country that
already feels bullied by US anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's friend and former Latin American envoy, Thomas
``Mack'' McLarty, will lead the delegation. McLarty, who is far
more interested in talking about increasing trade than cracking
down on drugs, is expected to assure Colombian business leaders
that Washington wants to ``de-narcotize'' its dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the way to strengthen our relationship on
narcotics is to strenghten our relationship on other things,'' said
Arturo Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American
Studies at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana will return for a state visit later this year, the
White House announced.

ASCEND LOOKING TO CONVERGED TELEPHONE-DATA WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ascend Communications Inc.'s $843 million acquisition of
Stratus Computer Inc. might be called a marriage of convergence. At
first glance, the two companies seem to come from opposite sides of
the track. Ascend makes computer data switches, while Stratus makes
super-reliable computers for the telephone industry and others.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the world, telephone networks and computer data
networks are ceasing to be separate systems. Instead, they're
converging into a powerful unified system that can transmit any
kind of information quickly and cheaply. Phone companies and
Internet service providers are spending billions to make it happen.
Ascend could get a larger share of that market &UR;  &LR;  with Stratus in
its stable.
</P>
<P>
   Stratus' key contribution to the partnership is its expertise in
a little-known but vital communications network called Signaling
System 7, or SS7.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone is actually a simple computer terminal. Dialing a
number sends a set of commands to phone company computers, telling
them how to handle the call. These commands used to be carried over
the same wires that handle the phone calls themselves, but today,
the commands are routed over a different set of wires that only
carries information about how to handle calls. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That's what SS7 does. When you pick up a phone and dial a
number, the telephone communicates with an SS7 computer that
interprets the numbers you dial and figures out who you're calling.
This information is sent over the SS7 network to a computer at the
receiving end. These two SS7 computers send the correct commands to
the telephone company's switches, and the call goes through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telephone switches are getting dumber and dumber,'' said
Annabel Dodd, a telecommunications consultant and adjunct professor
at Northeastern University. ``The really complicated stuff is in
the Signaling System 7 part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the SS7 computers collect the billing information
on long distance calls. They also run the popular ``value-added''
services that generate big profits for phone companies, such as
voice mail and call-waiting service.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies demand extremely high reliability, which is
why so many of them use Stratus computers to run their SS7
networks. Stratus makes machines that are ``fault-tolerant,'' or
able to keep going even when some component fails. Each Stratus
machine contains two of everything _ processors, disk drives and so
on. In effect, each computer is actually two computers. Both run
constantly, doing the same tasks at the same times. If a part
breaks, its mirror-image component never misses a beat, so the
system never stops working.
</P>
<P>
   These days, most of the growth in telecommunications traffic
comes from data transmissions, not voice calls. Traditional phone
switches, designed for short conversations, are being flooded by
Internet users who stay connected for hours at a time. Ascend is
devising switching equipment that will pick out calls to Internet
providers and route them over a different circuit, leaving the
switch free for voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But new systems are allowing data networks to handle voice calls
as well, by translating the sound into digital data. Major phone
companies like the long distance carrier Sprint have announced
plans to set up unified networks that carry voice and data over the
same cables, thus saving the huge expense of maintaining separate
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend makes the data relay switches that will be at the heart
of such networks. With Stratus, it now has access to the SS7
equipment needed to provide high-quality phone service over
advanced data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the next generation network is built with more of a data
backbone, the key will be to provide the same kinds of services
that (now) make the voice network so rich,'' said Stratus president

HOUSE APPROVES NAMING CIA HEADQUARTERS AFTER BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ronald Reagan got his airport and now George Bush
has his CIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The House gave its unanimous approval Monday to a measure naming
the Langley, Va., building housing the nation's premier
intelligence organization the George H.W. Bush Center for Central
Intelligence. The Senate is expected to pass the same measure when
it returns from its summer recess in early September.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to the former president who resides in Houston, his
congressman, Rep. Bill Archer, called Bush ``a man of unblemished
integrity'' and said it was fitting that the CIA building should be
named after the only president to serve as head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 74, served as director of the CIA for a year during the
Ford administration. He has also served as vice president, United
Nations ambassador, envoy to China, Texas congressman and chairman
of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Ford named Bush as director of the CIA in 1976 when
the agency was being investigated by Congress. While in charge,
Bush helped draft orders to prevent violations of CIA regulations
as well as federal and international laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``He created strength and stability in the intelligence
community, and he is widely credited with restoring (CIA staff)
morale,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va. ``What better way to honor
George Bush than to place his name on CIA headquarters?''

<P>
   Flats have outpaced stilettos as the chic shoes for fall.
Designers have chosen them to give a new look to this year's
revival of long skirts, tacitly acknowledging that high heels are
not universally popular as everyday wear.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet flats include Isaac Mizrahi's classic leather version
($220 at Saks Fifth Avenue); Enzo Angiolini's cap-toe in velvet
($72 at Bloomingdale's), and Chanel's cap-toe in leather ($340 at
Saks and Neiman Marcus).
</P>
<P>
   In skimmers, Bloomingdale's has satins by CK Calvin Klein ($130)
and Nicole Miller ($110), and python or velvet from Isaac by Isaac
Mizrahi ($130). The store also has Mary Janes in gray flannel by
Cynthia Rowley ($169) and in velvet by BCBG Max Azria ($145).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Janes by Martinez Valero are at Macy's in leather ($140),
and at the Co-Op at Barneys New York ($175). Skimmers by Silvia
Fiorentina ($340), Ferragamo ($190) and Anne Klein ($160) are all
at Neiman Marcus.

CHRYSLER SALES EXCEED 200,000 FOR 6TH STRAIGHT MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Chrysler Corp. announced Monday that its sales of cars
and trucks in July were up slightly from levels a year earlier but
down from the brisk pace of the previous two months.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's sales totaled 206,018 cars and trucks, up 3 percent
from the level in July 1997. In both May and June this year, when
incentives to buyers were in place, Chrysler sales hit 250,000
units, reaching that level for the first time ever, and inventories
were lowered on dealer lots. Still, July marked the sixth
consecutive month of sales exceeding 200,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of Chrysler's sales is derived from healthy demand
for its trucks, particularly the Dodge Durango and the Jeep Grand
Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler. The automaker sold 146,503 trucks
in July, up 9 percent from levels a year earlier. It sold 59,515
cars, down 8 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota reported a 13 percent gain over July 1997, with its
Toyota and Lexus divisions together selling 122,550 cars and
trucks. The Toyota division, led by its best-selling Camry,
recorded sales of 107,877, up 8 percent from a year earlier,
marking the first time in its 41-year history that its sales topped
100,000 vehicles in each of three consecutive months. Lexus
reported its best-ever sales month with July sales of 14,674, up 58
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Honda reported that July gave it the second-best month ever.
Honda and Acura sold 92,820 cars and trucks, up 6 percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz of North America reported a 53 percent increase
from a year earlier with July sales of 10,310 cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru of America's sales totaled 13,071 cars and trucks, up 16
percent from July 1997, for Subaru's best July since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Saab, which has introduced two new models in recent months,
announced sales of 15,977 cars, an 11 percent rise from July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi sold 15,474 cars and trucks in July, a decrease of 8
percent from the level a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   July sales for the industry, some of which remain to be reported
over the next few days, are expected to be off overall from last
year's strong July and from the extraordinarily brisk pace of May
and June, when sales were the highest since the mid 1980s, thanks
to attractive consumer incentives that expired at the end of June
and in early July.
</P>
<P>
   A six-week strike by the United Automobile Workers union at two
General Motors parts plants, which forced the closing of nearly all
of the GM's North American plants, also weakened sales of cars and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the early reports suggest that auto sales in July may
come in stronger than some analysts had predicted. ``Industry sales
will be off about 6 to 7 percent from strong year-ago levels, but
not bad given the problems at GM,'' said David Healy, an auto
analyst for Burnham Securities Inc., New York.
</P>
<P>
   Healy predicted that the seasonally adjusted selling rate, which
reached 16.7 million cars and light trucks in June _ the highest
level since 1986 _ would be about 14.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that Ford sales, which are to be announced
Tuesday, will be flat.
</P>
<P>
   GM reports sales on Wednesday. Ronald Zarrella, vice president
in charge of GM's North American Vehicle Sales, Service and
Marketing Group, said a month ago that GM's July sales would be
down as much as 40 percent because of the strike, causing GM's
market share to slide to an all-time low of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some competitors picked up share from GM customers not willing
to wait,'' Healy said.

ISSUE-ORIENTED DEBATE HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENCES IN CALIF. CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>

 By ZACHARY-COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Despite all the sniping between Attorney General Dan
Lungren and Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the first of a series of debates
in the race for governor was surprising in its focus on issues.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the primary campaign, which was dominated by
mudslinging often dished out in expensive television ads, the
Republican and Democratic nominees for governor clashed in an open
forum over critical issues such as taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that struck me was that they really laid out their
agendas,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at the
Claremont Graduate University. ``They really went out there and
laid out their ideas. The question now is, what are they going to
do in the next four debates?''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong debate, held Friday night at the San Diego
Convention Center, underscored some of the deep ideological
differences between the two candidates, especially on abortion,
affirmative action and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The debate also provided an early peek at the issues the
candidates believe they can use against each other to sway
undecided voters before the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Democrat, repeatedly talked of his support for
abortion rights and his plans to reform California's ailing public
education system. Davis' advisers believe both themes will have
strong appeal with women, who early polls show are leaning heavily
toward the former two-term controller.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the core issue (of abortion), we are in fundamental
disagreement,'' Davis said. ``I trust a woman, who in concert with
her own God, her own doctor and her own conscience comes to a
decision on the most personal and delicate thing that involves a
woman's health. You (Lungren) don't trust a woman to make that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, the Republican candidate, painted his opponent as
outside the mainstream for voting against bills to expand the death
penalty and for opposing ballot initiatives to end affirmative
action and to cut benefits to illegal immigrants. Both measures
were passed by California voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren leaned most heavily on the two issues political analysts
say are his strongest: taxes and crime. The two-term attorney
general said crime rates, which soared to record levels in the
1980s, dropped to 1967 levels during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has tried to blunt his opponent's perceived advantage on
the tax issue, proposing an investment tax credit and a cut in the
vehicle-license fee that Lungren and Republican Gov. Pete Wilson
want to abolish. Lungren warned voters not to trust Davis on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring taxes down a lot more than Gray will,'' he said.
``Just look at our records.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus on issues after a primary election that was dominated
by personalities was welcomed by members of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see they're going to stick to the issues,'' said
Gene Block, a Los Angeles resident who works in construction.
</P>
<P>
   The debate at times wandered off course. A discussion on
improving relations with Mexico drifted off into a dispute over
whether Davis eschewed his state responsibilities by missing a 1996
conference on trade issues south of the border. Lungren said Davis
was in New York City raising money at the time.
</P>
<P>
   During a discussion of the death penalty, which both candidates
support, Davis praised Singapore's hard-line criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Singapore is a good starting point in terms of law and
order,'' Davis said. ``I think there ought to be clear rules. You
can't punish people enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said his comments were limited to the country's penalties
for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The frank tenor of the debate was in part a reflection of the
format, which allowed the candidates to question each other as well
as respond to questions from a panel of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head-to-head format allows candidates to get under each
other's skins,'' said Barbara O'Connor, a communications professor
at Cal State Sacramento. ``I think it's great for the viewer. I
think he or she can make up their minds about how the candidates do
under pressure, how they do when they're under fire, and how their
tempers hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The next televised debate is set for Aug. 18 in Fresno, followed
by debates in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento.

   BOEING-MERGER (Seattle) Did the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger
contribute to Boeing's current woes? Maybe so, conjecture some
analysts a year after the giant combination. If Phil Condit had
been spending more time monitoring and managing what was going on
on the factory floor, instead of trying to put a deal together,
production snarls might not have beern as bad.

   QUAKE-NORTHWEST (Seattle) A startling new assessment of
earthquake danger in the Pacific Northwest shows that the Puget
Sound region could be the location of the worst earthquake in
recent time, a 9.5 temblor that would clearly ruin your day. That's
the assessment from Craig Weaver, head of the U.S. Geological
Survey's Seattle office and a leading expert on seismic activity in
the Pacific Northwest. The new assessment was to open a meeting of
top earthquake engineers and scientists about the potential of a
`Big One' and how to minimize risk.

LAWMAKERS URGE MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR HIV-INFECTED PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sixty-eight House members asked the Clinton
administration on Monday to designate people with HIV as
``disabled'' so they can qualify for Medicaid and get drugs that
can delay the onset of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Donna Shalala, the secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services, the lawmakers urged that Medicaid be
expanded to cover HIV-positive recipients so they can afford the
expensive HIV-fighting ``protease cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug cocktail, which can cost $12,000 to $15,000 a year, has
been shown to reduce the amount of HIV in a person's blood stream.
HIV _ the human immunodeficiency virus _ causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid _ the federal-state health insurance program that
covers low-income individuals and people with disabilities _ now
covers individuals with HIV only if they are sick or disabled. In
effect, this precludes them from getting early treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The 68 letter signers included House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, D-Mo., and Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Jim Turner,
D-Texas, Nick V. Lampson, D-Texas, Pete Stark, D-Calif., Jim
McDermott, D-Wash., Lois Capps, D-Calif., Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., Ellen
Tauscher, D-Calif., Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unconscionable to deny people living with HIV the drugs
we know can help keep them well simply because they have no health
insurance or are not yet sick enough to qualify for Medicaid,''
Gephardt said in statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said new HIV treatments should be available to all who
need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``While government researchers issue hopeful statements about
the benefits of early therapy and news reports herald a new age for
people with AIDS, Medicaid trails the science,'' she said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., wrote a similar letter
following the June 25 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that federal laws
barring discrimination against disabled Americans applied to
HIV-positive individuals, even though they were without obvious
symptoms. The case involved a HIV-positive woman who was refused
treatment by a Maine dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli argued that HHS should follow the Supreme Court's
example by ``reinventing Medicaid'' so that low-income HIV-positive
people can benefit from drugs that postpone AIDS symptoms.
Torricelli is considering legislation that would require Medicaid
to pay for drugs for HIV-infected people.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also has endorsed the proposed Medicaid
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal Medicaid statutes, Shalala has the authority to
expand the program to cover HIV-infected people if she can show
such a step would be cost neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Pelosi argue that would be the case here because,
they contend, people receiving earlier therapy would stay healthy
longer, avoiding some infections that can require costly
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that early HIV treatment would result in a
savings to the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides
benefits to disabled people, including those with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   HHS spokesman Richard Sorian said the administration ``is
examining all of the more recent data to see whether or not a
change in policy is called for.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zingale, executive director of the Washington advocacy
group AIDS ACTION, says the current HHS policy is badly flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that under the current Medicaid rules, you have
to have full-blown AIDS before you can have access to AIDS
preventing drugs,'' Zingale said. ``If traffic safety regulations
followed this approach you'd put the airbags in the car after it
crashes.''

HOUSE PASSES RESOLUTION URGING FIRE PACT BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House gave unanimous approval Monday to a
resolution calling for the United States and Mexico to negotiate a
cooperative fire suppression agreement similar to the one that has
existed between the U.S. and Canadian governments since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, said that reaching an agreement would
allow U.S. and Mexican authorities ``to respond more quickly and
efficiently'' to wildfires, such as the ones this spring that
devastated more than 1 million acres along the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, joined by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said a fire
suppression agreement could help prevent the kind of situation this
spring when more than 10,000 fires in Mexico created a heavy layer
of smoke over much of Texas. The smoke, combined with the heat,
forced officials in Houston and elsewhere across the state to
declare a series of health alerts to keep people indoors,
especially the elderly and young school children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is real and as we have seen from the fires from
southern Mexico, you don't have to live next to the fire to be
affected by it,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are engaged in negotiations
with Mexico to finalize an agreement that would allow firefighters
from both countries to assist one another in fighting wildfires
that break out within 125 miles of the border.

Elisa Izquierdo, her siblings remain mired in the uncertainty of
the foster care system, showing how child welfare officials have

death, Elisa Izquierdo became a national symbol of all that was
wrong with child welfare in New York City, exposing the sloppy
investigations that allowed her to suffer and die under the city's
watch. And in some ways, her siblings' long journey through the
child welfare system highlights a less sensational, but far more
common problem: the experience of thousands of children who
languish in foster care for years without finding permanent homes.

CLINTON, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT MEET AT WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton welcomed Colombia's
president-elect, Andres Pastrana, to the White House in a friendly
meeting Monday that signaled a significant change in US anti-drug
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would help Colombia end a 30-year-old guerrilla
war while pursuing cocaine and heroin traffickers who have paid off
the country's congress, courts, and police.
</P>
<P>
   While aides said Clinton did not promise a specific aid package,
the meeting itself was a reward for Pastrana, a free-market
advocate who was seen as Washington's favorite in Colombia's June
21 elections. The White House rarely invites a Latin American
president-elect in for a talk, and officials said Monday's visit
followed a sharp debate between the State Department and law
enforcement agencies about how to deal with disorder in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting marked a reversal of Washington's relationship with
Bogota and a rebuff of Colombia's current president, Ernesto
Samper, who has been denied entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Samper took office four years ago amid accusations by Pastrana
and others that he took millions of dollars in donations from the
Cali drug cartel. After Samper failed to crack down on drug traffic
and corruption, the State Department revoked his travel visa in
1996 and twice rejected, or ``decertified,'' Colombia's anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today marks a new beginning in the US-Colombian relations,''
Pastrana told reporters as he left the White House and headed to a
luncheon with Attorney General Janet Reno and other high-ranking
officials, hosted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. ``The
years of mistrust are now behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, the administration had simply planned to
send a group of State Department officials to see Pastrana in
Bogota before his inauguration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But a lobbying effort by Colombia persuaded the White House that
Pastrana should be invited, according to officials who requested
anonymity. They said the State Department's Latin American
specialists have urged the White House to cooperate fully with
Pastrana as he tries to forge peace, while the Pentagon and drug
policy adviser Barry McCaffrey have argued that he is too eager to
make concessions to guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very mixed message going to Colombia because we
have some people in the US government supporting peace but Colombia
has the largest US military aid program in the hemisphere,'' said
Coletta Youngers, an Andean expert at the non-profit Washington
Office on Latin America. Washington gives Colombia about $100
million a year in aid and anti-drug assistance.
</P>
<P>
   US officials agree that Colombia _ the second-largest
Spanish-speaking country in the hemisphere after Mexico _ is an
imporant ally to woo. Colombia is the world's leading producer of
cocaine and leads the hemisphere in kidnappings and per capita
homicides. While the country is not in danger of collapsing,
Colombian guerrillas and traffickers have plagued neighboring
countries, including Ecuador and Venezuela, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is under more pressure than most any other country in
the hemisphere,'' said Viron P. Vaky, senior fellow at the
Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ``It's facing the most
difficult security problems and it's central to any worldwide
global drug strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the administration decided how to deal with Colombia,
officials have disagreed over who should head the US delegation to
the inauguration. Pastrana's cooperation is considered so important
that some officials wanted Albright to attend, but she will be in
Italy for the wedding of her spokesman, James P. Rubin. McCaffrey
demanded that he head the group, officials said, but the White
House thought that would send the wrong message to a country that
already feels bullied by US anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's friend and former Latin American envoy, Thomas
``Mack'' McLarty, will lead the delegation. McLarty, who is far
more interested in talking about increasing trade than cracking
down on drugs, is expected to assure Colombian business leaders
that Washington wants to ``de-narcotize'' its dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the way to strengthen our relationship on
narcotics is to strenghten our relationship on other things,'' said
Arturo Valenzuela, director of the Center for Latin American
Studies at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana will return for a state visit later this year, the
White House announced.

CHARGES OF FRAUD IN MEXICAN GUBERNATORIAL BALLOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On Monday, a day after voting in the southern
state of Oaxaca, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution
challenged preliminary returns that showed its candidate for
governor had come in second, saying the balloting was marred by
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders did not immediately announce how they might
press their complaints, but in other states they have organized
long protests to challenge election results they considered
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 90 percent of the ballots counted Monday by
Oaxaca's State Electoral Institute, the official returns showed
that the candidate of President Ernesto Zedillo's governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had received 48.5
percent of the votes. The Party of the Democratic Revolution, or
PRD, had 37.5 percent, and several other parties had a total of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those official returns approximated the results of two exit
polls conducted on Sunday by Mexican television networks. The PRI
candidate, Sen. Jose Murat, claimed victory late Sunday and
celebrated with mariachi music in the central plaza of Oaxaca's
state capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the PRD president, challenged
the PRI's victory claims. He cited a third exit poll, conducted by
the private Rosenblueth Foundation, which predicted on Sunday that
the PRD would defeat the PRI by 38.1 to 36.9 percent. He also said
the Oaxaca balloting had been marred by vote buying and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say there was a free election in Oaxaca,'' Lopez
Obrador said. ``We don't accept the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Oaxaca's 3.2 million people speak a dozen indigenous languages
and are atomized into 570 townships, far more than any other
Mexican state. Many villages are in remote mountain passes or rain
forests with primitive communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinarily difficult to establish modern voting
methods in a state like Oaxaca,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a college
professor who has worked to prevent vote theft in many states.
``There are still wide margins there for electoral fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the official results' similarity with the networks'
exit polls bolstered their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ponce, who helped organize the Rosenblueth exit poll,
said his foundation had interviewed 25,000 Oaxaca voters, a broader
sample than that consulted by the two networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy Campos Esquerra, who organized the Televisa network's
exit poll, said, ``I'd put my hands in the fire for our results.
They were very well done.''
</P>
<P>
   In other elections Sunday, the PRI won the governorship of the
Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, and the National Action Party won in
the central state of Aguascalientes, where the PRI had never
previously lost.

   BOSTON _ The Bruins and veteran center Tim Taylor, scheduled to
meet in a hearing Monday in Toronto, averted arbitration when they
agreed on a one-year contract Sunday. The club didn't release the
salary figure, although it's likely that Taylor, who made $425,000
last season, will now pull in something in the $750,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best for both sides,'' said Taylor. ``No one's a loser
and everyone is a winner. I think this all could've been avoided if
we'd sat down earlier but I'm relieved to get it over with. Now I
feel a part of the team again. I feel a sense of responsibility to
prepare for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 29, made the 75-minute drive from his home in Stratford,
Ontario, to Toronto for the hearing, but rather than sitting
through a tense hearing Monday, he went with a friend to the Hockey
Hall of Fame and for the first time saw the Stanley Cup with his
name engraved on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really great,'' said Taylor, who was on the Red Wings'
championship club in 1996-97. ``There also were a couple of
pictures up that I was in and I saw the video clips and the
highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor even participated in the interactive shooting gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend told me he'd give me 10 shots to hit nine targets,''
said Taylor. ``It took me 14 so I guess I'd better keep
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent at
the end of the 1998-99 season, is thrilled to have the distraction
of thinking about a contract removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly wondering what was going to happen,'' said
Taylor, who had a career-high 20 goals and 31 points in 79 games
last year. ``I was pretty anxious about it. It really was a
distraction. At times I was taking it kind of personal. But looking
back on it, I had to keep in mind that it is a business. If they
can get me for the cheapest price, then they're doing their job. My
agent and I are trying to get the most we can get. After reading
their brief, they were pretty honest. They didn't cut me up. In all
fairness, they were responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said the sides
weren't that far apart to start with. O'Connell, reached by
telephone in Nashville, where he is scheduled to attend GM meetings
today, said after the sides exchanged briefs it was clear that a
deal could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really drove this is that Tim really wanted to be in
Boston,'' said O'Connell. ``He likes the city, he likes the
environment. What averted this was that the position the club took
and the one Tim presented were so similar. Both were realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Boston,'' said Taylor. ``I like the coaching staff. I
think I've established myself as a good, solid, checking center.
It's a great situation. I think this team has a really good chance
to grow together.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the sides have kept the door wide open for further
negotiations that would lock him up rather than allow him to reach
total free agency next July 1. O'Connell said the team thought the
salary demands for a three-year deal were high but he told Taylor
he would be willing to reopen talks at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Bruins have hearings scheduled for next week. Forward
Dmitri Khristich is due for his next Tuesday while goalie Rob
Tallas is scheduled for next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he had some positive discussions with Bob Gerow,
the representative for free-agent center Jason Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we'd get back to him with a proposal,'' said
O'Connell. ``Maybe next week. It was a good dialogue.''

BILLS COUNTING ON JOHNSON-FLUTIE TANDEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDONIA, N.Y. _ Next door to the Buffalo Bills' training camp
at Fredonia University is an intriguing setup that lets fans of
nearly any age try their hand at some NFL-type football drills.
</P>
<P>
   So on a recent day there was the engaging sight of a 5-year-old
boy struggling to toss a football through a big hole in a huge
wooden board. The boy would toss the football. Clunk! The football
would bounce off the board. The boy would try again. Clunk! Again.
Again. Again. Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like the Bills' passing game last season.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo ranked 25th in passing yards gained among the National
Football League's 30 teams (the team's rushing offense was a
respectable 14th). In a league in which 17 teams produced 20 or
more passing touchdowns, the Bills had only 14. Only one team _ San
Diego, with 12 _ was worse.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Bills' quarterbacks _ Todd Collins, Alex
Van Pelt and Billy Joe Hobert (now with New Orleans) _ were not
ready to replace Jim Kelly, the club's leading career passer who
retired after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Bills did something about it. In camp are two newcomers
at quarterback with vastly different games and backgrounds. The
Bills traded with Jacksonville for Rob Johnson and then looked to
the Canadian Football League to swipe Doug Flutie. It is Johnson
and Flutie now, and Johnson gets first crack.
</P>
<P>
   Has Buffalo found an answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we do know is that Jim Kelly is not here anymore,''
said Wade Phillips, who has replaced Marv Levy as the head coach
after serving as the Bills' defensive coordinator for the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the Super Bowl Buffalo Bills,'' he said. ``This
team was 6-10 last year. We'd love to have some new tradition; we
can't live off the past. We think Rob is a quarterback who can do
it all. He throws the long ball and looks downfield a lot. He has
command and presence. He's not a rookie, so he knows the speed and
size of the game. Doug is a great leader, and he's mobile. He will
learn the entire offense, know everybody's job, and he's like
having a coach on the field. Because he moves so well, we'll have
to use him differently from Rob. He will bootleg and roll out and
throw on the run and scramble some. He'll give us another dimension
at the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is not exaggerating when he says that the Bills are not
the same team that, under Levy, made four straight appearances in
the Super Bowl this decade. Only four players _ Thurman Thomas,
Bruce Smith, Mike Pike and Andre Reed _ remain from those four
teams. Thirty-three of 84 players on the Bills' roster are either
rookies or players with only one year of pro experience, and 64
have four or fewer years of pro experience.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 25, has three years, all with Jacksonville. He and the
Jet receiver Keyshawn Johnson were a dynamic twosome at the
University of Southern California, but in Jacksonville he was a
backup to Mark Brunell. Johnson threw seven regular-season passes
in 1995, none in '96 and 35 last year. He is sort of a
known-unknown quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Brunell was hurt during the preseason, Johnson
started a Monday night game against San Francisco and torched the
49ers' pass defense with the nation watching. He played well the
following week against Atlanta and then started the season opener
against Baltimore. Jacksonville won, 28-27, and this is what
Johnson did: 20 of 24 passing for 294 yards with two touchdowns and
a rushing touchdown. His completion percentage of 83.3 for that
game set a Jacksonville record, and it was the best by a first-time
starter since the 1970 merger of the NFL and the American Football
League.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Johnson missed the next game with an injury and then Brunell
returned the following week. Johnson sat for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But on the strength of his three-game audition, Johnson earned
plenty of interest, especially from the Bills, who traded first-and
fourth-round draft spots for him and then signed him to a
five-year, $25.5 million contract with an $8.5 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought my time would come,'' Johnson said. ``I knew
I had the physical tools to play in this game and I had the two
things it takes to be successful at quarterback _ toughness and
smarts. I don't have the Brett Favre arm. I don't have Mark
Brunell's feet or elusiveness. I'd like to think I'm in-between on
those things. I pride myself on accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bills figured I was a young quarterback who had
been in the league and was worth the chance, as opposed to a rookie
quarterback coming straight out of college _ that's a crap shoot.
I've played and been around. But I know that fans here are like
fans everywhere. You don't perform well, and they boo you. You
don't perform well often enough, and they will help get rid of you.
I've got thick skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 6 feet 4 inches, 214 pounds. He is from Newport
Beach, Calif. He is all beach, sun and surf. The problem is, there
is little to none of that in Buffalo in November and December, when
the weather turns brutal and game conditions are often ugly.
Johnson said he can handle it, though. The Bills think he can, but
no one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But Flutie certainly can.
</P>
<P>
   He has played in blizzards in Canada and has succeeded. He
played eight CFL seasons and won the most valuable player award six
times, along with five passing titles and three Grey Cup
championships. Before that, Flutie, 35, played four NFL seasons,
splitting time with Chicago and New England from 1986 through 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his mobility, the Bills can use him as a change of
pace, inserting him for six to eight plays a game to ruffle the
opposing defense. And maybe Flutie, at 5-10 and 175 pounds, will
play more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athleticism and experience is my game,'' Flutie said. ``I'm
thrilled to be back in the NFL. I don't look at this year in
Buffalo as rebuilding. We want to win, and we have a nucleus of
veterans and youth to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo defense ranked No. 9 overall last season. Antowain
Smith and Thomas are anchors of the running game. The receivers
include Reed and Quinn Early and the former Dallas Super Bowl
champion Kevin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Bills, it all starts at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kelly is not there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people expect and I accept that,'' Johnson said.
``The Buffalo fans want the Bills to win at least a couple of Super
Bowls. I'd take one _ and we'd go from there.''

COMMENTARY: CLINTON'S FOREIGN DEBT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ I thought that by going all the way to
Brazil, I might actually escape the Bill Clinton soap opera. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Scene one: A Brazilian macho men's association recently voted
Bill Clinton ``Macho Man of the Year,'' and even delivered the
award to the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Scene two: Lunch in Rio de Janeiro with a group of Brazilian
businessmen. They want to know just one thing: What might Bill
Clinton's troubles mean for U.S. investment in Brazil? ``The whole
world is depending on U.S. capital flows,'' explains Joel Korn, a
leading Brazilian management consultant. ``If there is a change in
the U.S. situation because of the president's troubles, which
affects U.S. investment overseas, the whole world will be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   You have here in a nutshell the two basic foreign reactions to
Clinton's troubles: 1) Surely you Americans can't be serious about
prosecuting a president for adultery. World leaders always play
around _ just look at ours. And 2) My God, what if you Americans
are serious about prosecuting your president for adultery! Don't
you realize how important you are for the rest of the world? You
are the world's only superpower. Nothing happens without you. And
every emerging market is depending on your economic stability.
Maybe you think you don't need a president _ but the rest of the
world does.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Half the time the rest of the world is
snickering at us as naive Puritans and half the time they are
unnerved that we might actually devour another president, with all
the uncertainty that might entail.
</P>
<P>
   They are right to be concerned. Americans may think the world is
safe for us to indulge in this entertaining Clinton saga _ and for
U.S. foreign policy to come to a standstill while it plays out _
but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Look what's going on out there: Russia, with 20,000 nuclear
weapons and an impoverished arms industry ready to sell anything to
anyone, is teetering on the edge of collapse. Kosovo and Albania
are imploding. China is considering devaluing its currency, in a
move that could trigger a whole new downward economic spiral in
Asia that would surely hurt the U.S. economy. Japan is stumbling
around, lost. Saddam Hussein is preparing to rear his ugly head
again. Iran is testing a long-range missile. The Arabs are moving
closer to Iran, out of a feeling that the United States is too weak
now to protect them from any Iranian meddling. The expansion of
U.S. free trade, through the fast-track process, is frozen because
the president is afraid to confront Congressional Democrats on this
issue, because they are his only core support. And the Arab-Israeli
peace process is frozen, in part because the White House has
completely wimped out from its vow to confront Israel's prime
minister, Bibi Netanyahu, if he continues to reject the U.S. peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not some backdoor argument for letting the president
off the hook and just ignoring this whole tawdry affair. It is an
argument for why the president, in whatever he says to the grand
jury next week or to the American public afterward, has to bring
this case to a close, once and for all. No more ``I didn't
inhale,'' ``I didn't consummate,'' ``Not to my recollection.'' It's
enough, already.
</P>
<P>
   The press is now full of reports about infighting in the White
House between aides who think the president should come clean with
the grand jury and aides who think he shouldn't. Excuse me, but are
these guys nuts? Do they really think there is any hope for
salvaging the Clinton presidency with anything less than a full
disclosure? Do they really think America's national security
interests can indefinitely tolerate a wounded president, constantly
on the run from the press, courts and Congress?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has got to say and do now what is necessary to put this
case behind him _ in a way that might give at least some chance for
him to pursue the progressive agenda, at home and abroad, for which
he was elected. He owes that to all the people who believe in the
social and economic programs for which he stood, and still might be
able to salvage. He owes that to all the people who don't want to
see an isolationist, mean-spirited Republican right shaping
America's future.
</P>
<P>
   But to have a morally impeached Bill Clinton, without a shred of
hope for Clintonism, well, what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, whatever your aides might say, your options are
to tell the truth or resign. I hope you tell the truth, because the
country and the world can't afford to have you endlessly twisting
in the wind.

ISRAEL SET TO RELEASE PALESTINIAN PRISONERS IN EFFORT TO REVIVE
TALKS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Apparently in an effort to rescue imperiled peace
talks, Israel was reported on Monday to be preparing to free dozens
of Palestinian prisoners whose release had been urged by
Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, first reported by Israel Radio, was discussed on
Monday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's aides, although a
formal meeting on the subject was postponed until Tuesday. And
while Netanyahu's two top security advisers have disagreed over the
timing and wisdom of the proposed step, aides to Netanyahu said
they expected the plan to be carried out in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The idea gained prominence Monday after Palestinian officials
warned starkly on Sunday that they were prepared to call a halt to
meetings between the two sides unless Israel used a meeting that
was taking place Monday night to propose new ways to break a
16-month deadlock in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner release would not address the Palestinians' chief
concern: Netanyahu's rejection of an American-backed plan calling
for Israel to pull back its troops from an additional 13 percent of
the West Bank as part of a long-overdue troop withdrawal. And
because Israel would still hold 3,000 Palestinian prisoners, some
Palestinian officials dismissed the idea of a new prisoner release
as an empty gesture.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared, though, that such a gesture might be enough to
dissuade the Palestinians from calling an immediate halt to the
talks, which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet described
on Saturday as having been ``a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have a keen interest in portraying Israel as
the obstacle to progress, and as word of a possible prisoner
release began to spread Monday afternoon, a top Palestinian
official, Saeb Erekat, appeared to back away from the threat to
break off talks if Monday's working-level talks were not decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Monday's meeting would be the last, Erekat said,
``I don't want to make any prejudgments.'' He said that Arafat and
other Palestinian leaders would review the session's outcome and
then decide what steps to take next.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Netanyahu called on the Palestinians ``to stop
using the language of ultimatums.'' He added: ``I think the
Palestinians would be ill-advised to create artificial crises.
That's not going to lead anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Netanyahu's government, the main champion of a new
prisoner release has been the public security minister, Avigdor
Kahalani. Kahalani heads the moderate Third Way party, which has
threatened to pull out of the government unless Netanyahu reaches
an accord with the Palestinians. He characterized the plan as one
bound to be welcomed by Arafat as a show of Israeli good will.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Mordechai, the defense minister, had reportedly opposed
the plan on grounds that such a step should be taken only as part
of a broader accord, which he has said should be hammered out as
quickly as possible. But an Israeli official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said he understood that Mordechai had shown
a new willingness to relax that objection.
</P>
<P>
   Some strong opposition was voiced, however, from the far right
of Netanyahu's Likud Party. Conservatives, including Michael Eitan,
an outspoken member of the party's right wing, said that any
decision to release more Palestinian prisoners at this juncture
could be dangerous and foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   The release would probably include as many as 100 Palestinians,
most of them ill and none seen as a security threat, Israeli
officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As reports of the Israeli plan began to circulate Monday, the
Palestinian authorities submitted their own list of 120 prisoners
they said they want freed. At the same time, dozens of Palestinians
staged a demonstration outside Arafat's office in Gaza in which
they held aloft photographs of relatives held prisoner in Israeli
jails and demanded that the Palestinian leader secure their
release.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves appeared to suggest that freeing more Palestinians
from Israeli jails might well help to shore up Arafat's standing
among Palestinians, who are growing angry because his quest for
peace has produced so few tangible dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palestinian officials have shown no sign of backing away
from what they have made their bottom-line demand: that Netanyahu
carry out the 13 percent troop withdrawal that American officials
have called the minimum that the Palestinians could accept. Since
the plan was presented to the two sides in March, Netanyahu's
government has said repeatedly that it cannot envision ceding so
much territory to the Palestinians and has offered only what the
Palestinians have rejected as unacceptable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Israeli party to say yes to the American
initiative,'' Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said in an
interview published Monday. ``The issue does not need negotiations
but needs decisions, and we are waiting for the Israeli
government.''

FINANCE MINISTER'S COMMENTS DRIVES YEN DOWN AGAINST DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The yen fell to its lowest level against the dollar in
seven weeks on Monday, as currency traders tentatively tested the
new Japanese government's resolve to let the market determine the
currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. on Monday, one dollar could buy 145.63 yen, up from
144.79 yen when trading opened Monday morning and from 144.70 yen
late Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many currency traders and economists expect the dollar to test
this year's high of 146.75 yen any day, although few have forgotten
being burned by intervention by the United States and Japanese
governments after that high was hit on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Kiichi Miyazawa, the newly appointed minister of finance, caught
the markets' attention last week when he suggested that markets,
rather than governments, should determine the appropriate
dollar-yen exchange rate, although he hedged his comments by saying
intervention was ``all right'' in an ``extreme situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment by Miyazawa when he said he would leave the market
to determine exchange rates was what got the most interest in the
market, and now they're speculating about whether he will be as
committed as his predecessor to capping the market,'' said Robert
Alan Feldman, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman has set a target of 160 yen to the dollar by the end of
this year based on continuing gloomy economic fundamentals. On
Monday, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said domestic
vehicle sales fell 8.4 percent from a year earlier, the 16th
consecutive month that sales have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding mini-vehicles, however, sales climbed 13.5 percent
from the previous month, and two of the country's five largest car
makers, Honda and Mazda, reported a 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent
sales increase, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets have been skeptical of new Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's ability to address Japan's weak economy and shaky
banking system quickly and comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's new economic team _ including Miyazawa, Taichi Sakaiya,
the head of the Economic Planning Agency, and Toyoo Gyohten, who is
the prime minister's special adviser on financial issues _ has won
some grudging respect from the markets, but doubts still linger.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, they have not articulated a single philosophy on what
economic changes they will pursue, and Miyazawa is blamed in some
quarters for doing little to rein in the speculative growth that
created Japan's economic bubble in the 1980s.

A HEARTENING RETURN TO PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 9)  
(mk) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was in Alaska almost a decade ago when a ship nearly three
times the length of a football field went aground, spilling 11
million gallons of crude oil into the Eden of Prince William Sound.
Day 1 was shock and trauma. Day 2 disbelief. By the third day,
fishermen who would never so much as wince if their hands were
pierced by grappling hooks were crying like infants. Alaska's
beloved inland sea, with all its otters and whales, puffins and
bald eagles, was thought to be mortally wounded.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it was heartening this summer to return to the scene of one
of the nation's worst environmental disasters _ the largest oil
spill in North American history _ and see not only that the fecund
life of Prince William Sound seemed to be coming back, but that an
ever resourceful Alaska seaport had fashioned something lasting and
monumental from the disaster.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the 1989 spill, as oil spread more than 600
miles from the rupture point near Valdez, the town of Seward served
as a triage base for the thousands of dying marine mammals and
birds. It was a gold rush camp for ``spillionaires,'' as those who
made a killing off the cleanup were called, and not a pretty sight.
An army of people scrubbed oil from rocks, while others brought in
fresh casualties: majestic, feisty seabirds or otters tarred and
poisoned by oil. Most of them died slow, painful deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Now Seward is jumping, but in a different way. The town, 130
miles from Anchorage on the southern shore of the Kenai Peninsula,
has just opened the Alaska Sea Life Center, which the organizers
say is the Western Hemisphere's foremost cold-water research and
rehabilitation center for marine wildlife. The 115,000-square-foot
facility cost $56 million to build, much of it from money paid by
Exxon after a court settlement. State officials expect the center
to rival Denali National Park as the No. 1 tourism site in Alaska
within a few years, drawing upward of 300,000 visitors a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center is a world-class hospital for marine mammals or birds
in peril. But of equal import for the visitor, it is an enormous
window on the world of the north Pacific and all its inlets _ a
place to watch many of the odd wonders and daily habits of
everything from king crabs to sea lions to salmon, which return to
spawn in a little waterway just next to the center.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Seward has become a bustling base for
excursions by kayak, cruise ship or tour boat into Prince William
Sound and the neighboring Kenai Fjords National Park. Eco-tourism
has brought unimagined prosperity to this town of 3,000 people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A half-day at the sea life center watching sea otters fuss or
puffins dive, followed by at least a half-day on the sound
observing those creatures in their larger habitat, is enough to
leave anyone with some understanding of why Jacques Cousteau could
get so worked up over the most complex ecosystem on earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seward is an easy two-and-a-half-hour drive from Anchorage on
one of Alaska's most scenic highways (it is a redundancy, of
course, to call any highway in Alaska scenic). The road ends when
you run out of land, on the shores of Resurrection Bay. Seward is
home port to what may be the world's largest halibut fleet, and
Sewardites are crazed about the big, goofy-looking fish. Halibut
charters still make up much of the town's lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of town, latched to rock at the base of mountains
that rise steeply from shore, is the new sea life center. In the
way of new buildings in the north that attempt to capture as much
light as possible, the center seems airy and skylighted, even in
the below-ground rooms with their large windows to the sea. When I
was there, not long after the solstice, it seemed so luminescent
with summer glow that there was no need for electric light. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most aquariums and saltwater theme parks are set up for
entertainment. Orcas frolic on cue, penguins waddle for fish and
sea lions bark for their dinners. Not so at the sea life center. It
is meant to draw people into the natural world of the sea, to
engage them in a way Disney has never attempted. It is a nonprofit
center, but they are selling the ocean. Still, while eschewing
theme park shtick, the sea life center delivers its share of
scientific exposition in an entertaining manner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, consider halibut _ an ugly fish that can weigh up
to 500 pounds or more. It feels like a tire at the end of a fishing
line. The meat, if fresh, is as good as lobster. A halibut, which
is a flounder, has two eyes on one side, no eye on the other. One
of the first tanks in the sea life center provides an answer for
this anomaly: At a young age, a halibut starts to live on its side,
at which point the eye facing down will migrate to join the eye
facing out. There is a halibut in mideye transition in the tank.
After I'd spent a few minutes with him, fish and chips took on new
meaning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An entire room in the sea life center is devoted to the oil
spill. The exhibit tends to stick with the facts, with minimal
preachiness. The immortal words of Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the
Exxon Valdez, are highlighted: ``We've fetched up hard aground
north of Goose Island off Bligh Reef, and evidently leaking some
oil.'' The oil would contaminate more than 1,500 miles of
shoreline, kill in excess of 250,000 seabirds, 2,000 sea otters,
300 harbor seals and 250 bald eagles. Its full effect, particularly
on the dwindling population of Steller sea lions, may not be known
for years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sea otters, frisky and bewhiskered, constantly fluffing up their
thick fur to stay warm, became symbols of what oil could do to a
pristine body of water and its inhabitants. And otters are likely
to be one of the main draws at the sea life center. Once they were
nearly extinct, hunted by Russians and the Aleut natives they
enslaved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They have made a strong comeback, though their numbers are down
considerably since the spill. From the outdoor deck of the center,
you can usually see otters floating on their backs in the bay
below, grooming, and consuming large quantities of shellfish. If
you linger long enough outside, you may also see Dall's porpoises
or even humpback whales, both of which cruise the deep waters of
the bay looking for prey. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inside, down below, are the main attractions: several large,
glass-walled tanks with sea lions, harbor seals and a variety of
birds. These are creatures that, for the most part, have already
grown used to life around humans, and after being cared for are
unable to return to the wild. They live in rookeries designed to be
like their natural habitats or in dark, deep-water hollows. The
harbor seals, sleek-looking with tiny ears, are quite playful, and
move like torpedoes through the water. A good-sized octopus, a wolf
eel and king crabs occupy other tanks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the most fascinating, perhaps, are the seabirds. They use
their wings like the collapsing sides of the Batmobile; divebombing
from the air, they convert the wings to paddling purpose to swim
deep in search of shellfish. In the evening I took a cruise in
search of sea life beyond Resurrection Bay. Most Seward-based tour
boats head southwest, for up-close views of glaciers breaking apart
in Kenai Fjords National Park. We went the other way, on a
double-tiered tour boat holding about 60 people, to Prince William
Sound. At Fox Island we stopped for a salmon bake, cooked in native
style over alder wood, inside a lodge on an island with no
electricity. Fox Island is a favorite place for kayakers who want
to overnight at one of the small cabins.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then it was out beyond Cape Resurrection to islands packed with
birds and animals. It was the time of year when Steller sea lions
haul out on rocks for a mating ritual that makes 19th-century
Mormon patriarchs seem celibate by comparison. The bulls, some
weighing up to a ton, with manes that make them look like lions,
will herd about 10 females on a rock, then keep them there for
days, mounting them at will. They also guard them from other males.
We passed several rocks jutting from the sea, each a place of
fierce and polygamous lovemaking. Elsewhere the young bachelors, as
they are called, have their own rock hangouts, where they lounge
and dream of growing old and promiscuous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steller sea lions are disappearing, though, and their status is
so uncertain that the government has taken steps to place them
under the protection of the Endangered Species Act. Research at the
sea life center in Seward could prove to be the difference in
whether mating displays like the one I saw will continue to be part
of this cold, green section of the world.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seabird rookeries were equally energetic. Puffins with
rainbow-colored beaks dove between thousands of black-legged
kittiwakes, murres, auklets and cormorants. A single rock island
was packed so tight with birds it was like Yankee Stadium in the
midst of pennant fever _ minus the boo birds, of course. An eagle
attacking a kittiwake nest was quite entertaining, as the smaller
birds massed and squawked in an effort to distract the
silver-headed raptor.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the birds, the recent geology of the area provided
other diversions. The 1964 earthquake, a 9.2 on the Richter scale,
was the largest ever recorded in North America. It remade Alaska,
destroying several small towns in the process. Around Seward, parts
of the coastline slipped into the sea. The land dropped about six
feet on average in the islands off Seward. Bluffs became beaches
and beaches became ocean floors. What you see now in parts of the
sound and around the Kenai Peninsula are ghost forests, the gray
trees that were plunged down so deep that their roots reached salt
water. Thus they are frozen, perfectly preserved, like Lot's wife.
The ghost forests, with their new flat beaches, are wonderful
places for kayakers to camp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the return to Seward, the high, glacier-bound peaks held the
sun until nearly midnight. The deep crevasses and walls of ice,
usually blue in midday, took on the pink blush of Alaskan summer
sunsets. I saw black bears rambling through meadows, eagles
everywhere, even a snow-white goat perched on a high cliff. We were
followed into port by a pair of sea otters and by fishermen
exhausted by a day of reeling in halibut. They were not crying.

`MAXIMUM BOB': ELMORE LEONARD'S JUDGE TRANSFORMED INTO A QUIRKY
GOOD OLD BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Please check local listings.) 
(js) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1991 novel ``Maximum Bob,'' Elmore Leonard wrote that the
title character, a crackpot Florida judge guided more by whim than
law, looked like the actor Harry Dean Stanton. Things change. Now
Judge Bob Gibbs shows up on television looking like the actor Beau
Bridges. Not only that, his chilly nastiness seems to have warmed
into good-old-boy quirkiness. He's nearly cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   That may be disappointing for Leonard's devotees who enjoy
skulking along the moral fringes with his losers. (They're
sometimes winners, rarely heroes.) But the judge's transformation
holds promise for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   How much promise depends on the progress of ABC's ``Maximum
Bob'' series, which begins a seven-week trial run Tuesday night at
10. The executive producers include Barry Sonnenfeld, the film
director who authentically conveyed Leonard's cockeyed netherworld
in ``Get Shorty,'' and Alex Gansa, whose television credits include
a stint as supervising producer of ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The network provided advance tapes of two hourlong episodes: the
show's pilot, to be broadcast Tuesday night, and the third
installment, scheduled for Aug. 18. The former is a goofy
curiosity. The latter has an offbeat charm that could grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hour, directed by Sonnenfeld and written by Gansa,
crams in many of the plot elements from the novel while sowing
seeds for the series. We meet Bridges as the judge and Kiersten
Warren as his wife, Leanne, who spouts a lot of kooky spiritualism,
sometimes in the voice of a long-dead black girl named Wanda Grace.
(Leanne, like the other characters, is white.) Bob, who was
otherwise married when he spotted the much-younger Leanne when she
was a mermaid in an underwater show, has grown tired of her and
decides to scare her out of his life with the aid of an alligator.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the book's other major figures have been transformed.
Kathy Baker, Leonard's tough but vulnerable newly divorced young
probation officer, has become a tough but vulnerable newly divorced
public defender, played by Liz Vassey. Bob still makes a pass at
her. Her romantic interest, a suave police officer named Gary
Hammond, has become the not so suave Sheriff (Sam Robards),
fulfilling his late wife's wish that he learn the tango.
</P>
<P>
   The show flies by in a blur of bright lights and not so bright
grotesque minor characters, one of whom holds Leanne hostage and
seeks her help in writing a ransom note. ``How do you spell
orels?'' he asks, as in ``Do what I say orels I will put her in the
wood chipper.'' Stick with it. Before the final fade-out, those
exploding fireballs in the sky are explained.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What isn't explained, at least not yet, is what happened between
the pilot and the show to be seen in two weeks. We've now come
pretty far from Leonard's territory, but this new place has charms
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Bob has become even more warm and fuzzy. He and Leanne, who has
deep-sixed the voice from the great beyond, seem to have fallen
back in love. She takes organic fruit to the women her husband has
thrown into the local jail. One of them is Bob's ex-wife, Rosellen
Fortenot (Lee Garlington), to whom he declares, ``You are to
cynicism what Vermont is to syrup.''
</P>
<P>
   May she return, along with Rudolfo Esquival (Miguel Sandoval),
the sheriff's tango teacher, who has more than dance steps on his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, written by Theresa Rebeck and directed by Marc
Buckland, prime-time veterans, has an off-the-wall plot that
includes Fidel Castro, smuggled cigars, poisoned darts, an NBA
franchise and the state tango championship, not necessarily in that
order. There are also a pair of mysterious government agents with
black suits and dark glasses, an obvious but deft poke at
Sonnenfeld's film ``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Bridges, grinning under his redneck's buzz cut,
looks as if he's having a wonderful time. If ``Maximum Bob'' can
maintain its off-kilter inventiveness, it could build a following.

   Blockbuster events along the routes of summer travel tend to
find you: fireworks on the Fourth, state fairs, major festivals.
But sometimes news of events that families remember forever is
encountered by accident, in a flier at a rest stop, or a free local
summer-events publication.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a peek at choice events in museums, on college campuses
and at outdoor amphitheaters. On campuses, the schedule is skinnier
in August to give the schools a chance to get ready for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, information is given on a new service for parents
of high school students who want to visit any of 15 colleges in the
Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alfresco Plays &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor dramas are major attractions in the United States, with
about 100 scheduled. Around half are on historic themes, and many
of the others are Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Snow Camp Outdoor Theater,  &LR; Snow Camp, N.C., between
Greensboro and Chapel Hill, is presenting William Hardy's ``Sword
of Peace,'' about the Cane Creek Society of Friends and the
difficulties that adherents of nonviolence encountered in the
Revolution. This alternates with ``Pathway to Freedom,'' about
antislavery efforts in North Carolina before the Civil War.
Performances are 8:30 p.m. from Wednesday to Saturday until Aug.
15. Admission: $10, senior citizens $8 and children under 11 $5.
Call (800) 726-5115.
</P>
<P>
   Several plays tell of white settlers who were captured by
Indians and escaped or remained to start a different life. The
musical ``Blue Jacket,'' written by W.L. Mundell and composed by
Michael Rasbury, is about an Ohio Valley man who became a Shawnee
chief. This story is presented by  &UR; First Frontier  &LR; in Xenia, Ohio,
30 minutes east of Dayton. Performances Tuesday to Sunday at 8 p.m.
until Sept. 6; admission is $8 to $14, $6 for children under 13.
Information: (937) 376-4318.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of Jenny Wiley'' is a musical drama about a white
woman who fled captivity by Indians in the 1780s and whose story
became a legend. It is presented until Aug. 23 by the  &UR; Jenny Wiley
Theater  &LR; in Prestonsburg, in eastern Kentucky, in rotation with
``Smoke on the Mountain'' and ``Cinderella.'' Performances at 8:15

and Friday. Admission is $15, $13 for seniors and $8 for students
under 18; (606) 886-9274.
</P>
<P>
   In Alturas, nearly surrounded by a national forest in northeast
California, the  &UR; Modoc County Arts Council  &LR; will present ``Lost
River: the Story of the Modoc Indian War,'' by Ben Van Meter. In
the 1872-73 war, Indians refusing to leave their homes held off the
Army for nine months before fleeing and being tracked down and
tried. Performances are Aug. 27 to 29 at 8 p.m. and Aug. 30 at 3
p.m. Admission is $8, $6 for children and seniors. Call (530)
233-5454.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Institute of Outdoor Drama &LR;  maintains a Web site:
unc.edu/depts/outdoor. An annual directory costs $5 by mail: CB
3240, Nationsbank Plaza, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
N.C. 27599.
</P>

   Campus offerings often provide a showcase for summer-session
arts students.  &UR; Bates College  &LR; in Lewiston, Maine, is holding a
dance festival through Aug. 16, with visiting companies on the
schedule. ``Different Voices,'' on Aug. 13, for example, includes
dances by Japanese, Javanese, Cape Verdean, South African and
Australian artists who have been part of an international

Information: (207) 786-6381.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Skidmore College  &LR; in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a major tourism
area, stays busy all summer with writing classes and jazz
festivals. In August, the 250 members of the Boys Choir of Harlem
are at their summer camp. On Aug. 18 at 7:30 p.m., the choir will
offer a concert for its own benefit at the outdoor Saratoga
Performing Arts Center. Seats are $15, $8 for children; lawn
admission is $8, free for children under 12. Skidmore: (518)
580-5590.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, the modern dance students of the New York State
Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs offer a final
performance at the dance theater at Skidmore. This is free. Until

Museum of Dance on South Broadway in Saratoga Springs, where two
daily rehearsals, from 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 4 p.m. are open
Tuesday to Saturday. The admission prices are $1 for children under

Fever'' by Noel Coward, ``The Fantastiks'' and ``My Fair Lady'' in
repertory rotation until Aug. 20 with performances Tuesday to
Sunday at 7:30 p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m. Admission to the first
two plays is $13, $12 for seniors, $11 for students and $9 for
youths; ``My Fair Lady'' is slightly higher. Call (360) 650-6146.

   Aquariums, as any parent of a Scout knows, are providing
entrancing opportunities: Sleep with the fishes! Now at least three
of these are offering overnights to parents and children who are
not part of a group. It sounds wonderful to put a sleeping bag down
by the Coral Reef tank, as they do in Tampa, but Betty Kay Swanson,
who directs the program at the  &UR; John G. Shedd Aquarium  &LR; in Chicago,
says that the absolute best thing in the kids' eyes is to be in the
aquarium after hours and to talk with the staff who watch the
place.
</P>
<P>
   These programs all require reservations; participants bring
their sleeping bags and pillows and pay a fee for meals and special
programs. The Shedd has been doing these programs for seven years
for members, but now offers them for others, too, with as many as
350 people participating. The minimum age is 5; all children must
be accompanied by an adult. The next night is Sept. 25. The cost is
$45, $40 for members, with dinner, a bedtime snack and Continental
breakfast. Information: (312) 692-3333. The  &UR; Florida Aquarium  &LR; in
Tampa has been offering regular family overnights; the September
date is pending. Information: (813) 273-4176. The  &UR; New England
Aquarium  &LR; in Boston is offering two to the general public this
year; the next is Nov. 13. Call (617) 973-5206.

   For those already looking toward life as a freshman in the fall
of '99, checking out Boston universities has been made easier by an
organization called Campus Visit. The organization says that
100,000 students take a look at the Boston area, so 15 colleges set
up a consortium to provide information to potential visitors. A
magazine, Campus Visit, 1998, is available from the colleges or on
the Web at campusvisit.com. Sheets on any participating college may
be ordered by touch-tone phone through (888) 998-4748, and an
affiliated travel agency can make reservations for hotels, air
travel and a car. Participating schools are: Bentley, Berklee,
Boston University, Brandeis, Emerson, Harvard and Radcliffe, MIT,
Northeastern, Regis, Simmons, Stonehill, Suffolk, Tufts, Wellesley
and Wheaton.

   The airline industry has always been a good breeding ground for
copycats, so when Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, the
country's fourth- and fifth-largest carriers respectively,
announced a ``global strategic alliance'' in January, the other
major airlines immediately began circling one another.
</P>
<P>
   By April United Airlines, the country's largest carrier, and
Delta Airlines, the third largest, announced their own alliance as
did No. 2 American Airlines and No. 6 US Airways. The airlines say
that the three alliances, which together cover about 70 percent of
all domestic passengers, will give consumers more choices, lower
fares and improved service.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have denounced the proposed linkups, arguing that
any benefits they may bring will be far outweighed by the lack of
competition that is likely to result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume that members of an alliance are not going to compete
strenuously with one another,'' said Alfred Kahn, who presided over
the deregulation of the airline industry 20 years ago and is now
professor emeritus at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   In June the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, released a preliminary assessment of the deals. It found
that the alliances would reduce the number of competing airlines on
1,836 of the 5,000 busiest routes, which account for 90 percent of
total domestic traffic. Historically, the GAO said, when
competition declines, fares rise. It estimated that 100 million of
the 396 million passengers who fly each year faced potential
disadvantages, compared with potential benefits for about 30
million passengers on 338 routes.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have announced the deals at a time when they are
reporting record profits and their best customers _ business
travelers _ are complaining about high fares and overcrowded
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a potent election-year issue, members of Congress have
denounced the high fares, proposing a half dozen bills to promote
competition. But it is unclear what the government can do to stop
the alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the proposed linkups is slightly different. Northwest
and Continental plan to code-share _ meaning that each carrier will
sell its partner's flights as if they were its own _ forming a
global network from Asia to South America. The deal requires the
approval of the antitrust division of the Justice Department
because Northwest proposes to buy a controlling stake in
Continental. The department has also asked for information from
United and Delta, which plan to code-share but will exclude their
European operations and will not invest in each other.
</P>
<P>
   American and US Airways plan only to open up their
frequent-flier programs and airport lounges to each other's
members, something planned in the two other alliances also. That
does not require government approval, although the Department of
Transportation does have the power to intervene if it believes that
passengers are being adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, linking frequent-flier programs appears to be a
consumer boon. For example, as of Aug. 1, holders of US Airways'
Dividend Miles can use their miles to fly American to Hawaii, a
popular destination that US Airways does not now serve. But adding
US Airways' 20 million frequent-fliers makes the competition for
the limited number of seats reserved for free tickets that much
fiercer. Many passengers already complain that seats are not
available when they try to redeem their miles. A recent Consumer
Reports study found that domestic airlines last year booked 152,000
fewer free seats on routes most popular with frequent-fliers than
they did in 1996. (Several airlines said they actually gave away
more seats last year and accused the magazine of using misleading
data.)
</P>
<P>
   More troubling is the prospect that the alliances will reduce
competition among the major airlines and strengthen their already
strong hold on large metropolitan hubs.
</P>
<P>
   United, Delta, Northwest and Continental all say that there is
little overlap in their route systems and that by combining them
they will be able to offer service to cities they currently do not
serve. For example, someone living in Lincoln, Neb., which is now
served by United, will be able to book a ticket straight through to
Sarasota, Fla., which is served by Delta.
</P>
<P>
   But only a small number of passengers fly such routes each year,
compared with the millions who travel between United's hub in
Denver and Delta's base in Atlanta. The two carriers now dominate
air service between those cities, and critics say that they will
have little incentive to compete once they are allied.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also said that the alliances will strengthen the hold
that the major airlines have at the four airports where the number
of landings and takeoffs are strictly controlled _ Kennedy and La
Guardia in New York, O'Hare in Chicago and National in Washington.
That would make it even more difficult for small carriers to expand
service at these key airports. Indeed, the GAO and other critics
say that the alliances threaten the major achievement of
deregulation, which has been the competition introduced by new
discount carriers.

ADVERTISING: PEGASUS FLIES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 77 years of serving as the symbol of Mobil gasoline, motor
oil and other automotive products, the flying horse is now being
brought to life as part of a comprehensive image campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An animated, 3-D version of Pegasus, the classic red flying
horse icon, is the star of television commercials that are meant to
evoke warm, fuzzy feelings in consumers. The glitzy spots, which
feature the Grammy award-winning song ``I Believe I Can Fly,'' by
R. Kelly, stand in marked contrast to Mobil's traditionally bland,
product-focused pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Pegasus campaign is indicative of attempts by marketers of
products bearing valuable, though venerable, trademarks to reach
today's consumers. In many instances, the presentation is, like
Mobil's, retro-chic, updating familiar fare to take advantage of
fond memories of an idealized past.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include the return of the contoured bottle and
red disk in advertising for Coca-Cola Co. and the redesigns of such
ad characters as Sailor Jack and Bingo, the boy and dog featured on
packages of Cracker Jack snacks, now owned by the Frito-Lay unit of
Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pegasus is a way to emotionalize our relationship with the
customer,'' said Kevin Jeter, vice president for global fuel
marketing at Mobil Corp. in Fairfax, Va., and ``provides us with a
way to talk about anything we sell, whether it be our
convenience-store products, gas or service.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegasus _ a classical mythological creature associated with
strength, power and beauty _ is coming alive after consumers, in
focus groups, told Mobil executives how appealing the symbol was in
several different campaign formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research demonstrated how powerful the Pegasus icon is,''
Jeter said. ``It confirmed that there is a strong relationship
already between Pegasus and the consumer. The campaign only serves
to enhance that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegasus is the centerpiece of the extensive campaign, titled
``Take Wing,'' which began running in mid-May. The goal, Jeter
said, is to depict Mobil as a trusted brand with products that
``empower customers to live more productively'' and to celebrate
``the sense of power, energy, speed and service customers can
expect from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is an unusual joint effort of the Mobil roster
agencies. The lead agency, DDB Needham Worldwide in New York and
Chicago, part of Omnicom Group, handles general market advertising
for fuels and services. Arnold Communications in Boston, a unit of
Snyder Communications, handles advertising for convenience stores.
Ornelas &AMP; Associates in Dallas handles ads aimed at
Spanish-speaking consumers. And Burrell Communications Group in
Chicago handles campaigns for black consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking for ways to draw attention for their brand
and find something that separates them from the pack,'' said Ed
Hogikyan, management supervisor on the Mobil account at DDB Needham
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though spending for the campaign was not disclosed, trade
publications are estimating the budget at more than $30 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeter, who joined Mobil a little more than a year ago, said he
came up with the idea to give Pegasus a much more prominent role in
the brand's pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol has been in continuous use since it appeared on the
gas pumps of Standard Oil Co. of New York, which was eventually
renamed Mobil. But sometimes it has been played up, as when it
appeared on the giant signs that identified Mobil stations, and
other times it has been played down, particularly after a reworked
Mobil logo (with a red ``o'') became the primary identification for
the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of Pegasus signs are in demand among collectors
of advertising memorabilia and nostalgic Americana. Nowadays,
Pegasus has been on display on the pumps as well as in large
outdoor lighted panels at the service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of the campaign decided, Jeter said, that the Kelly
song would be an integral part of the commercials for TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is key,'' he said. ``It was so appropriate, and it
provides a memory device.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, ``I Believe I Can Fly'' comes from ``Space Jam,''
the 1996 movie featuring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny that was
based on the ``Air Jordan/Hare Jordan'' commercials for Nike Inc.
by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. That means that a song
written for a movie based on commercials is now being used in other
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Mobil TV spots, a child is shown looking out a car
window at the flying horse. Pegasus soars through the skies over
city and country locales until landing at a Mobil station. An
announcer's voice says: ``Do you believe man was meant to fly? We
do.'' The voice adds that at Mobil, ``everything we do lets you
take wing.'' The spot closes with the theme ``Mobil. The energy to
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial depicts Pegasus charging through a maze of
outdated gas pumps as a car tails behind. The announcer says: ``Do
you believe the old way of buying gas is dead? We do.'' That spot
is centered on the Mobil Speedpass system, which allows a customer
to use a tag to buy gasoline, with charges automatically billed to
a pre-selected credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Pegasus is back in a big way, it is Mobil's intention
``to stay the course,'' Jeter said, ``by building equity
long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer we stay with Pegasus,'' he added, ``the more
beneficial it will be.''

SHARI LEWIS, 65, STAR OF CHILDREN'S TELEVISION FOR FOUR DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (JT)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist
and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and
their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named
Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.
Uterine cancer was diagnosed in June, and Miss Lewis had been
undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, Ms. Begley said. She was
thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lewis' illness caused her to cut short her production in
Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS,
``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January
and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A
spokesman for PBS said Monday that three remaining episodes will be
broadcast in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year marked Miss Lewis' 50th anniversary as a performer.
Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in
New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught
her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before
``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,''
which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years
as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and
many other prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Miss Lewis said she got the idea for ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband,
the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what
children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show
features Dom DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who
delivers pizza by skateboard.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a
multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher,
she knew how to reach children with her puppet sidekicks, chief
among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly-haired creature who
would interrupt Miss Lewis with all manner of observations and
questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in
the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush
Puppy weren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a role model,'' she said. ``It's really very funny because
I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.''
She did this most convincingly even in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her
career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she
did. And so, when she created ``Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Miss Lewis
played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that
she wanted to learn to play, too. Miss Lewis then told Lamb Chop
that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do
much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Miss Lewis
said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came
to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and
percussion.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lewis felt that ``musical training teaches something that
is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to
what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, `get it.''' She
was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds
neurological connections and better study habits. In short, ``music
makes you smarter,'' she said. ``You could say that music is brain
food you eat through your ears.'' She deplored cutbacks in school
budgets that caused musical training to be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade
children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the
podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States,
Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like,
especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote 60 books for children, including ``Magic For
Nonmagicians,'' ``Things That Kids Collect,'' ``One-Minute Bedtime
Stories,'' ``One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ``One-Minute
Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos
for children.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City, the
daughter of Abraham Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a
magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York
City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was
an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age
of 2. But Miss Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist
and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin
under her chin.
</P>
<P>
   She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and
violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of
American Ballet; and acting with Sanford Meisner at the
Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a
girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in
the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had
been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian
to coach her.
</P>
<P>
   She attended Columbia University and in the 1950s was married
briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Tarcher in 1958. He survives
her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and
daughter collaborated with her in her projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miss Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her
skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company
and summer stock productions of ``Damn Yankees,'' ``Bye, Bye,
Birdie'' and ``Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and
casinos and did dramatic roles in television.
</P>
<P>
   Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she
appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ``Talent Scout'' show. In
1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on the ``Captain Kangaroo Show,''
which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ``The
Shari Show.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television
series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were
seen in Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lewis returned to children's television in the United
States with ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her
young: ``If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just
dance to that music.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television
programming for children and a close friend of Miss Lewis',
recalled Monday what it was like when Miss Lewis, accompanied by
Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the
House telecommunications subcommittee, which was holding hearings
on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television
Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such
protection and then informed Rep. Edward Markey, a Democrat from
Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop
wanted to testify, too. Markey readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb Chop turned to Miss Lewis and said, ``O.K., you can go
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go, you don't talk,'' Miss Lewis replied.
</P>
<P>
   So Miss Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the
occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for government
to care about children and children's television and to protect
young viewers from junk. ``It was one of those things that nobody
who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Monday, Miss Lewis' accomplishments as an educator
were praised by Richard Riley, the secretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said,
``Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''

HER LESSONS MORE THAN CHILD'S PLAY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; For most of her 64 years, kids came first for
Shari Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Since the '50s, Lewis slipped her hand into a sock to entertain
_ and, more importantly, educate and enlighten _ millions of
children.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the ventriloquist behind Lamb Chop, Charlie Horse and
Hush Puppy died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,
succumbing to pneumonia, which she contracted while undergoing
chemotherapy for her recently diagnosed uterine cancer. She was 64.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis turned her sock puppets into a cottage industry that
spawned books, videos and, of course, a television show. Earlier
this year, her Charlie Horse character got its own series, ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' (7:30 a.m. weekdays on KCET), a show
stressing the importance of preschool music education. Three new
episodes already have been taped, to be mixed in with reruns
scheduled to run through the fall. After that, her publicist Maggie
Begley speculated that the show will go off the air.
</P>
<P>
   No story was crafted without a suitable lesson, and Lamb Chop, a
6-year-old girl in sheep's clothing, was an easy character for
young girls to identify with.
</P>
<P>
   All of Lewis' ventures encouraged kids in the viewing audience
to participate. She was not interested in ratings or raising a new
breed of couch potatoes. She was not interested in being an
electronic baby sitter, rather more of an at-home, after-school
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' interactive approach to children's television taught,
rather than simply mesmerized, generations of American youth. Her
gentle presence on television also paved the way for a new batch of
children's show hosts, such as Soupy Sales and Pee-wee Herman, both
of whom she outlasted.
</P>
<P>
   Using fun sing-alongs, games and jokes, Lewis would make sure
her followers learned something _ whether they realized it or not.
And, she didn't go about it in a haphazard fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In conceiving ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza,'' for instance,
Lewis drew upon her background as a musician who graduated from New
York's High School of Music and Arts and conducted symphonies in
the United States, Canada and Japan. She worked closely with the
Music Educators National Conference to build the new show.
</P>
<P>
   Her impeccable reputation led to actors such as Dom DeLuise
signing on to her projects and musicians such as Ray Charles
playing along.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' work, including ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' has been
recognized with 12 Emmy Awards, the John F. Kennedy Center Award
for Excellence and Creativity, seven Parents' Choice Awards and the
Action for Children's Television Award. But more importantly, her
shows, videos and specials have been there for parents, their
children and their children's children.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis herself was a pistol. Born Shari Hurwitz in New York City,
she was an entertainer since age 2 and a singer, dancer, author,
actress and ventriloquist during the following 62 years. Sure, she
took children and her work seriously, but Lewis had a sensational
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1997 interview with the Daily News, she patiently got
into her Lamb Chop character and answered a few touchy questions:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sheep have been in the news a lot. What's your view on
cloning?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``If they clone me? If Shari had two of me, she'd really have
her hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, you're against cloning then?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I'm not against it. I mean I feel sheepish saying it, but
why clone me? Why mess with perfection?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when Lewis stayed at the l'Enfant Plaza Hotel in
Washington, D.C., the management took lamb chops off the menu in
deference to her. She told the Wall Street magazine, ``Actually,
rack of lamb is my favorite _ if for no other reason than to
horrify the waiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely her legacy will live on through her books, videos and
reruns of her television show. And if they aren't careful, future
generations of kids will have so much fun that they won't even
realize they are learning something. &UR;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian officials said on Monday that Muslim
rebels contesting Indian rule in Kashmir had crossed into a
neighboring Indian state overnight and shot and killed 34
construction workers who were sleeping in two remote construction
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the workers, most or all of them Hindus, was one
of the worst of its kind in the nine years of guerrilla warfare in
Kashmir. It followed days of escalating artillery battles between
Indian and Pakistani troops along the confrontation line that
separates the two armies in Kashmir, and prompted fears of a more
general escalation of the fighting over the divided territory.
</P>
<P>
   Since the underground nuclear tests that India and Pakistan
conducted in May, the United States has led a chorus of concern
around the world at the risks of Kashmir's becoming the flashpoint
of a new war between India and Pakistan that could prompt the use
of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the slaying of the construction workers began at
about 2 a.m. on Monday, when a group of assailants with automatic
rifles burst into a shed used as a dormitory by the workers at
Kalaban, 10 miles from the town of Chamba in northern Himachal
Pradesh. The fighting that followed killed 26 workers and wounded
eight, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, there was a similar attack on another
construction camp at the village of Shatrundi, along a remote
mountain road leading back into Kashmir, the police said. In the
second attack, eight workers were killed and three wounded.
Although the police accounts did not specify how the Indian
authorities could be sure the killers were Muslim guerrillas, the
inference seemed to be that only the guerrillas would have the
weapons and the motive for such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the two attacks is about 270 miles north of New
Delhi and only a few miles from the border between the Indian
states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Although attacks
by the guerrillas outside Kashmir have been rare, Indian officials
said they had received intelligence reports for some weeks
suggesting that the rebels might strike in Himachal Pradesh, a
usually peaceful state where the rebels would not face the heavy
Indian troop and police concentrations that confront them in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   News of the killings came as artillery battles in Kashmir
appeared to be intensifying. A report by Reuters news service from
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, put the number of civilians
killed on both sides in the artillery duels in the last five days
at 60. Other accounts placed the total closer to 80. The toll
appeared to be among the heaviest in years in the sporadic battles
that India and Pakistan have fought along the 550-mile line that
divides the larger part of Kashmir held by India from the smaller
part in Pakistan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indian military commanders played down the significance of the
artillery exchanges, saying similar upsurges occurred every summer
when melting snow in the Himalayan mountains opened passes through
which Muslim rebels infiltrate from bases in Pakistan-held Kashmir
to the Indian side. ``This is a seasonal feature, and there is
nothing to be alarmed about,'' said Air Chief Marshal S.K. Sareen,
chief of staff of the Indian Air Force, who spoke on a visit to
Srinagar, summer capital of Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir state.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody was so hopeful about the deteriorating
situation in the divided territory, especially after news broke of
the attack on the construction workers in Himachal Pradesh. A
frosty meeting last week between the Indian and Pakistani prime
ministers in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, did little to allay
the anxieties over Kashmir and the potential for using nuclear
weapons. The two leaders, Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz
Sharif of Pakistan, met while attending an annual conference of
South Asian heads of government.
</P>
<P>
   They were unable to agree on a formula for resuming diplomatic
talks on Kashmir and other contentious issues, including measures
to reduce the risk of a nuclear confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for both governments said Kashmir was the cause of the
deadlock, with Pakistan insisting Kashmir be the focus of the
discussions and India holding to its demand that Kashmir could be
discussed only in the context of a broader dialogue about security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   When the regional meeting ended on Friday, the delegations
returned home and blamed each other for the deadlock using harsh
language that suggested neither side was in the mood for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sharif told reporters in Islamabad that India was
responsible for escalating the artillery exchanges along the
border, which Pakistani officials said had caused at least 30
civilian casualties. Many of the victims were said to have died as
a result of Indian barrages on villages in the Neelum Valley area
of Pakistan-held Kashmir, northeast of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   ``India is indulging in irresponsible behavior, and I fail to
see any logic in this,'' Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
   Giving an account of his meeting with Sharif to the Indian
Parliament on Monday, Vajpayee said his government favored ``a
direct, composite dialogue'' with Pakistan, but not one that dealt
with tensions between the two countries in ``a narrow, segmented
fashion'' that focused on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Vajpayee said, he had admonished Sharif about
Pakistan's role in the territory, telling him that ``instigation of
terrorism was incompatible with our common desire for friendly and
peaceful relations and that these activities must cease
immediately.''

MASSACHUSETTS LAUNCHES HEPATITIS IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts public health officials launched a
campaign Monday urging residents to immunize themselves against
hepatitis B, a liver-damaging disease that in its chronic form
afflicts more than 1 million Americans and annually kills about
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The officials enlisted Congressman Joe Moakley of Boston, who
exhorted others to avoid the ``horrors'' he endured after he was
infected by the virus in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became jaundiced, my eyes were yellow,'' he said. ``I had no
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told me I had two months to live.''
</P>
<P>
   A liver transplant saved his life. But a series of three
vaccines over six months could have spared him the agony.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the most common types of hepatitis are A,
B, and C. Type B and C are spread through blood and bodily fluids,
according to a state Department of Public Health fact sheet. Type A
is spread through food or water contaminated with feces. Vaccines
protect against Types A and B only, although work on a vaccine for
hepatitis C is under way.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine against Type A is particularly recommended for
day-care center workers, and anyone who comes into close contact
with an infected person, travels to geographic areas that have poor
sanitation or lives in an area where there has been a recent
outbreak of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is 100 times more infectious than the HIV virus, and
can cause primary cancer of the liver or liver failure in chronic
cases, which comprise about 10 percent of all hepatitis B
infections. In these cases, people can carry the virus for decades
and infect others with it.
</P>
<P>
   As in Moakley's case, about 40 percent of hepatitis B cases stem
fron unknown causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can live for three weeks in a drop of dry blood,'' said
Linda Keller, hepatitis B coordinator for the state immunization
program. It can spread through nosebleeds or open sores, or through
sharing toothbrushes, razors, washcloths, needles or nail clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic hepatitis B affects 1.2 million Americans. Each year
200,000 people develop new infections, according to the American
Liver Foundation. Massachusetts doctors reported 1,200 chronic
cases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Every infant, child and adolescent in the state is at risk and
should be immunized, Keller said. Public health programs provide
free vaccines. More information is available at 617-983-6800.
</P>
<P>
   Adults should get tested and immunized if they are at high risk:
if they come from Asian or African countries, live with hepatitis B
infected people, are health care workers, use dialysis or IV drugs,
or engage in unprotected sex, or have multiple sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   About 88 percent of the infants born in the state are immunized,
Keller said, giving Massachusetts one of the highest rates in the
country. About 50 percent of schoolchildren are immunized now,
largely thanks to a federal and state funded program that, starting
in 1995, required vaccinations for sixth graders and made them
voluntary for older students.
</P>
<P>
   A new phase of the program will begin in 1998 requiring
immunizations for seventh graders.
</P>
<P>
   But very few adults _ even those at high risk _ are vaccinated.
For adults with high or low risk, Keller said, ``it's foolish not
to be vaccinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said that, if successful, the childhood immunization
programs could eradicate the disease in about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   State public health commissioner Howard Koh agreed. ``We believe
in the power of prevention. We have a vaccine and we're making
tremendous progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally preventable form of suffering,'' Koh said.

DOCTOR DECRIES ANTI-GAY USE OF RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lambasting a national anti-gay advertising campaign
that draws on his research, a Boston doctor Monday accused
conservative religious groups of distorting his work to support
their own theory: that homosexuality can be ``healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Garofalo, a Children's Hospital pediatrician who
authored a study of gay teenagers last spring, is cited at the
bottom of full-page advertisements featuring a group of smiling
``ex-gays,'' in a conversion campaign launched last month by a
coalition of Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's survey, which found high levels of substance abuse
among gays, is presented in the ads as footnoted evidence that
homosexuality is self-destructive. The ads contend that substance
abuse and other high-risk behavior among gays are the ``visible
response to a broken heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garofalo says he found nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete misrepresentation of what the research
actually says,'' he said. ``It was taken completely out of context.
It comes to the complete opposite conclusion of what the paper
actually concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   His paper _ titled ``The Association Between Health Risk
Behaviors and Sexual Orientation Among a School-based Sample of
Adolescents'' _ was published in May in the medical journal
Pediatrics, based on a 1995 survey of 4,300 adolescents in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It found that teenagers who consider themselves gay, lesbian, or
bisexual in high school also report ``disproportionate risk'' for a
number of other troubles _ especially suicide, violence, and
substance abuse. Garofalo believes the abuses are the result of the
alienation that gay teenagers face in a ``culture that is often
unaccepting.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ad campaign _ which was launched July 13 in seven
newspapers nationwide, prompting an immediate outcry from advocacy
groups _ shifts the cause of the problem onto homosexuality itself.
And conservative officials offered no apology Monday for their
interpretation of the medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexual behavior itself is a symptom of deeper, unmet
emotional needs,'' said Robert Knight, director of cultural studies
at the Family Research Council, a conservative think tank that is
helping fund the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in their heart knows the behavior is wrong,'' he
added. ``People who are caught up in it often cover their emotional
distress by abusing substances.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad mentioning Garofalo by name, the ``Standing for Truth''
campaign, was printed in the Washington Post on July 14, then
reprinted 15 days later in the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Some ads invoke the names of prominent opponents of
homosexuality, such as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and
others feature repentant former gays, such as Anne Paulk, who in
one full-page advertisement is billed as a ``wife, mother, former
lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Garofalo as a pawn of political correctness, Knight
said there is no substance to the theory that alienation can
produce self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying, if we could just understand adulterers
more, they wouldn't drink to cover up their guilt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo said he was ``horrified and angry'' about the
misappropriation of his work, calling the interpretation by the
religious right a ``divisive and destructive forum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an awful and very destructive message,'' he said
Monday. ``It alienates them, makes them further feel isolated and
alone. That's the very thing that leads to suicide, and leads to
the behaviors that were reported in my paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, which has sparked a renewed debate about
homosexuality, followed incendiary remarks last month by Lott, who
described homosexuality as a behavior that can be controlled, and
compared it to kleptomania. Advocacy groups have responded in kind,
taking out advertisements of their own to counter such allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community has raised some of its own objections. Dr.
Elizabeth Goodman, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard
Medical School, said Monday that the causality implied in the ads
is scientifically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've gone beyond the data,'' she said. ``I think
Dr. Garofalo's work shows us youth who have sexual identity issues
are at greater risk. But I think the importance of that is fixing
how our society views sexual orientation _ not fixing the sexual
orientation.''

`ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE': DOCTOR VS. MOB IN POISONED ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dr. Tomas Stockmann has thrown off the last traces
of self-control, and the results are not pretty. He has been
addressing the citizens of the coastal Norwegian town where he has
been known for years as a benevolent if eccentric physician and
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he's unrecognizable at the moment, his features engorged
with contempt, his voice loud and scalding. He has climbed a chair
on the speaker's platform; he is imitating a rabid monkey,
scratching himself. He is also, he makes it very clear, imitating
the people who are watching him.
</P>
<P>
   That's Ian McKellen, the great English classical actor, who is
playing Stockmann in the Royal National Theater's production of
Ibsen's ``Enemy of the People,'' and he has fully turned up the
volume of his natural stage presence, which is never exactly a
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Because other performers, playing townspeople, have been planted
throughout the audience of the Ahmanson Theater here, where the
traveling production runs through Sept. 6, theatergoers themselves
may feel vulnerable. There's a direct, uncomfortable intimacy
between you and the fulminator center stage. You may be infected by
all the anger and want to shout back. The question is on whose
side?
</P>
<P>
   This scene, part of the famous fourth act of Ibsen's 1883 drama
of political corruption and mob mindlessness, is the pinnacle in
this shrewd, carefully thought out and cleanly executed production,
directed by Trevor Nunn from a new translation by Christopher
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt, objectively speaking, that Stockmann is in the
right, as he tries to convince his fellow citizens that the waters
to be used in the town's new bath and spa center have been
poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   But who can be clearheaded in a crowd, especially one charged
with fear and confusion? The sheer ugliness of the doctor's rage
and disdain prohibits unconditional sympathy, and McKellen's crafty
performance has set up motives that go deeper than moral
indignation for this descent into fury. His Stockmann remains the
work's hero, but none of the characters emerge untainted from their
involvement in small-town politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Enemy of the People'' is the play Ibsen wrote, with unusual
dispatch, in response to the public outcry against his previous
work, ``Ghosts.'' It reflects the dramatist's belief that the
so-called ``solid majority'' of democracy is made up largely of
slow-thinking ``serfs''; it's the enlightened few, ``attuned to the
future,'' who by rights should rule.
</P>
<P>
   Of the iconoclastic, defiant Stockmann, he wrote, ``We are alike
in so many ways.'' The play is more crudely polemical than most of
Ibsen and for obvious reasons is not among the most frequently
performed. But as Anthony Page's revival of ``A Doll's House'' with
Janet McTeer demonstrated, Ibsen's characters are seldom as simple
as one might have come to think.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn and McKellen uncover the conflicted soul of the leading
man. The play's broader elements of preachifying aren't disguised:
the moral inadequacy of everyone other than Stockmann and his
immediate family is broadly rendered.
</P>
<P>
   But McKellen also creates a portrait of a manic, brilliant naif
conditioned by a life of rivalry with his brother, Peter (Stephen
Moore), the town's mayor, and of being indulged and admired by
those around him. He expects a torchlight parade for his discovery
that the baths, which are expected to revive the town commercially,
are polluted.
</P>
<P>
   That what happens instead suggests the torch-wielding vigilante
villagers of ``Frankenstein'' prompts in Stockmann a childlike
astonishment and a savage sense of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn sustains a double vision throughout the production, a sense
of public and private lives headed toward collision. John Napier's
revolving set, a gray 19th-century townscape that already seems
painted by industrial grime, is directly reminiscent of his work
with Nunn on another study in mob rule, ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   It shifts constantly between interior scenes and those of street
life, with lots of people (some of them locally recruited actors)
milling around, a bit unconvincingly.
</P>
<P>
   The searing fourth act aside, it's the private moments that have
the greater impact. McKellen is in his well-known extroverted mode,
as opposed to the more subtle, inward-looking style of his
brilliant ``Macbeth'' and ``Uncle Vanya,'' but the expansiveness is
appropriate here.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor is, after all, a bit of a showoff, enchanted by the
affection his absent-minded-professor persona and boyish enthusiasm
inspire in others and given to taking over any room he inhabits.

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Rebellious troops seized control of
several cities in eastern Congo Monday, and fought gun battles in
the capital, as the alliance that brought President Laurent Kabila
to office last year unraveled, threatening his hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio announcement from the eastern city of Goma, a man
claiming to be the rebels' leader, identifying himself as Sylvain
Mbuchi, commander of the country's 10th battalion, said the army
``had decided to remove President Kabila from power.'' He denounced
what he said was the government's ``nepotism, corruption and bad
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, aid workers and the Congolese government suggested
that in both the east and the capital, Kinshasa, the mutinies were
led by members of Congo's small Tutsi minority. Kabila's relations
with the Tutsis have been marked by mounting tension ever since he
seized power 15 months ago at the head of a rebel force largely
composed of Tutsi fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila now faces the problem that bedeviled his predecessor,
Mobutu Sese Seko: keeping the Congo whole. But he does so with far
fewer friends within Africa and abroad that he had a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-governmental troops appeared to have restored order in
Kinshasa, where the situation was quiet for most of the day Monday.
But by all accounts the situation in the country's interior remains
far more confused, with communications with some cities, such as
Goma, cut off entirely, and mutinous troops in several other
eastern cities reportedly making common cause with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tension is very high right now throughout this region, and the
situation is not at all clear,'' said one aid worker in the city of
Uvira, where there was scattered gunfire. ``There are all kinds of
rumors of mutinies and of troop movements.''
</P>
<P>
   International aid workers reported Monday that the rebellion in
Goma had inspired copycat movements in Bukavu, Uvira, Baraka and a
number of smaller eastern cities, where Tutsi populations are
relatively large, and where Tutsi troops are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   In Bukavu, on Sunday, rebellious troops attacked a prison and
freed people jailed in a previous mutiny, and then announced their
intention to remove Kabila from power.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration of mutiny came after a night of intense mortar
and machine gun fire in Kinshasa mounted by Tutsi elements of the
country's armed forces, against units of the Congolese army loyal
to Kabila. The Congo government contends that Rwandan forces helped
the Tutsi rebels, but Rwanda denies that.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, when the gunfire had died down, witnesses in
Kinshasa reported seeing numerous bodies, presumably of combatants,
in the vicinity of Camp Tshatshi, one of two main barracks in
Kinshasa where Tutsi forces are known to be garrisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's government responded to the unrest Monday by closing
the country's borders and imposing a three-day dusk-to-dawn curfew
in the capital. He also appealed, in a communique broadcast on
national radio, ``for all of the security forces as well as the
entire population to collaborate in rooting out and denouncing the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Congolese, after a week of bitter public recriminations
between Kabila's government and that of Rwanda, its eastern
neighbor and former ally, the talk of ``the enemy'' will inevitably
be interpreted as a denunciation of Rwanda, and of the Tutsi
themselves, an ethnic group that many Congolese consider
essentially Rwandan, rather than Congolese.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing a witch hunt against the Tutsi, two of
Kabila's top aides, Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha and Deogratias
Bugera, presidential affairs minister, both Tutsi, reportedly fled
the country Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After defeating Mobutu's army in May 1997, Kabila took power
with strong support to overturn long-held policies that had
impoverished a country full of natural resources. His popularity
quickly dissipated, however, as Congolese saw that the new
government had little experience and had quickly lost its
international good will.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of taking power, the east of the giant country,
which had spawned Kabila's rebellion and had long been among the
country's most unstable regions, was already posing a serious
security challenge to the government. Tutsi and other troops there
complained that the country was on the wrong track and that they
had fought for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The open conflict between Kabila's loyalists and Tutsi marks an
ironic reversal of the situation that brought Kabila, a longtime
guerrilla fighter lost in the obscurity of the mountainous eastern
bush country, to power in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan government picked Kabila to head a hastily concocted
coalition of eastern political forces that overthrew the aging
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, after a seven-month rebellion. The
fighting, in what all but amounted to a rout, was done by Rwandan
army elements and Tutsi soldiers trained and armed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   By backing Kabila, Rwanda's Tutsi-led government hoped to break
up huge refugee camps in eastern Congo, then known as Zaire. The
camps housed more than a million members of the country's Hutu
majority, which used Congolese territory to mount attacks on the
Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to government accusations that regular Rwandan troops
were involved in the unrest, Rwandan officials Monday denied that
any of their soldiers had stayed behind in the Congo after Kabila's
order, last Tuesday, for them to leave the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our soldiers left the Congo last week, approximately 500 of
them, and they are rejoining their respective units,'' Gen. Kayumba
Nyamwansa told the French news agency. ``They are very happy to be
back in their country.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether it is actively encouraging the mutiny against Kabila
or not, diplomats and Congolese political analysts say that Rwanda
feels anything but sympathy toward its former allies in the Congo.

 ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast: the Congo. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The falloff between the two countries, which has been unfolding
for months, has a complex history. On the Congolese side, Kabila is
said to have resented bearing international blame for the massacre
of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees by his own troops _
essentially Tutsi forces trained by or on loan from Rwanda _ during
the seven-month rebellion that brought him to power.
</P>
<P>
   With elections promised for next year, the Congolese leader,
never strongly popular since taking power, has played a nationalist
card, asserting his independence from his sponsors, the far smaller
neighbors in Rwanda and Uganda, whose highly visible presence in
the country has been a source of widespread resentment.
</P>
<P>
   He began doing this by weeding out senior ethnic Tutsi from
important military positions and replacing them with his own ethnic
kinsmen from southern Congo, and consummated the gambit by
expelling Rwandan soldiers from the country altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Rwandan and Ugandans have been embarrassed
by what they see as Kabila's political ineptitude, which has led to
frequent diplomatic gaffes. More seriously, Kabila's former
sponsors are believed to have invested heavily in the rebellion
that brought him to power because they expected that having a
strong ally in Kinshasa would deny numerous rebel groups use of
Congolese territory as a base for their activities.
</P>
<P>
   But in a year marked by skirmishes, mini-rebellions and ethnic
purges, Kabila's army has had its hands full with its own internal
problems and has been able to accomplish little to secure the
country's long borders with its eastern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   When the first signs of trouble between Kinshasa and Rwanda and
Uganda began cropping up, within weeks of Kabila's overthrow of
Mobutu, Kabila began to lean heavily on another ally, Congo's
southern neighbor, Angola.
</P>
<P>
   But even that relationship has become strained, African
diplomats say, over reports that Angolan rebels have reactivated
arms-running and gem-running networks that filter contraband
through Congo's porous territory.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if Angola wanted to back Kabila against his new
foes in the east, these diplomats say, fresh hostilities between
the Angolan government and its longtime rebel enemies in the Unita
movement would make an intervention in Congo unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who proclaimed that the problems of Congo were
simple questions of management and that by installing Kabila all
could be settled,'' said one African diplomat with long experience
of Central Africa. ``What we are seeing is that this country is the
most complicated of African puzzles, and holding the capital is a
far cry from governing.''

DISAGREEMENTS LURK BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PATIENTS'
RIGHTS BILLS

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been clear that there are major differences
to be worked out between the Democratic and Republican bills on
patient rights.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at the details of the House Republican plan shows
that there are also major differences in important areas on which
the two sides had seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements are apparent in two areas: emergency medical
services and the privacy of patients' medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress first appeared to agree that health
maintenance organizations should be required to pay for emergency
medical care. And they seemed to agree on a standard, promising
ready access to emergency care whenever ``a prudent lay person''
would consider it necessary. After all, that was the standard set
by Congress last year for Medicare, the federal health program for
38 million people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus dissolved when emergency physicians read the
fine print of the House Republicans' bill, the Patient Protection
Act, which was introduced on July 16 by Speaker Newt Gingrich and
passed eight days later by a vote of 216-210.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, the government has required hospitals to provide
emergency care for anyone who needs and requests it. But the
question of who should pay for such care has provoked many disputes
among insurers, hospitals and patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill would require HMOs and insurance companies
to cover emergency services for subscribers, ``without the need for
any prior authorization,'' regardless of whether the doctor or
hospital was affiliated with the patient's health plan. Emergency
services, as defined in the bill, include a medical screening
examination to evaluate the patient and any further treatment that
may be required to stabilize the patient's condition.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO would have to cover those services if ``a prudent lay
person, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine,
could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical
attention'' to cause serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House and Senate Republican bills would
establish a two-step test. An HMO or an insurance company would
have to cover the initial screening examination if a prudent lay
person would consider it necessary. But the health plan would have
to pay for additional emergency services only if ``a prudent
emergency medical professional'' would judge them necessary. And
under the House Republican bill, the need for such services must be
certified in writing by ``an appropriate physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the Republicans' bill would guarantee coverage for
``anybody who has a practical layman's feeling that they need
emergency care.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., said the bill ``is not going to
do what they are advertising.'' One reason, he said, is that the
bill was rushed through the House. ``There have been no hearings on
the Republican bill,'' Cardin said. ``It did not go through any of
the committees of jurisdiction for the purpose of markup or to try
to get the drafting done correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic bill, HMO patients who receive emergency
care outside their health plan _ whether in a different city or
close to home _ may be charged no more than they would have to pay
for using a hospital affiliated with the HMO. There is no such
guarantee in the Republican bills. And the cost to patients could
be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Democratic
bill would require HMOs to pay for emergency room visits in half
the cases where they now deny payment. And it says that the charge
for emergency care outside the HMO is typically 50 percent higher
than at hospitals in the HMO network.
</P>
<P>
   John Scott, director of the Washington office of the American
College of Emergency Physicians, said the protections for patients
were much weaker under the Republican bills than under the
Democratic bill or the 1997 Medicare law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than a century of common law and court decisions
interpreting the standard of a prudent lay person, or reasonable
man, as it used to be called,'' Scott said. ``But this new standard
of a prudent emergency medical professional was invented out of
thin air. It creates new opportunities for HMOs to second-guess the
treating physician and to deny payment for emergency services. It
would introduce a whole new level of dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charlotte Yeh, chief of emergency medicine at the New
England Medical Center in Boston, said, ``The Republicans performed
some unnecessary surgery on the `prudent lay person' standard, to
the point that it's hardly recognizable as the consumer protection
we envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate adjourned on Friday for its summer vacation without
debating the legislation, but leaders of both parties said they
hoped to take it up in September. Senate Republicans intend to take
their bill directly to the floor, bypassing committees, which
normally scrutinize the details of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There was, and still is, plenty of common ground if Republicans
and Democrats want to compromise. Both parties' bills would, for
example, require HMOs to establish safeguards to protect the
confidentiality of medical records.
</P>
<P>
   But on this issue too, the details have provoked a furor. When
privacy advocates read the fine print of the House Republican bill,
they were surprised to find a provision that explicitly authorizes
the disclosure of information from a person's medical records for
the purpose of ``health care operations.'' In the bill, that phrase
is broadly defined to include risk assessment, quality assessment,
disease management, underwriting, auditing and ``coordinating
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the House Republican bill would override state laws
that limit the use or disclosure of medical records for those
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican bill says patients may inspect and copy
their records. But it stipulates that the patients must ordinarily
go to the original source _ a laboratory, X-ray clinic or pharmacy,
for example _ rather than to their health plan for such
information.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Health, said the bill ``prohibits health care
providers and health plans from selling individually identifiable
patient medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, privacy advocates say the bill would allow many uses of
personal health care data without the patients' consent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gellman, an expert on privacy and information policy,
said: ``The House-passed bill gives the appearance of providing
privacy rights. But it may actually take away rights that people
have today under state law or common practice.''

Roschacher, said, recalling what turned out to be merely some
aggressive police security measures en route to his hotel. ``I
thought, `Are these guys the good guys or the bad guys?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two years later, Roschacher and his men have
learned enough about organized crime in Mexico to follow a
complicated financial trail and information from convicted drug
traffickers to the conclusion that Raul Salinas de Gortari earned
vast of sums of his money by assuring the safe transport of cocaine
through Mexico to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Swiss are preparing to use that evidence in a
civil court action to confiscate the fortune of Salinas, the elder
brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a much
larger and more experienced group of law enforcement officials in
the United States has been unable to make a similar case of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those officials say they may yet win criminal
indictments. Privately, though, others acknowledge that
Washington's pursuit of Salinas has been troubled from the start,
with turf battles among law enforcement agencies and federal
prosecutors, disputes over the handling of witnesses and complaints
from agents in the field of meddling and a lack of interest by
higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy with which both governments have proceeded makes it
impossible to fully evaluate their evidence before it is presented
in court, and Salinas has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials are also quick to note that they
have sought to build a criminal case, which entails a higher
standard of proof than the Swiss will face.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the unlikely initial success of Roschacher's small
detective team has turned an unflattering mirror on Washington's
handling of what U.S. officials once described as a watershed
effort to combat not just the flow of drugs through Mexico into the
United States, but the complex system of official corruption that
has long allowed it to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is even more striking, officials say, because the
Swiss appear to have relied almost entirely on witnesses and
information that were first uncovered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like the mouse that roared,'' one former senior
American law enforcement official said of the Swiss authorities.
``They were blocked almost every step of the way. But they just
kept going and kept going, and they finally made a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the investigations will definitively resolve the
question of the Salinas family's alleged collusion with the drug
trade remains far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   A partial account of the Swiss and U.S. inquiries, assembled
from government documents and dozens of interviews, suggests that
neither has penetrated into the brothers' inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   But some experienced investigators have concluded that Raul
Salinas could have been a valued asset for the traffickers even if
he could not necessarily pick up the phone and call off police
raids. He might have been paid off, they said, just to provide an
impression of acquiescence at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul Salinas was not somebody who protected a truck with a gun
as it went to the border,'' Roschacher said in an interview at his
office in Bern, the Swiss capital. ``What we are talking about is a
system _ a system in which a person can give orders to someone who
gives orders to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas, who remains in a maximum-security prison cell in
Mexico on charges of ordering the murder of a prominent politician,
has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence. He has insisted that most
of the money in his accounts was given to him by major Mexican
industrialists for an investment fund that he was to establish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had any kind of dealings with drug traffickers,
nor have I received any benefit or money from any drug
trafficker,'' he told the Swiss attorney general, Carla del Ponte,
in a handwritten letter from prison two months ago. ``The source of
my money, and of all the money that I managed, is legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas, who left office just before the Mexican economy
collapsed at the end of 1994 and left the country soon afterward,
has never been charged with any crime. He lives in Ireland and the
south of France, one of his old friends said, waiting impatiently
for some judgment more generous than the one a bitter Mexican
public has handed down.
</P>
<P>
   Within months after the Swiss police found Raul Salinas' bank
accounts on a tip from American drug agents, his case had entangled
some of Mexico's biggest businessmen, as well as banks in Mexico,
the United States, Britain and France. Initially, though, Swiss
officials saw nothing remarkable in the notion that a foreign
leader's relative might have stashed illicit wealth in their banks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `It's just a case like any other case,'' Roschacher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hidden fortunes of Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines
or Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, the Salinas accounts presented an
opportunity for the embattled Swiss to show that dirty money would
no longer be safe in their vaults. There was another incentive as
well: Whatever part of Salinas' money the government could
convincingly tie to drugs, officials said, it would be able to keep
under Swiss law.
</P>
<P>
   In Bern, the Swiss capital, Roschacher had three hard-working
detectives and the support of Mrs. del Ponte, the plain-spoken
prosecutor who has earned a wide reputation for pressing to open up
Switzerland's banks. He didn't have much else.
</P>
<P>
   After years of collaboration with American law-enforcement
agencies, Swiss officials assumed they could count on help from the
United States. Instead, banking and credit card records took months
to arrive. Interviews with convicted drug smugglers and other
witnesses from United States court cases were sometimes slow to be
granted, sometimes postponed and sometimes refused.
</P>
<P>
   By the second half of 1996, with the Swiss under pressure to
show progress, tempers began to rise. At one point, officials said,
as Mrs. del Ponte was trying to interview one American-supplied
informant in the presence of a fastidious federal prosecutor from
New York, she exploded in anger and later fired off a letter to her
counterpart, Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have had difficulties coordinating our
procedures,'' Mrs. del Ponte said euphemistically, emphasizing her
gratitude for the American help that eventually arrived. ``Of
course, when I am over there and the public prosecutor says to me,
`You cannot ask this question,' I am going to get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, law-enforcement officials had far more
investigative resources and more knowledge of the mechanics of
Mexican corruption. But they also found themselves struggling to
move their sometimes-rivalrous agencies and prosecutors in the same
direction at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors that circulated about Raul Salinas during his
brother's presidency had centered on the notion that he had grown
rich from the kickbacks of Mexican businessmen whom he might have
helped to win lucrative deals from the state. American
drug-enforcement, Customs and FBI agents had also received reports
linking him to at least two major Mexican cocaine smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-enforcement officials said the reports were startling, but
not enough to merit a special inquiry. That view quickly changed
after the discovery of the Swiss accounts, but after some
bureaucratic struggle, it was the FBI's office in New York, where
Salinas had also banked, that was finally assigned the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials said the inquiry was important because its
targets were high-profile: Salinas, who had moved tens of millions
of dollars through Citibank, and officers in the bank's
private-client section, who appeared to have helped him without
trying very hard to verify the legitimacy of his funds. Still,
people familiar with the probe said it was not a primary focus of
the bureau office, which soon consumed by its investigation into
TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a big man-burner,'' one former senior official said,
noting that the inquiry focused more on the trail of financial
transactions rather than on the history of Salinas' alleged
misdeeds. ``It was a paper chase.''
</P>
<P>
   At offices of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington,
Mexico and Texas, agents were turning their attention to Mexico's
new cocaine kingpin, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Again, there was a
thin record of informants who said Raul Salinas had met with
Carrillo and his associates, received money from the trafficker's
operations, or helped assure the movement of his loads.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they knew they would be hard-pressed to turn such
intelligence information into witnesses who could stand up in court
and convincingly accuse the brother of a former Mexican president.
But some complained that the greater challenge was navigating the
disparate and sometimes competing investigations going on around
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For months after Mrs. del Ponte's confrontation with the New
York prosecutor, two officials said, the Swiss authorities' access
to American informants all but dried up. They had yet to solidly
link Raul Salinas to the drug trade. And the outcry over
Switzerland's handling of the bank accounts of Nazi victims was
adding to pressure on the government to prove its vows of greater
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Then, little more than a year into the effort, the
investigators' luck began to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to talk to witnesses who knew a lot about what
had happened in Mexico,'' Roschacher said. ``For the first time,
they were people who knew things concretely _ `I was there; I saw
that' _ and not by hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long thereafter, though, Swiss investigators also began to
see the confidentiality of their witnesses start to erode as
information leaked to the news media, particularly in Mexico,
raising questions about Salinas' accusers.
</P>
<P>
   One such witness, officials said, was Marco E. Torres, a Mexican
smuggler who pleaded guilty to drug charges in the United States in
1996 and received a reduced sentence for his cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   According to two officials familiar with his statements, Torres
said he arranged the protection of cocaine shipments with Raul
Salinas and paid him one large bribe himself after a drug seizure
in Mexico in 1993. But parts of Torres' account, including his
claim to having known the Salinas brothers for years, were refuted
by Salinas' lawyers after they were first reported last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roschacher said he was not sidetracked by such particulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as no one can say, `He is a notorious liar _ we have
checked and what he says is wrong,' then for us he is a witness and
we take a look at him,'' he said. ``Our case is not built on Marco
Torres. His credibility is good. But we have several others who are
as good or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials would not name those other witnesses, saying
their identities would only be disclosed to judges who will review
the matter if, as expected, lawyers for Salinas challenge the
confiscation of his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in early 1997, for reasons that remain unclear, the
spigot of American assistance opened wider. The Justice Department
arranged for Swiss interviews with almost a dozen more witnesses,
officials said, including at least three convicted drug smugglers
who offered detailed information linking Salinas to specific
payoffs. Mexican officials also produced records showing that
during the last half of his brother's six-year administration, Raul
Salinas had made huge deposits in Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mrs. del Ponte said the evidence made it clear
that he had been ``directly involved in receiving money for
protecting the shipment of tons of cocaine through Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how Salinas might have arranged such protection _
despite never working in law-enforcement and having left the
government altogether in 1992 _ was a question law-enforcement
officials struggled to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican investigators said that they have focused closely on a
relationship between Raul Salinas and one of his closest business
associates, Justo Ceja, who served as Carlos Salinas' private
secretary and is a fugitive from charges that he illegally amassed
a large fortune while in government. (Raul Salinas' accountant was
arrested in mid-July on similar charges, while Salinas' wife was
sentenced to two years' imprisonment for pressuring witnesses to
lie in the murder proceedings against her husband.)
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have also determined that both Salinas
and Ceja had dealings with several senior Mexican law-enforcement
officials, each of whom has since been accused publicly of taking
bribes. But the only one of those former officials to ever be
charged with drug offenses, Mario Ruiz Massieu, has shown little
promise as a government witness.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that drug-enforcement agents in Mexico
City, Houston and El Paso who tried to build their own case against
Salinas were able to find several informants by the spring of 1997
who told of drug payoffs that Raul Salinas supposedly received. Two
of those witnesses, in particular, gave detailed accounts of having
seen Salinas meeting with major drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most important informants were taken from Mexico to
Texas, officials said, where they submitted to lie-detector tests
and appeared at first to be telling the truth. But under what
agents described as unusual high-level pressure to recheck the
men's stories, they were given further tests in which they appeared
to be less candid. In May 1997, officials said, the United States
Attorney in San Antonio abandoned the case entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was an enormous political component to the
case,'' one former law-enforcement official who worked on it said.
``But the Justice Department, without ever saying so, appeared not
to want us to deal with the political targets. They wanted us just
to concentrate on the drug traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions have been raised following the announcement in
April by Citibank's parent company, Citicorp, that it will merge
with Travelers Group Inc. _ a $70-billion corporate marriage that
could conceivably snag if the bank is ensnared in a major
money-laundering case. Justice Department officials declined to
discuss the Salinas investigation in detail. But they denied that
their problems in making a case had anything to do with political
or foreign-policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Still more doubts about Washington's coordination of the Salinas
case were raised by two other key witnesses, a Chilean-born
computer expert named Guillermo Pallomari and a Colombian cocaine
trafficker named Jose Manuel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Pallomari, a former aide to the main boss of the Cali cocaine
cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, fled Colombia in August 1995
after threats on his life and was interviewed by American
drug-enforcement agents for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   But officials familiar with the debriefings said he was never
asked in detail how the Colombians had protected their shipments
through Mexico, and some officials were stunned to learn what
Pallomari, now a protected witness, told the Swiss last Nov. 19 at
a Federal prison facility in southern Virginia where American
officials took him to be debriefed.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials familiar with his debriefings and a
partial transcript of his statement recently published in the
Mexican newspaper El Universal, Pallomari said the Colombians began
to strengthen their partnership with Carrillo, the Mexican
trafficker, in about 1992, after problems with their operations in
the Caribbean. Rodriguez Orejuela also tried to replicate in Mexico
the network of political protection he had established in Colombia,
Pallomari said.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, the informant said, Cali bosses drafted a manual on
political corruption and sent a copy to Carrillo. They also
funnelled some $80 million in bribe money to Mexico _ about half of
which was supposed to have gone to Raul Salinas to assure the
compliance of his brother's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pallomari said the money was sent with cocaine loads, deposited
with front companies, or paid through a Bolivian intermediary whom
the Colombians stationed in Mexico. On one occasion, he said, Raul
Salinas intervened at the Colombians' request to get back most of a
five-ton cocaine load the police had seized in Acapulco in early
1994 with American help. Pallomari also showed the Swiss how
payments to Mexican politicians were reflected in a partial set of
1994 accounting ledgers that were seized from the Cali cartel by an
elite Colombian police unit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Pallomari's story had some inconsistencies, but
they did not question that it might have been vital to the
drug-enforcement agents in Texas who were then trying to tie
Salinas to Carrillo `s enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, those agents did not learn even the outlines of
Pallomari's account until a year and a half after he came under
American protection. When law-enforcement officials from around the
country caucused in El Paso in January 1997 to assemble the
available evidence against Carrillo's organization, officials said,
Pallomari's information was about the best they had against
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   But Pallomari was unavailable. Federal prosecutors in Miami said
they could not loan their witness until they had finished their own
case against the Cali gang. Long before they did, the
drug-conspiracy case that might have linked Salinas to Carrillo
collapsed when the trafficker died after plastic surgery last July.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. prosecutors were apparently even less successful in
coordinating the information offered by Ramos, a former lieutenant
to the Colombian drug cartel based in the city of Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   According to two people familiar with Ramos' case, he approached
prosecutors in Houston in 1991, the year he was sentenced on drug
charges to two life terms in prison. He had met Raul Salinas in the
late 1980s, he told them, and had contracted with him to arrange
and protect the landing of drug planes in different parts of
northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One American official said doubts lingered about part of Ramos'
account, and his credibility was challenged by a federal prosecutor
who did not believe he had been forthright about another Colombian
drug operation that had been discovered in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramos also offered unusual documentation to corroborate his
claims: encoded payment ledgers, photographs and even a special
Mexican passport he had received under the carefully chosen alias
``Alejandro Salinas.'' Still, two people familiar with the case
said Ramos was all but ignored until late 1997, when the U.S.
Customs Service arranged for him to be interviewed by a federal
prosecutor in New York and then by the Swiss authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked on the door several times,'' one of those people
said. ``He was rebuffed each and every time.''

EX-PROSECUTOR PASSED OVER FOR U.S. ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles La Bella, former head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance unit, has apparently lost out in his
effort to be named U.S. attorney in San Diego, where he long worked
as a federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella returned to San Diego two weeks ago to fill in as U.S.
attorney temporarily, hoping to land the job on a permanent basis.
He departed after delivering a confidential report to Attorney
General Janet Reno that concluded she should seek an independent
prosecutor to investigate how the Democrats financed the 1996
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although his advocacy of an independent fund-raising inquiry
placed him at odds with Reno, who has refused to seek an outside
prosecutor, La Bella still hoped to be appointed the top federal
prosecutor in the volatile border region of California.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the job appears likely to be filled by Gregory Vega,
another longtime federal prosecutor in San Diego. Vega, president
of the Hispanic National Bar Association, sought the job in 1993
after Bill Clinton was first elected president, but Clinton instead
chose a fellow Rhodes scholar, Alan Bersin.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella was rejected in favor of Vega through a system in which
home-state senators recommend nominees for U.S. attorney before the
president formally sends their names to the Senate for
confirmation. Vega was the choice of Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat
running for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her recommendation of Vega on Friday, Ms. Boxer
said he was qualified because of his personal involvement in the
problems of the area and because, as a longtime assistant U.S.
attorney there, he is well regarded by colleagues and judges in San
Diego.

BURIAL OF SLAIN CAPITOL GUARD IN ARLINGTON PROTESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backed by some prominent veterans groups, the
chairman of the House Veteran Affairs Committee has raised
objections to the burial last week of Capitol Police Detective John
M. Gibson in Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Bob Stump, an Arizona Republican, refused to
support the request from House Speaker Newt Gingrich and House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt to the Secretary of the Army to
grant a special burial waiver for Gibson, a Waltham, Mass. native
who was not a military veteran.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of controversy over special burial rights at
Arlington granted to non-veterans last year, Stump successfully led
the House in March to pass a bill that would end all exceptions to
the rule that only veterans can be interned there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the speaker that this waiver was contrary to the bill,
which passed 417-0,'' Stump, a World War II veteran, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Stump and groups such as the Non-Commissioned
Officers Association of America have criticized the waiver granted
Gibson, as first reported Monday in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill
newspaper, the outpouring of public grief and support for the two
officers killed during the July 24 shooting at the US Capitol has
strengthened efforts to keep the door open for special exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an example of why the law should allow for waivers in
circumstances of extraordinary merit or, in his case, heroism,''
said John Ullyot, a member of the Republican staff of the Senate
Veteran Affairs Committee, which will take up the no-waivers bill
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington National Cemetery is regarded as a national shrine
honoring individual and collective acts of bravery and selfless
public service. It is also a living memorial to history, the site
of the Tomb of the Unknowns and the final resting place of veterans
from all the nation's wars. More than 240,000 Americans, including
President John F. Kennedy, are buried there.
</P>
<P>
   Burial space is limited to certain veterans who are highly
decorated or life-long service members, and to particular members
of their family.
</P>
<P>
   Although space is highly restricted, Stump said more than 60
waivers were granted last year to non-military individuals. Burial
rights became a political issue after it was revealed that M. Larry
Lawrence, a former US ambassador to Switzerland and a Democratic
donor, had lied about his military record. His widow had his body
exhumed.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of such waivers, Stump proposed his legislation to
stop the president or Secretary of the Army from issuing exceptions
to non-veterans. A few months later, Gibson was shot to death and
the Secretary of the Army granted his waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no equitable way to justify burying civilians in
Arlington Cemetery when you are denying burial to veterans,'' said
Richard Johnson of the Non-Commissioned Officers Association, which
represents 160,000 members. ``You could have a guy who served three
years in Vietnam with a bronze star who is denied because a bronze
star isn't high enough to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Most veteran groups, however displeased they were with the
Gibson waiver, were reluctant to publicly announce their objections
in the face of such an emotional outpouring of support for the
slain Capitol Police, said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard-pressed to say where we stand in this particular
climate,'' explained Bill Smith, a spokesman for the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, which has 2 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups, however, were not united in their opposition to
Gibson's Arlington burial. Phil Dughan, a spokesman for the
American Legion, which represents 2.5 million veterans, neither
opposed nor endorsed the exception, but the group did recognize
Gibson's bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America
Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting international
peace efforts, called those opposing Gibson's burial ``idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I have any problem with a national hero being buried
in Arlington Cemetary?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston Democrat whose
niece was married to Gibson, echoed Muller's point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I known the chairman is a strong supporter of veterans, but
I'm surprised that he would come out that strongly because for
every rule there's an exception,'' he said. ``These people weren't
just run over by a truck, they jumped in front of other people to
save lives.''

CLINTON LOOKS TO SUPREME COURT AGAIN IN LEWINSKY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House Monday said it would ask the
Supreme Court to block prosecutors in the Monica S. Lewinsky case
from questioning a close confidante of President Clinton, and held
out little hope that Clinton will offer, as some of his allies have
urged, a fuller public accounting of his relationship with the
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   As the high stakes legal struggle continues to intensify, the
testimony of Deputy Counsel Bruce R. Lindsey remains one of the few
unresolved battles between the White House and Independent Counsel
Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court appeal, which could delay Starr's probe, comes
at a time when even congressional Democrats have been urging the
White House to be more cooperative with Starr so he can wrap up his
case.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles Ruff said the White House also has
no desire to see the case drag on, and that was one reason he had
decided to take the question of whether Lindsey must testify
directly to the Supreme Court rather than ask the full appellate
court to to rule on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ask the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court
ruling that Lindsey's conversations with Clinton were not protected
by attorney-client privilege because he was a government attorney.
Ruff said he would ask the appeals court to keep Starr from calling
Lindsey to testify until the Supreme Court has a chance to act.
</P>
<P>
   Those latest legal moves come as Clinton and Lewinsky both are
preparing to testify before Starr's grand jury and as FBI
technicians analyze stains on a blue dress belonging to Lewinsky
that might hold possible genetic material linking it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the dress and a blanket immunity deal that
Starr gave Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis, has heightened
the political and legal pressure on Clinton. Clinton has agreed to
testify Aug. 17 by videotaped to the grand jury, but, so far, he
has not said whether he will explain his relationship with Lewinsky
publically.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, after promising to testify ``completely and
truthfully,'' Clinton said he would have no further comment between
now and his testimony. One White House aide said Clinton doesn't
plan a public statement before Aug. 17, but said that could change
and left open the possibility that the president would speak out
after he his closed-circuit television testimony before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for Clinton to tell the public what he will tell the grand
jury have come from several of his former advisers, including
former chief of staff Leon Panetta, consultant Dick Morris and
press secretary Dee Dee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this matter is important enough that he should sit
down, stare the American people in the eye and do it directly from
the Oval Office,'' Panetta said Sunday on ``Late Edition'' on Cable
News Network.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton was aware of the
advice being offered by some of his former aides and Democratic
loyalists who have been using the airwaves to urge him to come
forward and explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll receive all kinds of advice from people inside, from
people outside, from outsiders who were insiders, insiders who were
outsiders,'' Toiv said. ``We'll hear it all, take note of it.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have stressed that they are as much in the
dark as the public and cannot be sure whether Clinton will stick by
his earlier denials of never having sexual relations ``with that
woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has told the truth about this and will continue
to do so,'' Toiv told reporters Monday morning. ``I'm not in a
position to tell you what the president's testimony is going to be.
The only thing I can tell you is that he has said that he has told
the truth, and that he will continue to tell the truth,'' Toiv
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House used Clinton's upcoming testimony to support its
argument that questioning of Lindsey was no longer essential to
Starr's investigation ``The fact that the president is going to be
testifying certainly, in our view, lowers the significance of this
testimony and that of other attorneys,'' said one White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   The administration insisted Monday that the battle to prevent
Lindsey's testimony was being pursued solely on grounds of
principle, and not as part of an effort to delay Starr's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney-client privilege is a bedrock priniciple of our
legal system,'' said Ruff, the White House counsel in a statement.
``The attorney-client relationship is no less important in
government than in every other context where it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a three-judge panel rejected the White House
argument that Lindsey's tesimony was protected by attorney-client
privilege. ``Because of the importance of this principle for this
and future presidents, as well as the Executive Branch, we are
seeking review'' of that decision, Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who was in Toronto for a speech to the American Bar
Association, did not comment specifically on the latest stumbling
block to his investigation other than to say he was seeking to
``move forward very quickly'' with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He also signaled that he would show respect to Clinton when the
time came for the president to testify. ``One of the things that I
want to make clear is that it is very important we respect our
institutions of government and seek to discharge the duties that we
have... in a way that is very respectful of the institutions of our
government,'' Starr told reporters after his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, Toiv said he did not know whether
Clinton had received a request or a subpoena from Starr to provide
DNA samples that investigators might need to determine if the stain
on Lewinsky's dress came from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some DNA experts have reportedly said that the analysis is not
extremely time consuming and that by now the results should be
known. But Ron Van Vranken, a spokesman for the FBI, refused to say
whether the analysis was completed and if so, why the results had
not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are analyzing it. We're not in a position to talk about
how long they (investigators) will take,'' he said. ``We'll just
have to wait.''

GLIDING UP THE CHART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROSTBURG, Md. _ While watching a recent Washington Redskins
practice here in the rolling Appalachians, a father asked his young
sons which first-year players would make the final roster.
</P>
<P>
   One of the boys asked about former UCLA tailback Skip Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, Hicks,'' the father said. ``I think he's just
about a sure thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Redskins drafted Hicks, they called him a
third-round pick (69th overall) with first-round talent. Through
the first 10 days of training camp, he has done nothing to alter
their opinion. When coach Norv Turner was asked to name the most
impressive newcomers after last week's scrimmage against
Pittsburgh, Hicks was the first name mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of ability,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has the size to run inside, the speed to run outside and a
sense for the end zone that produced 48 rushing touchdowns at UCLA.
He has excellent hands, an unflappable demeanor and young legs _
something Washington's starting tailback, nine-year veteran Terry
Allen, does not possess.
</P>
<P>
   If early form holds, Hicks will challenge third-year pro Stephen
Davis for the second-string spot. Because of Allen's knees, No.2
could quickly become No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is the Redskins' offense is identical to the
one we had at UCLA, only there are a lot more plays,'' Hicks said.
``If anything, this one's easier. At UCLA, there was a lot to
memorize. Here, they tell you what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' resume is not without blemishes, however. He fumbled in
the scrimmage. He made a slew of mental errors _ ``Hopefully, that
was just nerves,'' he said _ and he hasn't learned to hit the hole
with ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   Turner can accept Hicks' gliding style, as long as the fumbles
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of backs have different styles,'' Turner said. ``When I
was at USC, we had Charles White, Ricky Bell and Marcus Allen, and
they each had different styles. When I was with the Rams, we had
Eric Dickerson, and he had a unique style. In Dallas, it was Emmitt
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to coach them, of course, but you also have to give
them the freedom to have their own style. When we looked at film of
Skip, he was awfully powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   __ NOTE: Former USC quarterback Brad Otten, who had major knee
surgery after college, is contending for the Redskins' third-string
job with veteran Trent Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been inconsistent,'' Turner said of Otten. ``He has days
when he does real well, and he has days when I'm disappointed with
him. It's taken a while for him to get comfortable with the knee.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola money machine has whirred along for years,
producing extraordinary profits for investors.
</P>
<P>
   What helped set it in motion was management's decision in the
late 1980s to remove the capital-intensive bottling factories from
the company's books and place them in a separate company. The
maneuver has proved so successful that archrival Pepsico Inc., a
perennial also-ran, recently announced that it, too, would consider
spinning off its bottling unit.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing chorus of financial analysts and accountants are
trying to strip the gears of Coca-Cola Co. They say that Coca-Cola
and its giant bottling company, Coca-Cola Enterprises, are
essentially one business and should consolidate their financial
statements, an argument not lost on the United States' accounting
rule makers.
</P>
<P>
   A consolidation would immediately cut hundreds of millions of
dollars from Coca-Cola's earnings, the analysts say. And Coca-Cola
would be forced to reclaim billions of dollars of debt that now
resides with Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers look wonderful,'' said Albert Meyer, an accountant
and investment analyst, about Coca-Cola's financial reporting
system. ``It is almost too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   To him and others, the system is not the real thing. ``It is
pretty fake, actually,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules leave some room for interpretation, and
Coca-Cola has not been forced to consolidate accounting, because it
owns less than 50 percent of the bottling company.
</P>
<P>
   But the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets the
nation's accounting rules, has long been concerned that some
companies, among them Coca-Cola, may be skirting the spirit of the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   So it is now discussing a new rule that would force companies
with very close ties to consolidate even when there is a minority
ownership _ a rule that would apparently force Coca-Cola's hand.
Though the board moves very slowly, a proposal is scheduled for
release late this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission could _ on its own _
require Coca-Cola to consolidate. Officials there said that they
looked at corporate relationships as well as stock ownership in
determining control, but that they could not comment on Coca-Cola's
accounting in particular.
</P>
<P>
   In select cases, they have forced companies to consolidate their
financial statements after finding that one company clearly
controlled many parts of another's business.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the fates of Coca-Cola and its big bottler are
inextricably linked. Coca-Cola recorded $18.9 billion in worldwide
sales last year, compared with $11.3 billion for Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which accounts for much of domestic Coca-Cola sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the global giant has a market value of $203 billion,
dwarfing the $13 billion market value of Coca-Cola Enterprises.
That divergence reflects a decade of superior returns for investors
in Coca-Cola and a heavy debt burden at Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current accounting practices say that Coca-Cola
can, to some degree, bolster its bottom line through sales to the
bottling company, over which it has much control.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola sells billions of dollars of soft-drink concentrate
each year to Coca-Cola Enterprises. It has also sold entire
operations, including three bottlers last year for at least $1.6
billion, to Coca-Cola Enterprises. Such sales could not generate
profits if the accounting books were consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola stands behind its accounting. Randal Donaldson, a
company spokesman, said that the company was ``absolutely in
accordance'' with all accounting rules. Federal securities
regulators were informed of the accounting system in 1986, when
Coca-Cola Enterprises became a separate company, Donaldson said,
and they did not object.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are independent, he continued, pointing out
that Coca-Cola Co. has a minority stake, now 44 percent, in the
bottler. Because Coca-Cola does not control the bottler, it does
not have the option of consolidating financial statements, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old worn-out point of view, totally without
merit,'' said Laura Asman, spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises,
``and our company's performance for our share owners speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Dwight Owsen, a doctoral student at the University of
Portsmouth in Britain, have recently written papers criticizing
Coca-Cola's accounting.
</P>
<P>
   They compare the approach with one used by many companies during
the Depression. During those hard times, a parent company and
related entities would sell items to one another to inflate
revenues and raise the parent company's stock price. Those abuses
led to changes in accounting rules, intended to eliminate any
profit on sales between closely related companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't transact business with itself,'' said Meyer, an
investment analyst with Martin Capital Management in Elkhart, Ind.,
and a former accounting professor who turned the spotlight on the
Foundation for New Era Philanthropy in Philadelphia, which was
found to be a financial fraud. ``It is not real. If you
consolidate, then everything collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   To Meyer and Owsen, the issue of independence rests heavily on
the composition of the board of directors. They say the board of
Coca-Cola Enterprises is controlled by people with strong ties to
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   To Coca-Cola's credit, the makeup of the board has changed
recently. Until late last year, Douglas Ivester, then Coca-Cola's
president, was chairman of the bottling company. He stepped down
after being promoted to chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Co. Neville Isdell, a senior vice president of Coca-Cola, also
stepped down, in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the board still includes two former senior Coca-Cola
executives and Joseph Gladden Jr., Coca-Cola's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are others with a large financial stake in
Coca-Cola: Howard Buffett, the son of Warren Buffett and a director
of Berkshire Hathaway, Coca-Cola's largest stockholder, and two
directors of Sun Trust Banks, Coca-Cola's second-largest
stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for six of the board's 13 members. Another
director is a consultant who has contracts with both Coca-Cola and
the bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Owsen suggest that Coca-Cola exerts so much influence
that Coca-Cola Enterprises may be overpaying it for bottling
factories and a myriad of other goods and services. Coca-Cola's
stunning returns, compared with far weaker profits at Coca-Cola
Enterprises, are evidence that Coca-Cola could be charging too
much, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock market analysts and accountants have questioned
Coca-Cola's accounting after examining its transactions with the
bottling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open secret on Wall Street, it seems, is that Enterprises
and Coke are one and the same company, accounting principles to the
contrary notwithstanding,'' wrote James Grant, the editor of
Grant's Interest Rate Observer, in a 1996 article. ``In essence,
the bottling giant is a kind of receptacle for the everyday
business detritus that would otherwise mar the parent's nearly
perfect financial profile.''

LEWIS REWROTE THE RULES IN A HIGH-TECH MEDIUM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a high-tech medium, television usually requires effects more
special than a talking sock.
</P>
<P>
   But Shari Lewis was so gifted a puppeteer, ventriloquist, and
entertainer that she was able to rewrite the rules and win 12 Emmys
before dying Sunday at age 65 of complications from uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the diminutive, red-haired dynamo also experienced
television's fickle side, and was absent from the tube for long
periods as cartoons took over children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will forever be identified with her most indelible
creation: a cantankerous little puppet named Lamb Chop. As much of
a high-maintenance prima donna as Miss Piggy, Lamb Chop was
nobody's sheep. Her screechy voice was even heard in the halls of
Congress. On programs such as ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' she made
the sort of mischief that gave a vicarious thrill to millions of
children watching at home _ while demurely professing her innocence
all the while.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Lewis means that yet another reassuring figure from
television's early years is gone from the scene. In the past month,
Robert Young of ``Father Knows Best,'' Buffalo Bob Smith of ``The
Howdy Doody Show,'' and singing cowboy Roy Rogers also have passed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed both ageless and tireless. It was easy to forget
that she had introduced Lamb Chop as far back as 1957, on ``The
Captain Kangaroo Show,'' before going on to create and star in such
shows as ``The Shari Lewis Show,'' ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' and
her latest, ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was someone who seemed to get younger as she got older,''
said children's TV activist Peggy Charren, a friend of Lewis's.
``She had more energy than anybody I know. She was Charlie Horse
and she was Lamb Chop, and some of those conversations between the
two of them were achingly funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The ebullient Lewis filled her shows with music, comedy,
riddles, puns, and easy-to-digest lessons about life. The
educational impulse was present off-camera too; Charren said Lewis
was as much activist as entertainer, ever concerned about expanding
the array of choices for children on television.
</P>
<P>
   During a memorable day in 1993, Lewis brought Lamb Chop to
Capitol Hill to make an impassioned plea to broadcasters to improve
children's television programming. ``We need the best you grown-ups
have to offer,'' Lewis had the puppet say. ``If you give it to us,
we will give you the good stuff back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis herself had a broad definition of ``the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lewis noticed that few TV programs seemed geared
toward Jewish children, so she came up with such primetime specials
as ``Lamb Chop's Special Chanukah'' and ``Shari's Passover
Surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Conscious that television seldom tried to foster an appreciation
of music, Lewis created a show designed to do just that, ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did was look at what was missing on television and
try to fill the gap,'' said Charren.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Potier, a spokesperson for WGBH-TV in Boston, which carried
Lewis' shows, recalled seeing Lewis perform last year in Dallas at
a PBS meeting. ``She did a song-and-dance with Lamb Chop, very fast
back and forth, singing the whole time,'' said Potier. ``She had to
change her voice each time, and throw her voice. It was
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis began astounding spectators at an early age. She first
pulled a rabbit out of her hat at the age of 4, appeared on her
first TV variety show at age 13, and starred in ``Facts 'n' Fun''
on NBC at 18. &UR;  &LR; She cemented her status as a leading children's
entertainer with ``The Shari Lewis Show,'' which ran Saturday
mornings on NBC from 1960 to 1963 before being canceled as
children's television shifted its focus to animation.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a half-hour syndicated puppet show called ``The Shari
Show'' in 1975, it would be three decades before Lewis regained a
prominent place on television. A resilient trouper, she took her
act to Las Vegas, appeared on game shows, and even conducted
symphony orchestras. She also wrote more than 60 children's books,
and in 1986, entertained children from around the world at a White
House Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis returned triumphantly to television with ``Lamb Chop's
Play-Along,'' which premiered on PBS in 1992. Before Lewis stopped
production on it last year, the show had won five Emmys. Then, in
January, Lewis introduced ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She cut
short production on the show six weeks ago when she began
undergoing chemotherapy treatments. Among the events she had to
miss was the ``Charlie Horse Music Pizza Jam Session,'' an event to
celebrate PBS' children's programming, at the Children's Museum in
Boston on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After developing pneumonia during chemotherapy, Lewis died
Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She leaves her husband,
Jeremy Tarcher; her daughter, Mallory Tarcher; and many grateful
parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew what parents would like for their kids, and
fortunately, the kids liked it,'' said Charren. ``She had that
magic touch.''

 UNDATED: financial profile.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his newsletter last week, Grant pointed to Pepsico's recent
announcement that it would put many of its bottling operations in a
separate company. ``Will Pepsico's announcement prompt an official
inquiry into the accounting arrangements?'' Grant asked. ``The
government has investigated less worthy subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &AMP; Poor's
Corp., the two big bond-rating agencies, consolidate Coca-Cola and
Coca-Cola Enterprises when they analyze the companies' financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi has not disclosed how big a stake in its bottling
operations might be sold to the public. Still, it would probably
follow Coca-Cola's model.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when Coca-Cola decided to put most of its North
American bottling factories into a separate company, it sold 51
percent of that company to the public. It kept just shy of the 50
percent stake required for independent financial reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The move allowed Coca-Cola to rid its balance sheet of the
expensive bottling factories and those factories' debt. And it
meant that Coca-Cola's earnings would no longer be lowered by the
factories' billions of dollars of depreciation and interest expense
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Coca-Cola's main duties have consisted of setting
global corporate strategy, planning advertising campaigns and
selling soft-drink syrup to bottlers. Coca-Cola Enterprises mainly
handles production: mixing the syrup with fizzy water, putting it
into bottles and trucking it to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the split, Coca-Cola still exerts much influence over
Enterprises. For example, the bottler cannot sell any bottling
operations without Coca-Cola's consent. And if an outsider buys
more than 10 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises' stock, Coca-Cola can
terminate its bottling agreements with Enterprises, which would
essentially end the bottler's business.
</P>
<P>
   Descriptions of the business transactions between the two
companies take up several pages in the documents that Coca-Cola
Enterprises must file with regulators. In 1997, Enterprises bought
vehicles and rented office space from Coca-Cola. And it repaired
Coca-Cola's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Even goods that Enterprises could buy directly from outside
vendors came from Coca-Cola. For example, Enterprises bought almost
all its sweeteners from Coca-Cola in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprises delivers fountain syrup to customers on Coca-Cola's
behalf, and at times, bills and collects money on those sales,
later transferring the money to Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said that all the transactions were conducted at arm's
length and at fair market prices.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Coca-Cola's sales of billion-dollar bottling
operations to Enterprises that most bothers Meyer and Owsen. They
say that Enterprises and its shareholders may be paying too much
for these factories, and they point to poor profit margins and the
billions of dollars of intangible assets that accompany the
purchases to support their case.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that these or any other purchases were done
at anything other than market value.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying issue, according to Meyer and Owsen, is that
Enterprises' board is dominated by people with strong ties to
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to drive a hard bargain,'' Meyer said.
``They have a conflict of interest.'' Any profits that Coca-Cola
earns on these sales _ about $508 million in 1997 _ are
``mythical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said that Coca-Cola strongly disagreed with Meyer's
contention that Coca-Cola exerted control over Enterprises' board.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that before Coca-Cola sells its interest in any
bottling operation to Enterprises, the price must be approved by a
three-member committee of Enterprises' board, and those three
members cannot be Coca-Cola executives or former executives.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the accounting rule makers, Donaldson said that
the Financial Accounting Standards Board had been debating the
rules for many years without reaching a conclusion. He pointed to a
paper by Dennis Beresford, former chairman of the accounting board,
who argued that the current rules were satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Not all stock analysts argue for consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber in San Francisco,
said Monday that it would be ``insane'' to join the two companies'
financial statements. He said that the relationship was like that
between most franchisers and franchisees. And he said that
Enterprises' management clearly had the best interests of its
stockholders at heart because most of their personal net worth was
invested in the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   At a beverage-industry forum in May, Goldman talked about how
well Enterprises' stock had performed in recent years even as it
acquired additional bottling operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they acquire, the less they make and the higher the
stock goes,'' Goldman said. ``It's the only stock that I've ever
seen like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, over the last decade, Coca-Cola Co.'s return to
investors has been even better.

   ATLANTA _ Gulf War veteran advocates say they are concerned that
an expanded testing program for depleted uranium contamination that
the Pentagon will announce today does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will announce that about 300 soldiers identified by
the Department of Defense as having come into contact with depleted
uranium (DU) during the 1991 Gulf War will have their urine tested
for the toxic heavy metal. The Pentagon has been conducting medical
tests on 33 soldiers who came into significant contact with the
radioactive material, which is used in armor-piercing shells and to
reinforce armor on tank bodies.

KOSOVO ASSAULT STEPPED UP, MAKING THOUSANDS MORE HOMELESS

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Fears grew Monday about the fate of tens
of thousands of refugees in the Serbian province of Kosovo who have
been fleeing what appears to be a massive government military
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Long columns of terrified civilians emerged from combat zones,
and authorities blocked international monitors from the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three days, 20,000 to 30,000 ethnic Albanians have
fled Yugoslav government forces trying to take areas back from
rebels, international relief officials said. They explained that
their estimates were imprecise because they, too, were regularly
being blocked from most areas of current or recent combat.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats assigned to monitor the conflict said they
believed the government was trying to clear ethnic Albanians from
areas of military importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a vicious tactic,'' said a monitor, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``First they are shelling civilian villages
and towns to make the people run, then they seem to be going in to
blow up or burn the buildings to insure civilians can't return.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign monitors said their observer teams were barred Monday
from entering any area of suspected conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best,'' said a foreign diplomat, ``we have to assume this
is a case of widespread `ethnic cleansing.' But the fact that we
are not allowed in to see for ourselves makes me wonder seriously
about what kind of atrocities are being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat said: ``We hear stories about mass graves and
summary executions and the like. Maybe they are not true, but if we
can't get past police checkpoints we become suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``ethnic cleansing'' was used during the war in Bosnia
to describe the practice by competing ethnic groups of expelling
civilians in order to secure control over territory.
</P>
<P>
   Government attacks last week may have caused more than 70,000
civilians to flee their homes, aid officials said. The population
of the province is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. An unknown number of
refugees have found shelter in the homes of others who live near
the conflict, while some have been able to reach nearby towns.
However, it is estimated that tens of thousands have taken refuge
in the mountain forests of central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The government is fighting ethnic Albanian forces of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which wants Kosovo to become an independent
country.
</P>
<P>
   With the government keeping relief workers from thousands of
people _ many of them hiding in forests without adequate water,
food or medical care _ a United Nations official said the refugees
were on the brink of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we could start getting to them immediately,'' said
Mons Nyberg, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, ``there will be a very serious problem because the
weather is extremely hot, the people are scattered across mountains
and there will be health problems very soon. You can't drive trucks
with supplies through the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg said Yugoslav authorities had repeatedly turned back
United Nations survey teams.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in one area the teams had been able to reach,
``there were houses burning everywhere, there was artillery fire
and gunshots in the distance.'' He added, ``The Albanian villages
are completely empty, the people are just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   An international aid official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said relief workers had found Monday that several
villages without any ethnic Albanian residents had not been touched
by government forces and that police officers in those villages
were arming civilians. ``This is a repetition of what happened in
Bosnia and Croatia,'' the official said. ``The army acts first,
then Serb civilians are handed guns to keep the other ethnic group
from returning to the area.''
</P>
<P>
   The military offensive began 10 days ago, announced as a fairly
limited operation to reclaim major roads from rebel control. In it,
the government may have retaken large areas of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the larger of the two republics that remain in
Yugoslavia (the other is Montenegro). The ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province once had a measure of autonomy, but Serbia ended
it. The fighting has escalated over the past several months, since
a government crackdown on rebel activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rebel commanders have boasted that their forces have only
withdrawn temporarily and are reorganizing for a counterattack.
Rebel soldiers have made scattered attacks on government forces
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday the Yugoslav press agency said that government forces
had entered the important town of Smonica and were continuing an
assault on the town of Junik, where more than 1,000 rebel troops
are thought to have taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Some rebel commanders say they are getting hundreds of
volunteers from among the refugees. But government officials
contend that the burden of caring for refugees as well as the
embarrassment of having lost much territory is badly hurting the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders acknowledge that coping with the thousands of
refugees is complicating their ability to reorganize. They insist,
though, that the offensive has not hurt their forces as much as it
has preoccupied them with worry about civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel commander said Friday that by shelling civilians who
live behind rebel lines and sending them into flight, government
forces had made the rebels fall back from their positions to help
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the civilians in rebel-controlled areas seem to support
the Kosovo Liberation Army, or at least its goal of establishing an
independent country. If civilians are cleared from much of the area
where rebels operate, it should be easier for government security
forces to fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia assured
Ambassador Christopher Hill, the American diplomat charged with
resolving the conflict in Kosovo, that the government offensive was
over and that international monitors and relief workers would have
complete access to all parts of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Hill said it appeared that the promises were being
broken. ``I'm not interested in anyone's assurances,'' he said.
``We don't have facts on the ground as far as I can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Pristina, the provincial capital,
contend that they support free access for diplomats and aid
workers. The problem, they say, is getting police forces to follow
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these police at the checkpoints just don't do as we
tell them,'' one official said. ``We're trying to correct this, but
it takes time.''

 &HT;    CEO remodeling American Business Products
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American Business Products may never be the same again
_ which is the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything here is sacred,'' said Larry
Gellerstedt III, chief executive officer of the company since March
30 and chairman since May 8. Gellerstedt said he has a mandate to
``produce a clear strategy'' for a 116-year-old Atlanta company
with a mix of businesses from printing to office supplies to
specialty coatings used in packaging. Institutional investors and
analysts ``don't see any direction to the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they seen much lately in the way of stock performance.
The shares closed 1995 at a high _ $28.50 _ and with a gain of 92
percent for the year. Since then, they have lost 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things they do very well,'' said analyst Steven
Margulies of Brean Murray. ``It's a cheap stock, and they do make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of its five units has been mixed, said
Burnham Securities analyst David Leibowitz. ``The big question is
whether those performing below average have the potential to show
the type of improvement shareholders have come to expect, and if
so, what steps are needed to bring that up,'' Liebowitz said.
Gellerstedt, who replaced Robert W. Gundeck after leaving Beers
Construction, has already pulled the plug on a joint venture in
Europe that made envelopes, and on an in-house effort to develop a
computerized order entry system. But the most radical changes, if
they are made, are likely to be in the Curtis 1000 subsidiary, the
forerunner of American Business Products and producer of about 40
percent of total revenue. Curtis makes custom-order envelopes,
labels, forms and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis 1000, started in St. Paul, Minn., in 1882, ``is back to
making money,'' Gellerstedt noted. A restructuring reduced the
unit's plants from 17 to five, including one in Duluth with 346
employees, and those left are running at only 50 percent capacity,
he said. Gellerstedt, who hopes to deliver a strategic plan to
directors this fall, sees several options for Curtis 1000:
</P>
<P>
   Keep it intact; form a joint venture, perhaps with an office
supply chain, to keep the plants running at a higher capacity; sell
the production part of the business, and sell and distribute
another company's products; or sell the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Another business, BookCrafters, which prints small runs of
books, continued to show ``weakness'' in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up on BookCrafters,''Gellerstedt said, while
acknowledging he does not have an answer to the problems. Discount
Labels, International Envelope and Jen-Coat, on the other hand, are
doing well, and Gellerstedt hopes to transfer technology and
operating advantages among them and other parts of American
Business Products.
</P>
<P>
   Discount Label produces and delivers custom-order labels to
30,000 distributors within 24 hours, across the nation, from a
plant in Louisville, Gellerstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   International Envelope makes light, tough envelopes, almost
impossible to open without scissors. Gellerstedt sees the potential
to expand into packaging, perhaps supplying mail-order companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jen-Coat supplies specialty coatings, including those used in
the packaging of chewing gum andartificial sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Leibowitz thinks it's ``probably premature'' to guess
what changes Gellerstedt will make.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they are, Gellerstedt has a multi-million-dollar
incentive to make them translate into a higher stock price. He
could wind up with 2 percent to 2.5 percent of American Business
Products stock as a long-term incentive, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. At Monday's closing price
of $18.12 1/2, that's worth about $5.9 million to $7.3 million.

 &HT;    If talks fail, BellSouth workers may strikeBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Members of the union representing more than half of
BellSouth's workers have voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike
should talks fail to produce a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline for a deal only days away, about 93 percent of
Communications Workers of America voters gave union leaders the
right to call a strike if negotiators fail to hammer out a deal by
the time current contracts expire at 11:59 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very iffy at this point,'' said Jimmy Smith, CWA vice
president for District 3, which includes the nine Southeastern
states in which BellSouth provides local service. ``If the contract
expired today, there's no question there would be a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   CWA represents about 48,000 of the 86,188 BellSouth employees.
The company, created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, has never faced a
strike and neither side seems anxious for a walkout now.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials say they remain optimistic that an accord
can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the progress of the talks,'' said
BellSouth spokeswoman Deborah Spicer. ``We are absolutely committed
to reaching an agreement by Saturday. We need to let that real work
happen at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth views the authorization vote as ``standard operating
procedure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are working on contracts for six BellSouth units.
Key issues are the company's ability to force employees to work
overtime, the contracting of jobs to non-union workers and pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   CWA officials declined to say how many members voted. However,
the turnout was greater than that three years ago when members
ratified pacts with BellSouth, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the distance between the two sides, the negotiating mood
can shift, he said. ``It's like the weather _ it can change in 15
minutes.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Tonight, Wednesday and Thursday at 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field, Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS will telecast tonight and Thursday night. Fox Sports
South will telecast Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP John Smoltz (9-2,
3.18; 14-10, 3.00 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. RHP Steve Parris (1-2,
5.45; 1-1, 5.68 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday, LHP Denny Neagle
(11-9, 3.53; 8-3, 4.45 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. RHP Brett Tomko
(10-7, 4.19; 0-1, lifetime vs. Braves). Thursday, RHP Greg Maddux
(14-5, 1.61; 13-11, 3.33 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. LHP Mike Remlinger
(6-11, 4.63; 1-2, 4.40 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 251-293 but
has won 14 of the last 17 games between the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves are 5-1 against Cincinnati and took
three of four at Cinergy Field last week. The Reds scored 23 runs
in those four games and still won just once. Atlanta is batting
.292 with nine homers against Cincinnati this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reds leaders: Avg. _ Dmitri Young (.309); HR _ Willie Greene
(13); RBI _ Eddie Taubensee (55); SB _ Barry Larkin (17). Wins _
Brett Tomko (10); ERA _ John Hudek (0.00). Saves _ Danny Graves
(3). Strikeouts _ Pete Harnisch (109).
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: The Reds are coming off a three-game weekend sweep at
Florida and have won five of nine after coming out of a eight-game
losing streak. The bad news: Three of those four losses came
against the Braves last week in Cincinnati. . .. The Reds have been
in last place since July 20 and have been no higher than fourth
since Opening Day. . . . The recent Braves series was a disaster
for Cincinnati. Infielder Pokey Reese tore ligaments in his right
thumb and may be out for the year. Right-hander Pete Harnisch was
forced out of a start because of a tricep strain, and second
baseman Bret Boone might get back into the lineup only now after
spraining his left ankle. . . . The Reds have scored five or more
runs in five of their last nine games. . . . Since closer Jeff Shaw
was dealt to Los Angeles July 4, Cincinnati's bullpen has not blown
a save and designated closer Danny Graves is 3-for-3 in
conversions. . . . Parris, tonight's starter, is in a rematch with
Smoltz, after their last meeting was spoiled by Smoltz's ejection.
Parris pitched well early, taking a no-hitter into the fifth when
the Braves, enraged by Smoltz's ejection by umpire Hunter
Wendelstedt, nailed him for seven runs in their next 11 at-bats.
The big blow was Tony Graffanino's three run homer. . . . On the
DL: C Brook Fordyce (bruised left shoulder), LHP Steve Cooke (left
elbow tendinitis), INF Pokey Reese (torn ligaments, right thumb),
RHP Marc Kroon (right elbow tendinitis), RHP Keith Glauber (right
shoulder surgery), RHP Mark Hutton (strained right groin).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: OF Reggie Sanders is hitting .333 in his last eight
starts. OF Pat Watkins has a home run and is hitting .333 since his
call-up from Class AAA Indianapolis last week. RHP John Hudek has
yet to allow a run in his first 11 appearances (15 2/3 innings) as
a Red.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: C Eddie Taubensee is hitting .190 in his last six
games. OF Dmitri Young is hitting .227 over the last 10 days.

 &HT;    Burrough in the pits this offseason
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're looking for a future lawyer, accountant or
executive on the Atlanta Falcons current roster, then John Burrough
probably isn't your man. But if you want somebody who will get down
and dirty, he's the guy.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-year defensive end grew up in Wyoming, tending horses
and feeding cattle. After his pro football career, he aspires to
work in the oil industry, which is why he went back to school at
Wyoming to get his degree in geophysics.
</P>
<P>
   And this spring, he worked on the pit crew for NASCAR driver
Kyle Petty in races at Atlanta, Bristol and Talladega. The NFL
Players Association is one of Petty's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's not where you expect to find a 6-foot-5, 275-pound
professional football player, but Burrough couldn't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a NASCAR fan two years ago when I went to a race with
(former Falcon tackle) Antone Davis,'' he said. ``A lot of guys
went to the race in Daytona, but I wanted to get my hands dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrough, who was used mostly as a backup to right end Chuck
Smith last year, spent his offseason getting dirty in Suwanee,
where coaches have worked on building his strength.
</P>
<P>
   In training camp this year, he's working behind left end Lester
Archambeau, but he'll probably play both ends, at least until
someone claims the fourth end spot.
</P>
<P>
   Burrough, who has had one start each of the last two seasons,
has played in all 48 games in his Falcon career. Last year was his
best statistically, with 30 tackles and his only career sack.
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage of sacks is not the Falcons' chief concern
about the former late seventh-round pick. Burrough sometimes gets
pushed too easily out of the way on running plays. So most of his
offseason work with strength and conditioning coach Al Miller has
been on holding his ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on the point of impact and sturdiness on run
blocks,'' he said. ``We've worked on power and explosion, and a lot
of that comes in the offseason. I had a good offseason, and as a
team we had a great offseason. The camaraderie of the guys was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials hope that offseason pays off for Burrough and his
teammates. In the meantime, he practically glows when talking of
his work in the Petty's pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't let me go over the wall,'' he said. ``What I did
was catch tires. As the tires come off the car, they throw them at
the wall, and I'd bring them over the wall. I also worked a sign
board, which brings Kyle in to the pit at certain times. Once I
went to a NASCAR race and worked in the pits, I was a fan for
life.''

 &HT;    Fingers point to Ohio State
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998 season ended on a particularly sour note for the Ohio
State Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, Ohio State was 10-1 and ranked No. 4 when it played
No. 2 Michigan for the Big Ten championship and a spot in the Rose
Bowl. The Buckeyes, however, could not stop Michigan's Charles
Woodson and lost 20-14. That dropped Ohio State to 1-8-1 against
Michigan in nine years under coach John Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, Ohio State fell to Florida State 31-14 in the Sugar
Bowl in a game that wasn't that close. Cooper's bowl record at Ohio
State fell to 2-7.
</P>
<P>
   But if we are to believe the preseason magazines, 1998 will be a
year of redemption for both Cooper and the Buckeyes. Six of the
eight magazines surveyed by The Journal-Constitution have Ohio
State No. 1, and the composite poll has the Buckeyes No. 1 overall,
just ahead of Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has been in the national championship race for most
of this decade, but something always has gotten in the way _
usually Michigan. In fact, Ohio State's last national title came 30
years ago. But with 17 starters returning and a schedule that has
Penn State, Michigan State and Michigan coming to Columbus, the
scribes say this finally will be the Buckeyes' breakthrough season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in NFL history, Ohio State didn't get
anybody drafted this year,'' said Charlie Miller, the managing
editor at Athlon, which has the Buckeyes No. 1. ``That tells us
they didn't lose anybody from what was a bowl-alliance team. And
John Cooper's jinx against Michigan has to end sooner or later.''
Others have not jumped on the Ohio State bandwagon. They look at
the fact that in 11 of the past 14 seasons, Ohio State has ended
the season with a loss to Michigan. They look at Ohio State's
opener at West Virginia (11th in the composite poll) on Sept. 5,
and see an upset in the making. They see a Florida State team that
has gotten even faster in the offseason and has all of its tough
games, including Florida, at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida State was one play away from playing Nebraska for the
national championship last season,'' said Tom Deinhart of The
Sporting News, one of two magazines that picked the Seminoles No.
1. ``If Chris Weinke works out at qua rterback, they are certainly
good enough to run the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden's team was No. 1 in the coaches' poll last
season when it fell 32-29 at Florida. The Seminoles are hungry
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, you have to ask, `Can they put it all together?'''
said Bowden, whose teams have finished in the top five for 11
straight years. ``If we do, we'll be as good as we have been. We
certainly have the pieces to be that kind of team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Florida State and Ohio State got all the first-place
votes, several other teams could jump into the national
championship race, which will end Jan. 4 in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Florida finished No. 3 in the comtion's most versatile players
in tailback J.R. Redmond, and the Sun Devils don't play UCLA. LSU
looks for a breakthrough season with the return of tailback Kevin
Faulk. But the Tigers must play at Florida on Oct. 10. UCLA brings
a 10-game winning streak and quarterback Cade McNown into the
season. Tennessee will be very good on offense again.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a real darkhorse, try West Virginia, which
returns a ton of starters, including quarterback Marc Bulger and
tailback Amos Zereoue. The Mountaineers will find out if they are
for real on Sept. 5, when Ohio State visits.

 &HT;    Southern negotiating to build, operate Wisconsin generating
plant
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co., expanding its network of electric power
plants outside the Southeast, is negotiating with a Milwaukee-based
utility to build and operate a $125 million natural-gas-fueled
plant in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Electric said the Atlanta-based utility holding
company will build the plant in Herman, Wis., then sell the
Wisconsin utility all but 50 megawatts of the plant's 300 megawatts
of electricity capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern offer was the top bid among 20 proposals. Final
details of the eight-year power purchase agreement are still being
negotiated, and a final decision on the plant site is yet to come.
The preferred location is a 30-acre site Wisconsin Electric owns in
Sheboygan County.
</P>
<P>
   David Mould, a spokesman for Southern, said the company is
optimistic final details can be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facility is scheduled for operation by June 2000 and will
strengthen electric reliability in the region,'' said Richard
Grigg, president and chief operating officer of Wisconsin Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The utility said the plant would provide enough electricity to
meet the requirements of 100,000 homes. That's about one-tenth of
Wisconsin Electric's 1 million customers in the eastern part of the
state and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The plant would be owned by Southern Energy Inc., a Southern
subsidiary that presumably would be free to market surplus
electricity in wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
   Southern is moving to establish footholds in electricity markets
around the country as deregulation expands in the industry. In most
cases, it is building or operating plants and agreeing to supply
power back to local utilities for set periods with rights to sell
surplus power in wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Southern has announced plans to sell
electricity from four upstate New York plants owned by Sithe
Energies and to acquire a network of small Massachusetts plants
from Commonwealth Energy System for $537 million.
</P>
<P>
   Southern last year acquired an antiquated coal-fueled plant in
Hammond, Ind., for $68 million. The plant caught fire last week,
injuring 14 workers. Southern also has a 50 percent stake in a
small plant in King George County, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Southern is seeking approval to build a $175 million plant in
southern New Hampshire and is part of a consortium bidding about $1
billion for plants now owned by Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, a
bankrupt Louisiana utility cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Southern's Georgia Power Co. subsidiary has
made long-term agreements to purchase electricity from two Georgia
power plants owned by out-of-state companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson was thrilled that Milwaukee
was chosen as the site of the semifinal against Italy in September,
saying, ``This is a proud day for me, being a native of
Wisconsin,'' but that selection apparently cost the team Andre
Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right now, me and (Jim) Courier would have
rather played in Southern California,'' Agassi said. ``What about
what the players think? I was hoping it would be down there (in San
Diego) or we could pull it off in (Las) Vegas. I could've played in
San Diego, but now I can't play in Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had already committed himself to attending a dinner for
the Andre Agassi Foundation in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the U.S.-Belgium Davis Cup quarterfinal last month
in Indianapolis drew just short of 12,000 for the three days. The
first-round match against Russia at Stone Mountain Park attracted
over 14,000 despite a rainout.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Open preview for women
</P>
<P>
   The best event before the U.S. Open hardcourt probably will be
this week's Toshiba Classic in San Diego, where the field includes
Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Venus Williams, Steffi Graf and Anna
Kournikova. ... Seles on her first meeting against Williams, a
semifinal loss last week in Stanford, Calif.: ``She does a very
good variety on her serve. I really love that part of her game. I
wish I had that serve and that athletic ability.'' Williams won
6-3, 6-4 and hit 12 aces, including the first and final points of
the match. ... Graf, who lost to Lindsay Davenport in the Stanford
semifinals, was asked how her injury layoff affected her personal
life. ``I have to approach people more,'' she said. ``I think I'm a
more open person. Maybe it is something of a coming of age. I used
to be very quiet, I know. But I have had to make major changes.''
</P>
<P>
   TeamTennis
</P>
<P>
   Four Atlanta players are competing in World TeamTennis this
summer. T.J. Middleton is ranked fourth in singles at 59-51 for
third-place Springfield and beat Jimmy Connors of Kansas City 6-3
in Connors' debut. Richey Reneberg is 16-11 in limited singles duty
for second-place Sacramento. Luke and Murphy Jensen are 50-51 in
doubles for last-place Delaware. Luke is 14-30 and Murphy 20-25 in
singles. The league is at midseason break and will resume Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Loose points
</P>
<P>
   Rod Laver's recovery from a stroke is only beginning, according
to Dr. Neil Martin, co-director of the stroke center at UCLA
Medical Center. ``He's going to have a substantial job in front of
him, as far as physical therapy,'' Martin said. ``We're talking
months of therapy.'' ... Pete Sampras' plantar's wart was good
fortune to the du Maurier Open in Toronto. Sampras, who pulled out
of Los Angeles last week after the minor foot surgery, took a wild
card into Toronto this week instead and will play there for the
first time since 1990. ... During the first round of the Fed Cup,
Davenport said U.S. team members were on a mission to win back the
championship. Just days before the second round last month, she
begged off because of mental fatigue, prompting a late
substitution. ... Thomas Muster's injured left shoulder could keep
him out of the U.S. Open. ... Brad Gilbert says NCAA singles
champion Bob Bryan's game reminds him of his own. ``I didn't think
my game is that ugly,'' Bryan responded. ... Atlanta's Doug Flach
won three matches to qualify for the du Maurier Open in Toronto.
... Suspicious of tax evasion, German tax agents have raided about
30 locations linked to Boris Becker, including offices and
apartments of friends and the German Tennis Federation, according
to a Munich newspaper.

LEWIS REWROTE THE RULES IN A HIGH-TECH MEDIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (IDs Beth Potier in 14th graf; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a high-tech medium, television usually requires effects more
special than a talking sock.
</P>
<P>
   But Shari Lewis was so gifted a puppeteer, ventriloquist, and
entertainer that she was able to rewrite the rules and win 12 Emmys
before dying Sunday at age 65 of complications from uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the diminutive, red-haired dynamo also experienced
television's fickle side, and was absent from the tube for long
periods as cartoons took over children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will forever be identified with her most indelible
creation: a cantankerous little puppet named Lamb Chop. As much of
a high-maintenance prima donna as Miss Piggy, Lamb Chop was
nobody's sheep. Her screechy voice was even heard in the halls of
Congress. On programs such as ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' she made
the sort of mischief that gave a vicarious thrill to millions of
children watching at home _ while demurely professing her innocence
all the while.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Lewis means that yet another reassuring figure from
television's early years is gone from the scene. In the past month,
Robert Young of ``Father Knows Best,'' Buffalo Bob Smith of ``The
Howdy Doody Show,'' and singing cowboy Roy Rogers also have passed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed both ageless and tireless. It was easy to forget
that she had introduced Lamb Chop as far back as 1957, on ``The
Captain Kangaroo Show,'' before going on to create and star in such
shows as ``The Shari Lewis Show,'' ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' and
her latest, ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was someone who seemed to get younger as she got older,''
said children's TV activist Peggy Charren, a friend of Lewis's.
``She had more energy than anybody I know. She was Charlie Horse
and she was Lamb Chop, and some of those conversations between the
two of them were achingly funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The ebullient Lewis filled her shows with music, comedy,
riddles, puns, and easy-to-digest lessons about life. The
educational impulse was present off-camera too; Charren said Lewis
was as much activist as entertainer, ever concerned about expanding
the array of choices for children on television.
</P>
<P>
   During a memorable day in 1993, Lewis brought Lamb Chop to
Capitol Hill to make an impassioned plea to broadcasters to improve
children's television programming. ``We need the best you grown-ups
have to offer,'' Lewis had the puppet say. ``If you give it to us,
we will give you the good stuff back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis herself had a broad definition of ``the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lewis noticed that few TV programs seemed geared
toward Jewish children, so she came up with such primetime specials
as ``Lamb Chop's Special Chanukah'' and ``Shari's Passover
Surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Conscious that television seldom tried to foster an appreciation
of music, Lewis created a show designed to do just that, ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did was look at what was missing on television and
try to fill the gap,'' said Charren.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Potier, a spokesperson for WGBH-TV in Boston, which carried
Lewis' shows, recalled seeing Lewis perform last year in Dallas at
a PBS meeting. ``She did a song-and-dance with Lamb Chop, very fast
back and forth, singing the whole time,'' said Potier. ``She had to
change her voice each time, and throw her voice. It was
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis began astounding spectators at an early age. She first
pulled a rabbit out of her hat at the age of 4, appeared on her
first TV variety show at age 13, and starred in ``Facts 'n' Fun''
on NBC at 18. &UR;  &LR; She cemented her status as a leading children's
entertainer with ``The Shari Lewis Show,'' which ran Saturday
mornings on NBC from 1960 to 1963 before being canceled as
children's television shifted its focus to animation.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a half-hour syndicated puppet show called ``The Shari
Show'' in 1975, it would be three decades before Lewis regained a
prominent place on television. A resilient trouper, she took her
act to Las Vegas, appeared on game shows, and even conducted
symphony orchestras. She also wrote more than 60 children's books,
and in 1986, entertained children from around the world at a White
House Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis returned triumphantly to television with ``Lamb Chop's
Play-Along,'' which premiered on PBS in 1992. Before Lewis stopped
production on it last year, the show had won five Emmys. Then, in
January, Lewis introduced ``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She cut
short production on the show six weeks ago when she began
undergoing chemotherapy treatments. Among the events she had to
miss was the ``Charlie Horse Music Pizza Jam Session,'' an event to
celebrate PBS' children's programming, at the Children's Museum in
Boston on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After developing pneumonia during chemotherapy, Lewis died
Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She leaves her husband,
Jeremy Tarcher; her daughter, Mallory Tarcher; and many grateful
parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew what parents would like for their kids, and
fortunately, the kids liked it,'' said Charren. ``She had that
magic touch.''

 &HT;    Delta receives higher rating in quest for happy customers
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines' push to improve its customer service
paid off in June with the Atlanta-based carrier ranking No. 2 among
the 10 major airlines in on-time arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, which ranked No. 4 in May on arrivals within 15 minutes
of schedule, also improved with fewer baggage-handling problems and
fewer complaints from customers, according to the latest Department
of Transportation figures available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good indication of the focus we are putting on
reliability and on-time flights,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry said
Monday. ``We are definitely committed to improving customer service
across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is upgrading its fleet, installing new technology
and software to improve passenger traffic flow through its gates
and last month promoted 25-year Delta veteran Vicki Escarra, a
native Atlantan who started as a flight attendant, to executive
vice president-customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report shows 75.4 percent
of Delta's flights arrived on time in June. The leader in the
category remained Southwest Airlines, which had 81.4 percent of its
flights arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
   While Delta came in second, its performance was actually below
the 79.5 percent of flights that were on time in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather is a big variable,'' Berry said. ``You can have a bad
month or a good month depending on what the weather does for you in
your major hubs.'' Delta services 80 percent of the flights at
Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this year, Delta ranked No. 4 in
on-time performance, compared with No. 10 a year ago, according to
the DOT report.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the nation's 10 largest carriers had an on-time arrival
record of 70.4 percent in June, down from May's 77.5 percent rate
and below June 1997's market of 76.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another key indicator of service is mishandled baggage. In June,
Delta jumped from No. 5 in May to No. 1 in June with 3.99 reports
for every 1,000 passengers. America West had 4.27 complaints per
1,000 passengers, putting it in the second spot.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also improved with fewer customer complaints in June,
rising to No. 3 from No. 4 in the ranking. It had .60 complaints
per 100,000 passengers, compared with the carrier with the worst
results: Northwest with 2.34 complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Among all airliens in June, consumers filed 709 complaints about
airline service, 22 percent fewer than the 914 filed in May and 6
percent below the 758 percent in June a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT results did not include second quarter figures on
``bumping,'' or passengers who were either voluntarily or
involuntarily denied boarding. Delta ranked No. 6 in the first
quarter, January through March, with 1.14 bumpings per 10,000
passengers, compared with 2.23 a year ago.

CUBAN EXILE ASSERTS HE DELIBERATELY MISINFORMED THE NEW YORK
TIMES  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Cuban exile who conducted violent operations against the Cuban
government has asserted that he deliberately misinformed The New
York Times when he said in a series of interviews that leaders of
the most influential exile organization in the United States had
provided him with financial support.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, a cable news station in Miami broadcast
excerpts from an interview in which the Cuban exile, Luis Posada
Carriles, said he had lied because The New York Times had
information about financial backers in the United States whom he
wished to protect. He said that he had misdirected the newspaper by
asserting that he had received money from Jorge Mas Canosa, who,
until his death, was the leader of the Cuban-American National
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper had a lot of information about people that could
be adversely affected, people that were alive, that could get into
federal problems,'' Posada said in the interview with CBS
Telenoticias, a Spanish-language station. The interview was
conducted in Spanish and translated by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say what pressures Mr. Posada may have felt to change
his story, or what second thoughts he may have had after seeing the
furious reaction among anti-Castro Cubans, or even what motivated
him to give us the interview in the first place,'' said Bill
Keller, the managing editor of The New York Times. ``As we made
clear in the original articles, he is a tricky character who lives
in a shadowy world. We presented him as an interesting figure from
history, not a paragon of truth and virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller added: ``What we can say with confidence is that he said
the things we quoted. We can say that some of what he said _
including the fact that he had a longstanding relationship with Mr.
Mas _ was corroborated by other interviews and documents. And where
we could not corroborate his claims, we said so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday night broadcast was the second interview with Posada
that has been aired in Miami since The New York Times published
three articles about his activities and his ties with Mas.
Immediately after The New York Times articles were published, the
foundation called a news conference to condemn the articles and
showed a videotaped interview with Posada in which he said the
articles were lies. In that interview, Posada asserted that The New
York Times had misquoted him.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times quoted Posada as saying that over the years,
Mas and other leaders of the Cuban-American National Foundation had
sent him more than $200,000. Posada admitted that he had been
responsible for a number of violent acts, including several
attempts on the life of Fidel Castro and the bombing of hotels last
year in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Posada was quoted in The New York Times as saying that all
payments were made in cash and that he did not know whether the
money came from personal, business, or foundation accounts. He said
the money was used for his living and operating expenses. Posada
said that Mas did not want to know the details of Posada's
activities and he did not tell him.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing the relationship between Mas and Posada, The New York
Times drew on recently declassified government documents, including
a 1965 Central Intelligence Agency cable that asserts that Mas had
paid Posada $5,000 to place mines in a Cuban or Soviet vessel in a
Mexican harbor. The articles also included a deposition by Mas'
brother, Ricardo Mas, who said that his brother had used the money
to pay for Posada's escape from jail and his transportation from
Venezuela to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent interview, Posada said that all of his
comments about the foundation and Mas were deliberate pieces of
disinformation intended to lead The New York Times away from his
true sources of financing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times asked Posada in the interviews several times
about a document that indicated he was receiving money for the
hotel bombings from four Cuban Americans in Union City, N.J., one
of them a member of the foundation with close ties to its leaders
in Miami. He confirmed the authenticity of the document but
declined to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview on Sunday, Posada said that it had
been ``15 years, 12 years since I last had contact with Jorge
Mas.''
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Posada had said that it was eight to 10 years
since he had contact with Mas. He told The New York Times that they
had last spoken about a month before Mas' death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent interview, Posada was asked if the Cuban
foundation had sent him money to finance subversive actions. ``They
have never sent me any to finance subversive acts, never given me
money to pay my expenses, not for any other type of activities,''
he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times article did not say the foundation had given
money to Posada.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, however, Posada wrote that foundation
leaders had helped pay his medical and living expenses and
transportation from Venezuela to Central America after he escaped
from jail in 1985. Posada told The New York Times that Mas had
coordinated the flow of money to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Mas said in the deposition that his brother had paid for
Posada's escape from jail after he was arrested for bombing a
Cubana airliner in 1976, killing 73 people. Mas testified that his
brother said ``he needed me to go down and bring back $50,000, that
it would be used to get Luis Posada Carriles out of jail, that
Carriles wanted out, that he might start talking.''

PRESUMED PARENTS IN BABY MIXUP DIED IN CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The recent discovery that two babies were switched
at a hospital maternity ward three years ago took a grim and even
more complicated turn Monday with the disclosure that the presumed
parents of one baby died on July 4 in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville,
where the girls were born on June 29 and June 30, 1995, declined to
identify Kevin Chittum and Tamara Whitney Rogers as the parents of
one of the switched girls. But USA Today reported in Monday's
editions that Chittum, 25, and Ms. Rogers, 19, had died in the
accident that claimed seven lives before anyone knew that their
daughter might be involved in the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Watts of Buena Vista, Va., Chittum's aunt, said Monday that
hospital authorities had informed the surviving family members that
3-year-old Rebecca was another woman's child and that another woman
was raising theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The two families involved live in nearby towns in the Shenandoah
Valley. Paula Johnson of Ruckersville approached the hospital two
weeks ago with DNA evidence that proved 3-year-old Callie Marie was
not her child. Ms. Johnson had sought the tests to establish the
paternity of Callie's presumed father and to induce him to make
child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Beck, spokeswoman for the hospital, said that the
hospital suspects the switch was not an accident and has called in
Virginia State Police to aid in its investigation. She said the
hospital has not yet named ``Family B'' _ which Ms. Watt says is
her family _ as Callie's biological parents, but that it had
dispatched a physician and a nurse to visit it.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the other 3-year-old girl, Rebecca, is pleading
for seclusion while they work through their grief over the July 4
crash and arrange custody of her and the 1-year-old daughter of
Chittum and Ms. Rogers, who were engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The two mothers presumably involved had known each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Whitney from the hospital as a warm and
enthusiastic person,'' Ms. Johnson said in a statement Monday
through her attorney, Cynthia A. Johnson, who is not related. ``For
the last few days, my life has been an absolute nightmare with
reporters stalking me, Callie, and members of my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to the chance to meet with the other
families and my biological daughter in private,'' she said of
Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   The crash that killed the parents raising Rebecca was the worst
in the nation this year on the fourth of July, claiming seven lives
in all. Chittum, a carpenter and a contractor, had set off early
that afternoon for a county fair with five passengers _ Ms. Rogers,
his 13-year-old sister, his 11-year-old niece from Charlottesville,
and two brothers, 10 and 13, from Lexington who had known his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in ``a very bad place'' near Roanoke, on
Interstate 81, said the Botetourt County Sheriff, Reed Kelly. It
was pouring rain, he said, and the car drove over a hump in the
road that caused it to hydroplane and cross the median, where it
hit a tractor trailer. Everyone in Chittum's car and the driver of
the truck, Jerry Douglas Gregory, 59, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The families that now care for Rebecca and her sister are big
and entrenched; the phone book for Buena Vista, population 6,500,
lists 10 Chittums and nine Rogerses. After the accident, they faced
one custody question that was troubling enough. Now, Mrs. Watts
said, they have another.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ After Jan Jones, this booming city's two-term
Democratic mayor, entered the Nevada gubernatorial race just over
two months ago, she had plenty on her mind and on her plate. There
were dollars to be raised, hands to be shaken, pitches to be honed.
</P>
<P>
   But first and foremost, there were chemotherapy and radiation
treatments to be endured. In tandem with her quest to become the
state's first female governor, Ms. Jones was trying to overcome
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, she still is. Although Ms. Jones says that the
surgery she underwent in February was successful and that the odds
that she is cured are better than 90 percent, doctors are still
pumping toxins into her body, in case there is any residual cancer
to be vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones capped off perhaps the most turbulent, eventful few
days of her campaign more than a week ago with a chemotherapy
session. She has one more to go.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that she has made no effort to conceal any of this _
her husband, Richard Schuetz, a gambling industry consultant, wrote
a front-page article for The Las Vegas Sun in which he described
lying beside her in bed and welcoming her snoring as a sign that
she was sleeping well _ has lent a fascinating, unpredictable
dynamic to the Nevada gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also underscored the extent to which candidates and
elected officials have in many cases come to expose the most
intimate corners of their lives, including illness, to public view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an era when politicians look to humanize themselves
and talk about these things much more often,'' said Stuart
Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report.
</P>
<P>
   It is in many ways a bold contrast to the past, when politicians
like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy sought to
conceal or at least soft-pedal health problems: polio in
Roosevelt's case and Addison's disease, a degeneration of the
adrenal glands, in Kennedy's. The prevailing wisdom and worry were
that voters might be concerned by any suggestion that a candidate
or elected official was not in robust health.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking appeared to influence Paul Tsongas, a Democratic
candidate for president who in 1992 trumpeted what he called a full
recovery from lymphoma by allowing news photographers to take
pictures of him in his bathing suit at the pool where he swam laps.
It was later learned that Tsongas' prognosis was more problematic,
and he died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been many signs in recent years that the
political climate is changing, at least at the level below the
presidency. Lawton Chiles was elected governor of Florida in 1990
despite an admission that he had taken anti-depressant medication,
and Ms. Jones, 49, is one of several candidates around the country
this year who have been remarkably open about health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., who is 46, has spoken candidly about
having Parkinson's disease, a degenerative nerve disorder, as has
70-year-old Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M. Both are running for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts said this openness is part of a
confessional culture in America that has inevitably influenced
politics and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Al Gore and the trials and tribulations of every family
member,'' said Rothenberg, referring to the vice president's
frequent public comments about his sister's lung cancer and a
nearly fatal accident in which his son was hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said it was impossible to know how much, if any,
calculation goes into these confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Other political analysts said that politicians may simply be
anticipating scrutiny from reporters and beating them to the punch.
Both Evans and Skeen had faced speculation about their health
before revealing they had Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones said she could easily have kept her breast cancer
secret, but did not do so in part because she felt she could help
educate people about the disease and the importance of the early
detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often said I could be the only governor candidate who
could save women's lives,'' said Ms. Jones, adding that her busy
public schedule and obvious vim should reassure voters that she is
fine, and that her honesty could help her at the polls. Many
political analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it could play out differently, says Aaron Russo, one of
several Republicans in the race. Russo, a movie producer running a
somewhat offbeat campaign, said bluntly that voters should be wary
of Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if, God forbid, something happened to Jan when she was
governor?'' Russo asked in an interview. ``If she's sick, I don't
know that what she's doing is best for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' volubility about her breast cancer is only the latest
surprising chapter in a political career that has pegged her as one
of the most interesting up-and-comers in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative but socially liberal, she has an
undergraduate degree from Stanford University, a personal worth of
millions, a generous nimbus of frosted hair, a penchant for
extremely high heels, eight cats, four dogs and three children,
ages 18, 14 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was elected mayor of Las Vegas in 1991, she was best
known to Nevadans for her campy shenanigans in a string of
television commercials for the car dealerships owned by her second
husband. The couple later divorced and Ms. Jones was married in
January to Schuetz, her third husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones said that she was not merely an actress in the
commercials, in which she was cast as Little Red Riding Hood and a
gangster's moll, but a principal force in their creation, correctly
anticipating that consumers, traditionally suspicious of car
salesmen, would find a woman more trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, there was no other woman on TV selling cars,''
she said over a long dinner several weeks ago. ``Today in Las
Vegas, every car dealership has a woman spokesperson. I think I set
the trend.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed. ``Politics was the only job I could have found
where I didn't step down from selling cars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones is considered the front-runner to win the Democratic
gubernatorial primary in September, but political analysts said
that she would clearly be the underdog in a match-up in November
with Kenny Guinn, 61, the former president of the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas, who is expected to win the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge before her may have grown a bit tougher a week and
a half ago, when the state's Ethics Commission decided to
investigate whether there was any impropriety in a vote by Ms.
Jones, who sits on the Las Vegas City Council, that appeared to
benefit one of her political contributors. Ms. Jones has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger hurdle she faces may be financial. While she has
raised about $800,000 so far, Guinn has raised about $3.5 million,
which is one reason why many Nevadans consider Guinn's election a
foregone conclusion. Ms. Jones has taken to referring to herself as
the ``fly in the anointment.''
</P>
<P>
   That she is a woman could work to her advantage. In recent
years, Nevada has elected more women proportionally to state and
national offices than most other states, and this election season
could be the best test of that progressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Jones, the Democratic front-runners for attorney
general and lieutenant governor are women, an all-female lineup
that political insiders have taken to calling ``the estrogen
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Ralston, the publisher of a nonpartisan political newsletter
in Nevada, also noted: ``The more Jan Jones plays up the breast
cancer thing, the more she plays up her gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her opponents conceded quietly that the public sympathy
created by her openness about breast cancer makes campaigning
against her a more delicate endeavor.
</P>

   ``I think it's helping her, but the whole thing can be
overplayed,'' Ralston said. ``There's a slight danger of her doing
that.''

DOW FALLS 96.55; NASDAQ INDEX TAKES BIGGER HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell Monday as investor concerns that Asia's
economic crisis will continue to erode the profits of U.S.
companies depressed share prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 96.55 points, to 8,786.74,
a 1.09 percent decline. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
dropped 8.23 points, to 1,112.44.
</P>
<P>
   But once again the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index took
a greater hit, declining 21.29 points, to 1,851.10, a 1.14 percent
drop. Microsoft, Worldcom, MCI Communications and
Tele-Communications Inc. were the leading decliners in the index,
which lost more than 3 percent of what its value was last week.
That compared with last week's 0.6 percent drop in the Dow and 1.8
percent fall in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Asia pushed the dollar higher against the yen, to
145.60, closer to its June 16 high of 146.75 yen _ its highest
level in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds gained as the strong dollar made Treasury issues an
attractive safe-haven investment for foreign buyers. Treasury
securities were also buoyed by a larger-than-expected decline in
the July National Association of Purchasing Management's index.
</P>
<P>
   The key indicator of domestic manufacturing activity fell to
49.1 in July from 49.6 in June, its second consecutive decline
after 22 months of being above 50, the dividing line between a
manufacturing sector that is expanding and one that is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fairly strong consumer demand and tame inflation in the
United States, analysts are concerned that Asia's woes will crimp
earnings, especially for large multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on second-quarter earnings, it's clear there's a
meaningful slowdown in profit growth,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson noted that even companies with limited operations in
Asia, like Computer Associates International, were being affected
by the malaise. This is because some of the company's customers _
with greater exposure to Asia _ may delay spending on the software
developers' products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find a safe haven or avoid being hurt by what's
going on in Asia,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to his more bearish sentiment, Johnson on Monday
lowered his earnings forecasts for the S&AMP;P 500. He now expects
operating earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 to be $46.73 a share this year,
down from $48.57, and $49.48 in 1999, down from $52.21.
</P>
<P>
   His forecasts are slightly below the consensus estimates of
$47.20 and $49.70, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the declines and a strong bearish market sentiment,
Johnson and several other analysts believe the declines simply
signal a market correction and are not the beginning of a severe
market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this short-term setback as a reality check, however,
rather than the start of a meaningful move to the downside,''
Elizabeth Mackay, investment strategist at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.,
wrote in a recent market report.
</P>
<P>
   Declines should be limited to a 7 percent to 10 percent decline
for the major market indexes from their recent highs, Ms. Mackay
wrote. At Monday's close, the Dow was down about 5.9 percent from
its July 17 record close of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   But if the index falls below its recent low of 8,627.93
investors may begin to worry more about whether the declines will
end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's losses left the Dow 158.81 points away from its recent
low of 8,727.93 on June 15. A close below that would signal an
almost 8 percent decline from the July 17 high.

<P>
   Elsewhere in the market, the German software developer SAP began
trading on the New York Stock exchange Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with a market capitalization of about $73 billion,
is the world's second-largest technology company behind Microsoft.
It is also the largest new listing ever on the Big Board, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Its size is one reason SAP chose to list on the New York Stock
Exchange, as opposed to the Nasdaq, said Kevin McKay, chief
operating officer and chief financial officer of SAP Americas. ``We
don't characterize ourselves as a high-tech start-up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company favored a recent change in the
exchange's policies that allowed SAP to select the specialist, or
dealer, who is assigned to maintain fair and orderly trading in the
stock. Generally, specialists are assigned securities by the
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The company's American depository receipts fell 1 15/16, to 59
9/16. One ADR represents one-twelfth of a preferred share of SAP
stock.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States remains the world's biggest arms
merchant, filling the developing world's arsenals with billions of
dollars of weapons, but Russia and France are poised to overtake
the United States, a new government report reveals.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Congressional Research Service, says the
United States retained its No.1 position in the arms trade, which
it has held for seven years, by selling $15.2-billion worth of
weapons last year, a 44 percent share of the shrinking global arms
market.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France are in a dead heat in the competition for
sales pacts, says the report, which is based in part on data
compiled by the CIA. The accords, not all of which are carried out,
indicate trends in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that sales by the United States and other
nations to the developing world are slowing. There has been a
steady decline in most sectors of the international trade since the
end of the Cold War and the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The arms bazaar of the '80s and early '90s in Asia and the
Middle East has calmed, in part because of the Asian economic
crisis, which has prevented nations from striking huge new deals.
Another factor is the long slump in crude-oil prices, helping slow
purchases by Saudi Arabia, once the biggest buyer of U.S. weaponry.
The Saudis have also been constrained by the huge costs to help
finance the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations are still the biggest buyers of U.S. weapons.
Last year, the United States delivered attack helicopters and a
variety of missiles to Taiwan, missiles and torpedoes to Egypt,
multiple-rocket launchers and airborne-jamming equipment to South
Korea and air-defense communications equipment to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, with $11 billion in new weapons deliveries, and
Taiwan, with $9.3 billion, were by a 10-fold factor the largest
buyers among developing nations last year, far outstripping their
nearest competitors, Egypt, Iran and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   They will soon have a new rival. In May the United Arab Emirates
announced that it would buy 80 F-16 fighters, including weapons and
support systems, a deal worth an estimated $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy on weapons sales was set by an order signed by
President Clinton in 1995, Presidential Decision Directive 34. It
says the sales are ``a legitimate instrument of U.S. foreign
policy.'' The policy makes clear that increasing the sales and
market share of U.S. arms manufacturers is a goal of U.S. foreign
policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lora Lumpe, who directs the Arms Sales Monitoring Project at the
Federation of American Scientists, said, ``This administration has
relied on armed diplomacy, weapons sales and military training,
rather than fostering regional arms control and diplomatic
initiatives to dampen or head off conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   No international arms deal has been rejected under the
directive, which evaluates sales case by case. The policy also
accepts the argument that if the United States does not sell
weapons to developing nations, others like Russia or France will
gladly fill the order.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is struggling to sign deals to obtain hard currency.
Developing nations increasingly see it as a supplier because of its
economic woes, the report says. Russia's best customers are India,
which bought 40 Russian fighter jets last year, and China, which
bought two destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Iran was a major buyer of Russian fighter jets,
bombers, tanks and submarines. But now ``Iran, primarily due to its
own economic problems, as well as U.S. pressure, most recently has
ceased to be a major purchaser of arms from Russia,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Russia delivered $2.7 billion of arms from 1990 to 1993, but
$700 million from 1994 to 1997. Iran has become more reliant on
Chinese suppliers. But China's deliveries also fell, from $1.8
billion from 1990 to 1993 to $800 million from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of all regions, the Middle East continues to have the deepest
hunger for new weapons, the report says, and the United States
continues to be its most reliable supplier. U.S. allies in the
region have received, among other weapons, 116 supersonic aircraft,
1,358 surface-to-air missiles, 1,332 tanks and self-propelled guns
and 72 helicopters in the last four years, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   But two big U.S. enemies, Libya and Iraq, have effectively been
shut out of the conventional market by sanctions, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to last year the United States signed contracts to
sell $44.1 billion of weapons to Middle Eastern nations, the report
says. France is in a position to overtake the United States as the
region's biggest arms suppliers, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is the second-biggest regional market, and Russian sales to
India, China and Vietnam have given it the biggest share of
arms-transfer agreements in the region. From 1994 to 1997, Russia
concluded $29.6 billion in agreements to Asian nations, more than
40 percent of that market.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, the United States has led the field in the
'90s. From 1990 to 1997, it delivered $53.4 billion of weapons to
the developing world, far outstripping Britain, Russia and France,
the study shows.
</P>
<P>
   The figures in the annual report for U.S. sales include just
government-approved military sales, not commercial sales of
components and spare parts. The report says government
statisticians cannot accurately compile those figures.

 &HT;    Ligtenberg doesn't fit mold, but has been unstoppable
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson and Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His are not classic closer credentials.
</P>
<P>
   You think Robb Nen is one course shy of a degree in chemical
engineering? Trevor Hoffman neither walked on at the University of
Minnesota nor attended college on a student loan. Rod Beck didn't
go undrafted, then play for a minor-league team called the Loons
and endure all-night, 26-hour bus rides through the Canadian
wilderness to pitch. Mariano Rivera wasn't traded for a bunch of
bats and balls. John Wetteland doesn't have ``90210'' sideburns.
Jeff Shaw's father didn't pressure him to abandon his baseball
dreams and take that job offer in a 3M lab.
</P>
<P>
   Only baseball's other Kerry did all that. Only Kerry Ligtenberg.
That, and reassert himself again and again whenever others doubted
him. And now look. Ladies and gentlemen, the new closer on
baseball's team of the '90s, the NL's Luke Perry Luke-alike _ Kerry
Ligtenberg?
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, Mr. October closer? Yes. Yes indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the (expletive) story of the century for me,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ``The guy's a chemical engineer coming out
of an independent league, and he's closing for a team that's won
more games than any team in the major leagues the last eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ligtenberg merely hoped to throw well enough in
Double or Triple A to get to spring training '98 as a non-roster
invitee. Then he was abruptly promoted to Atlanta last August.
``That was a dream,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I was shocked, but happy.
I thought from now on, everything I do from here on out is icing on
the cake. Nobody expected me to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Ligtenberg needs a steam-shovel-sized spatula to
spread all the icing. Ever since Mark Wohlers hurt his side, then
lost his control, Ligtenberg has not only assumed the closer's
role, he's commanded it. Since July 1, the day after Wohlers was
optioned to Richmond to rediscover the strike zone, Ligtenberg's
been lights-out.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 appearances, he's allowed just one earned run in 14 2/3
innings, an ERA of 0.61. He's converted nine straight save
opportunities (10 in a row overall), the last two coming Saturday
and Sunday against St. Louis. Ligtenberg is 16-for-18 in save
situations and has lowered his ERA from 4.16 at the end of June to
3.14. And with the July 31st trading deadline having passed without
Atlanta acquiring a reliever, Kerry's the closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hasn't he done?'' asked Cox. ``There's no criticism of
Kerry Ligtenberg. Can't be. The guy throws strikes, throws 94, 95
miles an hour, can hit the black with his slider. He's been
dynamite. The guy's a pretty well-kept secret around the league
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With his portfolio, who wouldn't be? In 1989, upon graduation
from Park High School in the Minneapolis suburb of Cottage Grove,
Ligtenberg was 6-1, 150. ``School was easy for me,'' said
Ligtenberg, who was in all advanced-placement classes in high
school. His best buddies weren't nerds, ``but nobody was into
baseball.'' When four of them _ all good math students _ decided to
attend Minnesota, Ligtenberg did, too. Only one, David Hall, made
it through the chemical engineering school rated No. 1 in the
country. ``He's into polymers,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball walk-on, Ligtenberg was told by his college pitching
coach, Rob Fornicere, that he'd never make it as a professional
pitcher. As a junior, he was 7-6, with two shutouts. His senior
season began with a trip south and three straight losses: At
Georgia Tech, where Jason Varitek beat him with a three-run homer;
at FSU, where Paul Wilson out-dueled him; and at Miami, where
Ligtenberg was shelled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he regrouped, pitching well enough to make third-team
All-Big Ten and get the Gophers into the NCAA Regionals. When
Ligtenberg wasn't drafted, though, he considered going to a
major-league tryout. But his head coach, John Anderson, advised,
``Don't do that. You have some ways to go. Why don't you go talk to
this guy Olson about playing?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Olson, the Braves' catcher from 1990-93, was then the
general manager/manager of the Minneapolis Loons of the
now-defunct, independent Prairie League. Ligtenberg auditioned for
the Loons and Olson offered him a contract: $650 a month. Norm
Ligtenberg, a chemical engineer at 3M, urged his son to consider a
3M job offer. Kerry had considered that career path until an
internship at 3M. ``I always wanted to work in a lab,'' he said,
``but when I started to, it sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   So he'd started taking management courses. When Olson offered a
$650-a-month alternative, Ligtenberg jumped at it. The caliber of
play was ``a couple of steps down from Minnesota,'' he said. The
20-man roster included one ex-major leaguer: Senor Smoke, Juan
Berenguer, a reliever on the Braves' pennant winners of 1991-92.
``But he was just fat,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Road trips were pure Prairie League, especially one bus ride to
Saskatoon after a day game in Minneapolis. ``We drove the whole 4th
of July,'' Ligtenberg said. ``We watched fireworks as we're
driving. We got stopped at (Canadian) customs.'' Finally, 26 hours
later, the Loons hit Saskatoon. ``We ended up getting to the park
at six o'clock,'' he said. ``The game was at seven. We never took
BP. We just played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg loved it, finishing 5-5. ``The first year, I wasn't
real good,'' he said. ``But I was having fun.'' When his father
again pressured him to go back to school and get his degree,
Ligtenberg went to Olson and said he needed more money to assuage
his dad. Done. A raise from $650 to $1,100. Ligtenberg remembers
pitching a no-hitter somewhere in North Dakota, in front of 50
people. By then, he was a two-pitch pitcher: A fastball that was up
to 90 mph and a slider. His changeup was ``awful.'' In the
off-season, he worked for UPS.
</P>
<P>
   After a second season of Loon-iness, Ligtenberg was invited to a
Cincinnati tryout camp. ``Don't do that,'' Olson told him. ``You
shouldn't have to. I want to get you invited to a spring-training
camp.'' In January 1996, three months after the season and since
Ligtenberg had last thrown a baseball, he went to an unheated
high-school gym one morning and threw for two Braves scouts. The
new scout wasn't impressed; the older one, Brian Kohlscheen, was. A
month after signing a contract, at $850 a month, a $250 pay cut
from the Loons, Ligtenberg went to West Palm Beach for his first
Braves' minor-league spring training camp.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Ligtenberg weighed 210 and threw in the low '90s. But
when a Class A Durham Braves coach called him aside shortly before
the last cut, he thought, ``I'm gonna get shafted.'' Nope. He had
eight saves by the All-Star break before blowing five-straight
saves in late June. But he bore down, threw 12 scoreless innings in
a row, finished with 20 saves and thought, ``I might be pretty good
at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it was important to prove all the doubters
wrong, all those who thought he wasn't any good at Minnesota. Yet
his father persisted, saying, ``You're wasting your time.'' John
Anderson, though, told Ligtenberg, ``If you quit now, you'll never
know how far you might have gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the minor-league camp in the spring of '97, Ligtenberg
was something of an enigma to Bill Fischer, the crafty,
curmudgeonly pitching coach at Richmond. ``Fisch and I really
didn't see eye to eye at first,'' he said. ``He's an old-school
guy. He liked me at first because I threw strikes, didn't walk a
lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, however, hated Ligtenberg's appearance. The Braves have
a systemwide ban on facial hair, but Ligtenberg rarely shaved and
grew a huge shock of hair and long sideburns. ``To see how far I
could take it with the manager,'' said Ligtenberg, who was not
inspired by Luke Perry on ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' ``No, I thought
that guy looked like a dork,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Ligtenberg was finally called up to Atlanta last Aug. 12
and made his first appearance in a televised game, Olson called the
next day and said, ``You've got to get a haircut.'' When Ligtenberg
sat in the barber's chair, the barber recognized him from the
sideburns. So Ligtenberg lost the long hair but kept the sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo (Mazzone, the Braves pitching coach) always says, 'You can
grow 'em as long as you pitch like that,' `` Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He's pitching with superb control (just two walks since July 1),
a splitter he learned from Bryan Harvey last season in Greenville
and an implacable sense of purpose. In his last outing in the
spring of '97, Ligtenberg walked four batters, drew Fischer's wrath
and then told off the old coach. He figures that's why he started
that season in Greenville, not Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Later that season, after being promoted to Richmond, Ligtenberg
gave up a game-losing, 13th-inning homer to Toledo, then walked off
the field and said, ``Hey, I'm fine.'' Later, he told Fischer,
``Come on, Fisch, that stuff's gonna happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, even here, Ligtenberg doesn't get flustered. ``He
always looks the same,'' Cox said. ''He looks like Fred McGriff
walking off the mound. You can't tell if he won or lost the game.
He's got the right makeup for it.''
</P>
<P>
   For closing. The toughest moment? Blowing a three-run lead five
weeks ago for Dennis Martinez, temporarily denying him a historic
242nd career win. ``I thought it was going to be easy and took it
for granted,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I overcame that. And if I can
overcome that, I can overcome about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, he already has. ``I don't think I'll ever take this
for granted,'' Ligtenberg said. ``From where I was three, four
years ago, this is about as far away as I can get.''

 &HT;    Florida's Democrats foundering
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jeb Bush's smile was as wide as the
Everglades as he worked the crowd of 250 people in a posh private
club overlooking the playground of America's upper classes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican front-runner in the Florida governor's race
wasn't addressing the rich, mostly white socialites and captains of
industry who own the oceanfront mansions of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was peppered with prominent business owners and
local politicians, but most of them happened to be black.
</P>
<P>
   Their polite _ even enthusiastic _ response to a Republican
candidate signaled the surge of another big wave in what has become
a watershed year in Florida politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the waves are crashing over the bow of the once-dominant
Florida Democratic Party, caught in a racial controversy that could
sink its campaign to hold onto its last remaining high-profile
state office: the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a headless horse,'' said University of South Florida
political scientist Susan MacManus, who tracks state politics.
``They haven't had any leadership. If they lose the governor's
chair, they've lost Florida for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   So bad is the crisis that Vice President Al Gore will jet into
the state Friday to meet with the party leadership to try to sooth
the roiled waters. Gore isn't just providing a selfless boost to a
state party in trouble: He needs Florida in 2000 for his
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' debacle began as a slow erosion in the 1980s,
when Republicans started making significant gains in voter
registration. Florida also voted Republican in several national
elections, like several other Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as 1990, the Democrats still had the upper hand,
retaining majorities in both houses of the Legislature and
controlling most county and city offices.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless Republican tide, however, finally crested in
1992, when the GOP won exactly half the seats in the state Senate.
They followed up in 1994 by taking the Senate outright, then won
the House in 1996, making Florida's the first Southern statehouse
in GOP hands since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats didn't do their homework,'' said Richard Scher,
a University of Florida political scientist who follows state
politics. ``The handwriting was on the wall in the late 1980s, but
since 1992, the collapse has been prodigious.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter registration records show the Democrats still maintain a
precarious edge over their GOP rivals, 45 percent to 40 percent.
The Democrats' tally is down from 66 percent just 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they have watched their power base erode, the party
has managed to exacerbate the crisis by alienating one of its most
loyal constituencies, African-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   In January, state Rep. Willie Logan, a black Democrat from
Opa-Locka, was in line to become the party's leader in Tallahassee.
At the last minute, Logan was deposed by 31 white Democrats who
said he hadn't raised enough money for the party and wasn't
providing the leadership they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks were outraged. In the months since the coup, Logan has
teamed up with U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, an outspoken black
Democrat from Fort Lauderdale, to create a political action
committee that is working against the white Democrats who voted
against Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have gleefully aided their cause. At one
high-profile fund-raiser this summer in Tallahassee, Republican
Party Chairman Tom Slade theatrically served lunch to Logan, then
gave his PAC $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 10 of the white Democrats who voted against Logan have
either retired from politics, switched parties or changed the
office they are seeking. The biggest casualty came last month when
State Rep. Anne Mackenzie of Fort Lauderdale, once a rising party
star who took over when Logan was ousted, suddenly retired from
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mackenzie had done no better than Logan in raising money for the
party and couldn't smooth over the crisis created by the coup. All
this has happened just as the campaign between Bush and the
presumed Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, is hitting full
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a nuclear blast,'' MacManus said of the Logan
debacle. ``It was the last straw that broke a coalition that had
been eroding for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay desperately needs black support. The most recent poll in
late July showed him trailing Bush by 22 points. He also lags
dangerously in the race to raise campaign money. As of July,
Republicans had raised $8 million to the Democrats' $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a formidable opponent. In 1994, he came within an
eyelash of defeating Lawton Chiles, one of the most popular
politicians in Florida in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, a longtime Democratic congressman from Ocala, ran for
the U.S. Senate in the late 1980s and lost to a Republican
congressman, Connie Mack. He then became Chiles' running mate and
has served two terms as lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polls, Logan's campaign to extract revenge from
his foundering party appears to be working. The July survey found
16 percent of blacks would vote for Bush _ a giant stride over the
5 percent he received in the 1994 race and clearly enough to turn
the tide in a close race. Observers say there is already a surge of
change bubbling among black voters nationally, with the traditional
unquestioning loyalty to the Democratic Party wavering. In Florida,
the Logan affair has accelerated that change and could prove a key
turning point in the history of the state's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although MacManus and Scher believe MacKay still has time to
salvage his campaign and run competitively against Bush, both say
it will take the Democrats years to recover, even if MacKay wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warning signs have been there for a long time,'' MacManus
said. ``But it has happened very quickly. It caught the old-line
Democratic leadership with their pants down.''

 &HT;    Families working on solution of switched babies
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The families of two Virginia girls who were switched in the
hospital shortly after their births in 1995 are working out an
agreement that would keep the children with the people who
currently have custody, a relative said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The switched children, Rebecca Grace Chittum and Callie Marie
Johnson, are now 3 years old. Callie has been raised in
Ruckersville, Va., by Paula Johnson. Ninety miles away in Buena
Vista, Va., Rebecca had been raised by Kevin Chittum and his
fiancee, Whitney Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Chittum and Rogers died July 4 in a traffic accident that killed
five other people. Rebecca lives with her grandmother, Rosa Lee
Chittum, who is Kevin Chittum's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Paula and my sister will work it out,'' said Mary
Watts, Callie's biological great-aunt, in a telephone interview
Monday. ``There will be no court fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What an intelligent bunch of people, if that's the way it
turns out,'' said Elizabeth McCulloch, a family law expert at the
University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said the child-switch surfaced after Paula Johnson filed a
dispute over child support and a DNA test showed Callie was not her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew anything about it,'' Watts said. Officials from
the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville showed
up in recent weeks ``to take blood from Rebecca'' for tests,
providing the first hint that something was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she doesn't want to take Rebecca from the family
that has raised her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl has already experienced so much tragedy in her three
years,'' Johnson told USA Today. ``I just wanted to know her name,
to see what she looked like and to know my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Johnson, 30, said, ``Words cannot express the
way I felt. This last month of not knowing has been agony for my
family and for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the news media have swept into Buena Vista, a
mountain town of 6,300 supported by the manufacture of space
heaters and drainage supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy. It's wild,'' said Watts, who has had reporters
from as far away as London tramping through her front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista City Attorney W.T. Robey asked reporters to give the
Chittums and others space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grandparents dearly love this child they have and they
very much want for her to stay right here where she has been loved
and raised with the only family she has ever known,'' Robey said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A picturesque community in the lap of the Shenandoah Valley, the
town barely has emerged from its mourning for Chittum and the
others killed when the car they were in hit a patch of water on
I-81 near Buena Vista and slammed head-on into a tractor-trailer
truck. Almost 800 people attended the funeral. Some people still
light candles in the windows and vigils still have been seen in the
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town has been very supportive of the family,'' said Mayor
Harold Kidd. ``The accident was very devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   At Todd's, a downtown bar and restaurant known for a laid-back
atmosphere and barbecued ribs, the tragic crash was a topic at
nearly every table. ``Almost everyone knows everyone in the area,''
said Tonia Carpenter, 34, a waitress at Todd's.
</P>
<P>
   What is not yet known is the how and why of the baby switch that
occurred three years ago at the University of Virginia Medical
Center and only served to intensify the tragedy of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an internal investigation determined the switch could not
have happened by accident, and university police are investigating
the incident as a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of their births, the girls and parents were
``banded'' with matching identification bracelets, hospital chief
of staff Thomas Massaro said in a statement. ``Banding was
documented, and the documentation was corroborated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No human enterprise can be perfect, and we are doing
everything we can to improve the process further,'' Massaro said
Monday through the hospital's media relations department.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch, the family law expert, said courts ``strongly
prefer'' natural parents in custody cases unless ``strange
circumstances'' prevail. The longer a child lives with a
non-parent, the weaker the natural-parent argument becomes,
McCulloch said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kimberly Mays, a Florida girl switched at birth
in 1978, Mays sued to ``divorce'' herself from her biological
parents. In 1993, a judge ruled in her favor. Within a year, Mays
changed her mind and moved in with her birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Rights Council in Washington, which lobbies to
``demilitarize divorce,'' urged the court to keep Mays with the
family that raised her _ a position it also takes with Callie and
Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Levy, president of the Children's Rights Council,
declared that both birth parents and adoptive parents should be
involved in raising such children. ``You can't have too many
children loving the child,'' he said.

 &HT;    HOUSE ACCEPTS BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted overwhelmingly Monday for a
bipartisan bill that could curb the flow to political parties of
the large contributions that were at the heart of many of the
scandals in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming months of delays by the Republican leadership, the
House voted 237-186 to accept the sweeping campaign-finance
overhaul co-authored by Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., and Martin
Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Their bill, which had been endorsed by the Democratic leadership
and President Clinton, had the support of 185 Democrats , 51
Republicans and one independent. The Republican leadership managed
to round up 175 Republicans and 11 Democrats to vote against. Two
Republicans and 10 Democrats missed the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters still face new struggles to defeat substitute bills
and obtain final House passage this week, and then to obtain
approval next month by the Senate, where GOP filibusters have
blocked final action on similar legislation twice within the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a generation, members of Congress take it upon
themselves to change our campaign finance laws,'' Meehan said.
``That day has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, led the assault on the bill he
described as ``unilateral disarmament'' by the Republican Party,
because it contains a ban on unregulated ``soft money'' gifts to
political parties. The bill would no longer let the parties take
contributions of any size from the treasuries of corporations or
unions, or of more than $25,000 a year from any person.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months that ended June 30, the Republican Party
reported $70 million and the Democratic Party reported $45.8
million in soft money receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., took exception to DeLay's description
of the bill as ``unilateral disarmament'' by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, this bill is as fair to Republicans as it is to
Democrats. It's the same to Wall Street as to the labor unions.
It's the same to the Christian Coalition as to the ACLU,'' Zach
said. ``Isn't that fair?''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay grumbled that he was unable to prevent votes for the
Shays-Meehan bill by Republicans seeking to please newspaper
editorial writers in their districts. He said the members told him,
``Since the Senate will never support the bill, they can afford to
vote yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., doesn't plan to schedule a
vote on the bill when the Senate reconvenes in September for the
final month of this session of Congress. Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., whose version of the bill
was blocked by a GOP filibuster earlier this year, said the wide
victory margin in the House would help their plans to try again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   They can offer the bill as an amendment or hold up action on
other vital legislation in an attempt to change Lott's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``No side can get 60 votes,'' which would be enough to end a
filibuster in the 100-member Senate, Lott's spokesman, John
Czwartacki (CQ), said. ``It would be a big waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters said they rescued the bill from similar
death threats many times in the past. In addition to forcing House
GOP leaders to keep their promises to allow votes on the
Shays-Meehan bill, they defeated 15 ``poison pill'' amendments that
they believed would have weakened the bill too much or made it too
strong to pass by such a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to banning soft money, the Shays-Meehan bill would
tighten regulations for pre-election ads and financial disclosures,
and would create a nonpartisan commission to recommend further
reforms to the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all probability, the (Supreme) Court will hold parts of the
bill unconstitutional,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif. A leading
opponent of Shays-Meehan, he asked House members to vote by an even
larger margin later this week for a milder bipartisan substitute
sponsored by a group of freshman members.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan supporters will fight hard against that.
</P>
<P>
   After the nine remaining substitutes for the Shays-Meehan bill
are withdrawn or voted upon, only the version with the most votes
will be presented to the House for final passage. That final action
will take place before the House adjourns Friday for its month-long
summer vacation, promised Majority Leader Richard K. Armey,
R-Texas.

 &HT;    GM workers put in a full day, plus some OT
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DORAVILLE, Ga. _ General Motors is starting to make up for lost
time.
</P>
<P>
   As the first shift in more than six weeks ended Monday, workers
rolled out of General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant after a full
workday, plus an hour of overtime. Most said morale inside was high
after settlement of strikes in Flint, Mich., that forced layoffs at
Doraville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said Kelvin Dennis, who spent his
time away from the plant fishing and taking vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is the same, and we're glad to be back,'' said Toni
Kemp, a 21-year GM veteran.
</P>
<P>
   All 4,000 workers were sent home in June after the plant ran out
of parts because of strikes by United Auto Workers at two parts
plants on June 5. GM and the UAW came to an agreement last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt really great to be in there,'' said Gary Christian.
``Six weeks without a paycheck isn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers and plant management headed back last week to
prepare for Monday's 6 a.m. start.
</P>
<P>
   The next few days will be spent heating up paint ovens, turning
on machines and making sure no problems occur before they start
churning out the Chevrolet Ventures, Oldsmobile Silhouettes,
Pontiac Trans Sports and Opel Sintras, said GM spokeswoman Marsha
Hall Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to start up in a controlled manner, from a quality
standpoint,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It will only be a matter of days before the plant is operating
at capacity, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Workers likely will have nine-hour days and overtime on
Saturdays for the rest of the year. Schedules are determined
weekly, however, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to try and make up for production losses,''
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike idled more than 190,000 workers at 27 of GM's 29
North American assembly plants and cost the world's No. 1 automaker
an estimated $2.2 billion in profits.

WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES FIGHT TO BLOCK LINDSEY TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House announced plans Monday to continue
efforts to block prosecutors from questioning President Clinton's
longtime confidant Bruce Lindsey about an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   As aides brushed aside talk of a nationally televised mea culpa
by the president, his lawyers prepared to ask the Supreme Court to
decide whether the attorney-client privilege shields Lindsey, a
deputy White House counsel, from questions about his conversations
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers asked a federal appeals court Monday to
issue a stay that would prevent Lindsey from being summoned before
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's grand jury until the nation's
high court decides whether to get involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a three-judge appeals panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the White
House argument that Lindsey was shielded from testifying. The panel
upheld a lower court order for Lindsey to answer prosecutors'
questions about the president's relationship with former intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, whose friendship with the president dates back to the
beginning of his political career in Arkansas 30 years ago, has
unmatched knowledge of Clinton's activities in Little Rock and
Washington. Among Lindsey's assignments is defending Clinton
against allegations involving women.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff issued a statement Monday
saying that a review by the Supreme Court is needed ``because of
the importance of this principle for this and future presidents, as
well as the executive branch'' of government.
</P>
<P>
   If the courts agree, Lindsey's testimony would be postponed at
least until the Supreme Court begins its next term in October.
</P>
<P>
   The justices previously refused to consider an appeal of a
similar ruling from the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which held that government lawyers cannot hide behind the
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who was appointed four years ago to investigate Clinton's
business dealings in Arkansas, broadened his inquiry in January to
include whether the president lied under oath and urged others to
lie in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton testified that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. The former White House intern issued a
similar denial under oath, but last week reportedly reversed course
and told Starr's deputies _ after she was promised immunity from
prosecution _ that they did engage in sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has agreed to testify Aug. 17 via
closed-circuit television before Starr's grand jury, which puts him
in a position of recanting his earlier denial or contradicting
Lewinsky's most recent description of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, presidential aides dismissed talk of Clinton changing
his story, insisting such discussion implies that Clinton lied
under oath early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton would continue to maintain that he had no
sexual relationship with Lewinsky, White House spokesman Barry Toiv
told reporters that the president ``told you that he is going to
testify truthfully ... he's already spoken to that.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about whether Clinton's version is the truth, Toiv
replied that he is ``not in a position to tell you what the
president's testimony is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that he has said that he has
told the truth, and that he will continue to tell the truth,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Starr's prosecutors interviewed Lewinsky in
preparation for her appearance _ possibly late this week _ before
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FBI is expected in the next week to determine
whether a stain found on a blue cocktail dress turned over to Starr
by Lewinsky contains DNA material indicating any sexual contact
with the president. Lewinsky told prosecutors she wore the dress
during a sexual encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's press briefing, Toiv was repeatedly hit with
questions about whether the president has provided investigators
with DNA samples to compare with any material found on the dress or
whether Starr had requested DNA samples from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I'm aware of,'' Toiv said, referring questions to
Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, who did not respond to
telephone inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a
sealed ruling Monday that reportedly permits U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson to proceed with a hearing to determine if
Starr improperly leaked grand jury evidence, which is prohibited by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Unnamed sources cited by The Associated Press and CNN said the
ruling addressed Starr's concerns that evidence crucial to his
investigation of the president might be obtained by Clinton's
private lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The legal sources said the court ruled the leaks investigation
could proceed but that any evidence should be turned over to
Johnson, who is overseeing the grand jury investigating the
Clinton-Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has accused Starr of illegal leaks and requested that
the prosecutor be sanctioned for contempt of court. Starr's office
has denied releasing any information improperly.

ATLAS HOLDS UP HOLING 100
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK HIPES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a healthy dose of retrospection, Larry Atlas
figures he could have played more golf. Under the circumstances,
that is saying a mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, armed with a bag of clubs, a few boxes of balls and
good soles in his spikes, the Woodley Lakes golf pro played 100
holes at his home course for charity as part of the PGA's National
Golf Day.
</P>
<P>
   In a little over seven hours, Atlas and assistant pro Brady
Riggs raised $5,000 for L.A.'s junior golf program, which promotes
the game to the growing number of children flocking to neighborhood
courses to become the next Tiger Woods or Annika Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've played a little faster,'' admitted the 36-year old
Atlas, a former hockey player who took up golf just 12 years ago.
``There was a point there when we started hitting it sideways and
we spent time looking for balls. There seems to be a wall somewhere
around 80 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall or no, the twosome's money total was tops in the section,
and the Southern California Professional Golf Association raised
$65,000 of the nearly $500,000 national total, the best mark of any
area PGA.
</P>
<P>
   The money has helped Woodley Lakes form a Junior Club, which
began less than a year ago and already has 50 members. They are
considered the future of golf _ counted on to keep pace with the
booming industry that until the past 20 years was reserved for
retirees and members of the social elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real explosion (in junior golf) the last couple
of years,'' said Woodley Lakes assistant pro Ken Fletcher, who has
seen much from his post at the course pro shop. ``In the past, it's
been more football and basketball, but now this has become a
big-money sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a notion grasped early on by Atlas, who grew up in New
York with a hockey stick in his hand rather than a 6-iron. He first
read about the charity golf event three years ago in a PGA
publication. In 1996, he participated in his first 100-hole day.
Since then, he figures, he's raised $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put together a travel team, gotten them T-shirts and
balls, and we're able to sponsor kids that can't necessarily afford
to play,'' Atlas said. ``We think it's all pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DAY
</P>
<P>
   The day started for Atlas and Riggs at 7 a.m. with the first
drive. On a cart, they screamed through the course, stopping just
long enough to point themselves in the general direction of the cup
before firing away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way you'd earn a tour card, but in a way it
teaches you not to be a Swiss watch on the course,'' Atlas said.
``You learn to stay focused for a long period of time. To be
honest, it's a good way to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The twosome would play so quickly they would pass up groups that
started in front of them. By the second time through, most on the
course got wind of what was going on and began cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `Keep going, you're doing a great job,'''
Atlas remembered. ``The fifth man in the foursome.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing that fast suited Atlas, who shot a tidy 408 and had two
rounds _ a 69 and a 71 _ under par. It was only the last 10 holes,
when he shot a 44, that he started feeling the burn.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs, 30, himself a product of the junior golf program while
growing up in Burbank, shot a 412.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are really into the program,'' Fletcher said.
``They really hustle to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, with temperatures reaching the 90s by early
afternoon, Atlas hustled so much he didn't even stop for a bathroom
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, it does test your intestinal fortitude and your
love for the game,'' he said. ``The cause gets you out of bed in
the morning, but it's the perseverance that tells you to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, to the benefit of all, he did.

 &HT;    Falcons notebook
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second Monday in a row, you needed a roster to
keep up with moves on the Atlanta Falcons' offseason line, as
several players were moved around, some because of an injury to
starting right tackle Corey Louchiey, and others by plan.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, in fact, caused coach Dan Reeves to scrap morning
practice as the team went just once, at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey pulled a groin in the afternoon scrimmage Saturday in
Jacksonville, and Reeves said he might not play in Friday night's
preseason opener against Tennessee in the Georgia Dome. Backup left
tackle Nate Miller was moved to Louchiey's spot with the No. 1
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Other moves: backup rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam moved to
No. 2 left tackle; No. 2 rookie right guard Bob Hallen was moved to
No. 2 left guard; No. 3 rookie right tackle Jose Portilla moved to
No. 2 right tackle, and No. 2 left guard Scott Adams moved to No. 2
right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey was one of six players who did not practice, and one of
10 on the injury report. His injury is significant. The Falcons
struggled at that spot last season, chiefly with departed Tim
Willig, and when Louchiey was signed as a free agent after starting
13 games in three seasons in Buffalo, he was inserted as the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam was backing him up, but since he and Portilla are
rookies, Reeves said the move of Miller to right tackle gives the
Falcons a veteran at that spot. He also said the Falcons had
planned on Salaam and Portilla working both sides, as any reserve
lineman will need to play multiple positions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was an undrafted free agent defensive tackle out of LSU
in 1995. He spent most of '95 and most of '96 on the practice
squad. He did not dress for the first three games last season, and
saw limited reserve duty the final 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Louchiey on the sidelines were backup CB Randy Fuller
(ankle), starting CB Ronnie Bradford (hamstring), backup LBs David
Brandon (foot arch) and Ruffin Hamilton (hamstring), and DE Barry
Mitchell (groin). It was the first practice missed for Brandon and
Hamilton, and the ninth straight for Mitchell, a member of last
year's practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had six or eight guys who couldn't go this morning, and we
thought some of them might go this afternoon,'' Reeves said. ''We
were a little short with secondary receivers, and at cornerback.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Keith Crawford, who missed four straight practices with
a hamstring, was able to practice, as was receiver Mercury Hayes,
who missed the afternoon scrimmage in Jacksonville. Also, rookie
cornerback Elijah Williams, who sprained an ankle Saturday morning
in Jacksonville, was able to go Monday. Fuller (10 practices
missed) and Bradford (nine) both looked a lot better, running
during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the injury report from Monday: DT Mark Campbell (knee
sprain), G Jeremy Akers (shoulder, elbow), LG Calvin Collins
(wrist) and Hayes (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Reeves wasn't sure whether the team would practice once or twice
today, but the Falcons almost surely will practice just once
Wednesday and once Thursday. Should there be two practices today,
they'll likely be at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. It's possible Thursday's
practice will be at the Dome, a sort of walk-through prior to
Friday's preseason opener. Coaches may also experiment on the
sidelines with headsets. This will be the first year the NFL is
using wireless communications systems, although coaches will have
the option of using the old system. Today, it's possible the
Falcons will stage a full-go, tackling-included drill for just the
second time in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Turning down the heat
</P>
<P>
   It was more like late October Monday, as it was a 82 degrees
with 50 percent humidity. It was obvious after practice it had been
cooler because just a handful of players got in ice barrels to cool
down their legs. Normally, there's a waiting line.
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler - Threw in drills and worked with the No. 1
offense ''red zone'' drills and regular 11-on-11 sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani -- Ditto, except with the No. 2 offense. Also had
holding dutes with placekickers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg -- Ditto, except with the No. 3 offense. Also had
holding duties with placekickers. Took some snaps with the No. 1
and No. 2 offenses in 9-on-7 running game sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan -- Threw in drills, and took some snaps with the
No. 1 and No. 2 offenses in 9-on-7 running game sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad, and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: In full-go field goal drills, reserve cornerback Juran
Bolden blocked a 35-yard attempt by backup kicker David Akers. He
knifed through on the right side, squeezing between outside man Ed
Smith and end Travis Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: Starting cornerback Ray Buchanan got beat deep down the
middle by rookie free agent receiver Octavus Barnes in one-on-one
passing drills. Buchanan ran him down about 30 yards later and
tackled him.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: In the 11-on-11 session, Chandler rolled out right under a
heavy rush and threw a perfect 21-yard pass to Terance Mathis near
the right sideline. Mathis dropped it, screaming in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's confidence. We went down to another training
camp, and beat up on a good team like Jacksonville (in a pair of
Saturday scrimmages). We're beat up, but it was pretty obvious.
That's an 'A-line,' and people say they got a chance to win the
Super Bowl, but we banged them up and that's a fact. You can say
what you want, and in a game situation things (ITAL might (END ITAL
be different, but that was a good confidence-booster for a lot of
guys.'' _ Defensive end Chuck Smith, when asked to explain the
general good mood players seemed to be in Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   Falcons video director Tom Atcheson and his crew usually
generate about 80 tapes per practice. Many of these are copies, as
every coach gets a copy of nearly every drill. At every practice,
there are cameras on two mobile, three-story towers, and a
hand-held unit used for placekicking. Each drill is on a seperate
tape, and most of the tapes are re-used a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   What about next year?
</P>
<P>
   Coaches from Middle Georgia College, which is among parties
interested in playing host to Falcons training camp next year if
construction in Suwanee mandates a move, were at practice. The
group included head coach/athletics director Randy Pippin, whose
proposal is in the Falcons' hands of Falcons. Furman officials, who
also are interested in having camp on their Greenville, S.C.
campus, may attend a practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   The first kickoff team worked half-speed on staying in lanes.
That unit, from left to right, was CB Michael Booker, CB Lenny
McGill, LB Craig Sauer, S Chris Bayne, CB Juran Bolden, RB Gary
Downs, LB Ben Talley, LB Eddie Sutter, S Devin Bush, and FB Bob
Christian. Later, kicker Morten Andersen hit two onsides kicks,
each bouncing more than 30 feet in the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scene I: Late afternoon, offices of a large Manhattan law firm.
Stanley Bojarski, a tall, animated man, hunches over a computer
terminal. He wears a gray pinstripe suit, retro-ish geometric tie,
black tasseled loafers. At his right elbow is a stack of papers,
legal briefs or depositions, which he periodically leafs through.
</P>
<P>
   Scene II: Some hours later, a 199-seat West Side theater. A
mermaid in a blue wig and bosomy nude fishtailed body-mold cavorts
onstage, to crowd guffaws. It is ... Stanley Bojarski!
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Such is the bipolar life of Bojarski, legal assistant
by day, actor and comic female impersonator by night.
</P>
<P>
   By juggling a so-called survival job at the sedate midtown
offices of Dewey Ballantine with a prime role in the exuberantly
gay-themed musical revue ``Howard Crabtree's When Pigs Fly'' on
West 42nd Street, Bojarski is doing what actors have long done to
eat and pay the rent. There are countless Stanley Bojarskis off and
on Broadway waiting tables, modeling, driving taxicabs, painting
apartments and spraying cologne on shoppers in Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, have their feet planted in two such contrasting
worlds. T.S. Eliot was a bank clerk. Wallace Stevens and Charles
Ives sold insurance. But they, so far as is known, did not perform
in drag after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Bojarski, 48, spends his days sorting through lawsuit papers of
Ciba-Geigy vs. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., and his nights vamping
onstage in dresses, high heels and outlandish costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The campy roles were created for him by Crabtree, an acclaimed
designer who died of AIDS in 1996, shortly after finishing work on
the hit show, now winding up a near-record two-year run.
</P>
<P>
   (The title of the revue is taken from a school counselor's dire
prediction that young Howard would make something of himself ``when
pigs fly.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Gemini _ it's a perfect situation,'' Bojarski said the
other day in a running interview that began in his cubicle at work
and wound up in front of a makeup mirror in his cluttered backstage
dressing room at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Another cast member in ``When Pigs Fly,'' James Heatherly,
undergoes a similar daily transformation, from a business-suited
preparer of client presentations in the private banking division of
Republic National Bank to extravagantly costumed women, Cupid and a
smitten gay lover singing satiric torch songs to conservative icons
like House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Strom Thurmond and radio
commentator Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my day job, this is my real job,'' said Heatherly,
sitting in the darkened theater before his nightly metamorphosis.
``This is what I care about, this is what my passion is.'' He said
his bosses at the bank were culture-minded and understanding of his
complicated schedule, allowing him now, for example, to take some
time off for the final weeks of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Some jobs that actors juggle are more of a stretch than others.
Terry Richmond, who performs in the ensemble of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' on Broadway, holds yoga classes for her fellow actors
at $5 a session. Another cast member, Bill Bowers, teaches
pantomime to colleagues and children with physical and learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Liz McConahay, on leave from the cabaret revue ``Secrets Every
Smart Traveler Should Know,'' is a dog walker.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Garner, an aspiring actor from Kansas who performs
stand-up in drag at ``The Web,'' a gay cabaret in midtown, is an
assistant publicist promoting shows for the theatrical publicity
agency Boneau/Bryan-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most encyclopedic inventory of an actor's survival
jobs was provided by Claudia Shear in her 1994 one-woman Off
Broadway show ``Blown Sideways Through Life,'' which chronicled the
64 jobs that took her from an artist's modeling studio to Bear
Stearns to the telephone reception desk of an East Side brothel.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bojarski fell into his law firm job between stage roles. Growing
up in Fonda, N.Y., west of Albany, where his parents owned a
restaurant, he acted in amateur productions and majored in
literature at Marist College in Poughkeepsie. He performed in
musicals in dinner theaters and summer stock, toured with road
companies of ``Annie'' and ``Me and My Girl'' and played in ``West
Side Story'' in Berlin. He also had a prime role in Crabtree's
earlier show, ``Whoop-Dee-Doo!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, looking for steady work between parts, he applied to a
temporary employment agency, Career Blazers. He was placed at Dewey
Ballantine on a team of legal assistants helping prepare for the
civil trial of a lawsuit brought by the firm's client, Ciba-Geigy,
against its insurance company, Liberty Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, meanwhile, was writing prime parts for Bojarski into
his new musical ``When Pigs Fly.'' The show opened in August 1996,
with Bojarski playing multiple roles, among them the Queen of
Diamonds; a sailor-suited, dippy suburban arts presenter, Carol Ann
Knippel of the Melody Barn (pronounced ``Bern''); a garden supplier
(one of the jobs the school counselor suggested for Crabtree) with
the sassiness of a streetwalker and a grotesquely bewigged
18th-century courtesan whose gown is her entire vanity table.
</P>
<P>
   But Bojarski had one condition. ``I was not going to jeopardize
my day job,'' he said. ``It's nice when you're 22, you can call
Mommy and Daddy. Not when you're in your 40s.'' Accordingly, the
show schedule took his law firm routine into account.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical recent weekday, Bojarski worked on his legal papers
at his desk until just after 5:30 p.m. Then, with a cheerful
``g'night'' to his co-workers, answered by a chorus of ``good
night, Stanley,'' he clicked off his computer and headed out.
</P>
<P>
   He passed his project manager, Douglas Briggs, who praised
Bojarski's work and said his unusual schedule ``probably keeps him
happy in some strange way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooh,'' said Bojarski, beaming, ``I'm asking for a raise
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his associates at Dewey Ballantine have been to the
show, which is closing on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Walking toward the theater, he said he could feel the burdens of
his law work dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk out that door and that all gets shed away,'' he said.
``You can't take it with you.''
</P>
<P>
   En route, he stopped at a deli. ``I get something to eat for
after my nap,'' he said, adding, ``Ugh, it sounds so pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He emerged with a small bag. ``Tonight's chicken, tomorrow's
pizza,'' he said. ``You got to vary it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the theater he went backstage, took off his suit, changed
into a black robe and sequestered himself for an hour's restorative
nap. When he got up, he ate his chicken sandwich and began applying
his makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Heatherly, meanwhile, had arrived from his job. A former boy
soprano from Tennessee, he grew up around the country following the
postings of his father, a Secret Service agent. He came to New York
at 25 in 1991, with a degree in musical theater from West Texas
State University in Canyon. That qualified him to be a proofreader
in a publishing house, manager of a restaurant at the Bridgehampton
Tennis and Surf Club, telephone receptionist for a construction
company and now a banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good about letting me take time off,'' he said. ``They
hired me knowing I had a life on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner, 21, the actor who works days as a theatrical publicist,
has found a creative way to stretch his dollars. By traveling from
his apartment in Brooklyn to his engagements in drag, he said, he
is sometimes not charged by taxi drivers. ``They think they're
taking a beautiful blonde,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bojarski said actors were often compelled to dwell in two
separate worlds. ``I live two lives,'' he said. But he has no doubt
where he belonged, he said. ``The real me is what you see
onstage.''

NEW YORK CITY SEX INDUSTRY STRAINS TO COMPLY WITH NEW LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By DAN BARRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bang of hammers and the buzz of power drills
muffled the come-hither cooing of the women working at Show World
on Monday, as the flagship for New York City's sex industry
frantically sought to strike a balance of compliance under a city
government no longer tolerant of its brand of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Miniature Statues of Liberty, not rubber sex toys and leather
handcuffs, now fill the ground-floor display cases, while the Big
Top Theater upstairs offers old movies, not nude entertainment.
Such recent changes were enough to convince a Supreme Court judge
Monday to block, at least for a few days, the city's plan to
padlock the sex emporium.
</P>
<P>
   The on-going renovations do not reflect any Saul-like conversion
by Show World's owner, Richard Basciano, a reclusive businessman
who lives in an apartment above his empire of sexual illusion, on
the corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue. Instead, they are
Basciano's way of complying with a new zoning law that prohibits
establishments in restricted areas from having more than 40 percent
of their inventories dedicated to sex.
</P>
<P>
   Now at Show World, customers can buy a New York Police
Department souvenir T-shirt, watch a pornographic video in a
peep-show booth, catch the Cary Grant film playing upstairs, shoot
some pool, then spend $15 and more to peer through Plexiglas to
watch a woman remove all her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Judge Stephen Crane cited these changes
Monday in denying the city's motion to close Show World, saying
that the renovations had sufficiently complicated the matter of its
compliance to require another hearing, scheduled for Thursday.
Judge Crane also declined to permit the closing of three other
Manhattan businesses and reserved judgment on a fourth, but allowed
the city to shut down the Harmony Theater in lower Manhattan last
night.
</P>
<P>
   After the court hearing, Herald Price Fahringer, the attorney
representing businesses, expressed confidence that Show World would
remain open, saying that only 33 percent of its floor space is set
aside for the sex business. But Steven Fishner, Giuliani's criminal
justice coordinator, disagreed; he predicted the city would
demonstrate that Show World is a threat to the public welfare that
needs to be padlocked immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The city argues that Show World is within 500 feet of both a
school and the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Cross, and
therefore is in violation of a new zoning law that prohibits sex
shops from operating near places of worship, residences, schools,
day-care centers and each other. During Monday's court hearing, the
city's lawyers introduced the affidavits of inspectors to support
their argument that Show World continues to violate the law,
renovations notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Those affidavits reflect the change in what is considered
acceptable behavior during the tenure of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, as
well as the city's determination to shut down establishments like
Show World through vigorous enforcement of the new law. During one
week in late July, five inspectors paid a total of six visits to
Show World.
</P>
<P>
   One inspector, Raymond Dowd, visited Show World on two
consecutive nights, dropping tokens in 10 different video booths.
In his affidavit he employed the exact language of the zoning law
to report having seen ``specified sexual activities'' and the
exposure of ``specified anatomical areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inspector, Srigiajaharan Chellah, bought $3 worth of
tokens at Show World. He visited the peep-show booths and watched
eight pornographic videos, each one lasting a minute, each one
costing a quarter. He then went into the lounge and, his affidavit
said, watched ``one (1) female performer on the stage, dressed in a
bikini suit, and dancing to pre-recorded music.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors estimated that as much as 90 percent of Show
World's floor space was dedicated to adult entertainment, although
these estimates were based on measurements by eye, not by tape.
None reported seeing live nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these inspectors were markedly different from
those who ventured into the Harmony Theatre, an establishment at
279 Church St. Those city employees reported seeing mutual groping
between naked women and male customers; one inspector said, simply:
``I observed one female who appeared to be having sexual
intercourse with one of the male patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports like these offended Tom Simmons, the property manager
for the Show World Organization. ``To have Show World lumped
together with some of these other establishments is,'' he said,
struggling for a moment to find the appropriate word, ``really
insulting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such sentiments arise from a prevalent attitude at Show World
that it is somehow superior to other peep shows and sex shops. For
a quarter-century it has stood like a gaudy fortress across from
the Port Authority, withstanding occasional attacks from community
groups, thwarting city inspectors with diligent health code
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Basciano, who is believed to be in his early 70s, used to have
several partners, including one man, Robert DiBernardo, who was
murdered by the Mafia several years ago for offending John Gotti.
Now he operates alone, employees say, aware of the great value of
his real estate, but determined to fight Giuliani in the name of
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   `` Basciano's concerns here are over the consitutional rights
that he fought for in both theaters of World War II,'' Simmons
said. ``How far are they going to take this law? Is the Shubert
Theatre next, with `Chicago?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the sex industry's fight over the legality of the city's new
zoning law has been all but lost. After three years of court
arguments and appeals, the industry's dim hopes now rest with the
U.S. Supreme Court, which is unlikely to overturn the law. In the
meantime, Basciano has decided to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   He has preserved the curious circus motif that includes clown
heads and merry-go-round horses, as well as the stairwell that
includes a different flashing sign on each step: ``private
booths''; ``nude dancing;'' ``safe and clean.'' But gone are the
barkers who once stood at the theater's portals, urging passersby
to check out the show; the posters of scantily dressed women; the
advertisement depicting a man with tophat and cane and announcing
that couples were welcome.

THREE YEARS AFTER SISTER'S DEATH, SIBLINGS LANGUISH IN FOSTER
CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The five children watched helplessly as their parents
forced their sister, Elisa Izquierdo, to drink ammonia and eat her
own feces. They looked on as their parents sexually assaulted her
and beat her until the white bones gleamed through her brown
fingers. The children survived the violence that killed Elisa, but
they landed in foster care with shattered lives and damaged
psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Child welfare officials, who investigated 6-year-old Elisa's
death in November 1995, suggested that the city sever ties between
the abusive parents and their surviving children, and have the
children adopted so they could begin to recover from the severe
psychological trauma in stable, nurturing homes.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three years after Elisa's death, her mother,
imprisoned for the killing, still retains the legal rights to her
five surviving children, who are 5 to 13 years old. Four of the
five siblings have bounced through more than four foster homes as
city officials have fallen months behind their own timetable in
setting the children on the road to adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Elisa Izquierdo became a national symbol of all that
was wrong with child welfare in New York City, exposing the sloppy
investigations that allowed her to suffer and die while under the
city's watch. And in some ways, her siblings' long journey through
the child welfare system highlights a less sensational but far more
common problem: the experience of thousands of children who
languish in foster care for years without finding permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the median stay in foster care has declined from four
years to three years since 1996, which both city officials and
advocates for children say is still too long for many children to
wait for stability. The city wants to reduce it even further, to
below 2.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Elisa's siblings also reflects the legal and
bureaucratic barriers that often prevent child welfare officials
from quickly severing the bonds between parents and their children,
even when a parent has killed a child.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, officials had to wait 12 months before starting
the court process to terminate the parental rights of Awilda Lopez,
Elisa's mother, and Carlos Lopez, her stepfather. Laws protecting
the rights of parents are so strong that the waiting period was
necessary even though Ms. Lopez had pleaded guilty to murder and
Mr. Lopez was serving a sentence for attempted assault.
</P>
<P>
   After that, child welfare officials had to prove to a judge that
the couple had also abused the surviving children, in a trial that
took several months. Even after a formal finding of abuse was
granted, it took 11 months for the city's office of Family Court
Mental Health Services to complete the psychological evaluations
needed to prove the children should never be returned to the
Lopezes, child welfare officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, finding foster parents capable of coping with the
psychologically damaged children was difficult. Less than 10
percent of all child welfare cases involve abuse, and many foster
parents were unprepared for Elisa's siblings, who had been exposed
to such extraordinary violence.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the needs of the traumatized siblings, some
foster parents simply gave up on the children, saying they could no
longer care for them, city officials familiar with the case said.
As a result, the four youngest children, who are still struggling
to erase the painful memories of the torture they witnessed, found
themselves forced to move over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only the three youngest siblings, who are 5, 6 and 7,
live together. The older children, 12 and 13, live in separate
homes, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the children say the obstacles to finding
permanent homes for children who have lived through extreme abuse
are so great that they do not blame child welfare officials for the
lack of stability in the siblings' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were any other case, I would be arguing that the
system was working too slowly,'' said Ronald E. Richter, the deputy
director of the Manhattan office of Legal Aid's Juvenile Rights
Division, which represents the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe that the system has failed these
children,'' said Mr. Richter, who declined to discuss the details
of the case or the lives of the children he represents. ``I believe
the system has responded as well as it can to these children with
extraordinary needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richter declined to describe the homes or the permanency
plans for the children, saying only that the siblings are safe and
happy in their current foster homes. But unfortunately, he said, in
the quest for stability, even explainable, understandable delays
often wreak havoc in children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Besharov, a child welfare specialist who investigated
Elisa's death as a member of the city's child fatality panel and
pushed for her siblings' adoption, said he fears that their
unstable lives in foster care may ultimately have a devastating
impact on their psychological and social development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of permanency is the biggest threat to the welfare
and the safety of foster children,'' Mr. Besharov said. ``Temporary
and haphazard placements hurt children. Their emotional and
physical situations deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective ought to be to halt the emotional and physical
deterioration of abused and neglected children,'' he said. ``But
for too many children coming in contact with New York City's child
welfare system, the system doesn't arrest their downward spiral. It
sometimes accelerates it.''

   MILWAUKEE _ You can't mentor troubled children without also
helping their parents because children always return home,
heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield told a group of
governors Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success starts at home,'' Holyfield said. ``Everything starts
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, a three-time heavyweight champion and the youngest of
nine children, spoke about fatherhood to the National Governors'
Association Committee on Human Resources, where he and governors
spent the morning discussing how states can promote programs that
emphasize responsible fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   According to NGA figures, four out of 10 children in the United
States are not living in the same home as their biological father,
and nearly half of all children being raised in mother-headed
families are living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   During the committee meeting, governors outlined ways their
states are helping men learn parenting skills through mentoring
programs and other initiatives. Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said
one of the most difficult hurdles such programs face is finding
mentors who will work with children long enough that children don't
feel abandoned when the mentor moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, the father of eight children ages ``14 on down,''
said a program he backs in Atlanta encourages mentors to teach
children how to be independent and make the right choices for
themselves. Mentors must make it clear to children that they are
giving them information, and how they use that information is up to
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also said he would like to see fatherhood classes
taught in schools. ``They teach people how to get a job but not how
to raise a family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said too many children today grow up without fathers or male
role models to show them how to raise children properly. They also
aren't taught how to control their aggression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told a group of teen boys heading to prison who
thought he was ``real bad'' that he was actually good because he
only uses his aggression in a boxing ring. He said children don't
know how to deal with their aggression productively and respect
others because they simply aren't trained.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, he said, parents just aren't around. There are
plenty of kids today wearing ``a $150 pair of tennis shoes who are
still upset'' because their parents give them money but don't give
of themselves, Holyfield said. ``It's not the money that solves the
problems, it's time.''

NATO APPROVES PLANS FOR MILITARY ACTION IN KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also YUGO-KOSOVO) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States announced Monday that NATO has
approved plans for the use of military force in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was intended to push President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to end the current offensive against ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has now approved a range of contingency plans for the use
of military force in this regard,'' the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, said Monday, after American diplomats in the region
said that Kosovo is ``on the edge of a humanitarian catastrophe.''
Those plans are now being further refined, Rubin said, and ``we
expect that work to be done very, very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last week, the North Atlantic Council, which
consists of NATO member representatives, approved a set of options
that are being turned into detailed military plans, so that NATO
forces can act quickly, if required, senior American and
NATO-country officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The planning centers on air-power options, the officials said,
rather than ground troops. NATO military planners have been asked
to draw up a range of more limited targets for air strikes. The
idea, one official said, is to make the potential use of force more
realistic by keeping it more limited, and reducing the political
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean we're closer to bombing Serbia Monday than
we were a week ago,'' one NATO-country diplomat said. ``But if
Milosevic thinks he can get away with a high level of violence
because NATO would only react to extreme violence, then NATO's
ability to respond to different circumstances will be more subtle
and refined.''
</P>
<P>
   No official would discuss what actions by Milosevic would
trigger NATO military force. Serbia is one of two republics that
remain in Yugoslavia, and Milosevic was previously the Serbian
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Any use of force would require a separate political decision by
NATO countries, some of which have said they would prefer U.N.
Security Council authorization first. While not a member of NATO,
Russia has said it would veto any such authorization. Washington
says NATO has legal authority to use force, if necessary, without
any further U.N. action.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the United States, the European Union and NATO all
demanded a cease-fire in Kosovo as weekend fighting forced as many
as 30,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes in the face of
government attacks on their villages. As many as 180,000 people
have been displaced since February, said officials of the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees, in a province of about 2 million people
that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the Serbs said that their offensive against the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian rebel group, and its
supporters was over. ``Their claims,'' said Rubin, ``are obviously
nonsense,'' describing significant military operations in at least
three areas of Kosovo over the weekend, with the fiercest fighting
in the Decani/Dakovica area, including tanks and artillery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since late May, NATO has been drawing up a series of military
options for the Kosovo situation and warning Milosevic of those
plans. In mid-June NATO fighter jets staged a fly-by over the
warring forces in Kosovo, as an aerial show of force to convince
Milosevic to stop the fighting or suffer the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rebels gained ground over the last several weeks,
NATO officials signaled that they were reluctant to use military
force because that could further help the rebels in their efforts
to win independence from Serbia, which the West does not support.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the government launched a major new
offensive, and NATO planners have been trying to keep up with the
changing situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's NATO decision moves beyond general planning of
options _ a land deployment here, or a set of air strikes there _
to detailed work on how certain options would actually be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's comments Monday were designed, officials said, to show
Milosevic the potential cost of defying Western opinion and
humanitarian standards in his campaign against the rebel group and
the civilian sea in which the insurgency swims. ``It is a reminder,
and Milosevic is a person who needs reminding, who often seems to
act against his own interests,'' a senior American official said.
</P>
<P>
   The West has been frustrated by Milosevic's pattern of using
just enough force to test Western patience, but then to back off
before prompting military intervention. More limited air options,
another official said, would mean ``the threshold for using force
is also lowered,'' presumably making American and NATO threats to
use force more meaningful to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said that
military options remained on the table and warned Milosevic not to
engage in ``a wanton exercise of power against innocent
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other military options are going ahead with scheduled
military exercises in Macedonia and Albania under the Partnership
for Peace program, and using ground forces in Kosovo itself, to
save lives or to insure a cease-fire or negotiated settlement, if
one can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the early idea of sending troops to Kosovo's borders, which
was a response to fears that the violence would spread to Macedonia
and the entire region, has been overtaken by a shifting situation
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And there was little appetite among NATO countries, including
the United States, for new troop deployments in the Balkans,
particularly since NATO-led forces already have an open-ended
commitment to insuring a peace settlement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The focus for military planning now, officials say, is on a
variety of air power options that could punish Milosevic and his
troops or simply try to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that while NATO's political leaders would decide
whether military action was needed, the factors that had made the
planning necessary _ the fighting, the refugee problem and the risk
of regional instability _ were getting worse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States had been endeavoring, through a form of
shuttle diplomacy by its ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill,
to start serious negotiations between Milosevic and a unified team
of ethnic Albanian leaders. But the rebel group itself has at least
three regional commands and no clear political leadership and is
dismissive of the major civilian leader in Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova,
who favors independence through nonviolent means.
</P>
<P>
   The West is also pressing for a solution _ a form of negotiated
self-government for Kosovo within Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia _
that the ethnic Albanians do not want. Already, senior Western
officials say, the use of the word ``autonomy'' is no longer
possible with the Kosovo Albanians, who are pressing for an
independence that Milosevic cannot afford, politically, to grant.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said Monday that Kosovo was on the brink of a humanitarian
emergency if the refugees and displaced people were not allowed to
go home in the next week or two, which are important for the
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an extremely serious situation here,'' Hill said in
Pristina, the Kosovo capital. ``There have been tens of thousands
of displaced people in recent weeks.'' He added that the latest
offensive against the rebels ``has caused even more people to flee
from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin called on Milosevic to keep his promises to grant fuller
access to the refugees by international aid agencies. And the NATO
secretary-general, Javier Solana, in Warsaw, urged a cease-fire in
Kosovo and the rapid start to serious negotiations on a peaceful
settlement.

PICASSO WORKS INSTALLED AT BIRTHPLACE IN MALAGA

<P>
   The house in Malaga, Spain, where Pablo Picasso was born on Oct.
25, 1881, and lived for 17 months before his family moved next
door, reopened on June 22 as a small museum for Picasso's work. The
five-story building, which had been open to visitors from 1988 to
1996, has been transformed into the first of two Picasso museums
planned for Malaga, on Spain's southern Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent collection of 200 Picasso artworks, mainly
engravings, was donated by his daughter-in-law, Christine Ruiz
Picasso. Currently on display are some 20 of Picasso's engravings
inspired by the sonnets of the Spanish writer Luis de Gongora y
Argote. The museum will also have rotating monthly exhibits, which
started with a loan of 30 of the artist's engravings from the 1930s
to the 1970s from the Reina Sofia National Art Center in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The Pablo Ruiz Picasso Foundation, run by Malaga's city hall,
operates the museum. A library occupies the upper floors, with
thousands of Picasso-related books, press clippings and
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 15 Plaza de la Merced in the city's historic
quarter, (34-95) 221-5005, is open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
through mid-September. The schedule then changes to 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on
Sunday. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   The second, larger museum, also in the city's historic district,
is expected to open next year, with a display of works donated by
Christine Ruiz Picasso and the artist's grandson Bernard Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Lorikeets, Meerkats and Koalas in St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   Children's zoos have gone far beyond a few pens of sheep or
goats that will nibble food from kids' hands. The St. Louis Zoo,
for example, has recently redone its Children's Zoo to include a
slide that goes through a pool of otters, an aviary alive with
dozens of little parrots called lorikeets, and hourly shows like
``Pets and Consequences'' in a special amphitheater for live animal
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Emerson Electric Children's Zoo, as the new
three-and-a-half-acre area is called, also has installations of
koalas; meerkats (like Timon from ``The Lion King''), which stand
on their hind legs to look around; and big-eared fennec foxes,
which run down crickets at snack time. In the Just Like Me area,
children can mimic animals by swinging like a monkey, climbing on a
web like a spider or digging like an aardvark.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the St. Louis Zoo, in Forest Park, (314) 781-0900,
is free; admission to the children's zoo is $3 a person (under 2
free), though it, too, is free for those who enter between 9 and 10
a.m. The zoo is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 9 p.m. on
Tuesday until Labor Day.

   Valet Parking Introduced at Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Passengers driving to Kennedy International Airport
who are in a rush to make a flight and don't want to waste too much
time parking (and waiting for the van that invariably seems to stop
at every other terminal before theirs) now have an alternative:
valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began
a service that allows motorists to get off at the Federal Circle
exit of the Van Wyck Expressway inside the airport, drop off their
cars and be driven in a 14-seat van that goes directly to the
passenger's terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority promises that customers should not have to
wait any longer than a few minutes for the van, which will include
free newspapers and bottled water. The passenger's car will be
parked in a lot accessible only to the valets. The cost is $18 a
day (compared with $7 a day in a long-term lot and $24 a day in a
daily lot). A similar service was introduced at Newark (N.J.)
Airport on July 1, and is eventually planned for La Guardia, too.
</P>

   ONE BED, ONE LIFE: GOOD REASONS TO CHEER
</P>
<P>
   When the need is great the good people of the Phoenix area know
precisely what to do.
</P>
<P>
   They have opened their hearts to the victims of domestic
violence because it is a tragic subject that cannot help but touch
a heartstring.
</P>
<P>
   Women running from an abusive mate in the early morning hours,
clutching an infant and wondering if there is help, wondering if
there is a bed for a safe haven. Anything. Just to get away and out
of harm's way and to get help.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scene from hell.
</P>
<P>
   And it happens with an alarming frequency.
</P>
<P>
   But often out of view. The secrets of a particular family. Maybe
a neighborhood. Police blotter information that's not usually
disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the horrific death and tragedy of Laura Munoz
(EDITORS: There is a tilde over the `n' in MUNOZ) did the Phoenix
area take notice and begin to understand the crying need. Munoz, a
mother of six, was one of the unlucky ones, a stabbing victim who
had been repeatedly turned away from crowded domestic shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of beds is so dire that only about one in six can
be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the outrage if hospitals had to turn so many away?
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix City Council took matters into its own hands and
authorized $1 million for the building of new shelter beds for
women fleeing from abusive situations. But there was a catch.
Shelters couldn't apply for the money unless they demonstrated an
ability to meet the match.
</P>
<P>
   That's where you came in. That's where you came through.
</P>
<P>
   In only two months, a fund-raising campaign has raised an
additional $1 million in the ``One Bed, One Life'' campaign,
sponsored by The Republic, Channel 12 (KPNX), KMLE-FM (107.9) and
Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   That means that $2 million can be put to incredibly good use.
The grants are expected to be given out by the city's Committee on
Domestic Violence in September.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that the odds of another tragedy like the one that
befell Laura Munoz might be lessened by a considerable margin.
</P>
<P>
   But the work is not done, and another important proposal has
been endorsed by the Phoenix committee headed by Councilwoman Peggy
Bilsten. The idea is to establish in Phoenix a ``one-stop-shop'' to
help victims of family violence, whether they are in need of
medical attention, police assistance, counseling or an order of
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far more humane and efficient way to treat victims who
now must endure the pain of telling their stories several times in
many different locations.
</P>
<P>
   Bilsten's committee has suggested that $1.2 million would be
required to bring a comprehensive domestic violence center on line.
Donations of furniture, computers, phone lines and the like could
lower the cost.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good idea, another response to a problem that's out of
the closet. If the convenience of so many services under one roof
encourages just one adult to seek help, it will have served its
purpose. In September, the City Council should make another strong
statement against domestic violence and approve a family center. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLARENCE THOMAS' SPEECH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas spoke to 2,000 members of the National
Bar Association last week, and for a fleeting moment, the First
Amendment seemed a tiny bit more secure.
</P>
<P>
   An introspective, thoughtful speech by the nation's
highest-ranking black official to the nation's largest group of
black attorneys and judges may seem about as unusual as jam and
bread. But in fact, his appearance over the shrill objections of
NBA directors, including - incredibly - judges charged with
dispensing fair and impartial justice, represented a notable
victory for free speech regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been a lightning rod for controversy and vilification
in civil rights circles since he ascended to the high court in 1991
for one reason - he holds views out of sync with self-anointed
black leaders, a `betrayal'' of the conventional liberalism of his
predecessor, Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   He explained his ``primary problem'' among black brethren `is
that I have no right to think the way I do because I'm Black.'' But
his views, he added, are ``not necessarily illegitimate if held by
non-Blacks. They are exempt from this kind of criticism because
they are not Black.''
</P>
<P>
   An exaggeration? Imagine demonstrators picketing Justice Sandra
O'Connor because her views aren't `White'' enough. Or Black leaders
objecting to her views on affirmative action. They don't; she's
exempt.
</P>
<P>
   It's only Thomas who is so honored. He must be made to toe the
line.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely this demagogic groupthink notion that all
members of a racial minority must be of one mind which, in Black
economist and writer Thomas Sowell's words, has `already poisoned
race relations and misdirected a whole generation of young
Blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in this context that Justice Thomas' assertion of the
right to `think for myself,'' and to ``refuse to have my views
assigned to me...because I'm black'' represents a triumph of free
speech, and a threat to the hegemony so many civil rights leaders
seek over their followers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it also signifies a moderation of the thought
regimentation among that leadership remains to be seen. It was not
a hopeful sign that as soon as Thomas finished speaking, the
lawyers put on a special seminar to dump on those views whose
independence scares them so. &QL;

STOCKS FALL AS HONG KONG'S ECONOMIC SLUMP WORSENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The stock market fell sharply here on Monday, as two
new reports laid bare the depths of the Asian financial crisis and
its impact on this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   First, Hong Kong's government reported that the economy shrank
2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1998. The contraction was even
sharper than the provisional figure of 2 percent the government
released in June. And it confirmed that Hong Kong is headed into
its deepest recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., the leading bank
here, announced that earnings fell 41 percent, to $791.16 million,
in the first half of 1998 because of a huge charge taken to protect
it from bad loans. HSBC Holdings PLC, the bank's London-based
parent, said it took a $1.14-billion charge _ a jump of $889
million over a charge in the first half of 1997. As a result, HSBC
said net profit for the first half fell 16 percent to $2.402
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The provision for bad loans is one yardstick of how severe HSBC
believes the financial crisis will be. Analysts said its size
indicated that the bank expected many Asian companies to tumble
into financial hardship as the crisis wears on _ with a good number
defaulting on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the market has to realize is that this is not the end,
but the beginning,'' said Roy Ramos, a banking analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong. ``There will have to be more
provisions for bad loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although HSBC and the government made their announcements after
the stock market here closed, investors had anticipated the bad
news. The benchmark Hang Seng index of 33 leading issues fell
383.43 points, or 4.8 percent, to 7,552.77, worsening a market
decline just over 8 percent in the two preceding weeks. HSBC, which
accounts for about one-third of the weighted index, also slid
nearly 5 percent Monday, to $179(Hong Kong), or $23.25(U.S.) a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said on Monday that Hong Kong's economic
performance in the first quarter was worse than first thought
because declines in consumer spending and in tourism revenue were
steeper than expected. K.Y. Tang, a government economist, said the
rapid onset of the financial crisis had made it all but impossible
to accurately forecast economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Tang acknowledged that _ with the latest trade and retail
sales figures showing continued declines _ he expected the second
quarter to be ``somewhat worse'' than the first. Private economists
said Hong Kong's output would probably decline 3 percent in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bright spot I can see is the normal seasonal pickup
in trade in the fourth quarter,'' said Ian Perkin, chief economist
of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``But then we get
into the problem of what happens in the first and second quarter of
1999.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like many economists, Perkin said he worried that Hong Kong and
other Asian economies faced several years of recession. Hong Kong's
economy has been sapped by all the usual symptoms of the Asian
economic ailment _ like an erosion of exports to its neighbors and
a loss of consumer confidence _ and a few symptoms unique to this
city. The trouble-prone opening of the Hong Kong airport disrupted
cargo shipments, costing several hundred million dollars in
exports.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Perkin estimated that Hong Kong's gross domestic
product would decline by 2 percent this year _ its first full year
of contraction since the territory began keeping records in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is taking a similarly bleak view. It
said it could not predict when Hong Kong or other markets would
claw themselves out of their current trough. Executives at HSBC
said the bulk of the $1.14 billion in bad-loan provisions was
intended for loans to companies in Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos noted, though, that the bank still needed to deal with
loans to companies here and in South Korea, Malaysia and China.
``We take a very strong premise that it is going to get worse in
all these markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, HSBC's nonperforming loans account for only 1.7
percent of all its loans in Hong Kong, and 6.9 percent of loans in
the rest of Asia. But Ramos said he expected that the ratio of
nonperforming loans could easily double in Hong Kong, and in some
Asian markets _ like Thailand _ it could rise to as much as 30
percent of the bank's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we've been taken aback by how severely economies
in Asia have contracted,'' Ramos said. ``And we've been taken aback
by how high the ratio of nonperforming loans has risen.''
</P>
<P>
   HSBC executives noted, somewhat plaintively, that their
underlying business was performing well. The bank's operating
earnings before the bad-loan provision increased 13 percent, to
$4.76 billion, in the first half. And HSBC's British and U.S.
operations both had solid profit gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the bankers found it hard to accentuate the positive.
Addressing a news conference in the bank's architecturally striking
Hong Kong headquarters, John Bond, the group chairman of HSBC
Holdings, said of the Asian crisis, ``I think the speed and
severity has caught everybody by surprise.''

 &HT;    Are we not `Rugrats'? Why yes we are!
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Are we not men?'' Mark Mothersbaugh
asked as the leader of Devo, the legendary '70s new wave rock
group.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mothersbaugh has a different question: ``Are we not
rugrats?''
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh, the creator of that bizarre rock classic ``Whip
It,'' is now the musical force behind the Nickelodeon animated kids
program ``Rugrats.'' And as the show evolves from TV phenomenon to
Broadway-style touring spectacular (coming to the Miami Arena on
Thursday) to a feature film (due in the fall), the 48-year-old
composer is riding each wave of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural progression of our cycle of de-evolution,''
he says drolly of his second (and decidedly more commercial) career
as kiddie writer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gap between Devo and ``Rugrats'' may not be as large
as it seems. Even as it lampooned pop culture, the band embraced it
_ and nothing could be more popular than the Nickelodeon series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were influenced not so much by pop music, but by everything
that was going on in the world around us: elevator music, TV
commercial music,'' Mothersbaugh explains. ``I quoted Burger King
(jingle) lyrics on our first album.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mothersbaugh is steeped in fashioning the ``Rugrats''
soundtrack. The show revolves around the hi-jinks of a host of
toddlers _ Chuckie, Tommy and the slightly older Angelica, who
confront such burning issues as toilet-training and who's their
favorite TV character.
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh admits he was skeptical when he was first
approached by the series' creators, Gabor Csupo and Arlene Klasky.
He was hoping for something with ``Ren and Stimpy''-like subversive
undertones; they were pitching a far more family-friendly show. But
the idea that Rugrats presented a self-contained children's world _
kids talk to each other, even if their parents hear it as gibberish
_ gave him an interesting musical starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something that would create their audio
universe,'' he says of his music, which sounds something like
nursery tunes played backwards.
</P>
<P>
   For the stage show, Mothersbaugh was free to think bigger _ and
add actual songs. ``There's a song that sounds like a James
Brown-style song. There's one that's like a gospel song. There's a
reggae song,'' he says. And don't forget Angelica's main number:
``If I Were Princess of the World,'' a fitting anthem for the
series' most self-absorbed character.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``Rugrats'' film, Mothersbaugh promises more of the
same, including a song he's recorded with Beck, Jakob Dylan, Lou
Rawls and Iggy Pop, among others. It captures the scene in a
hospital nursery, packed with day-old infants. ``It's like a Busby
Berkeley routine,'' Mothersbaugh says.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy whose signature artistic contribution may have
been turning a flowerpot into a fashion statement about headgear.
And who could forget those yellow lab coats Devo sported?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something to wear on stage and we found
these chemical clean-up outfits,'' Mothersbaugh recalls with a
laugh. ``It cost us five bucks apiece to buy these little plastic
suits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Devo was about more than plastic suits. The band, consisting
primarily of Mothersbaugh and his brother Bob (lead guitar) and
siblings Bob and Jerry Casale (guitar and bass, respectively),
formed in Ohio in the mid '70s. Since the members were art
students, their focus was on the visual _ and they saw the group as
a way to make a statement about an increasingly mechanized,
soulless world. A world in which man was essentially
``de-evolving''; hence, the group's name.
</P>
<P>
   Devo began by making movies, not records, but eventually a few
of their songs found their way to vinyl. They caught the attention
of everyone from label executives to art rockers Iggy Pop and David
Bowie. By 1978, Warner Brothers released their debut album, the
boldly titled, ``Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!'' The new wave
had its first heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The band reached its commercial peak in 1980 with its third
album, ``Freedom of Choice,'' which featured the gold-selling
``Whip It.'' The song's video, a favorite of the young MTV network,
featured some of the most arresting images ever to air on music
television: cowboys whipping cowgirls in a bizarre spoof of
Reagan-era home-on-the-ranch politics. But some feminists saw it
otherwise _ as a statement encouraging violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dealt with a lot of irony, and that is always misunderstood
in this country,'' says Mothersbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest misunderstanding may have been labeling Devo a
rock band when in fact it came much closer to the spirit of
performance art. ``It was record companies who pushed to minimalize
that,'' says Mothersbaugh of the group's creative leanings. ``They
wanted us to be a rock band. That was what they knew how to
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Devo's run lasted into the early '90s. And although technically
the band has never broken up (and even played Lollapalooza in
1996), Mothersbaugh was free to pursue other projects, from scoring
feature films (``Bottle Rocket,'' ``Happy Gilmore'') to writing the
theme to TV's ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rugrats'' in all its guises _ TV, stage and film _ remains
his biggest undertaking. Bigger in some respects than Devo, he
says. If you don't believe him, just ask a group of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the ``Rugrats'' are their Beatles,'' he
concludes.

INDONESIA MILITARY EXAMINES SUHARTO-ERA ABUSES

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's military began an investigation
Monday into the kidnapping and torture of political opponents under
Suharto, the former president, and the possible involvement of his
son-in-law and other members of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, said that Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law, and two other officers connected to
the military's Special Forces unit would be called before a special
military council while 10 others below the rank of colonel would
face court-martial charges.
</P>
<P>
   The military is attempting to improve its image following local
and international pressure to find 14 political opponents of
Suharto who are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto said the council had been formed ``to put an end to the
case of the missing persons'' but that punishment would be meted
out according to military procedure behind closed doors. The
maximum penalty is dishonorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian public's perception of the military has fallen to
its lowest point in years after reports of the military's
involvement in kidnapping Suharto's opponents and shooting four
university students last May and accusations that it may have been
behind rioting that claimed nearly 1,200 lives the same month.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the National Commission on Human Rights said the
military was taking the right steps by forming the review body but
called for the results to be open.

   &UR; Rembrandt, by Rembrandt &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that there will be an exhibit of Rembrandt's
self-portraits next year, both at the National Gallery in London
and the Maurits-huis in The Hague. Do you know the dates? _ Jim
Graham, Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A. Rembrandt wrote his autobiography with a paintbrush, creating
60 self-portraits _ the first at age 20 or 21, the last at 63,
shortly before his death in 1669. The paintings, drawings and
etchings help trace his stylistic development, from youthful
self-confidence to the searching portraits of old age.
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt painted himself in many roles: as artist, in
extravagant dress, as the Apostle Paul and at the feet of Christ
during the raising of the Cross. This exhibit, which will first be
shown in London before moving to The Hague, will study the
significance of these varying depictions as well as the facial
expressions the artist chose. It will include numerous paintings
and about 30 of his etchings and drawings. In addition, a small
selection of works by Rembrandt's students will show how their
self-portraits were influenced by their teacher. The works will be
on loan from the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the
United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The show is first scheduled to run at the National Gallery on
Trafalgar Square in London from June 9 through Sept. 5, 1999. Early
plans are for 40 paintings and 35 etchings and drawings by
Rembrandt to be on display. There will be an admission charge to
the exhibition (the permanent collections are free), to be called
``Rembrandt by Himself,'' but it has not been set yet. Information:
(44-171) 747-2885.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauritshuis, 8 Korte Vijverberg, The Hague, has chosen the
simpler name ``Rembrandt Himself'' for the show, to run from Sept.
25, 1999, to Jan. 9, 2000. This exhibition will feature 25
paintings, fewer than the number at the National Gallery. Tickets
for the Mauritshuis show will be available beginning June 1, 1999,
and will be sold for specific entry times. Visitors will have a
one-hour window in which to arrive and will be able to stay as long
as they wish. For information, call (31-70) 302-3456.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buenos Aires Hotels  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I will be staying in Buenos Aires in November.
We saw that one major American chain hotel costs $390 a night. Can
you suggest something more moderate? _ Mary Jane Baker, Portland,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Here are three possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Plaza Francia, 2189 Schiaffino, telephone and fax
(54-1) 804-9631, has 50 smallish but cozy rooms in the elegant
Recoleta district. Nearby are trendy shopping centers, outdoor
cafes and major museums. Rooms at the front of the hotel offer
views of the pretty tree-lined streets below. A double room is
$152.46 to $175.45, including tax and Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking the Libertad Plaza and two blocks from the Teatro
Colon is the Hotel Bisonte, 1207 Paraguay St., (54-1) 816-5770, fax
(54-1) 816-5775. The 87 rooms are not overly elegant, but they are
comfortable and are particular favorites for business travelers,
with their computer ports and 24-hour room service. A double is
$169.40, with tax and buffet breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go higher on the amenity (and price) scale, the
Hotel Claridge, 535 Tucuman Street, (54-1) 314-7700, fax (54-1)
314-8022, is a traditional English-style hotel in the middle of the
financial district. The 161 rooms are large and well--appointed,
and there is an outdoor pool. The Claridge Grill is one of the
city's better-known restaurants. Doubles: $290, with tax but no
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Airport Parking &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently left my car in the Kennedy Airport long-term lot
for a week. The cost was reasonable, but after leaving the lot, I
noticed that my license plate number was on my credit-card receipt.
How is this done and why? _ Leonard A. O'Connor, Watertown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. How your license-plate number gets on your receipt is fairly
simple _ the cashier in the booth can see it thanks to a mirror
(it's also recorded by a video camera) and enters it in the
register. But the background is a little more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, the agency that operates La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark
airports, said that in 1991 the authority installed a computerized
revenue-control system for the daily and long-term lots at each
airport. One problem at these lots in the 1980's was car theft, but
the new system has helped reduce that. Each night, an employee with
a hand-held computer records the license plate number and location
of each car parked in these lots. Besides helping to reduce auto
theft, it also helps the authority to find out where travelers like
to park and for how long, data that can be used to improve customer
service. If a customer has a complaint about a cashier, that
employee can be identified. And if you come home from your trip
with so many great memories that you forgot where you parked your
car, the computer can find it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill also said that by the end of the year, the Port Authority
planned to have at least one lot at each of the three airports that
accepted payment with EZ Pass, the system now used at the
authority's bridges and tunnels to automatically record toll
charges for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nevis Runway &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I really enjoy the island of Nevis in the Caribbean, but it
takes the better part of a day to get there since I must first fly
to San Juan, then to St. Kitts, then switch planes for Nevis. The
runway at the island's airport is being lengthened. How soon can I
expect direct flights from, say, San Juan? _ John Wellenbach,
Narberth, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. The runway, which is being extended to 4,000 feet to
accommodate larger jets, was originally scheduled to be completed
this month, said Christine Walwyn of the St. Kitts and Nevis
Department of Tourism, but the target is now early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither American Airlines nor its subsidiary,
American Eagle, plans to provide more direct service to Nevis after
the project is completed. ``It wouldn't make economic sense for
either one of the airlines to do it at this time,'' said Mitch
Baranowski, an American Airlines spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, you will just have to keep taking those 10-minute
flights from St. Kitts (there's also a 45-minute ferry trip
instead), or try the longer flights from Anguilla, Antigua, St.
Barts, St. Croix and St. Maarten.

CLINTON TO EXPAND MEDICAID FOR SOME OF THE WORKING POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for
electronic media.) 
(JT) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday will announce new
policies making it easier for states to provide Medicaid to adults
in two-parent families who work at low-wage jobs for more than 100
hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the changes would help 135,000 to
200,000 people in 20 states. Thirty states had already received
permission from the federal government to dispense with the
100-hour-a-month rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will make the changes by regulation, having concluded
that he does not need to ask Congress to change the laws governing
Medicaid and welfare, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The old rules, in effect, penalized work effort, cutting off
Medicaid to adults in many low-income families who worked more than
100 hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also penalized marriage, cutting off Medicaid for many
single mothers who married, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, to be issued this week, states may
eliminate the 100-hour limit if they wish, or they could set a
higher limit. And states will have a financial incentive to do so,
because the federal government pays 50 percent to 77 percent of
Medicaid benefits. The federal share is larger in states with low
per capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to be delivered on Tuesday, Clinton describes the
100-hour limit as ``the last vestige of the old welfare system.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``no aspect of the welfare system did more to defy
common sense and insult our values than the so-called 100-hour
rule,'' Clinton plans to says. ``Instead of rewarding work, it took
away health care from people who secured a full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, Clinton says, ``the 100-hour rule was wrong, and
now it's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The president will announce the changes at a White House event
reviewing what has happened to low-income families since he signed
legislation revamping the welfare system on Aug. 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data, for March of this year, show 8.9 million
people on welfare. The number has declined by 37 percent since
Clinton took office in January 1993 and by 27 percent since he
signed the welfare bill in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Guyer, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group, described the new
rules as ``a wonderful policy change'' that could help many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If states take advantage of this new option,'' Ms. Guyer said,
``low-income parents can increase the number of hours they work
without fear of losing Medicaid coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Baxendell, a health policy analyst at the National
Governors' Association, said state officials would also welcome the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the new rules give states an option for more flexibility,
that's something we would support,'' Ms. Baxendell said. ``Some
states could view this as a nice complement to efforts to help
parents move from public assistance to work while keeping their
health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all working poor parents have no health
insurance. Typically, their jobs do not offer health benefits, and
low-wage workers often cannot afford to take advantage of the
coverage if it is offered to them. Moreover, while many states have
expanded Medicaid to cover the children of low-income families in
recent years, the parents are often ineligible for Medicaid and
other public health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old welfare system, people who received cash
assistance were automatically eligible for Medicaid. But, Ms. Guyer
said, as parents move off welfare into low-wage jobs, they
frequently lose their health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 states including New York and New Jersey, an adult in a
two-parent family can ordinarily qualify for Medicaid only if the
principal wage-earner in the family works fewer than 100 hours a
month, federal officials said. This restriction prevents states
from expanding Medicaid to two-parent families in which the
principal wage-earner works 100 hours a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   The other 30 states had received waivers under the old welfare
law allowing them to eliminate the 100-hour rule.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said
the 100-hour limit was added to federal welfare regulations in
1971, and it restricted Medicaid eligibility as well because the
two programs were closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare law gave states new freedom to set eligibility
rules for cash assistance, but it froze in place most of the
Medicaid eligibility rules that prevailed in July 1996. States
could liberalize eligibility for welfare, but not for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   One result, officials said, was a disincentive for poor people
to work. They could keep Medicaid coverage if they worked 90 hours
a month, but, in many states, they would lose Medicaid if they
worked 110 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, healthy adults of working age are eligible for
Medicaid only if they have children. While Congress and the states
have established more generous criteria for children and pregnant
women, the income limit for parents seeking Medicaid is generally
far below the official poverty level.

<P>
   Q &UR; : &LR;  Our manager touches people when he talks to them. It seems
like it's more of a cultural thing than a sexual thing, but I can't
stand it. I don't want to make a federal case out of this, but I
would like it to stop without a creating a problem with him. Any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A &UR; : &LR;  When there is unwanted touching, you do not need to make a
federal case out of it, or even a state case, but you should state
your case to your manager. Whether it is a cultural thing or a
sexual thing does not matter because it is an unwanted thing. This
means it must stop.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the best step is to tell him that there is something
going on at work that is interfering with your comfort level and
effectiveness on the job, and you would like to discuss it with him
in private.
</P>
<P>
   In such a meeting, there is no need for an attack, an accusal or
a threat. Rather, you should present your thoughts in a direct,
honest, businesslike and professional way. Be prepared to provide
specific examples if necessary, emphasizing the point that you want
these behaviors to cease.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed a cultural thing, you will see it in his
initial reaction and subsequent behavior. And, if it is a sexual
thing, you will see that, too. As a final note, you should make a
formal note to yourself regarding this meeting. Although you don't
want to make a federal case, such a note can be hopeful, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In our small office, I am part of a team of four managers and
one general manager.
</P>
<P>
   I am isolated in the work I do, and none of the other managers
make an effort to include me in anything. Although the general
manager is happy with my performance, I'm ignored when it comes to
going out for coffee or lunch. I believe it is the general
manager's responsibility to include me, but I am not comfortable
approaching him because it seems petty and unprofessional. What
should I do besides try to have a positive attitude?
</P>
<P>
   A: When your significant others at work treat you as an
insignificant other, there are some steps you can take besides
trying to maintain a positive attitude. In fact, people can only
try to maintain a positive attitude for so long, before they end up
saying, ``So long.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that if you go to the general manager and complain
that you are being left out, you may appear petty and
unprofessional. However, you can approach him with some suggestions
regarding ways that the department can work more productively.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying idea is that with increased contact and
communication, employees' attitudes toward each other can change
and they work more effectively together. With this in mind, tell
the manager that you would like to be more involved with the rest
of the management team. Try to suggest some specific projects that
include all four of the managers, such as a quality improvement
committee that brings the entire team together on a regular basis.
In a word, you need more of an opportunity to work with your
associates and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work with a person who is very uncooperative and abusive.
He verbally abuses me, hung up the phone on me and once threw
things at me. I have complained to our manager, and he told me that
he is also having problems with him. I have since found out that
many people are having the same problem. How should I deal with
this person?
</P>
<P>
   A: The real question is not how you should deal with him but why
your manager has not already done so. When you and your manager
discuss a problem regarding a co-worker and your manager responds
that he also is having problems, that it not even mismanagement. It
is non-management.
</P>
<P>
   Your co-worker's behavior is totally unacceptable and the fact
that he threw something at you could be described as an act of
rage. Since your manager is not taking action on it, senior
management needs to be informed. Tell your manager that he needs to
take this up with senior management. If he will not do this, tell
him that you are going to do so and let him know why.
</P>
<P>
   You have a co-worker who has sent a clear warning sign. To
ignore it is unfair to you and virtually everyone else in the
organization. &QL;

 &HT;    Gramm joins call for speeding farm aid
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Sen. Phil Gramm Monday joined the chorus
of national leaders calling for help for farmers and ranchers
hurting from the drought that is killing crops and parching
pastures from the Gulf Coast to the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, a Republican member of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to speed up applications
for emergency loans from farmers and ranchers who face severe
losses because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   The low-interest loans were triggered last month when
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declared that the entire state
is an agricultural disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, President Clinton issued a statement acknowledging
that while the nation's capital can't make it rain, it can help
farmers and ranchers who are hurting ``through no fault of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate trips to Texas last month, Glickman and Deputy
Secretary of Agriculture Richard Rominger visited farms and ranches
for a first-hand look at the effects of the severe dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm was scheduled late Monday to visit a drought-damaged
pasture in Brazos County after meeting with state agriculture
officials at Texas A&AMP;M University. He complained that it can take
up to 18 months for agricultural producers to receive money from
disaster loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems plain that requiring farmers and ranchers to wait a
year and a half to accommodate the processing of paperwork will
pile a policy disaster on top of a natural disaster,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the USDA to assign more employees to local Farm
Service Agency offices to handle the expected crush of disaster
applications, Gramm echoed a plea made in July by Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to help pay essential living expenses or to refinance
existing loans, the ``last-resort'' government loans carry an
interest rate of 3.75 percent. To be eligible, farmers and ranchers
must have suffered at least a 30 percent loss in normal revenues
and have been turned down by two private lenders.
</P>
<P>
   After the drought of 1996, 306 Texas producers received disaster
loans totaling $17.8 million, for an average of $58,000, according
to the Farm Service Agency, which administers the program.
</P>

 &HT;    Gramm joins call for speeding farm aid
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Sen. Phil Gramm Monday joined the chorus
of national leaders calling for help for farmers and ranchers
hurting from the drought that is killing crops and parching
pastures from the Gulf Coast to the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, a Republican member of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to speed up applications
for emergency loans from farmers and ranchers who face severe
losses because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   The low-interest loans were triggered last month when
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declared that the entire state
is an agricultural disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, President Clinton issued a statement acknowledging
that while the nation's capital can't make it rain, it can help
farmers and ranchers who are hurting ``through no fault of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate trips to Texas last month, Glickman and Deputy
Secretary of Agriculture Richard Rominger visited farms and ranches
for a first-hand look at the effects of the severe dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm was scheduled late Monday to visit a drought-damaged
pasture in Brazos County after meeting with state agriculture
officials at Texas A&AMP;M University. He complained that it can take
up to 18 months for agricultural producers to receive money from
disaster loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems plain that requiring farmers and ranchers to wait a
year and a half to accommodate the processing of paperwork will
pile a policy disaster on top of a natural disaster,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the USDA to assign more employees to local Farm
Service Agency offices to handle the expected crush of disaster
applications, Gramm echoed a plea made in July by Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to help pay essential living expenses or to refinance
existing loans, the ``last-resort'' government loans carry an
interest rate of 3.75 percent. To be eligible, farmers and ranchers
must have suffered at least a 30 percent loss in normal revenues
and have been turned down by two private lenders.
</P>
<P>
   After the drought of 1996, 306 Texas producers received disaster
loans totaling $17.8 million, for an average of $58,000, according
to the Farm Service Agency, which administers the program.
</P>
<P>
   While that's a relatively small number, agriculture experts say
most farmers are able to get help from banks where they have
borrowed money for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, about 110 of 254 counties were eligible for the
disaster loans.
</P>
<P>
   Separately from drought aid, Congress, responding to a severe
drop in farm income, sent President Clinton a bill Monday to

CLINTON CRISIS SETS TONE OF GOVERNORS' MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., S.C., Mich., Nev., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When the 90th annual meeting of the National
Governors' Association convened here on Saturday, its leaders
hailed the gathering as ``an exceptional opportunity to spotlight
what unites America and propels us into the 21st century.'' But
what has been spotlighted instead is rapidly growing worry among
top Democrats and rapidly rising hopes, if not glee, among top
Republicans about the outcome of the Clinton-Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right up against it now,'' Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida,
a Democrat, said of President Clinton's impending grand jury
testimony. Then, with a downcast shake of his head, Chiles said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing left for him except to tell the truth. That's
what he's said he will do. He says he's done nothing wrong. OK.
That's what he's got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson, the Wisconsin Republican who is official
host of the four-day conference here, used similar words in
discussing the president's problems. But he wore a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's easy,'' said Thompson, who has sometimes been
mentioned as a presidential contender. ``Just give his speech and
get it over with. But just make sure it's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all Republicans here, Thompson hedged his comments so as
not to convict the president prematurely. Still, he and other
Republican governors left no doubt that they felt that Clinton's
difficulties, wherever they might come out in the end, had already
seriously damaged the Democrats and would greatly benefit
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about Republicans in 1998 and 2000, and why
not?'' Thompson said. ``The Democrats are confused, all over the
map, and they've got a leader who's got big troubles. Of course
we're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican governor, David Beasley of South Carolina,
predicted that the Lewinsky matter would hurt Democrats ``in a lot
of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one I want to mention,'' he said, ``is that the
president will be less able to get out and energize voters.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such comments come mostly in corridor talk here, not
in the official seminars and plenary sessions. In those, the talk
has been solely about matters like welfare reform, health care,
education programs, environmental cleanup and any number of other
state initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end it is corridor talk that has set the tone of the
Milwaukee meeting, because at this juncture it seems that the
political hopes and fears of Democrats and Republicans both will
more likely turn on the president's grand jury testimony than on
child care or education reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let him tell what he said he will tell, and that ought to
take care of all this,'' said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, often
mentioned as a Republican presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic governors have put the best face they can on things,
with many saying, mantra-like, that the president has denied any
wrongdoing and that there is no reason to question his denial
pending proof to the contrary. Still, like the congressional
Democrats who have recently begun to call on the president to be
more forthcoming about the Lewinsky matter, the Democratic
governors no longer insist that there is nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   None have made bold predictions here about expanding their ranks
this fall _ they are already outnumbered by Republicans, 32-17,
with one independent _ and they have no great expectation that
their party will be regaining control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending the election with the same numbers would probably be
good for us,'' Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada lamented when asked about
Democratic hopes for cutting the Republican hold on governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said word that Clinton had agreed to give
testimony had brought a renewed focus on the investigation not only
from leading Democrats and Republicans but also from typical
Americans well outside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   What was once just a sideshow beyond the nation's capital, Romer
said, has become a ``serious sideshow.''

STRATUS TO BE ABSORBED BY ASCEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stratus Computer Inc., a pioneer maker of failsafe computer
systems that was founded 17 years ago, will soon be dismantled
following its $843 million acquisition by Ascend Communications
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Stratus of Marlborough, Mass. and Ascend of
Alameda, Calif. was announced Monday after being widely rumored
last week. It is the latest in a string of deals among computer
networking and telecommunications companies as the Internet
explosion leads to a convergence of voice and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend, a maker of data networking switches, is buying Stratus
primarily for its technology and products sold to telephone
carriers to manage their networks and blend voice and data traffic.
That business unit of Stratus _ one of four _ had $220 million in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   After the $843 million stock swap is completed in the late fall,
Ascend will sell Stratus' three remaining business units _ with
$466 milliion in 1997 revenue _ as well as Stratus' corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had several active inquiries from companies looking
into what we plan to divest. I just cannot name them now,'' said
Bruce Sachs, Stratus president and chief executive. Sachs had been
shifting the company into telecommunications since becoming CEO in
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will lead to a series of employment changes at
Stratus. About 500 jobs will be terminated, including 350 that were
targeted last month when the compnay announced a 20 percent drop in
revenue for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave Stratus with about 1,900 employees. Only 400 to
450 of those employees will become part of Ascend, while the other
1,500 would join the company or companies that eventually acquire
the bulk of Stratus, said Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sachs said that of the 500 who will lose their jobs _ half of
them in Massachusetts _ some will be considered for new jobs at
Ascend, which has its East Coast headquarters in the Westford,
Mass. offices of the former Cascade Communications Corp., a
computer networking company Ascend acquired last year for $3.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stratus acquisition and divestitures and some
additional hiring by Ascend, the California company will have more
than half its work force in Massachusetts, Ascend said.
</P>
<P>
   To buy Stratus, Ascend will swap 0.75 of its shares for each of
Stratus' 24 million outstanding shares, excluding options. Based on
Ascend's closing price Monday of &UR;  &LR; 46 13/16, up 2 11/32, the deal
values Stratus at $35.11 a share, which is slightly higher than
Stratus' closing price Monday of $33.75. Stratus shares rose 4 7/8
in very heavy trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The premium has dwindled considerably since last week when
rumors of a pending deal leaked out, causing Stratus shares to rise
and Ascend's to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who were skeptical last week were more positive about
the deal Monday. The acquisition of key Stratus technology will
enable Ascend to better compete against larger rivals such as
Lucent Technologies Inc., said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is mainly buying Stratus for its products and services
for telephone carriers. It is a leading supplier in that market,
selling to 27 of the 30 largest players. Stratus sells them
specialized computers and software that run Signaling System 7
technology, or SS7, which enables phone companies to route voice
and data traffic over data networks and to incorporate
``value-added'' services such as call forwarding, credit card
verification and 800 calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can leapfrog the competition by several years,'' said Mory
Ejabat, Ascend president and chief executive officer. ``We can now
expand into new areas, become an Internet backbone provider and
take our products across the country and into Europe.''

VIDEOTAPES TAKE STAR ROLE AT ARCHER DANIELS TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Top executives from two of the world's most powerful
food companies sat at a conference table, snacking on orange juice
and steak sandwiches as they spoke. The meeting, in a private room
at the Marriott Hotel in Irvine, Calif., was terse and
businesslike. But the topic of discussion, the government says, was
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, the four men _ two from Archer Daniels
Midland Co. and two from Ajinimoto Co. of Japan _ haggled over
volume production numbers, arguing over the accuracy of data they
were providing each other about their companies' sales of a feed
additive. It was, prosecutors say, the critical stage in conspiracy
that had lasted more than a year to fix prices of the additive.
</P>
<P>
   And unknown to all but one man in the room at that meeting in
October 1993, every word was being videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years after government raids disclosed the
existence of a huge price-fixing investigation, prosecutors played
that videotape Monday to a federal jury that is hearing the
criminal price-fixing case against three former Archer Daniels
executives. All three men have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   If the government is right in its claims, the videotape offers
an unprecedented look into what the government contends was a
price-fixing conspiracy on a giant scale, involving every major
company in the business of producing the additive, which is called
lysine. It shows the executives of the two largest companies in the
business discussing how they would dictate the annual growth in
production to the other lysine makers, and debating the tactical
benefits of simply lying to the others about certain data.
</P>
<P>
   But the tape has already played a critical role in reshaping the
future of Archer Daniels, the politically powerful grain giant. For
it is the crucial evidence against one defendant, Michael Andreas,
the son and former heir apparent to the powerful company's
chairman, Dwayne Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the case are Terrance Wilson, the former head of
the company's corn-processing division, and Mark Whitacre, the
former head of its bioproducts unit, which produces lysine.
</P>
<P>
   The government has already secured guilty pleas from some of the
executives involved in the conspiracy and each of the companies;
Archer Daniels agreed to pay $100 million in 1996 to settle
price-fixing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation was first disclosed, much of the public
attention has focused on Whitacre, who served as a government
informant during the inquiry and secretly recorded his colleagues
over more than two years. But he became a defendant in the case
after the government learned he had violated his cooperation
agreement by illegally taking millions of dollars from Archer
Daniels through a complex fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the defense centers on Whitacre. Lawyers for
Andreas and Wilson have argued that he manipulated investigators
and Archer Daniels officials to create evidence of a conspiracy.
The defense lawyers have argued that many of the conversations
captured on the recordings either involve innocent business
discussions or were elaborate efforts to trick Asian competitors
into providing information that would allow Archer Daniels to gauge
the size of the lysine market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the hearing Monday focused solely on the price-fixing
allegations that began the investigation. Early in the day,
prosecutors played an audiotape recorded by Whitacre in 1993 during
a meeting at Archer Daniels' headquarters in Decatur, Ill., between
senior executives with the company and officials with Ajinimoto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying at this company,'' James Randall, then the
president of Archer Daniels, told the Japanese executives. ``Our
competitors are our friends and our customers are our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Irvine came some months later. According to
testimony in the case, efforts among the five lysine producers to
fix prices were failing because the companies were unable to reach
an agreement to limit production. So, the government contends, a
meeting between top decision makers at the two largest producers _
Archer Daniels and Ajinimoto _ was arranged.
</P>
<P>
   In the videotape, which was made by a camera hidden in a lamp,
the men appeared to be discussing various possible agreements to
allocate how much lysine each company could produce in 1994. At one
point, they decided to use their 1993 sales as a base; they then
appeared to attempt to allocate a predicted growth in market demand
of 14,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how do we share the growth,'' Andreas said.
``What would we be willing to accept and what would you be willing
to accept?''
</P>
<P>
   The men spent some time haggling over production numbers while
standing at an easel. At one point on the tape, the Ajinimoto
executive said that other lysine producers would not believe Archer
Daniels' sales figures. The Archer Daniels executives replied that
the two companies should instead offer lower, false numbers to the
other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Andreas appeared to propose an allocation of the
projected lysine market growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can each have 2,000 tons more in 1994,'' Andreas said of
the other lysine producers. ``And we get the rest between you and
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the video, Andreas, who is now on leave as vice chairman of
Archer Daniels, said that if an agreement was not reached, Archer
Daniels could simply run up its production far more. ``If they
don't agree and there becomes a free-for-all,'' he said, ``Our
numbers are liable to be a lot larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he specified what that meant. ``Their choices are that
we'll agree to only grow five if everything is good,'' he said,
``Or 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the conversation indicated that the senior
management at Archer Daniels kept a close handle on developments in
its businesses, particularly divisions like bioproducts. ``Myself
and my father and Randall,'' Andreas said. ``We all know all the
time what is going on, especially with new businesses that need our
attention.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 10 weeks of sporadic and sometimes caustic
debate, a majority of the House Monday night defied the Republican
leadership and voted for a bipartisan bill that would overhaul the
way the nation's political campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively strong 237-186 showing for the measure, sponsored
by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.,
makes it likely that it will be the one to prevail against several
competing proposals still to be considered. Fifty-one Republicans
broke with their party leadership to support the bill, while only
11 Democrats bucked their party to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As members of the House you get an opportunity very few times
in your career to make a historic vote,'' Meehan said. ``This was a
historic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain of the outcome, even as the vote began, House members
_ including Speaker Newt Gingrich _ stood in the cavernous House
chamber staring up at the large electronic board that shows each
vote as it is cast. Gingrich, who by custom usually does not vote,
this time voted no. As support for the legislation surged past a
majority, cheers and applause erupted on the Democratic side of the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would effectively ban the
unlimited, unregulated donations to the political parties _ or
``soft money'' _ that led to the abuses in the 1996 presidential
campaign. The bill would also curb issue advocacy commercials by
outside groups in the 60-day period before an election.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Monday night's vote, the bill's sponsors had to
surmount months of challenges as the Republican leadership first
tried to block the legislation from the floor and then tried to
subject it to scores of amendments designed to fracture the bill's
coalition. Despite the House's endorsement Monday night of the
legislation, the Senate is considered unlikely to take up campaign
finance legislation before it recesses in October.
</P>
<P>
   Recapitulating weeks of late night debate, the House one more
time Monday clashed over whether the bill's limit on political fund
raising would restore integrity to a political process drowning in
special interest money or whether it would limit free speech and
alter the balance of power between the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prevent any last-minute Democratic defections, the two
senior Democratic leaders of the House took part in the closing
debate to make impassioned pleas for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a national crisis of confidence in our system of
campaign financing,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader. ``It is a crisis of confidence that cuts across party lines
and should disturb all of us as Democrats, as Republicans, as
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans argued that their party _ which has had a
traditional fund-raising advantage _ would be hurt because the
measure does not prevent organized labor, which generally backs
Democrats, from devoting union dues to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my Republican colleagues, let me just simply say this is
not reform,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip. ``This
is not good government. This is political disarmament. It does
nothing to protect union members from forced union dues while
putting shackles on our traditional supporters.'' He accused some
Republicans of voting for the measure simply because they thought
the Senate would be sure to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan coalition backing Shays-Meehan countered by
turning to a conservative member of the rebellious Republican class
of 1994 to make their closing argument. ``Vote yes on this bill,''
implored Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn. ``It's the moment of truth. The
truth is this bill is as fair to Republicans as Democrats.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday night's vote, the Shays-Meehan bill still faces a
few more hurdles to win final House passage under a byzantine
voting process in which 11 different overhaul proposals have been
pitted against one other. The measure only moves to a final vote if
none of the nine plans still standing obtain a larger majority.
Voting is expected to continue later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strong showing for the Shays-Meehan legislation,
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said he would withdraw his own
proposal. Others were expected to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., made clear Monday night he
would still be fighting to pass another bipartisan plan which he
drew up with other House freshman. The measure contains a less
stringent ban on soft money. On that measure, Shays said, ``The
only other bill we need to be concerned about is the freshman
bill,'' Shays said Monday night. ``I hope it gets a respectable
bill but I hope it doesn't get 237.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Shays-Meehan bill passes the House, its chances are
considered remote in the Senate, where Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, has made clear he does not want to consider it in
the closing weeks of the session leading into the mid-term
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year a companion bill sponsored by Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., died when it won
majority support but not the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster.
Meehan argued that the House action would put new pressure on the
Senate _ particularly on senators up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade numerous attempts to refine the campaign
finance laws have died in one house or the other or else by
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the scandal over the House bank, the
Democratic-controlled Congress passed legislation in 1992 only to
see it vetoed by President George Bush. President Clinton came into
office in 1993 pledging to overhaul the system, but legislation
collapsed in 1994 when Senate Republicans launched a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors had hoped that the congressional hearings on Clinton's
unrestrained pursuit of campaign funds in 1996 would give them new
momentum. But the Republican leadership made clear that they were
more interested in investigating Clinton than changing the law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet improbably and against all odds, the effort by Shays and
Meehan has only snowballed. Earlier this year, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich tried to dispense quickly with the campaign finance issue
under rules that never allowed the bipartisan bill to the floor.
That sparked an incipient rebellion and almost cost Republicans
control of the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the GOP leadership decided to switch tactics and
try to kill the campaign finance bill through openness _ allowing
months of debate on 11 proposals and numerous amendment attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Meehan had to accept some amendments they would have
preferred to avoid, such as one banning political contributions
from non-citizens who are legal residents of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But time after time, holding a solid majority of the House
behind them, they fought off other amendments that they said would
have killed their bill by driving away large numbers of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Down to the last hours Monday, the supporters of their bill were
making phone calls and holding meetings to keep in their fold
wavering black, Hispanic and anti-abortion Democrats, who were
concerned about opposition from anti-abortion groups and by
immigrants rights groups that had turned against the bill because
of the amendment blocking donations from legal residents who are
not citizens. In the end, few Democrats bolted from their party.

U.N. ARMS INSPECTOR'S TALKS WITH IRAQ BREAK DOWN IN BITTERNESS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Crucial talks in Baghdad on the remaining
issues blocking the lifting of sanctions on Iraq collapsed in
rancor on Monday, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, returning to the belligerent tone that heralded an
international crisis last fall, rejected a plan for settling issues
proposed by the U.N. chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi delegation leader,
accused Butler, an Australian, of using ``old tricks'' and
following an American policy of continuing sanctions no matter what
progress is made.
</P>
<P>
   Butler told reporters in Baghdad after Monday's session that he
had not made the progress he had hoped for. ``I made a proposal for
further acceleration of work and it was rejected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Turk, the Slovenian delegate to the Security Council and
its current president, said that Butler would cut his trip short
and return to brief the council by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials here and in Baghdad said that they had no further
information on the stalled discussions and declined to speculate
whether the show of obstinacy by the Iraqis was a ploy to rally
support against Butler, whose frank style they dislike.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis once again staged a funeral procession for 35 Iraqi
children outside the building where Butler and Aziz met. Their
parents told reporters that the children had died because of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis accused the United States of ``wrecking'' the program
under which limited oil sales are permitted to pay for food and
medicine. U.N. officials countered that a loosening of the
sanctions has increased oil sales sharply and has allowed hundreds
of millions of dollars in medical supplies to reach Iraq. They said
it was the Iraqi government that recently reduced a U.N. proposal
to raise caloric intake in food distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have been encouraged by Russia, France and China to
hope for a phasing-out of sanctions should the Security Council
acknowledge that every detail about Iraqi weapons will never be
known and that enough progress had been made to warrant a
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Butler, under pressure from the Security Council,
provided Iraq with a ``road map'' of steps to take to meet his
disarmament requirements. Aziz, repeating that Iraq had no more
weapons or information to provide, strongly indicated then that
there would be no more cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Butler did not go to Iraq this week with high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of this round of talks would leave little room for
averting tensions when the sanctions are reviewed by the Security
Council in October. Iraq has significant questions to answer and
has provided no new information since May.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have, in fact, lost some ground because of the
discovery of VX nerve gas on shell canisters and a less upbeat
assessment than expected last week by the International Atomic
Energy Agency on accounting for nuclear programs. Iraq also refused
to hand over a document found by inspectors last month.
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein has threatened unspecified retaliation
if the embargo on oil sales is not lifted this year. Last year, his
government expelled American inspectors, put large presidential
compounds off limits and threatened to freeze all inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's defiance of arms inspectors led to a massing of
American and British forces in the Persian Gulf early this year.

ALBERTSON'S DEAL FIRES FIRST SHOT   IN ONE-STOP SHOPPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you think supermarkets are big now, wait a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement of Albertson's $11.7 billion buyout of
American Stores is just the latest sign that smaller grocery stores
are passe and that all-in-one stores are the supermarkets of the
future. From baked beans to stepladders to fully cooked meals,
consumers will soon be able to buy everything they could want
without leaving one store, analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see major players going further and further on
selling convenience to customers,'' said retail analyst Patrick
Schumann of Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``Bigger stores are one way
to grab more customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said Albertson's faces a tricky task in taking
on the disparate collection of American Stores assets, which
include the Lucky, Sav-on, Jewel, Osco and Acme chains. The
combined company will have 2,470 stores in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
   To compete effectively, all of the company's outlets will have
to offer high-end services like florists, bakeries and
delicatessens, and continue to provide the deep discounts for
commonplace items like detergent, breakfast cereal and videotapes
that American Stores' customers are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure has been the expansion of giant
discounters like Kmart and Wal-Mart into the grocery business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a clear trend toward larger stores because one-stop
shopping is what customers want,'' said Brian Eisenbarth, an
analyst with Collins &AMP; Co. ``That's what you're seeing with
Wal-Mart and Target.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer with 1,900 stores,
already has a major presence in grocery retailing through its 450
Wal-Mart Supercenters. Chairman David Glass has said Wal-Mart plans
to become the nation's largest food retailer and Merrill Lynch
analyst Daniel Barry has predicted that event will take place in
the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have pointed out that since the $436 billion grocery
business is dominated by small chains, a massive operator like
Wal-Mart has solid opportunities because it can beat most rivals'
prices with its economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers kick a lot of tires these days, so you have to be
outstanding to survive in the supermarket business,'' said retail
consultant Frederick Marx of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ``Everybody's
already figured out that prepared food, florists and other
specialties are where you can make real profits. Standing still is
not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the successful operators have to find ways to get rid
of duplicative overhead, Marx said. ``The question every operator
has to face is how quickly is Wal-Mart going to come in'' he said.
``You don't want to wait until Wal-Mart's at your door.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Albertson's competitors don't appear to be waiting.
Business Week reported recently on speculation that
Cincinnati-based Kroger may agree to a buyout by Safeway, resulting
in a combined company with 2,760 stores in a deal worth about $15.4
billion. &QL;

HOUSE BANS UNREGULATED `SOFT MONEY' CONTRIBUTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Champions of overhauling campaign finance laws
prevailed against the odds in the House on Monday, passing a bill
that bans unregulated and unlimited ``soft money'' contributions to
political parties and dramatically changes the way national
elections are paid for.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of campaign finance reform still face an uphill
battle, not only in the House but in the Senate, where Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and other Republican opponents say
they will continue to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bipartisan bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., managed to overcome stiff
opposition led by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. The vote
of 237-186 was a hard-fought victory for Shays and Meehan, who had
worried over several months of debate that their measure would be
watered down or killed outright by several hundred amendments
designed to siphon off support.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than losing steam, the bill seemed to pick up more
supporters in recent weeks as Republican leaders tried repeatedly
to bring it down with some 60 ``poison pill'' amendments and
warnings that it would violate the constitutional guarantee of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the vote, Shays attempted to persuade a number of
members still uncommitted by dubbing the campaign finance issue
``the most important vote'' of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray we will do our job and send it to the
Senate,'' Shays said, calling the vote ``a historic opportunity to
restore integrity to the campaign finance process.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, modeled after legislation first introduced in
the Senate by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., would ban soft money contributions to state and national
political parties from corporations, individuals and special
interest groups. It would beef up disclosure regulations for any
contributions more than $50 and require the timely posting of
contributions on an Internet site once a candidate's report is
filed with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would regulate so-called anonymous special
interest ``issue ads'' that masquerade as negative campaign ads run
on radio and television during the closing days of a campaign.
Finally, the bill would force labor unions to refund any dues or
payments from members used for political purposes if members
object.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bill for which under the scrutiny of daylight
support has grown,'' said Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del, who called it
one of the ``finest pieces of legislation'' voted on by the House
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents led by DeLay trashed the Shays-Meehan bill,
calling it a ``fiasco'' that violates the Constitution's First
Amendment protection of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It violates our most precious freedom _ the freedom of
speech,'' said DeLay, who warned that the Supreme Court would
likely overturn the measure if it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay also said the bill amounted to ``political disarmament''
for Republicans, who normally outraise and outspend their
Democratic opponents by a margin of 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not reform. This is not good government. This is
political disarmament,'' DeLay declared, imploring his GOP
colleagues to vote it down.
</P>
<P>
   But his arguments against the measure only fueled the intensity
of support for it among many of its Republican backers, who labeled
DeLay's comments about it benefiting Democrats more than
Republicans ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that this bill is as fair to Republicans as
Democrats. The truth is that it affects any outside group the same.
It's the same for Wall Street or the labor unions. It's the same
for the Christian Coalition and the ACLU,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp,
R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp called on his fellow Republicans to ``do the right thing
for the American people and send the signal that we have gone the
distance on reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment of truth,'' he said. ``Will you please put
the public interest above your personal interest? Will you please
put good government above your political party?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Shays-Meehan bill received a majority of House
votes, it still could be stopped under a ``king of the hill'' rule
governing the campaign finance debate. The Shays-Meehan measure is
just one of several campaign finance reform bills the House will
vote on this week. The one that gets the most votes will be the
bill that gets forwarded on to the Senate for possible
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill, however, is expected to emerge at the end
of the week as ``the top dog'' legislation, as House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., put it recently.
</P>
<P>
   In his floor speech in favor of the bill, Gephardt said passage
of the measure would be ``the first real step in the process of
reform this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Shays-Meehan was a setback for the Republican
leadership, which had sought to prevent a vote on the measure. In
the end, 51 Republicans, 185 Democrats and one independent voted
for the legislation and 175 Republicans and 11 Democrats voted
against it. Party leaders had predicted only a few weeks ago, that
no more than two dozen Republicans would support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got kicked pretty good,'' said one Republican leadership
aide. ``But it'll never get through the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have vowed
not to allow the legislation to be considered again in the Senate
this year. The McCain-Feingold version was blocked earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked last week if the Senate would be under pressure to
pass campaign finance reform if the Shay-Meehan measured prevailed
in the House, McConnell just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the position of Lott and McConnell, Shays said he has no
plans to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been resurrected from the grave,'' he said of the vote on
his measure. ``This bill won't die.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., called the Shays-Meehan measure a ``tough, fair'' bill that
would make ``a genuine difference in the way we conduct
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called on the Senate to take up the issue.

HOUSE PASSES CAMPAIGN FINANCE REVAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, in a rare snub of the Republican
leadership, Monday night passed a landmark plan for the most
sweeping changes in the way money is spent and raised in the
nation's elections since the wake of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   After months of political pressure, parliamentary pitfalls and
``poison-pill'' amendments, a bloc of 51 renegade Republicans broke
with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and helped the Democratic minority
pass the overhaul plan, 237-186. Only 11 Democrats voted against
the high-stakes measure.
</P>
<P>
   All 24 House members from New England voted for the proposal
except Representative John E. Sununu, a New Hampshire Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would ban the large, unregulated contributions known as
``soft money'' that were at the center of campaign-finance abuses
in the 1996 elections. The bill also would prohibit the type of
anonymous attack ads that proliferated in 1996 and influenced the
outcomes of many congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a generation, members of Congress take it upon
themselves to change our campaign-finance law,'' said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, who
sponsored the bill with Representative Christopher Shays, a
Connecticut Republican. ``That day has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has vowed to sign the measure into law if
it reaches his desk, issued a statement calling the vote a
``breakthrough in the fight for bipartisan campaign finance
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory, Clinton said, ``showed that reform is an
idea whose time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the legislation's torturous journey is far from over,
despite the plan's remarkable resurgence since foes declared it
dead several months ago amid stern opposition from Gingrich and his
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure faces challenges from several alternative
proposals this week in the House, supporters said it appears likely
to prevail and be forwarded to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a Senate version of the Shays-Meehan bill has failed twice
in the last year, even though it was supported by a simple majority
of the 100-member body. In each case, the effort failed when
supporters fell eight votes short of the 60 votes needed to end a
Republican-led filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the measure's chief sponsor, Senator John McCain,
an Arizona Republican, said little has changed since the last
setback in February.
</P>
<P>
   The House action ``might change some votes in the Senate and
persuade a super-majority of senators that the time is finally at
hand to reform a campaign finance system that a clear majority of
Americans believe is corrupt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lingering opposition and dwindling number of days in the
current legislative sessions make ``another attempt at passing a
Senate bill an exceedingly difficult task at best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
another attempt at passing the campaign-finance bill this year
``would be a big waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was part of the 14th major effort in Congress to
change the campaign-finance system since 1979. Every previous
attempt failed, as legislation died in the House, the Senate or the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   During the 19-year struggle, the House and Senate agreed only
once to an overhaul plan. But when they sent it to the White House,
in 1992, the measure was vetoed by President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a historic opportunity to restore integrity to
the political process,'' said Shays, who has endured a backlash
from GOP colleagues for defying Gingrich's opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the bill's soft-money ban would benefit
Democrats. Both parties spent a total of $270 million in soft money
in 1996. And in the 18 months after Jan. 1, 1997, Republicans
raised $70 million in soft money while the Democrats raised $46
million.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's foes also argued that the proposed restrictions on
special interest advertising were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just violates our most precious freedom, freedom of
speech,'' said Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority whip.
``The supporters of this bill believe there is too much information
about our government and that Americans are too stupid to sort out
what is true from what is false.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for banning soft money argued that political leaders
expose themselves to the appearance of possible corruption in
pressuring corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals for
the six-figure contributions they use to fund their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the allegations about wrongdoing at the White House
involved soft-money donors sharing coffee with Clinton in the
executive mansion or sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican Party, whose leaders engineered the recent
attack against antitobacco legislation, have opened themselves to
criticism, for example, by accepting more than $1 million from the
cigarette maker Philip Morris in the 18 months after Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Democrats portrayed Gingrich's opposition of the
bill as a symbol of the influence of big money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months of delay, poison pills, death by amendment: The
opponents of reform have done everything they can to kill off
campaign finance reform and keep the spigots of special interest
money flowing,'' said House Democratic whip David Bonior of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from a group of moderate Republicans, Gingrich
ended months of resistance and permitted debate to begin in May on
the Shays-Meehan bill and 11 competing proposals. Debate on the
Shays-Meehan plan began June 19, with much of the action relegated
to late-night sessions over the 45-day span.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shays-Meehan supporters defeated more than 40
amdendments, including many aimed at gutting the measure, they were
unable to fight off 23 others.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23, however, only two were so problematic that they
threatened to break apart the majority coalition supporting
Shays-Meehan. Both amendments would prohibit non-citizens,
including all non-military legal permanent residents, from
contributing to election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic members of Congress assailed the measure as
discriminatory to individuals who work in the United States, pay
taxes and, in the vast majority of cases, are enmeshed in the
lengthy process of attaining citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to vote on most alternatives to the
Shays-Meehan plan this week, although several sponsors have said
they may withdraw their proposals in order to keep alive the
Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the competing sponsors are Representatives John F.
Tierney, a Salem Democrat, and Charles F. Bass, a New Hampshire
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney said he had yet to decide if he will withdraw his
proposal, which would provide free and reduced-rate broadcast time
to candidates who abide by spending limits. But he indicated he did
not want to be seen as obstructing progress. ``I don't want to be
part of the delay,'' he said.

ALBERTSON'S TO BUY CHAIN OF STORES FOR $8.3 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic on total revenues of top supermarkets is being
sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)

 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albertson's Inc. said Monday that it would acquire American
Stores Co. for $8.3 billion in stock, in a deal that will create
the nation's largest supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction _ the latest in a round of deals announced in
the grocery industry recently as supermarket operators have sought
to form regional strongholds _ would create a chain of nearly 2,500
stores in 37 states with more than 200,000 employees and pro forma
1998 revenues of about $36 billion. The purchase would also
establish Albertson's, which had been the fifth largest chain, as
the industry leader, vaulting past Kroger, which has nearly 1,400
stores in 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's is strong in the West, Midwest and South and will
now have a larger presence in the Southwest and on the West Coast,
where American Stores is a large competitor. The acquisition would
also move Albertson's into drug store retailing because American
Stores has 750 free-standing drug stores that operate under the
Osco Drug and Sav-on names.
</P>
<P>
   In all, American Stores, which is based in Salt Lake City,
operates 1,558 stores in 26 states, including 269 food and drug
combination stores and 539 supermarkets that operate under the
names Acme Markets, Jewel Food Stores and Lucky Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's, which is based in Boise, Idaho, operates 916 retail
stores in 23 states. Both chains' stores will retain their names,
and the company headquarters will remain in Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's chairman and chief executive, Gary Michael, will run
the combined company, and American Stores' chairman and chief
executive, Victor Lund, will be vice chairman of the combined
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strategic standpoint, this transaction will strengthen
our presence in many of our existing markets across the country _
particularly in Northern and Southern California and the Southwest
_ and enables us to enter important urban markets like Chicago and
Philadelphia for the first time,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying the $8.3 billion in stock, Albertson's
will assume $3.4 billion in debt. American Stores shareholders are
to receive 0.63 shares of Albertson's common stock for each share
of American Stores stock. Based on Albertson's closing price on
Friday of $48 a share, the deal is worth $30.24 a share for
American shareholders, who would then own 41.3 percent of
Albertson's. Also, Albertson's will issue about 170 million
additional shares in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's said it expected to save $100 million in costs the
first year from buying and distribution efficiencies and $200
million in the third year from reducing overhead and advertising
expenditures in overlapping markets. Part of the lower overhead
cost will come from eliminating some administrative jobs, although
the number has not been determined. Albertson's said it would take
an undetermined one-time charge related to the transaction, which
it expected to add to earnings per share next year.
</P>
<P>
   American Stores' stock rose $5.3125 Monday to $28.50.
Albertson's shares, meanwhile, were nearly flat, edging up just 50
cents, to $48.50. Shareholders' lukewarm reception may indicate
that they consider the price of the transaction a bit rich or that
they have concerns about how easily the companies can be combined.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``because of our consistent business philosophies and
similar corporate cultures, I am confident the integration of these
two companies will go smoothly,'' Lund said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts said the combination could be more difficult than the
companies anticipate because of the numerous geographical regions
in which they operate and because of the number and type of stores
they run. The deal, which has been approved by both companies'
boards, could also run into antitrust problems in such areas as
California, where Albertson's stands to dominate the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is likely to mandate some
divestitures where there is overlap, said Debra Levin, an analyst
who follows the supermarket industry for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``They will have to sell some stores, but I don't think
that will prevent this from working.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the industry's merger trend is being driven by the
benefits of size, namely, greater purchasing clout, a larger bang
for the advertising buck and additional stores from which to
compete with Walmart, the warehouse clubs and other nontraditional
retailers that now sell milk and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in May, Royal Ahold NV said it was buying the
Giant Food Inc., a supermarket chain, for $2.6 billion, adding 177
stores to its 830 domestic stores. And last year, Fred Meyer Inc.
purchased Quality Food Centers Inc. and Ralphs Grocery Co. in
separate deals worth about $2 billion that created a chain with
more than 800 stores in 14 states.

CLINTON AIDES TAKE DEFIANT STANCE ON LEWINSKY MATTER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking a defiant stance toward prosecutors and
political critics, White House officials said on Monday that
President Clinton would continue to maintain that he had no sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and would appeal a court decision
ordering a top aide to testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not scheduled to testify until Aug. 17, and his
advisers cautioned that only he and a small cadre of lawyers are
privy to his deliberations. But several Clinton aides on Monday
dismissed pleas from Republican congressmen and some former
officials that Clinton acknowledge an affair with the former White
House intern to blunt and perhaps end the six-month-old
investigation by Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has told the truth about this and he will
continue to do so,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, in
response to questions. ``I have no reason to think that that has
changed in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials expressed annoyance over what they called a
presumption that the president was lying when he denied a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
misconduct suit. They said that Clinton's agreement to testify,
despite White House suspicion of Starr's motives, proved that he
had nothing to fear. ``It is a little insulting to turn on the
television and see people come up with the brilliant idea that he
should tell the truth,'' one official said. ``Do you think anyone
here is going in and saying, `Sir, you should lie'?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also served notice on Monday that it would ask
the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's decision compelling
Bruce Lindsey, a White House lawyer who is the president's closest
adviser, to testify to the Lewinsky grand jury. Lanny Breuer,
another member of the White House Counsel's office, was subpoenaed
last week to testify on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists at the FBI crime laboratory completed a
first set of tests on a blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to
prosecutors. Prosecutors are trying to determine whether the dress
was stained during a sexual encounter with Clinton. The first test,
performed under extremely tight security, was intended to determine
whether the stain was caused by semen, but the result was being
very closely held.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixed decision for the White House and Starr, the U.S.
court of appeals here ruled on Monday that an investigation may
continue into whether Starr's office has illegally leaked grand
jury material. The investigation is being conducted by Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson, who presides over the grand jury hearing the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But, overruling part of a decision by Judge Johnson, the appeals
court found that the president's lawyers may not on their own
depose Starr's prosecutors or demand documents from them, according
to a lawyer familiar with the ruling, which was sealed. Instead,
Judge Johnson must first review and approve any documents that are
to be turned over by Starr's office, to insure they do not reveal
grand jury secrets.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, one of the president's lawyers, has accused
Starr's office of illegal slipping information to reporters and
sought sanctions against it. Starr's office has denied any such
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced on Monday that it would appeal a
ruling by a three-judge appeals panel that compelled complete
testimony from Lindsey. Lindsey, who has said that he knows of no
wrongdoing or criminal conduct, cited attorney-client privilege in
declining to answer some questions before a grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   In its divided ruling last week, the panel of the U.S. court of
appeals found that no such privilege could protect a government
lawyer from testifying in a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although one of the three judges argued, in dissent, that the
decision would chill discussions in the executive branch, the
majority wrote: ``When an executive branch attorney is called
before a federal grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes
within the executive branch, reason and experience, duty and
tradition dictate that the attorney shall provide that evidence.
Their duty is not to defend clients against criminal charges and it
is not to protect wrongdoers from public exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House filed a motion with the appeals court here to
block testimony by its lawyers while it awaits Supreme Court
action. It was not clear whether that motion would prevent Breuer's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff, said that the
appeals court decision would undercut any president's ability to
get honest advice by removing the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``This privilege ultimately serves the public interest by
insuring fully informed decision-making through open and candid
discussions between clients and attorneys,'' he said in a statement
on Monday. ``The confidential nature of the attorney-client
privilege relationship is no less important in government than in
any other context where it exists.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to the president said on Monday that he betrayed no sign
of nervousness about his prospective testimony. ``The most
comforting thing in the White House now is that the president seems
totally comfortable,'' said one Clinton aide who is not part of his
damage-control team.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to publicly ignore his legal and political
predicament, Clinton confined his public comments on Monday to
other legislative matters than talk of potential impeachment
hearings. In a speech to summer jobs workers in Cheverly, Md., he
warned Republican leaders that he would not accept a ``bare-bones''
budget from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Republican plan puts politics ahead of people and
puts your future in the back seat,'' he said. ``That is wrong.''
With veto threats hanging over seven appropriations bills, the
White House is on a collision course with Congress over the budget,
though that dispute has been obscured by the furor over Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also gave a speech on Monday, appearing before a lawyers'
group in Toronto, Canada. He reviewed the Supreme Court's
performance this year, calling it ``quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had learned from a defeat he suffered this year
before the Supreme Court, which ruled he could not have access to
notes taken by a lawyer to Vince Foster, the former Clinton
official who committed suicide during Clinton's first term. The
court ruled that a client's death did not weaken the
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that ``the court reminded us that there are other
considerations, there are other values,'' besides the pursuit of
truth. ``The law, embodying the wisdom of the ages, has seen fit to
protect relationships, even at the expense of truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Starr told reporters that he was pursuing his
investigation while ```being respectful of the institutions of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the president's advisers have doubts about his
truthfulness regarding Ms. Lewinsky, and some suspect that by
changing his story now he could bring an end to a drama that has
transfixed Washington and stunted progress on Capitol Hill. But
many Clinton allies also believe that any admission by Clinton
would be turned against him by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's advisers said that his team of political and
legal aides was nervously awaiting test results on Ms. Lewinsky's
dress, which was bought at the Gap. If DNA testing links the dress
to Clinton, this adviser said, White House thinking on his
testimony may change. ``Whatever anyone is saying becomes
inoperative depending upon the results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike lab findings in most high profile cases, which are widely
distributed through the upper echelons of the law enforcement
agency and the Justice Department, the Lewinsky lab tests are being
provided only to a handful of lab technicians and senior FBI
officials. They in turn reveal the findings directly to Starr.

GIANTS VIE FOR DRUG DOMINION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget the mega-grocery chain that will be created
by the proposed merger of Albertson's Inc. and American Stores Co.
If completed, the deal overnight would make Albertson's the biggest
operator of drugstores in the greater Los Angeles area, and one of
the largest drugstore and pharmacy operators in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gaining 808 grocery stores, one-third of which
have in-store pharmacies, Albertson's will acquire 750 stand-alone
drugstores, including both the Sav-on and Osco chains. Sav-on
currently dominates the Southern California market, with 276 of its
312 stores located in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The new heft represented by the combination of in-store
pharmacies and stand-alone stores would add fuel to an already
fierce firefight between the Sav-on and Rite Aid chains for the
hearts and wallets of Southern California shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's announcement, American Stores and Rite Aid
had each unveiled plans to control the Southland. And with good
reason: The Los Angeles metropolitan region is the second-largest
market for the $125 billion of prescription drugs, over-the-counter
medicines, and health and beauty aids that U.S. chain drugstores
sell each year.
</P>
<P>
   Toward its goal, Rite Aid said it would open eight new stores in
Los Angeles by October 1998, bringing its local total to 80, and
starting in 1999 would open 100 new West Coast stores a year
through 2004. The company also has begun renovating dozens of
stores left dowdy by a string of previous owners.
</P>
<P>
   American Stores said last fall it planned to open seven new
Sav-ons in Los Angeles and will add pharmacies to all new and many
existing Lucky stores.
</P>
<P>
   Though a newcomer to the stand-alone market, Albertson's has
indicated it plans to follow in American Stores' footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very committed to the (drugstore) customer,'' said
Albertson's spokeswoman Jenny Enochson. Though the company cannot
guarantee it will keep all existing Sav-on or Osco stores open,
Enochson said Albertson's anticipates operating the majority of the
sites.
</P>
<P>
   And that could spell trouble for Rite Aid. ``It's a little early
to know (Albertson's) intentions,'' said analyst Sally Wallick at
investment bank Legg Mason Wood Walker, ``but they're a much larger
company as a result of this merger and should have greater buying
power. That could mean better bargains for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Rite Aid will be losing sleep over this right
now, because it's so early, but they're surely aware of it, are
analyzing it and thinking about how it's going to affect them.'' &QL;

MARINE FLIERS ARE ARRAIGNED IN CRASH CASE

   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ The pilot and the navigator of a Marine
Corps surveillance jet that cut the cables of a ski-lift gondola in
the Italian Alps, killing 20 people, will enter not guilty pleas as
their cases move closer to trial, their lawyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, the pilot from Mission Viejo, Calif.,
and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y., were arraigned
in a courtroom at Camp Lejeune on Monday, their first court
appearance since the Marine Corps commandant, Lt. Gen. Peter Pace
decided last month that they would be tried on charges of negligent
homicide and involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   They are also charged with damaging military and civilian
property and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all of the charges, they would face up to life
in military prison.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by their lawyers in separate hearings, the fliers sat
quietly and answered only ``Yes, sir'' or ``No, sir'' when prompted
by the military judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley. Although the
officers were asked in the hearing how they would plead, their
lawyers said later that Ashby and Schweitzer would enter pleas of
not guilty at the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
   The two will be tried separately, with Ashby's court-martial
scheduled to begin Dec. 9, while Schweitzer's case is scheduled to
be heard in January.
</P>
<P>
   The two rear-seat equipment operators, against whom charges were
dropped last month, are likely to be called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The four crew members were charged after the Feb. 3 accident
near Cavalese, Italy, where their EA-6B Prowler plane severed two
lift cables that were holding up a gondola carrying skiers. The
accident provoked strong protests in Italy and strained relations
with the United States.

SPANISH PHONE UTILITY EXTENDS LATIN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ When Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications
company, came away with the largest single piece of Brazil's
telecommunications privatization auction last week, the Spanish
carrier doubled its holdings to more than $10 billion in Latin
America, where it was already the dominant foreign phone provider.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's immersion in the region, its main foray outside
Spain, started in 1990 with a $468 million investment to run
Chile's phone company, and spread to control of the leading
telephone companies in Argentina and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   And Telefonica's chairman, Juan Villalonga, said that after last
week's successful bid for a third of the $19 billion selloff of
most of Telebras, as the Brazilian carrier is widely known, his
company was now the ``undisputed'' leader in Latin America and any
competitors there are now just ``niche operators.''
</P>
<P>
   In the auction, which the Brazilian government held to bring
private enterprise and competition to its former state monopoly,
Telefonica agreed to spend $5 billion for control of the phone
company that serves the Sao Paulo region and $1.2 billion for the
wireless carrier that serves the regions of Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telefonica means growth,'' Villalonga, 45, said in a phone
interview on Friday from the Washington headquarters of one of his
company's international allies, MCI Communications. He flew in from
Brazil, and was meeting with MCI's chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., a
member of Telefonica's board.
</P>
<P>
   The Telefonica group, based in Madrid and fully privatized only
last year, reported 1997 profit of $1.2 billion on revenue of $15.5
billion, an 18 percent increase from 1996. The results continued
the company's steady growth of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign revenue accounted for 16 percent of company sales last
year and is expected to climb to 27 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although its overseas revenue so far is almost exclusively from
Latin America, Telefonica is counting on international alliances to
give it a foothold in the rest of Europe and the United States. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, it and MCI have been poised to build a fiber optic
network in Latin America and to provide customized
telecommunications products for Hispanic customers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It announced business deals in April 1997 with MCI and its
then-ally, British Telecommunications PLC. To do so, Telefonica
bowed out of membership in the European telecommunications
consortium, Unisource, in which AT&AMP;T, the largest phone company,
had also shown interest.
</P>
<P>
   But the planned acquisition of MCI by Worldcom, announced later
in 1997, knocked British Telecom out of the picture for Telefonica.
In March, it announced a series of MCI deals _ one of which would
make Telefonica a distributor for the combined company's European
business network. Villalonga said he is to take a seat on the
merged company's board after the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to include in their alliance Portugal
Telecom, which along with MCI made significant, separate purchases
in last week's Brazilian auction.
</P>
<P>
   Investment and mutual funds from the United States own about 35
percent of Telefonica, whose shares trade in Madrid, London, Paris
and Frankfurt and as American depository receipts on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The ADRs rose sharply last Wednesday on news of the Brazilian
auction, nearing a 52-week high of $158.125, then drifted back,
ending the week at $145.50. Monday, they eased a bit further, down
50 cents, to $145.
</P>
<P>
   Three Spanish financial institutions, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
Argentaria and La Caixa, hold about 15 percent of the company's
stock among them.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's overseas expansion has been spurred by the phased
introduction of competition into the Spanish telecommunications
market that began in 1994. The once-cozy monopoly, then Telefonica
de Espana, was founded in 1924 by International Telephone and
Telegraph and nationalized in 1945 under Franco. By the mid-1990s,
it no longer had the field to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch Communications of the United States has been part of a
cellular phone company competing domestically with Telefonica and
winning nearly 30 percent of that market.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance calls from fixed lines were opened to competition
only this year, and already Telefonica's rival for that business,
Retevision, says it has captured about 6 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga was appointed Telefonica's chairman by the Spanish
government, which still held nearly 21 percent of the company, in
June 1996, a month after his boyhood friend, Jose Maria Aznar, was
sworn in as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga, who had previously worked at Bankers Trust and
Credit Suisse First Boston in Spain, has been pushing Telefonica's
Latin American expansion while trying to protect its position as
Spain's largest company by market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Villalonga said his priority would be to build upon
the Brazilian acquisition. He pledged to double the existing six
million fixed phone lines in the Sao Paulo area within two years
and reduce years-long waiting lists for phones there.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica assumed extra debt in the Brazil deal, and Standard &AMP;
Poor's last Thursday downgraded its credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   But James Downie, an analyst with ABN Amro in London, said: ``We
are fundamentally positive on Telefonica. Debt now is relatively
cheap, and it was a one-off opportunity to get into Brazil.''

SEC ACCUSES DAIN RAUSCHER OF FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Idaho, Texas, Minn.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused
Dain Rauscher Inc. and two former employees of fraud for their
roles in underwriting bonds connected to the 1994 bankruptcy of
Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court, is the second
SEC action against a brokerage firm stemming from the bankruptcy.
In the first action, Credit Suisse First Boston and two former
employees agreed in January to pay $870,000 to settle SEC charges.
In addition, the commission is negotiating a settlement with
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. that is reported to be for a fine of less than
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC actions are distinct from lawsuits filed by Orange
County itself. Those suits, several of which have been settled
recently, generally accuse brokerage firms of selling risky
securities to the county. The SEC is concentrating on the adequacy
of disclosures made by underwriters who sold bonds issued by the
county or its municipalities to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Dain Rauscher, a major participant in municipal finance,
underwrote or was the financial adviser for 13 bond offerings,
totaling more than $980 million, by cities and school districts in
Orange County in 1993 and 1994, according to the SEC complaint. The
proceeds from the offerings were invested in an investment pool run
by Orange County's treasurer, Robert Citron. The pool suffered
heavy losses in 1994, precipitating the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC accuses Dain Rauscher of misleading investors by not
disclosing in the offering documents that the sole purpose of the
bond sales was to obtain money to invest in the Orange County pool
in the hopes of making profits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the commission contends, Dain Rauscher did not
disclose the riskiness of the pool's investments, which were highly
leveraged and subject to big losses if interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   Dain Rauscher, which is based in Los Angeles, strongly denied
all charges. ``We do not understand how the SEC can allege fraud in
these circumstances,'' the company said. It said it was not
involved with the investment pool. It also said it knew less about
the pool than the credit-rating agencies, which gave the pool their
highest ratings, and the SEC, which reviewed the pool at that time
and took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company said, all the investors who held the bonds
it underwrote were paid in full. Michael Missal, a lawyer for Dain
Rauscher, said it was common practice at the time not to disclose
that the proceeds of a bond offering were going to the investment
pool. But, he said, ``Every investor knew where they were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two former Dain Rauscher employees, who were the
investment bankers in charge of many of the offerings in question,
also denied the charges. The former employees are Virginia Horler,
57, of Moraga, Calif., and Kenneth Ough, 45, of Post Falls, Idaho.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dain Rauscher was formed in January through the merger of Dain
Bosworth of Minneapolis and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. of Dallas.
It was Rauscher Pierce that was involved in the Orange County
underwritings.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken Monday was not a surprise. Rauscher Pierce
disclosed in a quarterly filing last year that it was a focus in a
federal enforcement action related to Orange County. But talks
aimed at a settlement broke down.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, the SEC in January accused Rauscher Pierce
of defrauding investors and the state of Arizona by engaging in
``yield burning,'' in which Treasury bonds are sold to state or
local governments at artificially high prices. The company denied
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also brought an administrative action against Ms.
Horler, the former Rauscher investment banker, charging inadequate
disclosure on bonds issued by Nevada County, Calif. Ms. Horler
denies those charges, according to Missal, the lawyer. Rauscher
Pierce is also being sued by Orange County.

HOUSE PASSES SWEEEPING CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Monday succeeded where the Senate has
repeatedly failed.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives approved sweeping campaign-finance reform that
would rein in the two most criticized tools of the election
business - ``soft'' money and third-party attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort to reform the money system of U.S. elections is
not expected to get through the upper house, where Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz. has been the chief sponsor of campaign-finance
reform legislation. McCain's bill was killed by a series of
procedural maneuvers in the Senate last February, and he said
Monday that the votes are still not there to break it loose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said in a statement issued after the vote, the
House action is a hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The vote) might change some votes in the Senate and persuade
a supermajority of senators that the time is finally at hand to
reform a campaign-finance system that a clear majority of Americans
believe is corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 237-186, the House approved a measure that would
ban soft money _ that is, contributions to political parties that
are then redistributed to candidates at the party's discretion
</P>
<P>
   The House measure also would impose restrictions on election
advertising by third parties and require random audits of
campaigns. It would require that campaign-finance information be
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The strong majority vote for the proposal, which was sponsored
by Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Rep. Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., seems to guarantee that it will triumph over nine other
campaign-finance measures pending. House leaders decided to allow
whichever proposal had the most votes to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Those other measures will be debated this week, with the final
results expected before the House goes on a month-long break on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders strongly opposed the Shays-Meehan bill,
as did McCain's fellow Republicans in the Senate. On Monday, 51
Republicans defied those leaders to approve the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   None of those mavericks were in the Arizona delegation, however.
All five Republicans voted against the legislation. Rep. Ed Pastor,
the state's sole Democratic congressman, was the delegation's only
vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who handled campaign-finance matters
when he was an assistant state attorney, said the Shays-Meehan bill
has at least two strikes against it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the bill likely will increase the cost of
campaigns, as restrictions passed in earlier years in Arizona did,
Shadegg said. For another, it impedes constitutionally guaranteed
free speech with its restrictions on third-party ``issues''
advertisements, more often called attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg did manage to amend the bill. His change allows
complaints about election-law violations filed 90 days or less
before an election to go to federal district court, where judges
would be ordered to decide the issue quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, there is no pre-election punishment for a
candidate who violates the law that close to an election. &QL;

BILL TO SEEK RELIEF FOR HOME-HEALTH AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Representative James P. McGovern is expected to unveil
Tuesday a compromise bill to grant financial relief to hundreds of
home-health care agencies that have bitterly complained about
cutbacks in Medicare reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, co-sponsored by US Representative Thomas Coburn
(R-Okla.), was quietly filed Friday and has gained support from
eight Republicans and 20 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, hopes his bill will blunt
the financial blow dealt to the home health care industry when
Congress last year rolled back Medicare reimbursement for
home-health care to 2 percent less than 1994 levels. The cuts were
passed as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 in an attempt to
rein in fraud and spiraling health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Home-health care agencies in Massachusetts and senior advocates
say the cuts must be re-examined because of their tendency to
punish states that have tried to be efficient and maintain lower
costs. New England states spent an average of $4,400 in home-health
care for each patient in 1995, about $73 lower than the national
average that year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the cuts have forced some agencies out of business
and caused others to shun sicker patients with more expensive
needs.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's bill proposes three changes in reimbursement:
</P>
<P>
   _Agencies would be paid based on an equal mix of the national
average and the regional average costs of providing care. Under
current law, agencies are paid based on each agency's historical
costs, plus some adjustment for geographic differences.
</P>
<P>
   _States would receive a combined $1 billion in temporary block
grants over four years to pay agencies that care for sicker,
high-cost patients. The amount would depend on each state's share
of Medicare patients and on its use of home health services.
Massachusetts would receive roughly $30 million over four years
under that formula.
</P>
<P>
   _Medicare reimbursement rates to agencies would be raised by 3
percent over current rates. Medicare currently pays agencies 105
percent of the agency's average cost of delivering services to
patients. The bill would raise that rate to 108 percent.

 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Kay Thompson, playing a character inspired by
Diana Vreeland in the movie ``Funny Face,'' declared, ``Think
pink!'' she certainly didn't have men in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it shows how far men's wear has come that designers
are now suggesting that their customers do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Meyer, John Bartlett, John Scher and, unexpectedly, Tommy
Hilfiger saved the New York spring 1999 shows from being a
lugubrious procession of mealy suits and shorts by injecting
colorful pants, fancifully printed shirts and a mix of jackets with
surfer jams. It turns out that the designers are not so far ahead
of the men they aspire to dress this time, for the shows presented
a meeting of street wear and high fashion that was not so much
revolutionary as realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's whimsical but grounded show encapsulated the spirit
of the week. He cast lime-green hibiscus prints, a homage to Lilly
Pulitzer, in frolicky pants and sleeveless jackets, which he paired
with relaxed trousers of waxed cotton. Slipped over a pink polo
shirt bearing the designer's monogram _ he's becoming a name brand
_ was a hot-pink windbreaker and matching crisp trousers. His
jodhpurs were slimly tailored cotton trousers, which he showed
beneath crushed shirts, body-conscious ribbed sweaters or khaki
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Scher, although not as important a designer as Bartlett, lived
up to the all-but-forgotten promise of his first collections nearly
a decade ago. To see his concise, impressive line was like betting
on a sentimental favorite and watching that horse come in. Scher
showed navy-blue shirts with the full collars of a sailor's
uniform. Sailor pants invoked both the manliness and carefreeness
of sailors on shore leave. And a pink zip-front shirt jacket played
against the pale blue of rugged pants.
</P>
<P>
   The designers who consider themselves avant-garde are adding a
sparkle to men's wear, literally. Gene Meyer sprinkled sequins
across the midriff and in small circles on shirts and knit tops.
Meyer is in better control of his work than last season, when he
was oblivious to the perilously thin line between slouchy and
sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Many men's wear designers are becoming more like their
counterparts in women's wear, in that they are the customers they
design for. Interestingly, when Meyer, Bartlett and Scher came out
to take their end-of-show bows, each dressed and carried himself
like one of the mannequins on his runway.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is more convincing in this role than the attractive,
reed-thin Sandy Dalal. On any given day, Dalal seems not so much
like a designer about to take over the world as a customer for his
young, eclectic vision of pistachio-green floral shirts and
matching skinny pants, or sleeveless, V-neck sweaters paired with
pants cropped at the ankle. Like Cynthia Rowley, Dalal is not
afraid of hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Rowley offered a sweet, affecting show,
complete with bright beach towels thrown over guest chairs. She
mixed buffalo-check trouser shorts with multicolor, diagonally
striped sweaters. Suits _ traditionally the most difficult aspect
of men's wear for new designers to tame _ have come along nicely in
Ms. Rowley's hands since her first outing last season. The
collection as a whole was less clownish, yet retained her whimsical
imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the uninhibited joyfulness of collections like
Ms. Rowley's and Dalal's, Marc Jacobs struck a somber note, working
in a palette of white, khaki and mushroom gray. Still, Jacobs'
collection put him in the same casual camp as more joyful
contemporaries like Ms. Rowley. For the message among all the
seemingly effortless pairings of shirt and pants, sweater and jams,
by these designers, is that the yen for dressing up has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   What looks modern is ease. The suit has by no means breathed its
last, but as a defining element it has become the incredible
shrinking suit. As shorthand for success, the suit is a visual cue
from another era belonging to Ivan Boesky or Donald Trump. The
current cover of Fortune magazine boasts Mickey Drexler, the chief
executive of the Gap, in a white polo shirt. The previous issue
showed Bill Gates and Warren Buffet in the same uniform. To
consider this evolution is to understand Jacobs' offhand show of
lush cashmere T-shirts, camouflage pants and secretively detailed
trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Post-grunge would be a name for the change; tech fashion is
another _ clothes for the young barons of Silicon Valley and the
every-day-is-casual-Friday culture they have influenced.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, designers like Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren,
Joseph Abboud and the Hugo Boss company are still arguing for the
suitability of the suit. Ms. Karan introduced tailored suits for
the first time in her DKNY line. In her signature collection, she
layered ultraluxurious, lightweight fabrics in a jacket or a
sweater; the effect is not so evident in the look of the garment,
but in its feel. Her crinkled white suits and pants radiated ease.
And Ms. Karan has loosened her basic jacket by removing the
structured lining but retaining a sculptured shape with double
facing.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren certainly did not move the needle of men's wear by
inventing the shawl-collar sweater _ despite what his brother,
Jerry Lauren, suggested to a group of startled fashion editors last
week. But Lauren has been evolving on at least two fronts. He was
among the first to loosen up the rigid Savile Row-tailored suit.
Unquestionably more interesting is the designer's delving into
relaxed luxury in his top Purple Label line with opalescent fluid
pants, finely wrought white T-shirts and taupe suede jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren has inspired many a designer, and one who clearly aspires
to follow his footsteps is Maurice Malone. Malone had guests view
his collection as though at a museum show. With headsets attached
to a Walkman, the audience meandered through the presentation,
listening to a narrator. First came Malone's signature line of
sleek suits with multiple-flap pockets and contrasting shirts;
next, his underwear on models at a breakfast table, and finally,
his casual oversize jeans shorts and plaid shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult challenge for men's wear designers in this
moment of transition from businesslike to casual is closing the gap
between pink shirts and suits. The best in the business for now is
Hilfiger, who made as convincing a case as has ever been put on a
runway for a meeting between the sartorial, the athletic and the
romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger is emerging a mature designer, with no need to
genuflect to Lauren. Blending street wear and tailored clothes
seems organic to Hilfiger. He showed great mixes of slim floral or
batik pants with sheer shirts; long athletic nylon shorts under a
tailored jacket and emblem shirt; aerodynamic-looking zippered
jackets and drop-crotch jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger has realized that he need look no further than his own
playground for respect, and for what's next.

GOSMAN SAYS HE'LL RESIGN AS MEDITRUST CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abraham Gosman, a wily and highly successful dealmaker, will
resign as chairman and chief executive of Meditrust Cos., &UR;  &LR; his main
investment vehicle, amid a sharp stock slide at the Needham, Mass.
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gosman, 69, said Monday he would be replaced on an interim basis
by Thomas Taylor, an investor with close ties to the Bass family.
The Basses were leading investors in La Quinta Inns, a chain that
was purchased by Meditrust in a $2.65 billion transaction that
closed last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for me to smell the roses,'' Gosman said. ``I was
not pushed out of the company. I could have stayed as long as I
wanted to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Bass family could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gosman has made a fortune building, selling, and
sometimes repurchasing companies, he will step down at Meditrust at
a time when the real estate investment trust's stock has stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Meditrust shares closed at 22 9/16 Monday, down 42 percent from
a high of 39 in December. Analysts have blamed the performance on
this year's broad decline in real estate stocks and on a lukewarm
reaction to an aggressive plan expanding and reshaping Meditrust's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Meditrust, which had focused on health care-related real estate
holdings, paid $478 million in November to buy Santa Anita Cos., a
company that owned a famous horse track and special tax status.
Santa Anita was one of only four ``paired-share'' real estate
investment trusts, &UR;  &LR; or REITs, that could own property and operate
businesses on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Most real estate investment trusts pay no federal income tax as
long as they pass most of their earnings on to shareholders every
year. But they are prohibited from operating a business, such as a
hotel, in buildings they own.
</P>
<P>
   Meditrust paid a steep premium, at least $200 million, for Santa
Anita's special tax status and quickly moved to buy other
properties that could make the most of it. Gosman began to build a
golf course business and then purchased La Quinta.
</P>
<P>
   The Bass family agreed to take Meditrust stock for their La
Quinta shares and became important investors in Gosman's company.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress moved to close the paired-share loophole this
spring, just months after Meditrust had paid dearly for the
advantage. Restrictions were included in the Internal Revenue
Service bill signed into law by President Clinton two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gosman, who owns about 2 million shares of Meditrust, said he
would keep all his stock. He agreed Monday that the Santa Anita
deal had hurt the company, but said the poor REIT stock market was
mostly responsible for the Meditrust slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not disappointed the Street,'' Gosman said of investor
expectations and Meditrust's operating performance. ``The company
is making its earnings and will pay dividends for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for someone else to take it to another level,'' he
said. ``I have done all the things I want to do with the company.''

THREE YEARS AFTER SISTER'S DEATH, SIBLINGS LANGUISH IN FOSTER
CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 7th graf, Under state ..., to clarify state law; SUBS
12th graf, A court ..., with 2 grafs to clarify why it's been hard
to find foster homes for the children; ADDS background on parents,
that other children were not abused.)  (nk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The five children watched helplessly as their parents
forced their sister, Elisa Izquierdo, to drink ammonia and eat her
own feces. They looked on as their parents sexually assaulted her
and beat her until the white bones gleamed through her brown
fingers. The children survived the violence that killed Elisa, but
they landed in foster care with shattered lives and damaged
psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Child welfare officials, who investigated 6-year-old Elisa's
death in November 1995, suggested that the city sever ties between
the abusive parents and their surviving children, and have the
children adopted so they could begin to recover from the severe
psychological trauma in stable, nurturing homes.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly three years after Elisa's death, her mother,
imprisoned for the killing, still retains the legal rights to her
five surviving children, who are 5 to 13 years old. Four of the
five siblings have bounced through more than four foster homes as
city officials have fallen months behind their own timetable in
setting the children on the road to adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Elisa Izquierdo became a national symbol of all that
was wrong with child welfare in New York City, exposing the sloppy
investigations that allowed her to suffer and die while under the
city's watch. And in some ways, her siblings' long journey through
the child welfare system highlights a less sensational but far more
common problem: the experience of thousands of children who
languish in foster care for years without finding permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the median stay in foster care has declined from four
years to three years since 1996, which both city officials and
advocates for children say is still too long for many children to
wait for stability. The city wants to reduce it even further, to
below 2.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Elisa's siblings also reflects the legal and
bureaucratic barriers that often prevent child welfare officials
from quickly severing the bonds between parents and their children,
even when a parent has killed a child.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, officials had to wait 12 months before starting
the court process to terminate the parental rights of Awilda Lopez,
Elisa's mother, and Carlos Lopez, her stepfather. The law goes to
great lengths to protect the parent-child bond, making the waiting
period necessary even though Ms. Lopez had pleaded guilty to murder
and Mr. Lopez was serving a sentence for attempted assault.
</P>
<P>
   After that, child welfare officials had to prove to a judge that
the couple had also abused the surviving children, in a trial that
took several months. Even after a formal finding of abuse was
granted in 1997, it took 11 months for the city's office of Family
Court Mental Health Services to complete the psychological
evaluations needed to prove the children should never be returned
to the Lopezes, child welfare officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, finding foster parents capable of coping with the
psychologically damaged children was difficult. Less than 10
percent of all child welfare cases involve abuse, and many foster
parents were unprepared for Elisa's siblings, who had been exposed
to such extraordinary violence.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the needs of the traumatized siblings, some
foster parents simply gave up on the children, saying they could no
longer care for them, city officials familiar with the case said.
As a result, the four youngest children, who are still struggling
to erase the painful memories of the torture they witnessed, found
themselves forced to move over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only the three youngest siblings, who are 5, 6 and 7,
live together. The older children, 12 and 13, live in separate
homes, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A court ruling forbids the release of details of the five
children's behavior and psychological evaluations, but experienced
officials familiar with such cases say such children typically act
out in ways that make it difficult to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, advocates for the children say the obstacles
to finding permanent homes for children who have lived through
extreme abuse are so great that say they do not blame child welfare
officials for the lack of stability in the siblings' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were any other case, I would be arguing that the
system was working too slowly,'' said Ronald E. Richter, the deputy
director of the Manhattan office of Legal Aid's Juvenile Rights
Division, which represents the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe that the system has failed these
children,'' said Mr. Richter, who declined to discuss the details
of the case or the lives of the children he represents. ``I believe
the system has responded as well as it can to these children with
extraordinary needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter declined to describe the homes or the permanency plans
for the children, saying only that the siblings are safe and happy
in their current foster homes. But unfortunately, he said, in the
quest for stability, even explainable, understandable delays often
wreak havoc in children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lopez, who was a crack addict and a victim of domestic
violence, was twice investigated by child welfare officials for
leaving some of the siblings home alone, city records show. Lopez,
who was an alcoholic, was once investigated for leaving a child
with a relative and then disappearing for weeks. Together, they
savagely beat Elisa in front of her siblings, although early
evidence suggested that the other children had not been abused.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Besharov, a child welfare specialist who investigated
Elisa's death as a member of the city's child fatality panel and
pushed for her siblings' adoption, said he fears that their
unstable lives in foster care may ultimately have a devastating
impact on their psychological and social development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of permanency is the biggest threat to the welfare
and the safety of foster children,'' Mr. Besharov said. ``Temporary
and haphazard placements hurt children. Their emotional and
physical situations deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective ought to be to halt the emotional and physical
deterioration of abused and neglected children,'' he said. ``But
for too many children coming in contact with New York City's child
welfare system, the system doesn't arrest their downward spiral. It
sometimes accelerates it.''

PRESUMED PARENTS IN BABY MIXUP DIED IN CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to remove misleading sentence in graf 4 about the
location of the families' home towns and to clarify wording in graf
6.)  
(lh) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The recent discovery that two babies were switched
at a hospital maternity ward three years ago took a grim and even
more complicated turn Monday with the disclosure that the presumed
parents of one baby died on July 4 in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville,
where the girls were born on June 29 and June 30, 1995, declined to
identify Kevin Chittum and Tamara Whitney Rogers as the parents of
one of the switched girls. But USA Today reported in Monday's
editions that Chittum, 25, and Ms. Rogers, 19, had died in the
accident that claimed seven lives before anyone knew that their
daughter might be involved in the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Watts of Buena Vista, Va., Chittum's aunt, said Monday that
hospital authorities had informed the surviving family members that
3-year-old Rebecca was another woman's child and that another woman
was raising theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Johnson of Ruckersville approached the hospital two weeks
ago with DNA evidence that proved 3-year-old Callie Marie was not
her child. Ms. Johnson had sought the tests to establish the
paternity of Callie's presumed father and to induce him to make
child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Beck, spokeswoman for the hospital, said that the
hospital suspects the switch was not an accident and has called in
Virginia State Police to aid in its investigation. She said the
hospital has not yet named ``Family B'' _ which Ms. Watt says is
her family _ as Callie's biological parents, but that it had
dispatched a physician and a nurse to visit it.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Chittum and Ms. Rogers are pleading for
seclusion while they work through their grief over the July 4 crash
and arrange custody of the other 3-year-old, Rebecca, and the
1-year-old daughter of Chittum and Ms. Rogers, who were engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The two mothers presumably involved had known each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Whitney from the hospital as a warm and
enthusiastic person,'' Ms. Johnson said in a statement Monday
through her attorney, Cynthia A. Johnson, who is not related. ``For
the last few days, my life has been an absolute nightmare with
reporters stalking me, Callie, and members of my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to the chance to meet with the other
families and my biological daughter in private,'' she said of
Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   The crash that killed the parents raising Rebecca was the worst
in the nation this year on the fourth of July, claiming seven lives
in all. Chittum, a carpenter and a contractor, had set off early
that afternoon for a county fair with five passengers _ Ms. Rogers,
his 13-year-old sister, his 11-year-old niece from Charlottesville,
and two brothers, 10 and 13, from Lexington who had known his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in ``a very bad place'' near Roanoke, on
Interstate 81, said the Botetourt County Sheriff, Reed Kelly. It
was pouring rain, he said, and the car drove over a hump in the
road that caused it to hydroplane and cross the median, where it
hit a tractor trailer. Everyone in Chittum's car and the driver of
the truck, Jerry Douglas Gregory, 59, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The families that now care for Rebecca and her sister are big
and entrenched; the phone book for Buena Vista, population 6,500,
lists 10 Chittums and nine Rogerses. After the accident, they faced
one custody question that was troubling enough. Now, Mrs. Watts
said, they have another.

FASHION NOTES: WHO DESIGNED THAT DRESS?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HORK _ A mystery has emerged in fashion, where millions of
dollars are spent on publicity and no buzz-generating moment goes
unclaimed. Why has no designer come forward to take credit for that
dress? Yes, the one belonging to Monica Lewinsky and undergoing
tests at an FBI laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine has reported that it was a Gap dress, but a Gap
spokeswoman said Monday she could not confirm it. Experts in public
relations differed on whether the designer should come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Weisenfeld, the vice president for public relations at
Barneys New York and a former aide to Ann Stock, formerly Hillary
Rodham Clinton's social secretary, said: ``Monica is the epitome of
the bridge customer, and I can't believe a bridge designer hasn't
jumped forward to claim it for their own. What are they waiting
for?''
</P>
<P>
   But Pierre Rougier, the owner of Pierre Rougier Public Relations
Consultants, whose clients include Hermes, Narciso Rodriguez and
Richard Edwards, said: ``I would say, `Keep quiet.' If I'm a
designer, I don't want to go down as the designer who designed the
stained dress. There's something yucky about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Treifus, the senior vice president for global
communications at Calvin Klein Inc., says the industrywide silence
is easily explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you know that all the fashion houses have received
talking points?'' he said. ``We're not quite sure of the source of
the talking points _ whether they are direct from Monica Lewinsky
or from some other source _ but the first of these talking points
is, `Don't admit anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   A SUCCESSOR AT TOCCA
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tocca, the company whose lines were created and
designed by Marie-Anne Oudejans, who abruptly left it three months
ago, has hired Alexandra White, a stylist and contributing editor
at W magazine and Italian Vogue, as its creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oudejans, who has not publicly discussed in detail her
reasons for leaving Tocca, did not have a role in selecting Ms.
White, though she remains a partner in the business, said Edoardo
Mantelli, the chairman of Tocca. Ms. Oudejans could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a creative director, not a designer,''
Mantelli said. ``Tocca is a concept. It has a lot to do with our
vision. We want someone who can help us strengthen our business and
expand globally.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylists have come to exert a visible and important role in
fashion, helping to shape designers' collections. Prominent
stylists include Melanie Ward, who works with Helmut Lang; Carine
Roitfeld for Gucci, and Victoria Bartlett for Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is rare for a stylist to head a design company. Ms.
Oudejans, herself, was an exception. Once a stylist, she came to
see her fashions for Tocca sold in stores like Bergdorf Goodman and
Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROLLING NOVA'S CROWD
</P>
<P>
   NEWS YORK _ It's not every fashion show that draws the police.
But that is who showed up at the presentation for Nova by Tony
Mellilo on Thursday night at the close of the men's shows for
spring 1999. They arrived when a crowd of pedestrians joined
fashion editors and retailers blocking the street outside the
unusual show.
</P>
<P>
   The passers-by stopped and stared through glass windows into an
empty store at 100 Stanton St., part of which was decorated like a
bedroom. Inside, a lone model dressed and undressed in the line's
25-or-so soft knit sportswear pieces. The space is the site of a
Nova USA store scheduled to open this month.
</P>
<P>
   Kal Ruttenstein, the corporate fashion director of
Bloomingdale's, and Holly Adam, the fashion director for men's wear
at Bloomingdale's, cooled themselves on a bench outside the store.
Ruttenstein has ordered the collection for his store.
</P>
<P>
   The police asked Mellilo to clear a path on the sidewalk. One
confused guest spread the word _ wrongly, it turned out _ that
Mellilo was being shut down for operating without a cabaret
license.

EDITORIAL: THE PROSECUTOR WHO SPOKE UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have added a new tactic to the campaign to protect
President Clinton from an independent investigation of White House
fund raising during 1996. That tactic is punishing the
truth-tellers.
</P>
<P>
   The victim in this tale of political revenge is Charles LaBella,
who was billed as an indispensable star when Attorney General Janet
Reno brought him in to direct the Justice Department's
campaign-finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April, Reno's spokesman circulated word that LaBella had
done such a stellar job in getting the campaign investigation on
track that he would be returning to California as interim U.S.
attorney for San Diego. He dreamed of permanent appointment.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to leave last month, LaBella made a costly
mistake, which is to say that he performed his duty to the
taxpayers. As the person in Justice with deepest knowledge of the
case, LaBella said in a written report that Reno had no choice, as
a matter of law, but to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 days after LaBella's burst of candor came the news that
his interim appointment would not be made permanent, even though he
had the support of Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. Sen.
Barbara Boxer has recommended that another federal prosecutor,
Gregory Vega, get the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Union-Tribune played this as a political story of
the elective kind. Vega is president of the Hispanic National Bar
Association, and his appointment was described as an effort to
shore up Boxer with Hispanic voters in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   We see it as a different kind of political story that will send
a chilling message to assistant U.S. attorneys throughout the
country. Democratic fund raising is a no-go area for federal law
enforcement, and if you push too hard, the president's
congressional allies will make you pay.

   The New York Times was critical of LaBella's initial decision to
leave the campaign task force, but his final report did a great
service by publicizing the degree to which the government's top
law-enforcement officials view Reno as failing in her legal duty.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Boxer says politics did not enter into her
appointment and that she did not coordinate her action with the
White House. We are urged to believe that this is a matter of
coincidence and merit. For our part, we say with Sen. Fred Thompson
that this is not our first rodeo. We understand how the game is
played in Washington, and we also understand how the Democrats feel
about people who want to look closely at their 1996 money machine.
So does LaBella, now.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   When a Company Offers You `Voluntary' Health Screening  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The staff at one Bay Area technology firm recently learned the new
meaning of ``voluntary'' participation in a company-sponsored
health survey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A staffer _ who begged me not to name them or their firm _ sent
me a letter that invited workers to fill out confidential health
surveys with an independent research outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The company said this health data wouldn't become part of any
employee's file, and that the questions were only being asked to
give workers an outside assessment of their health risks.
</P>
<P>
   To get 100 percent participation in this health inquisition, the
company said all employees would have to pay $25 a month more for
their HMO coverage. But people who participated in the survey would
get a $25-a-month credit, leaving their HMO premiums unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wohl, an employee benefits attorney with Orrick
Herrington &AMP; Sutcliffe in San Francisco, said he hadn't heard of
any such company-wide health survey before, but could imagine some
good and legal reasons why it was being done.
</P>
<P>
   The company could be trying to get a lower group rate by giving
potential insurers an aggregate look at the firm's health risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that although they're presenting this as
voluntary, the raising and lowering of &UR;  &LR; the fees makes it
suspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a legal issue, as an employee relations
issue,'' he added. ``Why not just do it with the carrot instead of
with the stick?''
</P>
<P>
   This whole process sounded so Dilbert to me that I had to wonder
whether other tech firms have come up with the same bright idea of
putting their staffs through ``voluntary'' health screenings.
Please let me know.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Proud as a peacock? &LR;  NBC's multi-million stake in the Snap!,
the Internet directory, gave that C/Net spinoff a financial and
prestige boost.
</P>
<P>
   But the affiliation also puts the San Francisco-based service
under extra scrutiny, as was the case yesterday when Wired News
skewered Snap for quietly opening an adult directory _ the day
after NBC announced that it would promote Snap on network
television.
</P>
<P>
   Snap executive producer Katharine English said her staff began
reviewing sex sites months before NBC entered the picture, and that
the network had neither been consulted nor complained about Snap's
new, X-rated content.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  She said the decision to add porn to the directory, which
started July 21, was taken in recognition of the fact that 35 to 40
percent of Snap's daily queries are for ``adult content.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that level of interest, she said Snap felt it had to
address sex searches, but wanted to do so responsibly. When you
type ``sex'' into the Snap search line, the first page that comes
up lists several sex education sites, along with links to filtering
software parents can use to keep cyber-kids from the smut.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-core sites _ like Naked 4 U _ &UR;  &LR; start turning up on the
second of Snap's 25 page sex-listings.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek, the other Web site with a network partner (Disney/ABC)
was the target of a separate smut barb in a recent edition of
TheStreet.Com. The on-line financial service got a ``no comment''
from Disney and Infoseek when it asked whether the search engine
would still accept ads from hard-core porn sites _ which are said
make up more than 5 percent of online ad revenues.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Split Personality? &LR;  I can't be the only person who thinks it
odd that Wired magazine, which considers itself the paragon of Web
culture, isn't allowed to put its own name on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the state of affairs that exists three months after
publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse acquired Wired magazine. But the
sale did not include Wired's on-line properties, Wired News, the
HotWired how-to site, and the HotBot search engine &UR; , &LR;  which remain
under the control of Wired's founders Louis Rossetto and Jane
Metcalfe.
</P>
<P>
   What few outsiders understand about the sale agreement is that
it specifically prohibits Wired magazine from using the ``wired''
brand name on-line _ and Wired Digital isn't allowed to put the
valuable word on any broadcast or print property.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Wired _ be they print or digital _ cared to discuss
the irony of two corporations sharing one brand. Conde Nast,
Newhouse's magazine subsidary in New York, also declined to talk
about this delicate topic.
</P>
<P>
   But if you pumped the Wired building at 520 Third St. full of
sodium pentothol, someone would have to say what one insider told
me privately: ``This situation is untenable.''
</P>
<P>

U.S. SEEKS TO EXPEL EX-SALESMAN ACCUSED OF ROLE IN NAZI KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Justice Department accused a 79-year-old retired
businessman Monday of lying about his past as a Nazi war criminal
to enter the United States more than 40 years ago, and asked a
federal judge in Manhattan to revoke his citizenship, the first
step to his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the man, Jack Reimer, a former potato chip salesman
and restaurateur, sharply criticized the government's evidence and
said that his client, who was born in Ukraine and came to the
United States in 1952, was a prisoner of war during World War II
who had never lied to the American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But a Justice Department lawyer, Edward A. Stutman, told Judge
Lawrence M. McKenna that Reimer had been a skilled and highly
decorated commander at a Nazi SS training camp in Trawniki, Poland,
who participated in the mass execution of 50 to 60 Jews there, and
who led his men in missions to liquidate Jewish ghettos in Poland
between 1941 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will show,'' Stutman said, ``that the Trawniki
training camp was in every respect imaginable a training ground for
persecution and murder, and the defendant was one of its first
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the lawyers presented sharply contrasting accounts of his
past on the first day of his trial in federal district court,
Reimer sat impassively at the defense table, dressed casually in a
blue and gray sweater and sneakers, beside his lawyer, Ramsey
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a former attorney general in the Johnson administration,
suggested that the government had wildly exaggerated Reimer's
status in the SS, and he attacked both the accuracy and reliability
of the witnesses and historical documents Stutman said he would
introduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government speaks as if the documents are overwhelmingly
clear on these subjects, and they are just the opposite,'' Clark
told McKenna, who is hearing the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the proceedings before McKenna, Clark told
reporters that there would be no comment from his client, whom he
described as a friendly, cheerful and religious man. ``His feeling
as a religious person is that we are all tested and this is his
test,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the Justice Department's decision to
prosecute Reimer after so long, saying, ``Perhaps they're running
out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Reimer's varying accounts of his role have long been an issue of
contention. The government has introduced a transcript of a 1992
interrogation in which he acknowledged, without a defense lawyer
present, that he shot at one man in the mass killing of 50 to 60
Jews near Trawniki, and agreed with a prosecutor's suggestion that
he had ``finished him off.''
</P>
<P>
   In court, Clark, who has sought to have that testimony
suppressed, told the judge that government lawyers interviewing
Reimer ``badgered him and badgered him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reimer gave a new account in a 1997 interview with government
investigators, saying that by the time he had arrived at the pit
where the Jews had been herded for execution, all appeared to be
already dead. Reimer said that he fired one shot, directing it away
so that it would not hit any of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Stutman said that the government would present detailed evidence
_ including the statements of two of the Trawniki guards at the
scene _ to prove that Reimer was not only in command of other armed
Trawniki guards there but that he and the others all fired their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer's new version, ``in which he changes the trajectory of
his bullet, does not diminish his personal role in this process of
persecution,'' Stutman added.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Does Your Net Provider Eavesdrop?  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
   Q: We live in a small town. I know my Internet service provider.
Can he easily ``eavesdrop'' on my Internet activities? Does he know
which Web sites I visit? Can he read my incoming and outgoing
e-mail?
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: Dear paranoid: Yes, he can. According to the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C., it's not hard
technically for an ISP to track the Web wanderings of customers.
But EPIC Policy Director David Banisar said most ISPs _ even small
ones _ are unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average ISP probably isn't doing it just because it's
fairly burdensome,'' said EPIC policy director David Banisar. ``It
would take up a lot of space and slow down their systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have had Windows 98 since the day it was released and find
it to be absolutely no improvement over Windows 95. Actually, I
feel I was better off with Windows 95 and would like to uninstall
the 98 version. But after warnings from friends that I could lose
other needed items or create new problems by uninstalling, I am
really afraid to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fear not. Uninstalling Windows 98 is a quick, painless
experience that restores your system to the way it was before you
upgraded. However, to remove the new system, you must have saved
the old one. If you selected the Save Your System Files during the
upgrade process, you're in business. Go to Start/Settings/Control
Panel and double-click Add/Remove Programs. Scroll down until you
get to the option for uninstalling Windows 98. Select it, and click
Add/Remove.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of other situations that prevent you from
uninstalling Windows 98. You can't do it if the operating system is
installed on a compressed hard disk. And if you converted your disk
to FAT32 after installing Windows 98, you're also out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hate being on somebody's Buddy List in America Online. I
find the interruptions extremely annoying when people send me
instant messages. How can I stop receiving messages from my
so-called buddies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's what to do: Use the keyword ``Buddy'' to go to the
Buddy List Setup box. Then click Privacy Preferences at the bottom.
Here you'll find a number of options letting you keep people from
adding you to their buddy lists. You can filter out just specific
users you don't want as buddies, or if you really feel anti-social,
you can block everybody. By the way, I agree with you, there's
nothing as irksome as getting an unsolicited greeting from someone
online.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm the only one who uses my computer, and I neither need nor
want a Windows password. So I'd love to get rid of that Password
box that always comes on the screen before Windows 95 boots up. Is
there any way to eliminate this minor but persistent irritant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Here's how. First, delete the file that stores your
password. It has the same name as your user name, followed by the
extension .pwl. So if your user name is Jodie, the file will be
named Jodie.pwl. Go to Windows Explorer in the Windows Program
menu, and you'll find the .pwl file in the Windows folder.
Right-click it, and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.
</P>
<P>
   Now restart the computer. This time, when you see the Windows
Password dialog box, don't enter anything into the space for the
password. Just click OK. This will assign a blank password, and you
should not see the password prompt again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I send a resume to a company by e-mail without having
to type it into the message itself? And how can I be sure they'll
be able to read it?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you want to do is send the resume as an attachment. All
e-mail programs let you attach files to e-mail messages. To make
sure the file is readable at the other end, the best thing is to
create it in Microsoft Word for Windows _ the word processor used
by the majority of companies.
</P>
<P>
   By sending the resume as an attached Word file, you can fire off
a resume that looks just like one you'd send in the mail or deliver
in person, complete with boldfacing, underlining, italics and
special margins.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the Week &QC; 
PalmPilot users: Wouldn't it be great if you could see today's (and
even tomorrow's) appointments plus your To-Do list each time you
started your PalmPilot or Palm III? Well, you can with TealGlance,

CHARGES OF FRAUD IN MEXICAN GUBERNATORIAL BALLOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Deletes second graph, which stated that details of how the
PRD would challenge the vote are unknown, and adds new 6th graph
with information on how the PRD will challenge the election
results. No other changes.)  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On Monday, a day after voting in the southern
state of Oaxaca, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution
challenged preliminary returns that showed its candidate for
governor had come in second, saying the balloting was marred by
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 90 percent of the ballots counted Monday by
Oaxaca's State Electoral Institute, the official returns showed
that the candidate of President Ernesto Zedillo's governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had received 48.5
percent of the votes. The Party of the Democratic Revolution, or
PRD, had 37.5 percent, and several other parties had a total of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those official returns approximated the results of two exit
polls conducted on Sunday by Mexican television networks. The PRI
candidate, Sen. Jose Murat, claimed victory late Sunday and
celebrated with mariachi music in the central plaza of Oaxaca's
state capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the PRD president, challenged
the PRI's victory claims. He cited a third exit poll, conducted by
the private Rosenblueth Foundation, which predicted on Sunday that
the PRD would defeat the PRI by 38.1 to 36.9 percent. He also said
the Oaxaca balloting had been marred by vote buying and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say there was a free election in Oaxaca,'' Lopez
Obrador said. ``We don't accept the results.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his party would challenge the results before Mexico's
electoral tribunals. But he did not call for the type of popular
protests that the party has used in other cases to challenge
election results.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxaca's 3.2 million people speak a dozen indigenous languages
and are atomized into 570 townships, far more than any other
Mexican state. Many villages are in remote mountain passes or rain
forests with primitive communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinarily difficult to establish modern voting
methods in a state like Oaxaca,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a college
professor who has worked to prevent vote theft in many states.
``There are still wide margins there for electoral fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the official results' similarity with the networks'
exit polls bolstered their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ponce, who helped organize the Rosenblueth exit poll,
said his foundation had interviewed 25,000 Oaxaca voters, a broader
sample than that consulted by the two networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy Campos Esquerra, who organized the Televisa network's
exit poll, said, ``I'd put my hands in the fire for our results.
They were very well done.''
</P>
<P>
   In other elections Sunday, the PRI won the governorship of the
Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, and the National Action Party won in
the central state of Aguascalientes, where the PRI had never
previously lost.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Ascend Seals Deal For Stratus  
   
 By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Ascend Communications made a bid yesterday in the high-stakes poker
game to help create the next-generation network that will carry
both voice and data communications.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shrugging off Wall Street's skepticism, the Alameda company made
its second cross-country acquisition, with an $822 million
stock-swap deal for Stratus Computer, a Marlboro, Mass., maker of
telephone switching systems.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend, which manufactures networking equipment used by
telephone companies and Internet service providers, said the merger
will accelerate its move to create a combined voice-data network.
</P>
<P>
   Observers predict that such a network could cut costs for
telephone chatters, Internet surfers and users of demanding
applications such as video-conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transaction opens up a $10 billion new market opportunity
for Ascend's products now served almost exclusively by traditional
telecom-equipment suppliers,'' said Mory Ejabat, Ascend president
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was considerably less enthusiastic when rumors
surfaced about the deal last week. On Friday, Ascend's shares
plunged $7, or nearly 14 percent, to close at $44.47, largely
because of fears that the acquisition could slow down Ascend's
strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market said the same thing when we acquired Cascade last
year,'' Ejabat said yesterday. Ascend's shares plunged 22 percent
in one day on news of its 1997 deal to buy Cascade Communications,
which makes networking equipment. But the deal turned out to be a
winner, accounting for some major contracts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Ascend's shares rose $2.34, more than 5 percent, to
$46.81. It was the most active U.S. stock, with volume of 20.4
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stratus' shares jumped $4.75 yesterday to close at $33.63.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend itself has been considered an attractive takeover
candidate, possibly by telecom equipment vendors like Lucent of New
Jersey or Ericsson of Sweden. Rumors of Ascend being acquired were
heightened by the merger in June of telecommunications giant
Northern Telecom and Bay Networks, a Santa Clara data networking
company.
</P>
<P>
   That deal also was designed to provide the technology to create
a combined voice-data network _ considered essential to compete in
the telecommunications business, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, there was talk of data-voice convergence.
Now, the rubber is hitting the road here,'' said John Armstrong, an
analyst with Dataquest in San Jose. ``Either you keep up with the
pack or you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Having someone like Stratus or someone else who knows
telecommunications is the opening bid'' in the game,'' said Michael
King, an analyst with Meta Group in Burlingame.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned whether Stratus was the right choice
for Ascend. The Massachusetts company has been struggling with weak
demand in Asia. Last month, it said it will cut 350 jobs, or 15
percent of its workforce, and it reported a second-quarter loss and
a 20 percent drop in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend said it will sell off all of Stratus' businesses that
don't have to do with telecommunications, including its
financial-services software business. It plans to absorb only about
400 Stratus employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ejabat said he expects the Stratus purchase to boost Ascend's
earnings in 1999 to $1.70 a share next year on combined revenue of
$2.3 billion. Analysts expected $1.60 a share, according to First
Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the transaction, expected to close in the fall, each share of
Stratus will be exchanged for .75 shares of Ascend, based on
Ascend's closing price last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend will take charges of $300 million to $350 million for
research and development and $80 million to $100 million for
acquisition expenses in the fourth quarter related to the purchase.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   `Cybercards' Are Long on Action But Longer on Downloading  
   
 By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A new batch of trading cards hit the market this year, but they are
a far cry from the cardboard kind that come attached to a pack of
bubble gum.
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't store them in a shoe box, either.
</P>
<P>
   Complete with sound, full-motion graphics and multiple pull-down
stats windows, these are digital trading cards _ computer files you
download from the Web _ from New York-based CyberAction.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech collectibles actually are multimedia applications,
ranging in size from 200 to 800 kilobytes, that can only be viewed
with the company's free CyberViewer program. They cost $3.95 per
four-card set.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the cards struck CyberAction founder Marty Marion
in the middle of a plane flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting across the aisle from this 7-year-old kid, and
he was playing with his Supermonster trading card as if it was real
_ making growling noises and pretending the card was flying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got me thinking how much you could do with sound and
video to make trading cards more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is something that Marion has dubbed ``cybercards.''
</P>
<P>
   CyberAction has struck a wide range of image-licensing deals, so
there already are dozens of cybercards. You can collect digital
cards for Major League Baseball players like Ken Griffey Jr. and
Mark McGwire, and for Major League Soccer stars including Carlos
Valderrama. There's even a set for Xena: Warrior Princess and her
one-time rival Hercules.
</P>
<P>
   Sets featuring NFL players and Star Trek characters will be
available later this year, according to Marion.
</P>
<P>
   CyberAction has been selling about four or five sets of cards a
day since their January launch, Marion said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cards can be downloaded from  &LR; www.cybercards.com.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The required site registration, which includes a name, e-mail
address, ZIP code and gender, is fairly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the download process is not.
</P>
<P>
   The company is trying to make the cybercards difficult to copy,
resulting in a very tedious download process.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you buy a new cybercard, you also have to download a
``key file,'' which lets only a user who knows your password and is
working on your computer open the card.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to download, and then execute, an application to
install each card on your system. If you don't have Apple QuickTime
2.12 on your system, you have to download that. Finally, you have
to install an ``update key'' file every time you subsequently view
the card.
</P>
<P>
   So even armed with a Chronicle computer systems manager and a
corporate T-1 line, the download process for a single card took
this reporter almost an hour _ considerably longer than
CyberAction's estimate that downloading one card should take about
10 to 15 minutes with a 28.8 Kbps modem.
</P>
<P>
   The company currently is working to simplify the process so that
the key file downloads automatically, according to a spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cards and their accompanying files finally were
downloaded, the four sampled by The Chronicle were impressive. All
had good-quality, well-selected graphics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Xena: Warrior Princess card features a
20-second clip from the show in which the heroine kickboxes and
fences her way through a group of marauders on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   The Don Mattingly card shows Mattingly swinging away in
slow-motion, accompanied by real crowd sounds and an announcer
shouting, ``In '87, the records fell ... a homer in eight-straight
games and six grand slams on the season.''
</P>
<P>
   When you click on the lower right-hand corner of any of the
cards, it flips over and you can choose from menus like ``lifetime
statistics,'' ``trivia game'' or, for Xena, ``legend'' and
``lore.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why the products would be especially appealing
to kids, a fact which might concern some parents, given how simple
it is to buy them (if not download them) off the site. You don't
need to enter a credit card, just a phone number.
</P>
<P>
   The site does have a prominent message that flashes, ``Hey
Kids,'' then tells them to get their parents' permission before
buying anything.
</P>
<P>
   It also directs the young collectors to a form letter they can
print and give to their parents to help their cause.
</P>
<P>
   (It starts out ``To the World's Greatest Parent'' and ends with
a list of potential bribes like ``being nice to my brother/sister''
and ``cleaning the kitty-litter tray.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although nobody can download more than two sets of cards a week
using just a phone number, a kid could rack up a pretty high phone
bill ($32 a month) before the extra charges attracted adult
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Marion's response: ``That's better than an extra $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   To give kids a more honest way to get the cards, Marion is
setting up a program that would let parents prepay for a kids'
``card allowance'' on a credit card.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The problem with what Victor Aviles does is that when
people hear about it they think one word: gigolo. This may be
because of the tender circumstances. You hold a woman in your arms
_ a succession of women, actually; Aviles estimates in the hundreds
_ and with the moon and the music people assume what they consider
to be the inevitable, while in truth, doing the inevitable will get
you put off the ship at the next port. (In the Catskills, one
hears, they are more understanding.)
</P>
<P>
   Aviles is a dance host.
</P>
<P>
   And while Aviles has had women put room keys and phone numbers
and cash into the pockets of his white dinner jacket, he sees his
job as taking care of the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to love it,'' Aviles says. ``You can be taking on an
impossible task. There were 50 single ladies on my cruise and two
single guys _ of course those two guys had a wonderful time _ and
six dance hosts, and I believe all the ladies left that cruise
saying, `Wow, I had a great time with these guys!' I'm not saying I
took this on by myself, but if I had to, I would have. There are so
many beautiful ladies you can spend time with, no problem. But what
about the others? If you don't like that, it's going to be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Aviles saying he could have done more? Should have done more?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say I could have done more,'' Aviles says. ``I say I
did a lot more than I thought I could do. On a cruise you start at
5 o'clock cocktail parties, then we go until midnight. On dance
weekends in the Catskills, the only meal you don't dance through is
breakfast. I have the piece of chicken next to my mouth, a lady
comes over and says, `Vic, dance the mambo with me.' I'm thinking:
`Lady, give me a break. At least let me swallow the chicken.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If life were fair, there would be sufficient men to dance with
the ladies when they went on expensive vacations, but as it is not,
there are dance hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Aviles, age 53, a former New York City police detective.
Aviles spends his summer as the recreation director and dance host
at Sunny Oakes hotel in the Catskills; last April, Aviles worked as
a dance host on the liner Rotterdam, from New York to Lisbon. For
this, Aviles receives a free cruise, but he has to pay $25 a day to
the agency that books him.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships have rules. Hosts must be single. ( Aviles is
divorced.) Hosts must sign an agreement not to have a romantic
relationship with the guests. It is doubtful this agreement is
always honored _ hosts average four cruises before quitting, Aviles
says, either because they cannot take having to be continuously
``on'' or because they find someone.
</P>
<P>
   Aviles, who admits to having dated women he met while working in
the Catskills, has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women have tried to buy him, offered him trips,
offered him apartments, but he can't be bought,'' says Evelyn
Meier, who has taught and danced with Aviles for 12 years. ``He's
always got a girlfriend, sometimes two, but he's not a player in
that sense. For him, it's about something else. He always watches
to see who isn't dancing. I've seen him dance with women who have
never danced in their lives, who are shy or pudgy. He takes them
out on the floor and presents them and for one moment, they're
Ginger Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a dance host? Aviles, who grew up in East Harlem,
credits a movie _ and the Police Department. It is possible that
being responsible for his mother also contributed. Aviles' father
was absent. Aviles worked from the time he was 10. He also joined a
gang. At 15, Aviles says, he saw ``West Side Story'' being filmed
in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sharks and the Jets,'' Aviles says. ``They're dancing and
snapping their fingers. I remember walking down the street trying
to copy it. Unfortunately, dancing was something tough guys do not
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviles married and joined the police department. After five
years on the force, he was tapped by internal affairs to get close
to two policemen. The officers were taking dance lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first dance was the tango,'' Aviles says. ``They give me
this beautiful dance instructor. She says, `Vic, this dance is all
in the body _ we have to have close, close contact.' I'm thinking,
`Where have I been?' ''
</P>
<P>
   After 21 years on the force, Aviles retired. Determined that his
next career would be ``totally nonviolent,'' Aviles spent 12 years
as a massage therapist. Four years ago, Ms. Meier said, Aviles was
approached by agents for the cruise lines to be a dance host. He
declined because his mother was ill. Last year, after his mother
died, Aviles took his first cruise job. He lives in a modest,
rent-controlled apartment on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Aviles enjoy more, dancing or making the ladies
happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a combination, but if I had to choose, I would
say making the ladies happy,'' Aviles says. ``To make her feel and
look as if she is more beautiful than she is, a better dancer than
she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if I'm a drug and I'm giving them this high. A woman
is sitting there with a frown on her face like the heavens have
fallen and I just extend my hand and say, `May I have this dance?'
and I bring her on to the dance floor, she's smiling, it's like a
miracle. I think, `Wow, that's unbelievable I can do this.'''

EDITORIAL: WELCOME TO GRENADA, CASTRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   A dictator who rules a country as long as Fidel Castro has
governed Cuba sometimes gets to edit the history he helped create.
Castro did just that over the weekend when he visited Grenada, the
tiny Caribbean island the United States invaded almost 15 years ago
in the name of preventing Cuban contamination in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Castro clearly savored the irony of his warm official greeting
by the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell. He was welcomed with steel bands, a 21-gun salute and an
official thank-you for Cuba's help in building the airport that
Washington once viewed as a dangerous extension of Cuba's military
reach into the eastern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader also got positive welcomes in Jamaica and
Barbados, the first two stops in his tour of the English-speaking
Caribbean. Six of the area's prime ministers have visited Havana in
the past year and a half, and many of them are now pressing for
Cuba's admission to the 16-nation Caribbean Community, a regional
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Further straining American ties with the Caribbean is a 90
percent drop in U.S. aid for the region between 1985 and 1995. Cuba
has been quick to move into the breach with modest but appreciated
programs of medical and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress continues to treat Cuba as though the Cold
War had not ended. The Helms-Burton law of 1996, even though the
Clinton administration has been able to waive some of its most
noxious provisions, denies the White House needed flexibility to
modify America's 36-year-old economic embargo against Cuba to take
account of changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   That embargo has failed to shake Castro's hold on power and
hurts ordinary Cubans. It also runs counter to a theme of American
foreign policy today, namely that increased trade and investment
can be a useful mechanism for encouraging democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   Despite harsh persecution by the Castro dictatorship, democrats
within Cuba are pressing to expand the narrow legal boundaries of
permitted political expression. The United States should reinforce
their efforts to open up Cuban society by increasing its own
official and unofficial contacts with the Cuban people. Isolation
does not work.

SPIELBERG SHOOTS ERNIE'S WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A long, slow tracking shot in the movie ``Saving Private Ryan''
shows Omaha Beach in the aftermath of the D-Day invasion. It's a
picture of horror and waste and sacrifice, painted in heartbreaking
detail. If you've read the dispatches of Ernie Pyle, you know what
it looked like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong, swirling tides of the Normandy coast line shifted
the contours of the sandy beach as they moved in and out,'' he
wrote. ``They carried soldiers' bodies out to sea, and later they
returned them. They covered corpses of heroes with sand, and then
in their whims they uncovered them.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . .There in a jumbled row for mile on mile were soldiers'
packs. There were socks and shoe polish, sewing kits, diaries,
Bibles, hand grenades. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There were toothbrushes and razors, and snapshots of families
back home staring up at you from the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . .As I plowed out over the wet sand, I walked around what
seemed to be a couple of pieces of driftwood sticking out of the
sand. But they weren't driftwood. They were a soldier's two feet.
He was completely covered except for his feet; the toes of his GI
shoes pointed toward the land he had come so far to see, and which
he saw so briefly.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's film is as good as the critics say it is, but
it's not the first time World War II has been presented honestly.
Pyle did that.
</P>
<P>
   He did it for millions of readers, six days a week, year after
year, in Africa and Europe and the Pacific. He did it by
transforming the charts and graphs of war into a map of the human
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Capt. Miller, played by Tom Hanks in ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' could be Capt. Henry T. Waskow from Pyle's most
famous column. The fictional Sgt. Horvath, played by Tom Sizemore,
could be Sgt. Frank ``Buck'' Eversole, about whom Pyle wrote, ``The
years roll over him and the war becomes his only world, and battle
his only profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The other characters in the movie _ Ryan and the soldiers sent
to save him _ are all there in Pyle's columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't warriors,'' he wrote. ``They were American boys
who by mere chance of fate had wound up with guns in their hands,
sneaking up a death-laden street in a strange and shattered city in
a faraway country in a driving rain. They were afraid, but it was
beyond their power to quit. They had no choice. They were good
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   A scene very much like that is in Spielberg's movie. The
difference being, Pyle's soldiers was real.
</P>
<P>
   And they were ``good boys,'' too, but not perfect ones.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote once, ``They had been fighting and moving constantly
forward on foot for nearly three weeks without rest _ sleeping out
on the ground, wet most of the time, always tense, eating cold
rations, seeing their friends die. One of them came up to me and
said, almost belligerently, `Why don't you tell the folks back home
what this is like? All they hear about is victories and a lot of
glory stuff. They don't know that for every hundred yards we
advance somebody gets killed. Why don't you tell them how tough
this life is?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Pyle did. Steven Spielberg did, too, though with a lot
more gore than Pyle included in his columns, partly because it
wouldn't have made it past military censors and partly because he
didn't need it. His message got through.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle was killed by Japanese machine gun fire Apr. 18, 1945, on a
Pacific island called Ie Shima. He left behind books like ``Here Is
Your War'' and ``Brave'' ``Men.'' I found my father's generation in
them. I know how lucky I am. There's also a fine biography called
``Ernie Pyle's War'' by James Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the personal papers discoved after Pyle's death were notes
for an unfinished column about V-E Day. He writes that ``in the
joyousness of high spirits it is easy for us to forget the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A movie like ``Saving Private Ryan'' may help some people to
remember. But it's not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as there's a library in town. &QL;

COX GOES OUTSIDE TO START JETS CAREER, BUT NOT YET AS TARTING
LINEBACKER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ For the seven previous years, Bryan Cox has
been one of the National Football League's outstanding linebackers,
mostly in the middle. Monday, he began his career with the Jets,
not as their new starting middle linebacker, but as a backup on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   This unexpected, and perhaps temporary, turn of events unfolded
during the Jets' morning practice here at their Hofstra University
complex. When the first defense took the field for a nine-on-seven
drill, Dwayne Gordon was in the middle, James Farrior on the
weakside and Mo Lewis on the strongside. When the second defense
took over, Pepper Johnson was in the middle, Chad Cascadden on the
weakside and Cox, wearing his familiar neck collar, on the
strongside.
</P>
<P>
   That means that with the start of the season five weeks away,
Cox, a 30-year-old four-time Pro Bowl player, is the backup to
Lewis, who is perhaps the Jets' best defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the role many people envisioned when the Jets
signed Cox to a one-year, $500,000 contract on Saturday, a day
after their starting middle linebacker, Marvin Jones, tore two
ligaments in his left knee and was lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells said he planned to keep Cox on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants a chance to be a starter,'' Parcells said. ``I told
him I'll go by what I see. I said I would expand his role, and I
think he could play in the middle in substitute formations,'' which
means nickel and dime defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that at this stage of Cox's career, outside
linebacker might be better for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would go one-on-one with the tight end,'' Parcells said,
``and I think he can certainly compete with tight ends well. I
think the coverages are simpler here. That allows him to be a
rusher from the outside, and he does that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, 6 feet 4 inches and 250 pounds, was the best available
free-agent linebacker. He has played seven often-tumultuous years
as a pro, the first five with the Miami Dolphins and the last two
with the Chicago Bears. His wild temper has led to penalties, fines
and angry coaches and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 season, when Don Shula retired as the Dolphins'
coach and Jimmy Johnson replaced him, Cox left the Dolphins as a
free agent and signed a four-year contract with the Bears. After
two years, they terminated the contract, disappointed that he was
not getting more sacks and upset over his outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   So Cox was available and the Jets needed a middle linebacker.
They have Pepper Johnson, an old favorite of Parcells', but Johnson
is 34 and recovering from quadriceps surgery. They also have
Gordon, a sixth-year career backup.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 television cameras recording every moment, Cox said he
was happy with his new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the middle hides a little of my weakness,'' he
said, ``because I'm not the greatest cover guy. I'm giving away
something in coverage, but when you ask running blocks to block me,
you're playing to one of my strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said if I wouldn't be a starter, I would quit. But
I'm going to play a lot of plays here. Logistically, I'm not going
to be a starter, but I'm going to have a lot of plays. Instead of
1,300 plays a year, I'll have 600 or 700.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first practice as a Jet, Cox wiped out Richie Anderson
for a loss on a running play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not giving me anything,'' Cox said of Parcells. ``I'm
like a young player. I'm going to play special teams and I've got
to earn everything I get. I still think I'm a quality linebacker.
When I get in shape, there are going to be some plays for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a team to work out with in the off season, it may take
Cox weeks to get in game shape. Cox said he had been playing
softball and golf daily, but not working out. He said he hadn't run
in two and a half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells said Cox was the top linebacker on his list of
emergency replacements, and now that he is here, the coach has
options. When Parcells was asked who would start at middle
linebacker, he was vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' he said. ``I would say now it's Dwayne Gordon.
I'm not counting Pepper out. I think we can play with the guys
we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   And that includes Bryan Cox, wherever he plays.

could be Sgt. Frank ``Buck'' Eversole, about whom Pyle wrote, ``The
years roll over him and the war becomes his only world, and battle
his only profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The other characters in the movie _ Ryan and the soldiers sent
to save him _ are all there in Pyle's columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't warriors,'' he wrote. ``They were American boys
who by mere chance of fate had wound up with guns in their hands,
sneaking up a death-laden street in a strange and shattered city in
a faraway country in a driving rain. They were afraid, but it was
beyond their power to quit. They had no choice. They were good
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   A scene very much like that is in Spielberg's movie. The
difference being, Pyle's soldiers was real.
</P>
<P>
   And they were ``good boys,'' too, but not perfect ones.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote once, ``They had been fighting and moving constantly
forward on foot for nearly three weeks without rest _ sleeping out
on the ground, wet most of the time, always tense, eating cold
rations, seeing their friends die. One of them came up to me and
said, almost belligerently, `Why don't you tell the folks back home
what this is like? All they hear about is victories and a lot of
glory stuff. They don't know that for every hundred yards we
advance somebody gets killed. Why don't you tell them how tough
this life is?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Pyle did. Steven Spielberg did, too, though with a lot
more gore than Pyle included in his columns, partly because it
wouldn't have made it past military censors and partly because he
didn't need it. His message got through.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle was killed by Japanese machine gun fire Apr. 18, 1945, on a
Pacific island called Ie Shima. He left behind books like ``Here Is
Your War'' and ``Brave'' ``Men.'' I found my father's generation in
them. I know how lucky I am. There's also a fine biography called
``Ernie Pyle's War'' by James Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the personal papers discoved after Pyle's death were notes
for an unfinished column about V-E Day. He writes that ``in the
joyousness of high spirits it is easy for us to forget the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A movie like ``Saving Private Ryan'' may help some people to
remember. But it's not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as there's a library in town. &QL;

BROWN'S MISSION IS A HOME ON GIANTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gary Brown walked alone through the campus at the
Giants' training camp, still feeling his way around at SUNY-Albany
and feeling his way around the third franchise he has found himself
with in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unfair to term Brown a journeyman just by
looking at the stops he has made in his career, not after he rushed
for 1,002 yards and an American Football Conference-best 5.1 yards
per carry with the Houston Oilers in 1993, and not after he
accumulated 945 yards on the ground for the San Diego Chargers last
season. But even Brown is unsure just how a player like himself has
been unable to find a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, because you see guys who have had success and they
seem to stay with the same team for years,'' Brown said after the
morning session Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't my thing, so I just have to go out and make
the best of my situation. Hopefully, I can play well again this
year. I look forward to playing well this year, and then maybe I
can play here for a couple more years and maybe even retire here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would be pleased to see the 29-year-old running back
find a home. They signed him to a one-year, $400,000 contract as an
unrestricted free agent on April 21 after making their way through
the draft without finding a running back. With Rodney Hampton set
free, Brown could become the primary running back with his strength
and skills running between the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   A Cinderella story like Brown's never would make the silver
screen. There are too many twists and turns and disappointments
scattered throughout the story.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-round draft pick out of Penn State in 1991, he carried
the ball just 27 times in his first two seasons and had only 16
carries in the first eight games in 1993. Then an injury to another
player provided him with his first start, and Brown responded with
166 yards rushing, earning AFC offensive player of the week honors.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that up with a 194-yard performance the next week
and AFC offensive player of the month honors.
</P>
<P>
   But his production slid to 648 yards rushing in 1994 and 293 the
following year. Overweight, overconfident and undermotivated, he
was waived by the Oilers on April 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than growing inspired by the turn of events, Brown sat
home and sulked, ballooning to nearly 40 pounds over his playing
weight of 225. When the 1996 season began, Brown was at home in
Williamsport, Pa. He remained there in a funk all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat around the house,'' Brown said. ``I took the wrong
attitude. I blamed the Oilers. I'd sit around watching TV and
eating. Finally, I was watching the AFC playoff games and I
realized I wanted to be back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered sometimes if I would be back. But once you decide
you're going to play, you have to have total confidence. When you
decide you're going to go back, you have to change your whole life
style completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this, can't eat that. I couldn't hang out
anymore. So my whole life style had to change. If I hadn't done
that, I wouldn't have been able to make it back. Once I decided I
was going to do it, I had no doubt I was going to make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made it back, signing with the Chargers and turning in
another successful season. But in the final game of the season, one
that Brown does not enjoy talking about, he was kept on the bench
against his wishes, falling short of the 1,000-yard plateau and a
$200,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chargers re-signed his predecessor there, Natrone
Means, Brown realized his days were numbered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Diego thing is something I had no control over,''
Brown said. ``Those things happen. I wanted to go for a thousand.
But it's in the past. I don't want to talk about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown opted to accept the Giants' offer, placing opportunity
ahead of money, believing that he could earn playing time in a
backfield already crowded with Tiki Barber, Tyrone Wheatley and
Charles Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I proved myself,'' Brown said. ``I think at this
point, I wanted to be in a good situation where I can go out and
just continue to do the things I can do. I took a lot less money
than I could have had somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that is better for me. It's a situation where I
have to prove myself and a situation where I can go out and play
well and contribute. You feel a little uncomfortable being here at
first. But the guys help and I'm feeling really good with how I'm
playing. I want to learn. If I just go out and play hard and do the
things I do, that's the only thing I can control.'' &QL;

NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HE TENDED SAYS FAREWELL TO SLAIN OFFICER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While dignitaries, friends and family members
gathered behind the closed doors of the First Central Baptist
Church on Monday to mourn the death of Police Officer Gerard
Carter, a small group of children formed a tight circle outside the
Staten Island church and bowed their heads in silent prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in T-shirts and shorts, they were not nearly as orderly
or solemn as the thousands of uniformed officers who lined Wright
Street six and eight deep as far as the eye could see. But their
grief was in some ways more tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to play baseball before I met him,'' said
Cortne Daniels, 10, a member of the Stapleton-Parkhill housing
police unit softball team, part of a league to which Carter
dedicated a great deal of his spare time. ``I'm going to remember
how he was a good coach and how he never lost his temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 28, died early Friday, four days after he had been shot
by a local youth, police say, while patrolling the same streets he
had grown up on. While it is common these days for New York City
police officers to go home to the suburbs after pounding a beat,
Carter chose to stay in his old neighborhood, and colleagues and
fellow Staten Islanders said his love and knowledge of his home
turf showed in his work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Calvin Rice, pastor of the First Central Baptist
Church, recalled the times he gazed across the street into the
Carters' backyard and watched as Gerard Carter grew from a
6-year-old learning how to ride a bicycle into a strapping
teen-ager playing football for the Port Richmond High School Red
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then it was like it happened overnight _ and he started
watching over me,'' said Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said Carter had chosen to become a police officer in part
because his father, Gaston, had been an officer for 23 years, but
also because ``he realized that the city needed a cop with heart, a
cop with feeling and emotion for the people he served.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him wept to think that a man who worked
tirelessly to teach good citizenship to children from the projects
would die at the hands of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We honor him as a true hero because he was always doing and
giving more than what was expected,'' Police Commissioner Howard
Safir said. ``The brutal violence of one man cannot take away from
his legacy. And not far from here there are children who will grow
up to be better people because of the example left by one man,
Officer Gerry Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while patrolling the West Brighton Houses on the night of
July 26 that Carter and his partner approached a teen-ager, Shatiek
Johnson, 17, who they believed was wanted for murder. According to
police, Johnson drew a gun and shot Carter through the windshield
of his patrol van. He was the third New York City police officer
killed in the line of duty this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to file a second-degree murder charge against
Johnson, who was paroled in April after serving two years of a
three-year manslaughter sentence for beating a homeless man to
death when he was 15. Johnson also faces second-degree murder
charges in the July 16 shooting death of another man on Staten
Island.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police Officer Larry Olinsky, a member of the Staten Island
housing unit, touched the mourners when he tearfully addressed
Carter's 6-year-old son, Louis. ``I know you can't understand this
now,'' he said. ``But your father was a hero. And all those
superheroes that I know you like to play with, even if you put them
all together, they would be nothing compared to what your father
meant to all the people in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that while Carter had been on the
police force for only five years, he had accomplished more than
some officers can hope to in a 20-year career. In his time on the
police force, Carter was responsible for 76 arrests, received two
commendations and was named outstanding officer of the year by the
Staten Island Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Lydia Roman, a family friend, said that she
appreciated Giuliani's call to overhaul the state's parole system
to keep felons like Johnson in prison for as long as possible but
that much more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more of what Gerard was doing, working with them when
they're young,'' she said. ``And we need more officers like him
stationed in their own neighborhoods. He knew the streets, he knew
the problems and he was trying to make a difference.''

EDITORIAL: A TRIUMPH FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the numbers themselves sent the most powerful
message. After a year of false promises, poison pills and delays,
the House approved the Shays-Meehan bill to clean up the corrupt
campaign fund-raising system by a decisive vote of 237-186. With 51
Republicans defying Newt Gingrich and supporting reform, the vote
shattered the idea that campaign reform is a partisan issue.
</P>
<P>
   Also demolished were the predictions of Republican leaders and
worshippers of conventional wisdom in Washington that reform was
dead. The measure now stands an excellent chance of surviving the
tests ahead and winning approval as the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House action was a milestone in a journey that began with
the first disclosure of campaign fund-raising excesses in the 1996
presidential election. Hearings into those abuses last year were
clouded with partisan acrimony. But on Monday Republicans and
Democrats showed they could work together.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his henchmen, especially Tom DeLay, tried to
portray the legislation as revolutionary. In fact, it simply closes
loopholes in the existing law limiting contributions to candidates
in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill extends the law by banning unlimited ``soft money''
donations to political parties from corporations, unions and rich
individuals. These were the donations that the Democrats raised at
the White House and Republicans at their own fund-raisers. The bill
also applies fund-raising limits to campaign ads broadcast by
single-issue groups two months before an election.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining test for the Shays-Meehan bill will come later
this week, when various so-called ``substitutes'' are voted on. Any
bill that gets more votes than the Shays-Meehan bill will be the
one to win final passage.
</P>
<P>
   It is now imperative that supporters of Shays-Meehan vote
against these substitutes, particularly a sham piece of legislation
advanced by a bipartisan group of freshmen that would ban soft
money from the national parties but let it go to the state parties
instead. The freshmen bill is not worthy of the name ``reform.'' It
would simply channel the same corrupting money from special
interests into national campaigns from a different route.
</P>
<P>
   In a climactic moment in the debate, Zach Wamp of Tennessee
implored his fellow Republicans to set aside their party leaders'
addiction to soft money and approve legislation clearly desired by
the public. That his argument carried the day kindles genuine hope
that Congress does listen to the public's yearning for a more
accountable political system. Members of the House or the Senate
will now ignore that message at their peril.

FASHION NOTES: WHO DESIGNED THAT DRESS?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct dateline)   By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mystery has emerged in fashion, where millions of
dollars are spent on publicity and no buzz-generating moment goes
unclaimed. Why has no designer come forward to take credit for that
dress? Yes, the one belonging to Monica Lewinsky and undergoing
tests at an FBI laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine has reported that it was a Gap dress, but a Gap
spokeswoman said Monday she could not confirm it. Experts in public
relations differed on whether the designer should come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Weisenfeld, the vice president for public relations at
Barneys New York and a former aide to Ann Stock, formerly Hillary
Rodham Clinton's social secretary, said: ``Monica is the epitome of
the bridge customer, and I can't believe a bridge designer hasn't
jumped forward to claim it for their own. What are they waiting
for?''
</P>
<P>
   But Pierre Rougier, the owner of Pierre Rougier Public Relations
Consultants, whose clients include Hermes, Narciso Rodriguez and
Richard Edwards, said: ``I would say, `Keep quiet.' If I'm a
designer, I don't want to go down as the designer who designed the
stained dress. There's something yucky about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Treifus, the senior vice president for global
communications at Calvin Klein Inc., says the industrywide silence
is easily explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you know that all the fashion houses have received
talking points?'' he said. ``We're not quite sure of the source of
the talking points _ whether they are direct from Monica Lewinsky
or from some other source _ but the first of these talking points
is, `Don't admit anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   A SUCCESSOR AT TOCCA
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tocca, the company whose lines were created and
designed by Marie-Anne Oudejans, who abruptly left it three months
ago, has hired Alexandra White, a stylist and contributing editor
at W magazine and Italian Vogue, as its creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oudejans, who has not publicly discussed in detail her
reasons for leaving Tocca, did not have a role in selecting Ms.
White, though she remains a partner in the business, said Edoardo
Mantelli, the chairman of Tocca. Ms. Oudejans could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a creative director, not a designer,''
Mantelli said. ``Tocca is a concept. It has a lot to do with our
vision. We want someone who can help us strengthen our business and
expand globally.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylists have come to exert a visible and important role in
fashion, helping to shape designers' collections. Prominent
stylists include Melanie Ward, who works with Helmut Lang; Carine
Roitfeld for Gucci, and Victoria Bartlett for Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is rare for a stylist to head a design company. Ms.
Oudejans, herself, was an exception. Once a stylist, she came to
see her fashions for Tocca sold in stores like Bergdorf Goodman and
Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROLLING NOVA'S CROWD
</P>
<P>
   NEWS YORK _ It's not every fashion show that draws the police.
But that is who showed up at the presentation for Nova by Tony
Mellilo on Thursday night at the close of the men's shows for
spring 1999. They arrived when a crowd of pedestrians joined
fashion editors and retailers blocking the street outside the
unusual show.
</P>
<P>
   The passers-by stopped and stared through glass windows into an
empty store at 100 Stanton St., part of which was decorated like a
bedroom. Inside, a lone model dressed and undressed in the line's
25-or-so soft knit sportswear pieces. The space is the site of a
Nova USA store scheduled to open this month.
</P>
<P>
   Kal Ruttenstein, the corporate fashion director of
Bloomingdale's, and Holly Adam, the fashion director for men's wear
at Bloomingdale's, cooled themselves on a bench outside the store.
Ruttenstein has ordered the collection for his store.
</P>
<P>
   The police asked Mellilo to clear a path on the sidewalk. One
confused guest spread the word _ wrongly, it turned out _ that
Mellilo was being shut down for operating without a cabaret
license.

WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES FIGHT TO BLOCK LINDSEY TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to include latest developements from court of appeals) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House announced plans Monday to continue
efforts to block prosecutors from questioning President Clinton's
longtime confidant Bruce Lindsey about an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   As aides brushed aside talk of a nationally televised mea culpa
by the president, his lawyers scrambled to buy enough time for the
Supreme Court to consider whether the attorney-client privilege
shields Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel, from questions about
his conversations with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia turned down an effort by the White House to keep Lindsey
from being summoned before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
grand jury until the nation's high court decides whether to get
involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers immediately asked Chief Justice William
Rehnquist to issue a stay that would block Lindsey's appearance
before the grand jury until the court rules on the substance of the
administration's appeal. Rehnquist, who last month denied a similar
motion regarding testimony from Secret Service agents, could rule
on the motion for a stay or turn it over to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a three-judge appeals panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the White
House argument that Lindsey was shielded from testifying. The panel
upheld a lower court order for Lindsey to answer prosecutors'
questions about the president's relationship with former intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, whose friendship with the president dates back to the
beginning of his political career in Arkansas 30 years ago, has
unmatched knowledge of Clinton's activities in Little Rock and
Washington. Among Lindsey's assignments is defending Clinton
against allegations involving women.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff issued a statement Monday
saying that a review by the Supreme Court is needed ```because of
the importance of this principle for this and future presidents, as
well as the executive branch'' of government.
</P>
<P>
   If the courts agree, Lindsey's testimony would be postponed at
least until the Supreme Court begins its next term in October.
</P>
<P>
   The justices previously refused to consider an appeal of a
similar ruling from the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which held that government lawyers cannot hide behind the
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, special White House counsel Lanny Breuer was prepared
to appear at the federal courthouse Tuesday after efforts to block
a subpoena for his testimony was turned down by the courts. Breuer,
a New York lawyer who joined the White House staff in early 1997,
heads the team of attorneys overseeing various scandals involving
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who was appointed four years ago to investigate Clinton's
business dealings in Arkansas, broadened his inquiry in January to
include whether the president lied under oath and urged others to
lie in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton testified that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. The former White House intern issued a
similar denial under oath, but last week reportedly reversed course
and told Starr's deputies _ after she was promised immunity from
prosecution _ that they did engage in sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has agreed to testify Aug. 17 via
closed-circuit television before Starr's grand jury, which puts him
a position of recanting his earlier denial or contradicting
Lewinsky's most recent description of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, presidential aides dismissed talk of Clinton
changing his story, insisting such discussion implies that Clinton
lied under oath early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically whether Clinton would continue to maintain
that he had no sexual relationship with Lewinsky, White House
spokesman Barry Toiv told reporters that the president ``told you
that he is going to testify truthfully . . . he's already spoken to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about whether Clinton's version is the truth, Toiv
replied that he is ``not in a position to tell you what the
president's testimony is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that he has said that he has
told the truth, and that he will continue to tell the truth,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Starr's prosecutors interviewed Lewinsky in
preparation for her appearance _ possibly late this week _ before
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FBI is expected in the next week to determine
whether a stain found on a blue cocktail dress turned over to Starr
by Lewinsky contains DNA material indicating any sexual contact
with the president. Lewinsky told prosecutors she wore the dress
during a sexual encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's press briefing, Toiv was repeatedly hit with
questions about whether the president has provided investigators
with DNA samples to compare with any material found on the dress or
whether Starr had requested DNA samples from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I'm aware of,`` Toiv said, referring questions to
Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, who did not respond to
telephone inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a
sealed ruling Monday that reportedly permits U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson to proceed with a hearing to determine if
Starr improperly leaked grand jury evidence, which is prohibited by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Unnamed sources cited by The Associated Press and CNN said the
ruling addressed Starr's concerns that evidence crucial to his
investigation of the president might be obtained by Clinton's
private lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The legal sources said the court ruled the leaks investigation
could proceed but that any evidence should be turned over to
Johnson, who is overseeing the grand jury investigating the
Clinton-Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has accused Starr of illegal leaks and requested that
the prosecutor be sanctioned for contempt of court. Starr`s office
has denied releasing any information improperly. &QL;

EDITORIAL: GOOD TIMES KEEP ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis may alarm Alan Greenspan and assorted other
economists, but to the American people the economic outlook could
not be rosier. That is what they tell the pollsters, who put
consumer confidence at virtually the highest level in 30 years.
More important, consumers act on that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists thought the second-quarter numbers would show a
decline in the American economy. But instead, the estimates issued
by the government last Friday showed continued growth, albeit at a
reduced level.
</P>
<P>
   That was because Americans _ both individuals and businesses _
are buying at a very high, and ultimately unsustainable, pace.
Adjusted for inflation, purchases by Americans are up 5.6 percent
over the past year. Such rapid growth would be expected if the
economy were coming out of a recession and pent-up demand were
bursting forth. But this is the eighth year of economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, incomes are not rising at anything like that
pace. To support such spending, people are deciding not to save.
The statistics on savings are muddied by the government's decision
to change the way they are calculated, but it appears that the
savings rate is at the lowest level since the government started
collecting the figures in 1946. Perhaps people see little need to
save. What savings they have are booming along with the stock
market, and there is no worry about recession.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of problems for businesses brought on by the
overseas weakness. So far those problems seem not to have dampened
corporate investment, let alone the buying patterns of consumers.
But the American trade deficit is soaring to record levels even
with imported oil the cheapest it has been in many years.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the trade deficit has little cost. The dollar is strong
because the Japanese yen is weak, amid worries the Japanese
recession will deepen. If Japan does get its economic house in
order, the dollar could begin to fall, perhaps raising the reported
inflation figures enough to trouble American consumers. But for
now, consumers see a wonderful economy, and are spending on the
assumption it will continue.

 &HT;    GM announces plans to privitize Dayton plant
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton will no longer be a GM town heading into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. on Monday said it will turn its Delphi
Automotive Systems unit into an independent company by next year _
a move that will leave the Miami Valley with only one factory
solely operating under the world's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi , currently a division of GM, employs 15,000 workers in
seven Dayton-area plants. While they will no longer work directly
for GM, th os e workers could emerge from the deal with a brighter
future.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive experts believe an independent Delphi could mean more
business for local plants that supply parts to most of the world's
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the company will offer up to 20 percent of
Delphi in a public stock offering, then turn over the remaining
part of the company to GM shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Once the spin-off is complete, the Moraine Truck Assembly plant
will be the only factory out of nine local plants operating solely
under the world's largest automaker. A new diesel engine plant in
Moraine is expected to be a joint venture between GM and Isuzu
Motors. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been discussing a plan to spin off Delphi since early
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker said it will work closely with the United Auto
workers, which settled two devastating strikes against GM last
week. As part of the strike settlement, GM promised not to sell or
close two Delphi brake plants in Dayton before January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials in Dayton said they weren't familiar with details
of the spin-off and were unsure how it would affect local plants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spin-off, Delphi officials said Monday they would
honor the GM settlement and not sell or close the Dayton brake
plants during the next 17 months. The two troubled plants on
Needmore Road and Wisconsin Boulevard employ 3,400 workers and have
been suffering from massive financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   The spin-off will better position Delphi, the world's largest
auto-parts maker with annual sales of $31 billion, to do business
with companies other than GM, the automaker said. It also will
eventually free GM to buy parts from the least expensive supplier,
whether Delphi or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent Delphi would become even more competitive than
Delphi is today,'' said J.T. Battenberg III, president of Delphi
and a GM vice president. ``While General Motors would continue to
be an important customer, Delphi's independence would substantially
help it attract additional business from automotive companies other
than GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate Delphi's market value at $11 billion to $13
billion. Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., has 204,000 employees and
plants in 36 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Delphi officials said the spin-off will add another
major company to the community's business resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Dayton we will have another Fortune 500 company,''
said Alan Dawes, general manager of Delphi's Chassis division,
adding that Delphi would already be about 25th on the list, based
on current sales. ``We have a lot of opportunity to grow our
business with non-GM customers at a faster rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether GM's decision to sell off Delphi would lessen
the long-term threat of plants being sold or closed, Dawes would
only say, ``This is not a facility-specific announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of GM's employees strolling through a parking lot at the
Wisconsin Boulevard plant said they knew GM wouldn't be their
employer forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for some good to come out of this, though,'' said Ben
Lewis, a 13-year employee and a senior plant engineer. ``This move
will help (lead to) a better relationship with the UAW and Delphi.
Success is not a dirty word. Corporation is not a dirty word. We
need to be successful and (now) the union can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Beach, an employee of Delphi for nine years, said that word
of the split is ``news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was coming. I've always considered myself an
employee of Delphi, not GM,'' Beach said. ``See that sign above the
door (that says Delphi) . . . it doesn't say GM does it?''
</P>
<P>
   Several Dayton city officials called the GM-Delphi split a
positive move for the local community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dayton area workforce has always been very competitive
both in quality and commitment,'' Dayton Mayor Mike Turner said.
``We certainly look forward to success in this new venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Kettering, where Delphi operates a suspension parts
plant that employs 3,000 people, were also optimistic about the
business deal. The Kettering plant has been targeted for sale or
shutdown by GM unless it can overcome huge financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delphi officials seem optimistic that financial problems can
be worked out to keep the Dayton area plants open,'' said Kettering
Assistant City Manager Pete Horan.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had expected the spin-off decision on Delphi at a GM
board meeting on Monday. ``It's what everyone was waiting for,''
said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a week after GM settled the two costly
strikes in Flint, Mich., including one at a Delphi plant triggered
in part by the company's efforts to farm plant work out to other
parts makers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe GM will come close to making up its
strike-related losses of $2.5 billion by selling its initial 20
percent stake in Delphi.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. downgraded its outlook on GM debt to
negative from stable following the Delphi announcement. S&AMP;P cited
``the significant challenges GM faces'' in completing the
divestiture without worsening its already poor relations with the
UAW.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, shedding Delphi could help GM eliminate the
high costs stemming from its Delphi ownership and close the
efficiency gap with its competitors, S&AMP;P said.
</P>
<P>
   Battenberg, who has pushed for a public offering, will be
chairman and chief executive of Delphi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delphi has proven its ability to compete,'' said Jack Smith,
GM's chief executive, in a letter to shareholders. ``But the fact
is, for competitive reasons, many manufacturers simply refuse to
buy components from Delphi as long as it's part of General
Motors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. is expected to sell a public stake in its Visteon
parts unit, with $17 billion in annual sales, for similar reasons.

HARRELSON'S DEFENSE CHIPS AWAY AT WITNESSES IN SEEKING NEW TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Stands for Harrelson-Conviction) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Lawyers hoping to win Charles Harrelson a new trial for
the 1979 shooting of a federal judge in San Antonio sought Monday
to show that one of his defense attorneys was once implicated in
the murder himself.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, hired by actor Woody Harrelson on behalf of his
father, chipped away at two witnesses in the first of what is
expected to be a three-day evidentiary hearing. Through painstaking
testimony, they revealed that Harrelson's main attorney sought the
help of San Antonio defense lawyer Alan Brown after a convict had
linked Brown to the assassination of U.S. District Judge John Wood.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers, including David Michael of San Francisco, and _
before he was called as a witness in the case _ Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz, appeared stymied in their attempts to
show that Harrelson's case was indeed one where the criminal
justice system went awry.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio lawyer Tom Sharpe, who defended Harrelson at his
murder trial, testified Monday that while he once sought Brown's
help as an investigator, Brown never did any work on the case.
What's more, Sharpe said, the convict who implicated Brown was a
self-serving liar who had been ``vaccinated with a polygraph
needle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Brown was a ghost in this case,'' Sharpe said. ``He knew
nothing about the murder of Judge Wood other than what he read in
the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown himself has called the allegations ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years later, the emotions swirling around the case
still seem raw. The hearing was moved to Denver from San Antonio by
U.S. District Judge Fred Biery because of security concerns and
because holding the proceeding in a courthouse named after the
murdered judge would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Maximum John'' for his lengthy sentences in drug
cases, Wood was shot once in the back with a hunting rifle outside
his San Antonio townhouse on May 29, 1979. Harrelson, now 59,
claims he was in Dallas at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is the only federal judge to be killed in modern times and
his murder is the stuff of Texas legend.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter called it an ``assault on our very system
of justice.'' U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez labeled Wood's murder the
``crime of the century.'' And Griffin Bell, then attorney general,
described the killing as a ``dark time'' in U.S. history and
pledged a fierce manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities indicted Harrelson, a card player and
hustler who was previously convicted for a 1968 contract murder in
South Texas. In 1982, he was found guilty of murdering Wood for a
$250,000 payment from an El Paso drug smuggler known as Jimmy
Chagra.
</P>
<P>
   The Chagra link provided fresh intrigue. Chagra was the middle
son of a colorful, if tragic, El Paso family. His two brothers,
both now dead, were attorneys who mixed drugs and law. The elder,
Lee Chagra, was known to have had an intense dislike for Judge Wood
because of his harsh sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no death penalty at the time, Harrelson
received two life sentences. He was moved to a maximum-security
prison dubbed ``Supermax'' in Florence, Colo., after he tried to
escape from a federal penitentiary in Atlanta on July 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, spurred by a son who never really knew his
father, a legal dream team filed motions aimed at winning a new
trial for Harrelson. At the same time, son Woody, who made his fame
on the television show ``Cheers,'' was in the running for a best
actor Oscar for ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the younger Harrelson was in the courtroom, dressed
in black Armani jeans and a lime green Patagonia shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the actor has said that his father is innocent in
the Wood killing. But on Monday, he focused his comments on
``government wrongdoing and cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to know about my father's guilt or innocence,''
he said during a break, his wife and two brothers beside him. ``But
I don't think he had a fair trial.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lawyers are hoping to prove that federal prosecutors hid
evidence that could have shown that a group of five men with loose
ties to the Chagra family killed Wood. One of them, they have
argued, is Brown. The hearing is to air the evidence the lawyers
have gathered regarding Brown's alleged role.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the lawyers argue that Sharpe failed to give
Harrelson adequate legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   Their task is not easy. In their opening statements, prosecutors
told Biery that Brown had been dropped from the FBI's probe long
before he was approached to help in the Harrelson case. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Without a doubt,'' said John DePue, a Justice Department
lawyer, ``Alan Brown was conflict-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's lawyers called as a witness Jack Compton, police
chief in the South Texas town of Alice and one-time Customs agent
who early on investigated the Wood killing. Much of his testimony
centered on Robert Riojas, a convicted killer who linked Wood's
murder to five other suspects. But Compton said he's still
convinced Harrelson was the triggerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed it then and I believe it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors portrayed Riojas as a conniving outlaw who was
desperate to make any kind of deal he could for leniency. Later,
Sharpe bolstered this portrayal, saying that Riojas had led
investigators on a ``rabbit trail'' that came to a sudden dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not subpoena Mr. Riojas to testify,'' Sharpe said. ``I
would not attempt to convince a judge or a jury that Mr. Riojas is
believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Sharpe contends that Harrelson does deserve a new
trial, but not because he received ineffective counsel. He said the
convicted killer should not have been tried in San Antonio, nor in
a courthouse named after the assassinated judge, nor before a judge
who was a pallbearer at Wood's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson and Brown are expected to testify when the
hearing resumes Tuesday.

RIGHT AT HOME IN NEW YORK

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Born and reared in Los Angeles, educated at
Crespi High and UCLA, Shaun Williams scoffs at the suggestion he
hasn't spent much time outside Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Las Vegas,'' he said with the ease of a world
traveler. ``And to Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   He's no Phineas Phog. But it didn't take Williams longer than a
New York minute to get comfortable in Albany, the Empire State
capital, where the New York Giants are holding their training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had an excellent camp,'' Giants defensive coordinator
John Fox said last week. ``He's a sharp guy and he's picked things
up quickly. He's been very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   What else would you expect from a man who was born Oct. 10, 1976
_ the day Giants Stadium opened.
</P>
<P>
   New York selected Williams with the 24th pick in the April
draft, then signed him to a reported four-year, $4.4 million
contract shortly before training camp. Projected as a safety, his
natural position, Williams has shown enough speed and coverage
ability to merit a look at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be an added bonus,'' Fox said. ``It's a compliment
to him we're even giving it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have one of the best young secondaries in the NFL,
with cornerbacks Jason Sehorn (USC) and Phillippi Sparks, and
safeties Sam Garnes and Tito Wooten. The unit is as stable as it is
talented, with a reserve corps returning intact.
</P>
<P>
   Given the competition, Williams figures his best chance for
immediate playing time is at nickel back _ the fifth defensive
back, used primarily in passing situations. His grueling
double-days (morning and afternoon practices) are spent learning
techniques and defensive schemes for both cornerbacks and safeties.
It's a full load and Williams is careful not to burden himself with
unrealistic demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At UCLA, I was used to the defense,'' he said. ``But here, I
have to think about what I have to do and what my responsibilities
are. Once I get the defense down, I'll be able to line up and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got plenty of support. The Giants' secondary coach, Johnnie
Lynn, played for UCLA in the late '70s and is familiar not only
with Williams but with all the great Bruins defensive backs, from
Kenny Easley to Eric Turner. And Williams, Lynn believes, has to
tools to extend the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easley was the prototype,'' Lynn said. ``He was used in a lot
of (schemes) to create plays. You had to account for him, and Shaun
Williams is the same way. He can dominate a game with tackling,
blitzing and making plays on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruins linebacker Jason Nevadomsky signed a free-agent
contract with the Giants this spring. If his troublesome shoulder
holds, he has the requisite size and speed to challenge for a
roster spot. If nothing else, Nevadomsky and Willliams have each
other during the toughest days (and most boring nights) of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   And in a refreshing twist, Williams' closest competitors, Garnes
and Wooten, are also his staunchest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised at how welcoming the guys are,'' Williams
said. ``It's a total team atmosphere and that's made the transition
easier. The guys are always giving me helpful hints on techniques.
They're willing to share information. On some teams, the vets would
be skeptical about giving a rookie valuable tidbits but not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they teach Williams the ropes, they'll teach him the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a house in New Jersey as close to Giants
Stadium as possible,'' he said. ``That way, I won't get lost.''

A TITANIC `TRISTAN' IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE &LR;   &LR; _ It was the biggest high-stakes operatic gamble in
years, and for the most part it paid off gloriously.
</P>
<P>
   With opera lovers from all over the world on hand for the
occasion, the Seattle Opera hosted a landmark double debut Saturday
night: Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' with two of the most
important young Wagner singers of the day _ English soprano Jane
Eaglen and Canadian tenor Ben Heppner _ undertaking the grueling
title roles for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   On one point, at least, there was no doubt: Eaglen's Isolde was
a triumph, a richly detailed, vocally unstoppable portrait of a
princess in the throes of uncontrollable passion.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner's Tristan, on the other hand, was considerably less
steady until the marathon third act, when he finally let loose with
the kind of vocal splendor that has made his name.
</P>
<P>
   But with some truly magnificent singing in the secondary roles
and a provocative, alluring production by director Francesca
Zambello and designer Alison Chitty, this ``Tristan'' made for an
enthralling night in the opera house _ almost as glittering a
success as the optimists were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate just how important this event was in the
far-flung but tightly linked community of opera buffs. When it's
done right, Wagner's sweeping tale of doomed, adulterous love
between a Cornish knight and the Irish princess betrothed to his
king is about the headiest, most intoxicating brew opera has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   No other composer has ever come so close to encapsulating in
sound the seductive pull of love, that tempestuous struggle of
pride, fear, rage and pure erotic longing that we all know but
rarely experience at such a heightened, unbroken pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the otherworldly harmonies, searing vocal lines and heated
Romantic poetry of this score, Wagner inscribed a vision of
unquenchable love that continues to work its magic nearly a century
and a half later.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is that the opera is almost impossible to cast
satisfactorily. It requires two performers capable of incredible
feats of vocal agility, power, stamina and interpretive subtlety,
singers who can command the stage for most of a nearly five-hour
span while singing above the heavy orchestral textures that swamp
the average voice. Such singers appear once or twice in a
generation, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Eaglen and Heppner, who are appearing together for the first
time in this production, Seattle has assembled the duo that
represents the current generation's best hopes for ``Tristan.''
Both have proven themselves to be among the leading Wagnerians of
the day _ Eaglen as Br &LR; u &LR; nnhilde in the ``Ring,'' and Heppner in
San Francisco and elsewhere in performances of ``Lohengrin'' and
``Die Meistersinger.''
</P>
<P>
   For Eaglen, at least, returning to the stage where she made her
memorable 1994 U.S. debut as a last-minute replacement in Bellini's
``Norma,'' Saturday's performance made good on every promise.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is a voice that seems to know neither fear nor ordinary
wear and tear, a pure, soaring tone that is as fresh and tireless
at the end of a long evening as at the beginning. It rides
effortlessly above the majestical din of the Wagnerian orchestra,
not only in the clear, forthright upper register but also in her
richly colored middle range. And if one or two high notes emerged
with a touch of strain, there were always more right behind them to
bring the performance back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking, though, for a singer who has sometimes seemed a
wooden dramatic presence, was how much she made of the role's
emotional drama. In Act 1, as Tristan's ship takes her to the
arranged marriage with King Marke, Eaglen registered the fury and
wounded pride of a woman betrayed (as she thinks) by the man she
loves. The surges of emotion during the lovers' Act 2 tryst were
almost heartrending in their intensity, and the ``Liebestod,'' that
amazing stretch of vocal transcendence that concludes the opera,
rang out with a limpid blend of ardor and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner's success as Tristan was more mixed _ for the first two
acts, in truth, it would not have been appropriate to speak of his
success at all. During that time, Heppner tiptoed gingerly around
his part like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming semi
truck.
</P>
<P>
   In Act 1, he seemed intent only on making as few waves as
possible, and in the extended Act 2 love duet (from which a sizable
cut was taken after the final dress rehearsal), he could barely be
heard over the sound of the orchestra and Eaglen's singing. Only in
the most intimate moments, such as his feeble reply to King Marke's
reproaches (``O K &LR; o &LR; nig, das kann ich dir nicht sagen''), did the
sweet tone and thoughtful phrasing that are his trademarks really
come through.
</P>
<P>
   The semi that was bearing down on him, of course, was Act 3,
surely the longest and most harrowing death scene in opera. Yet
when the crunch arrived, Heppner suddenly came into his own. Here
at last were the vigor, freedom and vocal clarity that had been
missing, deployed thrillingly and at great length. Singing a superb
Act 3, of course, isn't quite the same as singing Tristan, but
perhaps it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eaglen and Heppner were the headliners, they were by no
means the only important singers on the stage. Some of the
evening's most extraordinary singing came from mezzo-soprano
Michelle DeYoung, as Isolde's nurse Brang &LR; a &LR; ne, in a performance of
unremitting force and tonal splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Baritone Greer Grimsley was a charismatic, vocally heroic
presence as Tristan's sidekick Kurwenal, rising to particular
strength in Act 3. And English bass Peter Rose brought gravitas and
palpable pain to King Marke's sorrowful Act 2 monologue after
discovering the lovers in flagrante. Armin Jordan's conducting was
solid but rarely vivid; the Prelude and other orchestral passages
went by without raising the ambient temperature at all.
</P>
<P>
   Zambello's staging featured a few silly, arty touches that were
easily overlooked (a corps of naked crewmen in the hellish lower
deck of Tristan's ship, a blood-red Nike swoosh when he is wounded
at the end of Act 2), but other than that it managed to keep the
lovers' predicament to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Chitty's set for Act 1 is the side of a huge ocean liner, as
overt a homage to ``Titanic'' as it could be, with the action
playing out resourcefully both on deck and below. The second and
third acts are staged in an attractive but mysterious glass house
that looks something like an extremely upscale bus shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The best touches come at the flash points of the drama _ the
beautiful starlit night sky that lighting designer Mimi Jordan
Sherin has created for the Act 2 assignation, and most memorable of
all, the subtle but unmistakable shift in lighting when the
principals first share the fatal love potion.
</P>
<P>
   These are the moments when this ``Tristan'' comes closest to the
dark, unruly passion Wagner knew all too well.

SHARI LEWIS, 65, STAR OF CHILDREN'S TELEVISION FOR FOUR DECADES 
</HEADLINE>

date in graf 12.)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (JT)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist
and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and
their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named
Lamb Chop, died Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was
diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for
six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley. She was thought to
be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis' illness caused her to cut short her production in
Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS,
``The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January
and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A
spokesman for PBS said Monday that three remaining episodes will be
broadcast in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year marked Ms. Lewis' 50th anniversary as a performer. Her
career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New
York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her
the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which
ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as
well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many
other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ``Lamb
Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ``Shari's Passover
Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ``The
Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband,
publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children
liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features
DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers
pizza by skateboard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a
multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher,
she knew how to reach children with her puppet sidekicks, chief
among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly haired creature who
would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and
questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in
the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush
Puppy weren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a role model,'' she said. ``It's really very funny because
I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.''
She did this most convincingly even in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   She was a playmate who loved good music, and throughout her
career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she
did. So, when she created ``Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis
played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that
she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that
her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much
more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said.
Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to
life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and
percussion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis felt that ``musical training teaches something that is
seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to
what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, `get it.''' She
was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds
neurological connections and better study habits.
</P>
<P>
   She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to convince
children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the
podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States,
Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like,
especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote 60 books for children, including ``Magic for
Nonmagicians,'' ``Things That Kids Collect,'' ``One-Minute Bedtime
Stories,'' ``One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ``One-Minute
Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos
for children.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her
spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth
date listed in reference books would have made her 64.
</P>
<P>
   She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor
who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for
the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist.
Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter
piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a
natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she
tucked a violin under her chin.
</P>
<P>
   She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and
violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of
American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the
Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a
girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in
the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had
been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian
to coach her.
</P>
<P>
   She attended Columbia University and in the 1950s was married
briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Tarcher in 1958. He survives
her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and
daughter collaborated with her in her projects.

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her
skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company
and summer stock productions of ``Damn Yankees,'' ``Bye, Bye,
Birdie'' and ``Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and
casinos and did dramatic roles in television.
</P>
<P>
   Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she
appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ``Talent Scout'' show. In
1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ``Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to
her own morning television program for NBC, ``The Shari Show.'' Ms.
Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television
series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were
seen in Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States
with ``Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young:
``If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to
that music.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television
programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis', recalled
Monday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop,
showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House
Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how
to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such
protection and then informed Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman
of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Markey
readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ``OK, you can go now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the
occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for government
to care about children and children's television and to protect
young viewers from junk. ``It was one of those things that nobody
who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Monday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator
were praised by Richard Riley, the secretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said,
``Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''

 &HT;    Family granted more visitation with surviving children while
custody date pushed back
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Moreland family will have more visitation
with their four children but will have to wait at least six weeks
to learn whether the youngsters will remain in foster care or be
allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing on a motion to change the custody arrangements
was continued until Sept. 15. Defense and prosecutors agreed to the
continuation.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third time Montgomery County Juvenile Court Judge
Michael Murphy has postponed the custody hearing in order to allow
investigators more time to examine the deaths of four other
children in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had earlier said that he wanted more information before
he ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want their children back but visitations are going to be
increased,'' said family attorney, Anthony Van Noy, after a
closed-door meeting with Murphy, prosecutors and child welfare
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The children were removed from the home of Phillip and Regina
Moreland on Dec. 24 following the death of Danatta Moreland, the
third child in the family to die.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, the children were placed in the care of their
maternal grandmother, Cecile O. Marshall
</P>
<P>
   The children were removed from Marshall's home on June 26, one
day after the death of a fourth child - Kelab Moreland, 2.
</P>
<P>
   All deaths have been ruled homicides by suffocation or
asphyxiation. Police say they have a suspect but have not said who
it is.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have said that police are focusing their
investigation on a child in the household. Some family members have
rejected that conclusion and have been accused of not cooperating
with police.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Juvenile Prosecutor Jim Cole said the family is now
cooperating fully with authoritie, and attorney Van Noy praised
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police are doing their job and doing a good job,'' Van Noy
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Murphy's decision to delay the custody hearing once
again tends to suggest that police are having a hard time making a
solid case against a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had someone,'' Van Noy said, ``charges would have been
filed.''

SEATTLE IS FOR WAGNER LOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (with OPERA-TRISTAN-SFCHRON)  
 By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If anybody was going to make a splash with a new
``Tristan,'' it would have to be the Seattle Opera. No other
company in the United States has been so indelibly associated with
Wagner's music.
</P>
<P>
   An ``emphasis on the work of Richard Wagner'' is even included
in the company's mission statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under founder Glynn Ross, and since 1983 under Speight Jenkins,
the company's garrulous, affable Texan general director, Wagner has
been a central part of Seattle's operatic life.
</P>
<P>
   For years it was the place to go for the full ``Ring'' cycle,
that dauntingly ambitious four-opera pinnacle of Wagner's art.
Every summer from 1975 to 1984, the company mounted the cycle in
both German and English. Jenkins introduced a new ``Ring''
production in 1986, and a third production is planned for August
2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Ring'' is only the most prominent aspect of Seattle's
Wagner fixation. In the past decade alone, Jenkins has introduced
notable productions of ``Die Meistersinger,'' ``Tannh &LR; a &LR; user,''
``The Flying Dutchman,'' ``Lohengrin'' and now ``Tristan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done every major opera now except `Parsifal,''' Jenkins
says. ``And that's slated for 2003.''

CLINTON TO EXPAND MEDICAID FOR SOME OF THE WORKING POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add the following attention line)

 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday will announce new
policies making it easier for states to provide Medicaid to adults
in two-parent families who work at low-wage jobs for more than 100
hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the changes would help 135,000 to
200,000 people in 20 states. Thirty states had already received
permission from the federal government to dispense with the
100-hour-a-month rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will make the changes by regulation, having concluded
that he does not need to ask Congress to change the laws governing
Medicaid and welfare, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The old rules, in effect, penalized work effort, cutting off
Medicaid to adults in many low-income families who worked more than
100 hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also penalized marriage, cutting off Medicaid for many
single mothers who married, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, to be issued this week, states may
eliminate the 100-hour limit if they wish, or they could set a
higher limit. And states will have a financial incentive to do so,
because the federal government pays 50 percent to 77 percent of
Medicaid benefits. The federal share is larger in states with low
per capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to be delivered on Tuesday, Clinton describes the
100-hour limit as ``the last vestige of the old welfare system.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``no aspect of the welfare system did more to defy
common sense and insult our values than the so-called 100-hour
rule,'' Clinton plans to says. ``Instead of rewarding work, it took
away health care from people who secured a full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, Clinton says, ``the 100-hour rule was wrong, and
now it's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The president will announce the changes at a White House event
reviewing what has happened to low-income families since he signed
legislation revamping the welfare system on Aug. 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data, for March of this year, show 8.9 million
people on welfare. The number has declined by 37 percent since
Clinton took office in January 1993 and by 27 percent since he
signed the welfare bill in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Guyer, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group, described the new
rules as ``a wonderful policy change'' that could help many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If states take advantage of this new option,'' Ms. Guyer said,
``low-income parents can increase the number of hours they work
without fear of losing Medicaid coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Baxendell, a health policy analyst at the National
Governors' Association, said state officials would also welcome the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the new rules give states an option for more flexibility,
that's something we would support,'' Ms. Baxendell said. ``Some
states could view this as a nice complement to efforts to help
parents move from public assistance to work while keeping their
health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all working poor parents have no health
insurance. Typically, their jobs do not offer health benefits, and
low-wage workers often cannot afford to take advantage of the
coverage if it is offered to them. Moreover, while many states have
expanded Medicaid to cover the children of low-income families in
recent years, the parents are often ineligible for Medicaid and
other public health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old welfare system, people who received cash
assistance were automatically eligible for Medicaid. But, Ms. Guyer
said, as parents move off welfare into low-wage jobs, they
frequently lose their health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 states including New York and New Jersey, an adult in a
two-parent family can ordinarily qualify for Medicaid only if the
principal wage-earner in the family works fewer than 100 hours a
month, federal officials said. This restriction prevents states
from expanding Medicaid to two-parent families in which the
principal wage-earner works 100 hours a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   The other 30 states had received waivers under the old welfare
law allowing them to eliminate the 100-hour rule.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said
the 100-hour limit was added to federal welfare regulations in
1971, and it restricted Medicaid eligibility as well because the
two programs were closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare law gave states new freedom to set eligibility
rules for cash assistance, but it froze in place most of the
Medicaid eligibility rules that prevailed in July 1996. States
could liberalize eligibility for welfare, but not for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   One result, officials said, was a disincentive for poor people
to work. They could keep Medicaid coverage if they worked 90 hours
a month, but, in many states, they would lose Medicaid if they
worked 110 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, healthy adults of working age are eligible for
Medicaid only if they have children. While Congress and the states
have established more generous criteria for children and pregnant
women, the income limit for parents seeking Medicaid is generally
far below the official poverty level.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN LINE AT BASEBALL'S STAR MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Canada)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene played out pretty much the way Mark Grudzielanek and
Carlos Perez always imagined it would. Felipe Alou, the classy
manager who had raised them as major league pups, called their
names in the Montreal dugout. First Grudzielanek. Then Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been traded,'' Alou said. Then the players waited for
Alou to divulge the really good news. ``The Dodgers. Work hard.
Good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports highlights caught these exchanges, with Alou's arm
affectionately on each player's shoulder, and the players standing
there awkwardly, not knowing whether to stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to say or do,'' Grudzielanek said in the
Dodgers' clubhouse before Monday night's game with the Mets. ``I
mean, I wanted to just yell out, `Yes!' or jump up and down like a
kid. But Felipe has been my only manager. People talk about what
happened in Florida, but Felipe's been dealing with that the last
five years, losing guys he helped develop. I respect the guy so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Money doesn't buy respect, just some of the best players in the
game. Pedro Martinez. Henry Rodriguez. Larry Walker. Andres
Galarraga. John Wetteland. Marquis Grissom. They all walked out of
Felipe Alou's dugout as free agents or before demanding the big
money the indigent Expos have been in no position to pay. Alou has
solemnly shaken the hands of a virtual all-star team that included
his son, Moises. He knows the downsizing drill better than anyone,
including Jim Leyland, the Florida manager who is undeservedly
baseball's most pitied.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, a 1996 all-star shortstop, and Perez, the Expos'
best remaining pitcher after Martinez was dealt to Boston last
winter, were just the latest to push through customs at last Friday
night's major league trading deadline, which was an actual deadline
in the manner of the first edition of your daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more trades this season via the miracle of
waivers, or whatever, because the reality of baseball's class
society is that its supermarket for rich teams is open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. A well-heeled owner can
always walk in, peruse the aisles and lay claim to the latest stars
on the shelves, unless he is beaten to the draw and can't get his
checkbook out of his pocket fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   This is important to remember with the Mike Piazza saga into a
bizarre disaffection stage _ the catcher not hitting his weight
with runners in scoring position, the Shea fans booing his every
breath, and the grand plan of co-opting Piazza's Hall of Fame bat
for the next half-dozen years looking more like a seasonal rental
every day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't understand why anyone expected Piazza to come here and
suddenly exchange wedding vows with the Mets this summer, before he
becomes a free agent, after he rejected $84 million from the
Dodgers, the team with which he had spent his entire career. No
matter how many times he dispassionately claims to like New York,
Piazza must have some other agenda, for as Carlos Perez said:
``When you get drafted by a team and spend all these years with the
same guys, you usually don't want to leave. You just want that team
to give you the big money and a long-term contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The desired organizational outcome, of course, would be for
Piazza to start hitting long balls in the clutch, get the fans off
his back and get the Mets onto his shoulders and into the playoffs.
If he has already decided he is going elsewhere, the Mets will have
opportunities to survive the failed experiment, believe me, as long
as they are out there with the same money they presumably have set
aside for Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   They can make a run at Mo Vaughn, or Bernie Williams. How much
longer before Ken Griffey Jr. wants out of Seattle? If recent
history tells anything, it is that baseball's stars inevitably
move, and big ones, too. Rather than spend the whole $12 million
Piazza pie on one player, maybe the Mets slice that sum in half,
pursue strong hitters at third base and in the outfield, and move
Todd Hundley out of his worst nightmare, left field, and back
behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   For teams with money, there is always a spender's chance, a star
to steal, especially from the likes of Montreal, where it is now
Vladimir Guerrero's turn to count down the days until the Expos'
next fire sale. Guerrero, named National League player of the month
Monday, is an impressive 24-year-old slugger who, according to
Grudzielanek, has already rejected a rare long-term offer from the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's eligible for arbitration after next season, they'll
trade him,'' Grudzielanek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets should get in line right now.

NO SERMONIZING ON THE PRESIDENT  
 BOOK HAS EXTRAS  
 LIFE WITH SALINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A postscript on President Clinton's visit to East Hampton, N.Y.:
The title of the sermon at the First United Methodist Church on
Sunday was ``Mercy and Judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton might attend. (Mrs. Clinton is a Methodist.) And the
minister, the Rev. David Parker, wanted to dispel the idea that the
sermon title was an editorial comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might have suspected that this sermon topic was chosen
with the eye to a possible presidential appearance,'' he told the
congregation. ``Nothing could be further from the fact.'' He said
his topic had been governed by the morning's Scripture readings,
which in turn were determined by a calendar used by most Protestant
and Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were here,'' Parker added, ``the worst thing a preacher
could do under such circumstances when you have a captive
presidential audience is to pretend to play Nathan to the rule of
David.''
</P>
<P>
   The service began with the hymn ``For the Beauty of the Earth,''
which is often sung at times of thanksgiving. The president was
giving thanks, but not in church. He went to an East Hampton
restaurant, Babette's Feast, and thanked the owner, Barbara Layton,
for a petition she circulated in February attacking what was
described as the ``muckraking witch hunt at taxpayers' expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Book Has Extras
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonathan Ames was wearing a seersucker jacket, just
like the hero of his new novel, ``The Extra Man.'' And Blair Clark,
a former executive at CBS News, was denying that Ames had learned
anything about ``extra men'' (a k a ``walkers'' who escort wealthy
women to Broadway shows and dinner parties) from him.
</P>
<P>
   The things they talk about at those midsummer book parties.
</P>
<P>
   This one was set in a garden behind Clark's townhouse on the
East Side. Ames wrote much of ``The Extra Man'' in an extra room in
the house; he has known Clark and his wife, Joanna, for nearly 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ames' 84-year-old great aunt, Doris Klein, has known him even
longer. ``He devoted a whole chapter to me and he makes me out to
be much older than I am,'' she said. Ames laughed. ``I've had a
character in each of my books loosely based on my aunt,'' he said,
``and they're always her age.''
</P>
<P>
   Life With Salinger
</P>
<P>
   She called him Jerry. He signed his letters to her ``love.''
</P>
<P>
   He was J.D. Salinger, the famously reclusive author of ``The
Catcher in the Rye,'' writing to 18-year-old Joyce Maynard, an
undergraduate at Yale who had never read a word he had written. It
was 1972, and an article of hers had just appeared in The New York
Times Magazine. They became pen pals. Five months later she moved
in with him in Cornish, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard is breaking 26 years of silence about her
relationship with Salinger in a book that is scheduled to be
published next month. Vanity Fair magazine is running an excerpt in
its September issue that presents Salinger as someone who could be
``moody and cranky.'' Ms. Maynard portrays him as a devotee of
homeopathic medicine and an ardent fan of television programs like
``The Andy Griffith Show.''
</P>
<P>
   She also described two sexual encounters, saying that he told
her to move out after nine months, when they went to Florida to see
a ``naturopathic practitioner'' who performed acupuncture to make
sex less painful.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said Ms. Maynard would not give interviews until
the book was published. The magazine said the book chronicles ``her
44 years, through her confrontation last year with Salinger.''
(``She did confront him last fall, but they would not allow us to
use that,'' said Beth Kseniak, a spokeswoman for Vanity Fair,
referring to the book's publisher, Picador USA. ``They did not want
us to give everything away, I guess.'')

   General Motors Corp. announced Monday that it planned to spin
off its gigantic auto parts subsidiary to its shareholders next
year, a move that could reignite the labor troubles that led to
nearly eight-week-long strikes that ended only last Wednesday.
</P>

   If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away
from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company
produces most of the parts as well as the final product. Through
the 1970s, GM promoted its vertical integration as a source of
financial strength and savings.
</P>
<P>
   But John F. Smith Jr., the GM chairman and chief executive, said
Monday that General Motors wanted instead to be a company that
assembles and markets cars, but does not necessarily make a large
proportion of the parts inside. The spinoff of the auto parts
subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, ``represents nothing less
than a fundamental shift away from vertical integration,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Automobile Workers union reacted furiously to GM's
announcement Monday afternoon, which followed a regularly scheduled
board meeting. ``Should GM decide to proceed with the sale as
announced, the UAW's record is clear: we can and will aggressively
work to protect the rights and interests of UAW members impacted by
the sale,'' Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM
issues, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' national contract with the union expires in
September 1999, and the union could try to stop the spinoff of
Delphi then with a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Through strikes and the threat of strikes, the UAW has sometimes
forced GM to postpone or cancel factory sales and closings over the
years. Robert Stempel, the former chairman of GM, announced in
December 1991 the closing of two dozen factories and the
elimination of 74,000 jobs, but some of those factories are still
open and the jobs still exist.
</P>
<P>
   But a spinoff of Delphi could be an attractive move for General
Motors and its shareholders. The UAW currently forces GM to pay the
same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and
parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay
only half as much to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   An independent Delphi could try to pay lower wages to its
American workers who are members of the UAW. It might be able to
sell more parts to other auto makers, which have been reluctant to
order from Delphi for fear that it would share parts designs and
other competitive information with GM.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers
and parts workers, but they disposed of many of their parts
factories piecemeal in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when their
survival was in doubt. Japanese auto makers pay close to $19 an
hour to their assembly plant workers but buy the great bulk of
their parts from outside suppliers with much lower wages.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American
personnel, had said last Tuesday, when a tentative settlement was
reached with the UAW in Flint, Mich., that the automaker wanted a
closer relationship with the union and would begin holding regular,
top-level meetings with union officials. Knechtel said then that
the strike could only be judged worthwhile if it produced a lasting
improvement in the relationship. Workers ratified the settlement
last Wednesday and returned to work, but GM lost $3 billion in
after-tax profits because of the strike, or nearly half a year's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said at a press conference Monday that GM's board had been
planning for months to decide on the spinoff of Delphi at its
August meeting, but that the company had not told the union until
after the Flint strike had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even if GM divests Delphi, it will still be somewhat vertically
integrated. GM factories that produce engines, transmissions and
exterior sheet metal are part of GM's auto assembly and marketing
divisions, and would not be divested with Delphi. The Delphi
division makes hundreds of smaller parts, from spark plugs to
dashboards to seats, that are less important to a car's exterior
appearance or road performance.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes in Flint affected two parts factories, a Delphi
factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs and other parts and
another, non-Delphi factory that stamps truck hoods and other parts
from sheets of steel.
</P>
<P>
   But GM's planned spinoff of Delphi nonetheless represents a big
decision. Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., is the world's largest auto
parts maker, with slightly greater annual sales than Intel Corp.
Delphi's 200,000 employees around the world include 50,000 UAW
members in the United States, a sizable number for a union with
around 730,000 members. There are another 150,000 UAW workers in
GM's other operations that will not be divested.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said that it planned to dispose of Delphi in two
steps. During the first quarter of next year, GM plans to
distribute to shareholders as much as 20 percent of Delphi's stock.
The automaker said it would dispose of the rest of Delphi later
next year, by distributing shares or by exchanging GM shares for
Delphi shares, or possibly by a combination of these approaches, in
a transaction that is intended to be tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors announced its plan late in the afternoon. GM
shares rose 37.5 cents Monday, to $72.6875.

THE ART OF FUNK: GEORGE CLINTON'S `COSMIC SLOP' SPILLS ONTO
THE  CANVAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With his flowing robes and peacock-hued hair
extensions, funk grandfather George Clinton has established himself
as one of the most colorful figures in pop music. If that's true,
though, he can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm colorblind,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's a surprising admission, especially given Clinton's latest
obsession: painting. On Friday, the performer will be at San
Francisco's Beach Street Gallery to open a three-day exhibition of
his artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmic slop'' is one of many self-imposed musical descriptions
of Clinton's group, the long-running funk collective
Parliament-Funkadelic. The term might also be used to describe the
bandleader's paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I do music, I just throw so much stuff in there and then
start editing it out until it looks like something,'' he says with
a laugh. ``Somebody usually has to stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   After doodling for years and working on paintings to help
communicate his ideas for P-Funk's stage sets, Clinton recently
began showing his work in public. A Laguna Beach, Calif., art
dealer persuaded him to mount a show, which was followed by an
exhibition at the Tallahassee, Fla., airport, near Clinton's home.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a trailer he had originally intended to use as an
echo chamber for his recordings, the performer has completed at
least 300 paintings so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I really like is that he's so original and free,''
says Bob Abbott, Clinton's unofficial art adviser and the curator
of F.A.C.T. Gallery, the Laguna Beach space that first showed
Clinton's work. ``I relate a lot of his work to (Jean-Michel)
Basquiat. It has that feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says plenty of his friends and acquaintances have been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that talked me into doing it is the guy that did our
album covers (Overton Lloyd),'' Clinton says. ``He kept buying me
brushes. I'd do real good stuff until the brushes got old, or till
I got too many colors on one brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my nephew will wash 'em out for me, keep 'em clean. I do
pretty good work when I don't have to rush it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been busy of late. Last weekend, he was in Los
Angeles meeting with his longtime friend the Artist (Clinton's
groups have recorded for Prince's Paisley Park label). He was also
working on a Nike ad campaign and making an appearance in the comic
movie ``The Breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Painting, says the 57-year-old creative dervish, is a great way
to relax. ``When I come off the stage, it takes an hour just to
come back down, to settle down from the hype in my own head.
Painting these things _ I found it's addictive as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The two disciplines have plenty in common, he says. ``I mean,
they have the same terminology _ harmonies, tones, values, stuff
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can vibe on that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As an art student, he admits, his knowledge is limited. Given
P-Funk's absurdist party music, some of his painting inspirations
make perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked Salvador Dali,'' Clinton says, ``mainly for
the way things were put together that didn't seem like they should
be together. Stuff like a watch bent over a cactus.''
</P>
<P>
   Picasso is another Clinton favorite; so is ``what's-his-name _
Campbell's Soup'' (Andy Warhol). Others, however, might dumbfound
fans. One in particular: Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   As goofy as that name sounds coming from Clinton's lips, the
artist has a simple explanation. ``It's an extreme, the exact
opposite (of me). But if people like it, you better try to find out
why it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the more things you appreciate, the better off you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, painting is another way to stay young, just as he
has dabbled in hip-hop in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put myself in a position to do stuff I pretty much don't
know anything about,'' he says. ``I guess the way I do it seems to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a few youthful activities that he has yet to
grasp. ``I cannot figure out how you could get anybody to
break-dance,'' he laughs, ``or play video games. The kids pick up
on video games like it's second nature to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people, you'd break your neck thinking about what you
have to do to move like that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   George Clinton is hardly the first pop-music performer to fancy
himself a visual artist. Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood has sold
dozens of his colorful portraits of fellow stars, John Lennon's
estate has made a cottage industry of the late Beatle's dashed-off
cartoons and Tony Bennett has turned out almost as many paintings
as recordings over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other pop artists and their milieus:
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; David Bowie _ gaunt, blue-in-the-face portraiture

A CANDIDATE WITHOUT CASH OR FLASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWVILLE, N.Y. _ Most people watching the Lewis County Fair
parade had no idea who the man in the monogrammed shirt was or why
he had joined the procession of baton twirlers, beauty queens and
Boy Scouts marching through town on a steamy summer night.
</P>
<P>
   He was politely shaking hands, and occasionally introducing
himself as Jim Larocca, a Democratic candidate for governor. But he
was not urging people to support him in the Democratic primary on
Sept. 15. And unlike other politicians marching in the parade, he
had no zealous campaign aides passing out buttons and shouting his
name to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   James Larocca, a former state official from Huntington, N.Y., is
the most understated of the four Democrats hoping to oppose Gov.
George Pataki in the fall, and his campaign has by far the least
cash. But what he lacks in money and flash, he makes up for in
doggedness. Larocca registered as a gubernatorial candidate more
than a year ago, long before any of his better-known competitors _
Peter Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross and Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.
And he has traveled the state ever since, courting Democratic
leaders with a quiet intensity that has earned him a surprising
amount of support, considering that Larocca, 54, has few ties to
the Democratic Party establishment, has never held elective office
and is barely known outside Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is just a super guy,'' said Charles Merrell, the Lewis
County Democratic chairman, who invited Larocca to the upstate
parade. ``There's a lot to like about him. He'd make a great
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, have Merrell and other party leaders who gush about
Larocca thrown their weight behind other candidates? Why is
Larocca, admired by everyone from upstate dairy farmers to urban
advocates of gay issues, considered the longest of long shots?
</P>
<P>
   Because the other candidates have more money and name
recognition, factors that party officials said count more than good
ideas when the Republican incumbent is soaring high in the polls.
Larocca has raised only $845,000 and spent all but $3,600, which
leaves him miles behind Vallone and Ms. McCaughey Ross, each of
whom has raised more than $3 million. Hynes has raised $500,000 and
still has $200,000 on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going with Peter Vallone because he's got money and, let's
face it, more people know who he is,'' Merrell said. ``I just think
he's got a better chance at it than Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   Larocca is the only Democratic candidate who has worked in state
government, as transportation commissioner under Gov. Mario Cuomo
and energy commissioner under Gov. Hugh Carey. He was also
president of the Long Island Association, the island's largest
economic development group, for eight years. Demographically,
Larocca is a political consultant's dream: Roman Catholic,
Italian-American and the only candidate not from New York City. He
and his wife, Dale, have three grown children. And he looks
gubernatorial, with silvery hair, perfect posture and an earnest
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   His platform is broad enough to appeal to both upstate moderates
and urban liberals. He supports abortion rights, affirmative action
and gay marriage, yet he also calls the death penalty
``appropriate.'' Larocca would cut tuition at public colleges and
universities by 25 percent, ban corporate contributions to
political campaigns and push the State Legislature to allow casinos
in economically depressed regions.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to create regional partnerships involving
businesses, universities and local governments to assist economic
development. He encouraged such partnerships when he was running
the Long Island Association, and he said they helped the region's
economy when the military contracting industry collapsed in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly large stumbling blocks have made political life
difficult for Larocca in recent months. The biggest came in May,
when the Nassau County Democratic chairman, Stephen Sabbeth,
switched his support from Larocca to Ms. McCaughey Ross. As a
result, Larocca did not win enough delegate votes at the state
Democratic Convention to get an automatic spot on the primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Larocca turned to a more laborious way of getting on the ballot:
collecting at least 15,000 signatures from registered Democrats
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   These recent complications have hurt his fund-raising efforts,
Larocca said, as would-be supporters have decided his campaign is
doomed. He complains bitterly about his fund-raising disadvantage,
saying Vallone and Hynes can easily raise money as elected
officials, and pointing out that most of Ms. McCaughey Ross' money
comes from her husband, a wealthy banker. But he also attempts to
make an asset of his relative poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proving that it's not about money, but about the vision
and independence and integrity of the candidate,'' Larocca said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The absence of a political record and his relative obscurity
have meant that he has not attracted much campaign criticism yet,
but on Long Island, some civic and business leaders complain that
he has failed to take a strong stand on the state's takeover of the
Long Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say his insistence on staying in the race with no
money is a sign of arrogance. Sheldon Sackstein, the chairman of
Action Long Island, a nonprofit business and civic group, said
Larocca was more focused on advancing his career than on solving
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Larocca's distaste for old-style politicking shows on the
campaign trail, where he spends more time huddling with small
groups than working rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to his credit that he's not a back-slapping type of guy
and likes to have deep conversations with people instead,'' said
Assemblyman Eric Vitaliano, D-Staten Island, who has known Larocca
for years. ``Jimmy's got quiet strength, and that's an asset in
this time of superficial sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe Larocca does not have a prayer said his
soft-pedal approach was winning him a loyal support base that could
make him a strong candidate in 2002. John Zogby, a pollster in
Utica, N.Y., said that although Larocca's better-known opponents
would suffer from a primary defeat, he has nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young, he's attractive, he is making the kinds of
contacts he needs and he is not hurting himself by attacking the
other candidates,'' Zogby said. ``My guess is that Larocca is the
only one of these four who's got legs.''

 EX-BOROUGH PRESIDENT'S CONTRACT FOR APOLLO THEATER TV SHOW UNDER
INVESTIGATION  (js) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The private foundation that controls the financially
troubled Apollo Theater decided Monday that a company owned by
Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough president, could for the
sixth year in a row retain the syndication rights to a popular
television show broadcast from the Harlem landmark.
</P>
<P>
   But another company that had been seeking the syndication rights
complained that the Apollo Theater Foundation had wrongly allowed
Sutton's company, Inner City Broadcasting, to change its bid at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   And the state attorney general's office, which is already
investigating the financial relationship between the foundation and
Sutton's company, said it would immediately subpoena records from
the meeting at which foundation members awarded the one-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton rebuilt the Apollo Theater in the 1980s, but it lost
money, and in 1992, he turned its management over to the nonprofit
foundation. The theater fell into disrepair and, in May, state
officials announced they would withhold $750,000 in loans and
grants from the foundation until serious questions about its
finances had been answered. The foundation manages the theater for
the state, which owns it.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, state officials are questioning whether the
foundation's board _ whose chairman is Sutton's close friend, U.S.
Rep. Charles Rangel _ allowed Inner City Broadcasting to
significantly underpay it for control of the popular television
show, ``It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' which it had retained under
a five-year licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Rangel said he and the other board
members had voted 7-4 to let Inner City Broadcasting keep the
syndication rights for another year. Although Rangel would not say
how much the company had offered for the rights, state officials
said it had originally offered $1.5 million _ the same amount that
the other bidder, the African Heritage Network, was offering. But
last Friday, the state officials said, Inner City changed its bid
to $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Wurzell, a spokesman for Attorney General Dennis Vacco,
said Monday that an assistant attorney general had recommended in a
recent letter to the foundation's lawyer that Rangel excuse himself
from the vote because of his friendship with Sutton. Wurzell would
not say exactly why the attorney general's office wanted to know
the specifics of the vote, but he suggested that state
investigators considered it suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for us is whether the board members' actions today
were in the best interest of the foundation,'' Wurzell said. ``We
will, in the next 24 hours, issue a subpoena to the foundation
requesting all the pertinent documentation of today's meeting and
the board's action.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was traveling Monday and could not be reached for
comment. Calls to Chuck Sutton, his nephew and spokesman, were not
returned. But Rangel defended the vote, saying it in no way
reflected a bias toward Inner City Broadcasting. He said the
African Heritage Network would have been allowed to change its bid,
too, if it had asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rangel would not say how he or any other board member voted, and
would not discuss why they chose Inner City Broadcasting over the
African Heritage Network. But he said representatives from the
attorney general's office, whom he has talked to periodically since
the broader investigation began, never asked him to refrain from
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Under the five-year licensing agreement, Inner City Broadcasting
was supposed to pay the foundation $2,000 per taping or 25 percent
of the show's profits, whichever was greater. But according to
officials at the Empire State Development Corp., the state agency
that owns the Apollo, the foundation's executives told its
directors this year that Sutton owed at least $3 million under the
agreement, which expired at the end of last year. When the board
pressed for payment, it received only $200,000, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Rangel both say the foundation received all it was
owed. In an interview in May, Sutton said the television show, now
in its 10th year, began to make a profit only two years ago.

THEATER PRODUCER WINS BID FOR 42ND ST. BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rejecting a more lucrative bid for a theme restaurant
run by the World Wrestling Federation, the officials behind Times
Square's redevelopment have agreed to lease 42nd Street's last
unclaimed historic theater to the Canadian company that produces
``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Livent Inc., the company that built the Ford Theater on the
north side of 42nd Street, home to ``Ragtime,'' is expected to sign
a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday to lease the long-dormant
Times Square Theater next door. If a final deal can be struck,
Livent plans to create a 500-seat theater, a two-story restaurant
and office space in the 88-year-old building, one of eight that
hark back to the glory days of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Livent, New York state officials and the New 42nd
Street, a nonprofit redevelopment agency, rejected a higher offer,
which they did not disclose, by the World Wrestling Federation and
a partner to build a restaurant and retail store with a wrestling
theme. The group wanted to broadcast professional wrestling,
including its popular Wrestlemania championship matches, and
interviews with stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin, the Undertaker
and Hunter Hearst Helmsley of D-Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   Livent also outmaneuvered developers seeking to open a
restaurant called Empire!, with a Roman gladiator theme, and a
comedy club called the Laugh Factory, real estate executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Cahan, the president of New 42nd Street, confirmed that her
group expected to sign an agreement Tuesday with Livent. She said
that the opportunity for another live theater on 42nd Street was
too good to pass up. Two of the biggest hits on Broadway today,
``Ragtime'' and ``The Lion King,'' are housed in newly restored
theaters on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   James Bell, senior vice president of licensing and merchandising
at the World Wrestling Federation, said the wrestlers would have
been good company for Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, also planned for
42nd Street, and the Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny cartoon characters
at the nearby Disney and Warner Brothers stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offer was substantially higher and more lucrative than the
one they chose,'' said Bell, who estimated that 60 million people a
week watch wrestling matches, based on pay-per-view and cable
television ratings. ``We would have brought a good element to that
location. And our fans spend money,'' he said _ about $300 million
annually on action figures, video games and T-shirts licensed by
the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were compatible with Disney and Warner
Brothers,'' Bell said. ``But the board really wanted a traditional
theater versus, quote unquote, another entertainment type.''

NUMBER OF UNINSURED MOTORISTS INVOLVED IN CRASHES DECLINES, REPORT
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The percentage of uninsured motorists involved in
crashes has plunged by more than half in California under a
16-month crackdown, Department of Motor Vehicle records show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, before laws were toughened, 24.1 percent of all drivers
in crashes reported to DMV were uninsured motorists. For the first
five months of this year, 11.2 percent of drivers in crashes
involved the uninsured, according to the report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The drop has meant a boon to drivers: car-insurance rates have
dipped 5.5 percent while rates nationally are rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reduction in the uninsured, more people are buying
policies and they are buying them in high uninsured areas. There
are fewer lawsuits involving uninsured motorists,'' Insurance
Commissioner Charles Quackenbush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't think it's worth going around bare. So
they're purchasing. I wouldn't declare victory yet, but we're
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   According to consumer activists, motorists should be getting
even lower rates as a result of the crackdown's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only good if there is a reward for the consumer and
rates start coming down,'' said Philip Roberto, research director
for the Santa Monica-based Proposition 103 Enforcement Project.
``They haven't come down fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The decrease in uninsured motorists follows a 1997 requirement
that owners produce proof of insurance to register a vehicle;
tougher fines and penalties for not carrying the minimum liability
insurance _ starting at $500 for a first offense and climbing
steeply _ and Proposition 213's denial of non-economic damage
settlements to uninsured motorists.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials said a new industry in counterfeit proofs of
insurance is flourishing and legislation is needed to criminalize
such activity.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, long the state's biggest trouble spot,
1.2 million automobile insurance policies have been bought since
1995, although there are 780,000 fewer automobiles registered in
the county today than there were then.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the county's uninsured rate stood at just over 41
percent and 2.2 million vehicles were being driven without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, total automobile-insurance sales have jumped from
17.1 million in 1996 to 19 million.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to insure vehicles also has meant that more than
550,000 car owners statewide declared their cars non-operational
between April 1996 and April 1997 rather than insure and register
them. Instead, they paid the DMV a $10 fee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 570,000 vehicles statewide disappeared from
the registration rolls and did not reappear as non-operational
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, there were 293,285 fewer cars and 27,355
fewer motorcycles registered in 1997 than 1996, records showed. The
number of non-operational registrations was not broken out.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cars that vanished from the registration roles were
smaller, less expensive models, DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff said.
The cars could have been driven out of state, junked, or kept and
driven illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for us to tell where cars go when they aren't
registered,'' Nossoff said.
</P>
<P>
   DMV investigators and insurance officials believe a growing
number of cars may now be being driven by people who have phony
insurance documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding a very, very high number of people getting
fraudulent insurance cards and policies. We've created a new market
for fraud documents,'' said Randy Vera, DMV senior special
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   A recent stakeout at DMV offices in Inglewood and Hawthorne
netted about 50 people with fake insurance cards trying to renew
their vehicle registration.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV is pushing for legislation that would make forging
insurance cards a misdemeanor. It already is a misdemeanor to give
false information to the DMV. &QL;

USC RECRUIT STILL NOT OUT OF JAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC football recruit Windrell Hayes will not
report for training camp Wednesday because he continues to face
three felony charges for writing bad checks for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' trial is scheduled for Nov. 16 in Stockton, but if he is
able to plea bargain and reduce the charges to a misdemeanor, the
wide receiver might be able to join the football team.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes has already turned down one offer from the Lodi district
attorney to settle the case, because he would have been responsible
for at least $15,000 in damages to victims.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Paul Hackett said it is possible a settlement might
be reached within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, a wide receiver, is a transfer from San Jose State.

 &HT;    A hair-raising experience: Stylists compete in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge and Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The gloves came off in a hurry Monday night during the
fast-paced ``Hair Battle Royale '98'' at the Georgia World Congress
Center downtown. As more than 3,000 Bronner Bros. International
Hair Show attendees applauded their favorites, 12 hairstylists from
across the country competed for a grand prize of $10,000 or a 1998
Jeep Cherokee. The only rules: a 10-minute time limit and unlimited
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   First up in the large black-draped boxing ring stage: Washington
D.C. stylist Miki Wright vs. LaMesa, Calif.'s Tesa
Breaston-Holiday. While Wright's three tulle gowned and
ringlet-adorned models suggested romance, Breaston-Holiday went
Asian flash complete with a thumping ``X-Files'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   As the models onstage were being sprayed, styled and spritzed,
Northwest Atlanta stylist TEE White was busy backstage readying his
secret weapon _ men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there will be a lot of women out there and I'm looking
for some screams,'' White, 30, explained as he put the finishing
touches on his buffed shirtless models' body art with matching
primary hair colors.
</P>
<P>
   College Park stylist Felisha Gatlin, meanwhile, was looking to
the future for her inspiration, complete with time capsules and
silver space suits. ``I'm using a `frozen in space' look,'' Gatlin,
27, said, whose hands were cooperating with the chosen theme.
``This is a tremendous honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Norcross stylist Maurice Beaman was busy staging
the history of black hair care. ``My goal is to show where we've
been and where we're going,'' Beaman, 34, explained.

CLINTON AIDES TAKE DEFIANT STANCE ON LEWINSKY MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes made throughout story for clarification and further
detail.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking a defiant stance toward prosecutors and
political critics, White House officials said on Monday that
President Clinton would continue to maintain that he had had no
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and would pursue another
Supreme Court showdown, this time over an appeals court decision
ordering a top aide to testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not scheduled to testify until Aug. 17, and his
advisers cautioned that only he and a small cadre of lawyers are
privy to his deliberations. But, in what appeared to be a concerted
effort, several Clinton aides on Monday dismissed pleas from
Republican congressmen and some former officials that Clinton
acknowledge an affair with the former White House intern to blunt
and perhaps end the 6-month-old investigation by Kenneth Starr, the
independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has told the truth about this, and he will
continue to do so,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, in
response to questions. ``I have no reason to think that that has
changed in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials expressed annoyance over what they called a
presumption that the president was lying when he denied that he had
had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct suit. They said that Clinton's agreement to testify,
despite White House suspicion of Starr's motives, proved that he
had nothing to fear. ``It is a little insulting to turn on the
television and see people come up with the brilliant idea that he
should tell the truth,'' one official said. ``Do you think anyone
here is going in and saying, `Sir, you should lie'?''
</P>
<P>
   Each weekday morning, the president's political advisers and
spokesmen, who are generally in the dark about his legal strategy,
meet with members of the White House counsel's office for guidance
on how to respond to the day's developments in the investigation.
Aides who spoke about the president's position appeared to have
based their comments on such discussions.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House affirmed Clinton's denials, forensic
scientists at the FBI crime laboratory completed a first set of
tests on a blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to determine whether the dress was stained
during a sexual encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The first test, performed under extremely tight security, was
intended to determine whether the stain had been caused by semen,
but the result was being very closely held.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of rapid-fire legal motions and court decisions the
White House also served notice on Monday that it would ask the
Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's decision compelling Bruce
Lindsey, a White House lawyer who is the president's closest
adviser, to testify to the Lewinsky grand jury. After that
decision, Lanny Breuer, another member of the White House Counsel's
office, was subpoenaed last week to testify on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House filed a motion Monday with the Court of Appeals
here seeking to block testimony by its lawyers while it awaits
action by the Supreme Court. That motion was rejected, but the
White House immediately filed the same request with Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, according to The Associated Press. It was not
clear whether the maneuvering would affect Breuer's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who has said he knows of no wrongdoing or criminal
conduct, cited lawyer-client privilege in declining to answer some
questions before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In its divided ruling last week, a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Appeals found that no such privilege could protect a
government lawyer from testifying in a criminal investigation. It
ruled that the lawyers' ``duty is not to defend clients against
criminal charges and it is not to protect wrongdoers from public
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House counsel, Charles Ruff, said the appeals court
decision would undercut any president's ability to get honest
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This privilege ultimately serves the public interest by
ensuring fully informed decision-making through open and candid
discussions between clients and attorneys,'' Ruff said in a
statement Monday. ``The confidential nature of the attorney-client
privilege relationship is no less important in government than in
every other context where it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   In another running legal contest between Starr and the White
House, the Court of Appeals handed down a mixed ruling Monday,
deciding that an investigation may continue into whether Starr's
office has illegally leaked grand jury material. The investigation
is being conducted by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who presides
over the grand jury hearing the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But, overruling part of a decision by Judge Johnson, the appeals
court found that the president's lawyers may not on their own
depose Starr's prosecutors or demand documents from them, according
to a lawyer familiar with the ruling, which was sealed. Instead,
Judge Johnson must first review and approve any documents that are
to be turned over by Starr's office, to ensure they do not reveal
grand jury secrets.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, one of the president's lawyers, has accused
Starr's office of illegal slipping information to reporters and
sought sanctions against it. Starr's office has denied such leaks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president said on Monday that he betrayed no sign
of nervousness about his prospective testimony. ``The most
comforting thing in the White House now is that the president seems
totally comfortable,'' said one Clinton aide who is not part of his
damage-control team.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to publicly ignore his legal and political
predicament, Clinton confined his public comments on Monday to
other legislative matters than talk of potential impeachment
hearings. In a speech to summer jobs workers in Cheverly, Md., he
warned Republican leaders that he would not accept a ``bare-bones''
budget from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Republican plan puts politics ahead of people and
puts your future in the back seat,'' he said. ``That is wrong.''
With veto threats hanging over seven appropriations bills, the
White House is on a collision course with Congress over the budget,
though that dispute has been obscured by the furor over Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also gave a speech on Monday, appearing before a lawyers'
group in Toronto, Canada. He reviewed the Supreme Court's
performance this year, calling it ``quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had learned from a defeat he suffered this year
before the Supreme Court, which ruled he could not have access to
notes taken by a lawyer to Vince Foster, the former White House
deputy counsel who committed suicide during Clinton's first term.
The court ruled that a client's death did not weaken the
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that ``the court reminded us that there are other
considerations, there are other values,'' besides the pursuit of
truth. ``The law, embodying the wisdom of the ages, has seen fit to
protect relationships, even at the expense of truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Starr told reporters that he was pursuing his
investigation while ``being respectful of the institutions of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the president's advisers have doubts about his
truthfulness regarding Ms. Lewinsky, and some suspect that by
changing his story now he could bring an end to a drama that has
transfixed Washington and stunted progress on Capitol Hill. But
many Clinton allies also believe that any admission by Clinton
would be turned against him by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's advisers said that his team of political and
legal aides was nervously awaiting test results on Ms. Lewinsky's
dress, which was bought at the Gap. If DNA testing links the dress
to Clinton, this adviser said, White House thinking on his
testimony may change. ``Whatever anyone is saying becomes
inoperative depending upon the results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike laboratory findings in most high profile cases, which are
widely distributed through the upper echelons of the
law-enforcement agency and the Justice Department, the Lewinsky lab
tests are being provided only to a handful of lab technicians and
senior FBI officials. They in turn reveal the findings directly to
Starr.

YANKEES' SUCCESS ENHANCES VALUE OF CABLE CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each Yankees cable telecast should rightly be
preceded by a notice like the ones that accompany public TV
programs: ``This game has been generously underwritten by a grant
from the Madison Square Garden Network.''
</P>
<P>
   The MSG Network has made the Yankees flusher than flush since
the start of their landmark $486 million cable TV contract in 1989.
As the deal nears its end, MSG will pay the Yankees $53.3 million
this year, $54.25 million next year and $55.25 million in 2000,
according to people who have read the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball teams survive on $45 million or $50 million a
season less in cable cash. The entire National Hockey League gets
less in its rights deal with Fox Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But with the deal's expiration two years away, can the Yankees
expect a new one to maintain such exorbitant payments _ or go even
higher? When the deal was negotiated in 1988, it was the subject of
rabid bidding among MSG, which wanted to become more than a
six-month Knicks and Rangers service; Sportschannel New York, which
had held the Yankee cable rights from 1982 to 1988, and
WPIX/Channel 11.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Cablevision Systems owns MSG and Fox Sports New York,
the former Sportschannel. WPIX is part of the WB Network and could
not carry more than the 50 games it carries now under a subcontract
with MSG.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably less, as the WB expands,'' said Michael Eigner, who
oversees WPIX as an executive vice president of Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   So does Chuck Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, hold all the
leverage? Can he dictate to George Steinbrenner, the team's
principal owner, a significant cut in payments? Will Steinbrenner's
cash wad shrink in the new millennium until he gets a new stadium?
</P>
<P>
   No. No. And unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' value has expanded in the past decade, almost
making us forget the leanness of their 288-359 record from 1989 to
1992, the first four years of MSG's deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were 77-28 before Monday night's game in Oakland,
and MSG's 3.88 rating after 63 games is up 51 percent from last
year and 33 percent ahead of 1996' full-season MSG peak.
</P>
<P>
   There are several scenarios that offer competition to
Cablevision:
</P>
<P>
   _ Steinbrenner could create his own Yankee Network. For that he
would have to set up an administrative structure to sell the rights
to individual cable systems and commercial time to advertisers. He
would get no cash up front, but would get all the cable system fees
and advertiser payments. To execute the plan, he would need to make
a deal with Cablevision, which owns systems totaling 2.6 million of
the metropolitan area's 4.6 million cable homes. Dolan can be a
tough negotiator, but any attempt to bar the Yankees from his
systems would surely engender widespread viewer reaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steinbrenner could go into a partnership with Time Warner,
which could create a sports channel on its New York City cable
system, reaching 1.1 million subscribers. Time Warner would also
have to deal with Cablevision to gain full local exposure beyond
its environs. Tough as Cablevision can be, can you imagine someone
else starting a Yankee network and Dolan saying, ``Nah, sorry,
that's not for me''? Cable systems need the Yankees, even Dolan's.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN could launch a sports channel. Until recently, ESPN
contemplated creating ESPN West to carry games of the Anaheim
Angels and Mighty Ducks, the teams controlled by its parent,
Disney. When cable systems balked at carrying ESPN West, ESPN made
10-year deals to keep the Angels on Fox Sports West and the Ducks
on Fox Sports West 2, two of the 22 regional sports outlets under
the Fox Sports Net. A drawback to an ESPN New York is that it would
remain a one-team service until other teams' rights became
available. The Yankees plus college hoops and lacrosse is not a
powerhouse channel. Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman, said, ``We
will consider regional opportunities if they make good business
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New technologies, like digital television or satellite TV,
could play a role in a non-Cablevision scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Dolan must realize George Steinbrenner has many options
to work things out for himself,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a
professor of economics at Smith College and an expert on sports
finance. ``Steinbrenner has put an emphasis on developing a winning
team in anticipation of negotiating a new package. He's played his
cards right. I see this as a $50 million-a-year contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan realizes all this and knows that not having the Yankees'
cable rights would hurt more than the defection of any other team.
If Yankees games were broadcast on the Yankee Network, you could
expect that cable systems would, if necessary, pre-empt whatever
was being shown on MSG to carry the Bronx Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan knows this, which is why he tried to buy the Yankees last
year. If he had bought the team, he would have acquired the cable
rights to eternity, which the Fox Group did by buying the Dodgers.
If he bought a chunk of the team, it would come with a continued
cable deal. The talks never yielded a sale. But if there exists a
price that would make Steinbrenner bite, it has risen thanks to the
successful juggernaut the Yankees have been through 105 games.

   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza turned jeers to cheers against his former
team with a run-scoring single and a two-run home run for the Mets
Monday night at Shea Stadium. But there was no stopping the boos
directed at Greg McMichael when he pitched in relief for the Mets
against his former team. McMichael allowed five unearned runs and
two home runs in just two-thirds of an inning, as the Mets blew a
four-run lead to the Dodgers and suffered a crushing 8-5 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was especially demoralizing because the Mets (58-51)
looked as if they were going to pull within two games of the
Chicago Cubs in the National League wild-card race with what would
have been their 11th victory in the last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   But then McMichael (2-4) came on in relief for Hideo Nomo _ the
pitcher he was originally traded from the Mets to the Dodgers for _
to begin the seventh inning. And the right-hander could not hold a
5-2 lead, as Raul Mondesi and Eric Karros each belted long home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich began the Dodgers' rally with a
one-out single to left. Eric Young followed with a grounder to
short, but Rey Ordonez was charged with a throwing error as the
shortstop and second baseman Carlos Baerga were trying to turn an
inning-ending double play. Ordonez appeared to throw the ball too
hard, and it shot past Baerga's glove and into right center field.
Eisenreich took third on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Mark Grudzielanek hit a lazy fly to Todd Hundley in
left, McMichael _ who was traded back to New York for Brian Bohanon
_ allowed a three-run home run to Mondesi and a two-run shot to
Karros, both with two out.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the Mets were down two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's homer, his second of the game and 25th this season,
bounced off the top of the fence in center field, off the speakers
in back, and back onto the field to tie the game at 5-5. Karros'
shot to deep left center followed a single by Gary Sheffield and
gave Los Angeles a 7-5 lead, its first of the game. After McMichael
surrendered a two-out double to the next batter, Roger Cedeno, the
once and current Met, was all but booed off the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was a passion usually reserved for Piazza of late.
</P>
<P>
   But not Monday night, after Piazza had two hits in his first
three times up and three runs batted in. There were also plenty of
cheers for Nomo, who went six strong innings, allowing three hits,
two runs, two walks and striking out six. He looked like a lock to
win his fourth consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' defense _ so steady most of the season _ was
shaky, committing three errors.
</P>
<P>
   The misplays hurt Nomo most in the sixth. He allowed a one-out
solo home run to Mondesi and had to work overtime in the inning
just to leave with a 5-2 lead. A two-out third strike to Karros
skipped past Piazza for a wild pitch and enabled Karros to take
first base. Cedeno then reached on an error by Baerga, before Nomo
retired Adrian Beltre on an easy comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it looked as if the Mets were on their way to an easy
victory. Tony Phillips doubled to lead off the first and Edgardo
Alfonzo walked before Piazza and Brian McRae delivered run-scoring
singles off Dave Mlicki, the pitcher traded to Los Angeles with
McMichael on June 4 for Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the Dodgers had clawed back for a run in the
third on a two-out, run-scoring single by Grudzielanek to make it
2-1, Nomo singled home a run off Mlicki in the fourth, and then
Piazza drilled his 19th homer of the season in the fifth for a 5-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But McMichael and the Mets let it all slip away.

ALFRED SCHNITTKE, ECLECTIC COMPOSER, DIES AT 63 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, Germany)  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Schnittke, an iconoclastic composer who won fame in the
West as he struggled against the restraints of Soviet cultural
ideology at home, died Monday at the University Hospital in
Hamburg, Germany. He was 63 and lived in Hamburg and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, one of a series he had suffered in
recent years, according to his wife, Irina.
</P>
<P>
   Schnittke's eclectic method of composing, a collagelike approach
in which many styles and periods came together, was particularly
emblematic of music late in this century, reflecting an
international environment in which many languages competed for
attention with none speaking in an authoritative voice.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the medium _ be it serialism, updated
romanticism, baroque gestures or collages made of all the above _
his eclecticism was colored and weighted by a sense of pessimism
and anxiety bordering on, and often crossing over into, despair.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Schnittke's music has humorous elements, but wit's light
touch usually eluded him. More successful are the heavy comic
ironies placed against gloomy and imaginative elucidations of
modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I composed in a distinct style,'' Schnittke
said in an interview in 1988, ``but as I see it now, my personality
was not coming through. More recently I have used many different
styles, and quotations from many periods of musical history, but my
own voice comes through them clearly now. ... It is not just
eclecticism for its own sake. When I use elements of, say, baroque
music ... sometimes I'm tweaking the listener. And sometimes I'm
thinking about earlier music as a beautiful way of writing that has
disappeared and will never come back; and in that sense, it has a
tragic feeling for me. I see no conflict in being both serious and
comic in the same piece. In fact, I cannot have one without the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnittke was born in 1934 in Engels in the Volga republic,
which was then an autonomous region for ethnic Germans within the
Soviet Union. His music training began in Vienna, Austria, where
his father worked after World War II, and finished at the Moscow
Conservatory, where he subsequently taught instrumentation, score
reading, counterpoint and composition until 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He came to music late in his youth because of the war. ``We
didn't have a radio,'' he recalled. ``I don't think I heard any
music at all. One of the first pieces I heard, in 1946, was the
Shostakovich Ninth Symphony, which was very refreshing but also
very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1961 and 1984, Schnittke wrote the scores for more than
60 films, but did so in popular styles removed from his privately
inspired compositions. His major shift into eclecticism began with
his Second Violin Concerto in 1968 but had its origins in
film-score writing, a medium demanding many kinds of music. Mahler
and Ives were among its influences, as well as the rigorous serial
thinking of Henri Pousseur.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schnittke was a busy and productive composer and did not lack
for exposure in the United States and Europe. New York performances
of his music in recent years included all four of his string
quartets, a Piano Sonata (performed by Vladimir Feltsman, to whom
it was dedicated), a Cello Sonata, his first two cello concertos, a
Sonata for Violin and Chamber Orchestra and a Concerto for Piano
and Strings.
</P>
<P>
   His first opera, ``Life With an Idiot,'' had its world premiere
at the Netherlands Music Theater in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on
April 13, 1992. It is a surreal musical satire about a man who is
ordered by the Communist Party to take an idiot into his home as
punishment for some unnamed crime, and who suffers disaster as a
result. The work was conducted to great acclaim by Mstislav
Rostropovich. The Dutch press labeled the opera ``a requiem for the
Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnittke belonged to a rebellious arm of Soviet composition
that included Sofia Gubaidulina, Arvo Part and Edison Denisov.
Their nemesis was the Soviet Composers Union, which frowned on
serialism and many forms of experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere of Schnittke's First Symphony _ a piece the
composer described as ``beginning like a circus and ending in an
apocalyptic, terrifying way'' _ lost him the union's support in
1972, but he survived on film work and commissions from admiring
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such famous expatriates as Rostropovich, Feltsman, Gidon
Kremer and Dmitri Sitkovetsky brought with them their firm belief
in Schnittke's music when they came from the Soviet Union to the
West. Musicians like these, and now increasingly those who remained
at home, have been largely responsible for his international
reputation, which has been strengthening for a decade or more. Poor
health, however, slowed his activities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Schnittke is survived by a son.

LEROY BURNEY, FORMER SURGEON GENERAL, DIES AT 91 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Ohio, Ga., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Leroy Burney, who as surgeon general of the U.S. Public
Health Service in the Eisenhower administration was the first
federal official publicly to identify smoking as a cause of lung
cancer, died Friday at a hospital in Park Ridge, Ill. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, 1957, after organizing a group of scientists to
appraise 18 studies on smoking and health, Burney, himself a
smoker, issued a report saying, ``It is clear that there is an
increasing and consistent body of evidence that excessive cigarette
smoking is one of the causative factors in lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scientific Advisory Board to the Tobacco Industry Research
Committee immediately rebutted Burney's statement, saying that it
``adds nothing new to what has been known about the cause of lung
cancer'' and reflected the opinions of a small number of
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the evidence against smoking was mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Burney's first statement, and a stronger one in 1959, paved the
way for Luther Terry, surgeon general under President Lyndon
Johnson, to issue a landmark report on smoking and health in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Burney was not the first surgeon general to discuss the hazards
of smoking. Last year, in the journal Public Health Reports, Dr.
John Parasandola, the Public Health Service's historian, wrote that
in 1929, Surgeon General Hugh Cumming ``warned that smoking could
lower the `physical tone' of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1959,
Burney expanded on the link between smoking and lung cancer, now
saying smoking was ``the principal'' causative factor in lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the use of tobacco can be made safe, the individual
person's risk of lung cancer can best be reduced by the elimination
of smoking,'' he wrote, adding ``stopping cigarette smoking even
after long exposure is beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   But the American Medical Association, which for years had
investments in tobacco, said in an editorial in 1959 that there was
insufficient evidence ``to warrant the assumption'' that smoking
was the principal factor in the increase in lung cancer. ``A number
of authorities who have examined the same evidence cited by Burney
do not agree with his conclusions,'' the Journal's editor, Dr. John
Talbott, wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Leroy Edgar Burney was born on Dec. 31, 1906 in Burney, Ind.,
then a town of 300 that had been founded by his great-grandfather,
William Burney.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Butler University in Indianapolis for two years,
Leroy Burney received a bachelor's degree in 1928 and a medical
degree in 1930 from Indiana University. After an internship at the
U.S. Marine Hospital in Chicago, he earned a degree in public
health from Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Burney joined the Public Health Service in 1932, starting at its
Marine Hospital in Cleveland. In 1937 he set up the country's first
mobile venereal disease clinic, in Brunswick, Ga. At the time, he
wrote that effective control programs had been created for white
people in Northern states but ``no such programs for the Negro was
in progress in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Burney helped control sexually transmitted diseases for the Navy
during World War II. From 1945 to 1954 he was Indiana state health
officer. In 1956, he became the eighth surgeon general of the U.S.
Public Health Service, replacing Dr. Leonard Scheele, who resigned
after a number of children developed polio from being injected with
Salk vaccine because of a manufacturing problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Burney approved the Sabin oral polio vaccine for use in
the United States after the vaccine had been used on millions of
people in South America and the Soviet Union. Burney defended the
long delay in endorsing the vaccine by saying that he had ``no
apologies to make for conservatism, which is justified in an issue
as important as this.''
</P>
<P>
   As surgeon general, Burney worked to improve health care for the
elderly, particularly in nursing homes. Concerned about the
indiscriminate use of X-rays in health care, Burney set up a
division to unify radiation-related activities in the Public Health
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Burney also championed improving environmental health and
cleaning up pollution. He helped create the National Library of
Medicine, the National Center for Health Statistics and a national
influenza-surveillance system at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The day before leaving the White House in 1961, Eisenhower wrote
Burney, praising his efforts to control air pollution, raise the
quality of water and improve health internationally. A week later,
Burney retired as surgeon general and became vice president for
health sciences at Temple University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, at a meeting of former surgeons general of the U.S.
Public Health Service, Burney spoke about the effects of managed
care on the health care of Americans and said the patient often was
losing out. ``Some people, particularly the elderly, need the
warmth and friendliness of a personal physician's touch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, the former Mildred Hewins; a son,
Robert, of Washington; a daughter, Kay Butler of Lake Forest, Ill.;
five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

NCAA verdict 
regarding Tech 
due out today
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ The NCAA report on the Texas Tech infractions case, more
than 90 days in the making, is in the hands of university officials
and will become public today.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by the NCAA's Division I Committee on
Infractions, will be released to the media at 9 a.m., according to
an NCAA news release. Two hours later, Bonnie Slatton, the
committee's acting chairperson, will discuss the document via
conference call, the release said.
</P>
<P>
   Slatton, who chairs the University of Iowa's Department of
Physical Education and Sports Studies, led the committee during the
Tech case in the absence of the panel's chairman, David Swank, a
law professor at the University of Oklahoma. Swank recused himself
as a result of his ties to the Big 12 Conference. The committee has
eight members, all but two affiliated with NCAA schools or
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Tech chancellor John Montford said the university received a
copy of the committee's report late Monday afternoon. Citing NCAA
policy, he said he could not comment on the document until it is
released publicly. He said Tech likely would issue a written
statement after Slatton's news conference and would not hold a
formal news conference of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The report will mark the end of a waiting game that began when
Tech officials spent two days in front of the panel during its
April meeting in Cleveland. The committee's job is to determine the
validity of allegations turned up in NCAA investigations and, if
necessary, assess penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has acknowledged several rules violations stemming from
university audits and a lengthy NCAA investigation and instituted a
series of self-imposed penalties, including scholarship reductions
and forfeitures. The committee's report will state how the panel
ruled on those matters in which Tech and NCAA enforcement personnel
were at odds and whether more sanctions are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA enforcement staff initiated a preliminary inquiry of
the Tech athletic program in February 1996. The inquiry focused on
issues relating to football and men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Questions regarding how Tech basketball players Gracen Averil
and Deuce Jones were certified as eligible for the 1996-97 season
prompted Tech to conduct an audit of its eligibility-certification
procedures. The audit determined that 76 athletes in eight sports,
including football and men's basketball, had been improperly
certified as eligible from 1991-92 through 1996-97 as a result of
administrative errors. Further checking by Tech increased the total
to 81.
</P>
<P>
   Another Tech audit found that a misunderstanding of NCAA rules
had caused the university to award improper financial aid to
athletes in baseball and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   A letter of official inquiry prepared by the NCAA enforcement
staff and submitted to Tech last October included the two matters
detailed in the university audits as well as 16 areas of alleged
wrongdoing developed by enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In its response to the letter, Tech acknowledged that several of
the NCAA's allegations were correct. The university agreed with the
charge that it lacked institutional control in the operation of its
athletic program. It also acknowledged that former Tech assistant
football coach Rhudy Maskew likely engaged in academic fraud in his
efforts to help ex-defensive lineman Stephen Gaines obtain
correspondence-course credit from Southeastern College of the
Assemblies of God in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges disputed by Tech were two stating that the
university's longtime faculty athletics representative, Robert
Sweazy, and other personnel were negligent in investigating
potential rules violations. A particularly thorny issue involves
former receiver Malcolm McKenzie, who, enforcement personnel
allege, was allowed to continue playing after Tech officials had
reason to believe he had been improperly readmitted to the
university in the fall of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tech removed its football team from bowl consideration last fall
after receiving the letter of official inquiry and added a series
of other penalties in April. Those penalties included three years'
probation, scholarship cuts in six sports, and the forfeiture of
all games in which ineligible athletes participated.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Tech's self-imposed penalties, the Red Raiders
football program gave up eight initial scholarships this year and
will lose six in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the infractions committee has chosen to do little
more than rubber-stamp schools' own actions. In the Baylor
University basketball case in 1995, the committee went a step
further and gave the school permission to lighten its self-imposed
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools have not been so fortunate, however. The
University of Miami, facing charges of doling out impermissible
financial aid and other administrative-related impropriety, went
before the committee in 1995 having stripped itself of seven
football scholarships for one year and was handed a punishment that
included a bowl ban and the loss of 24 additional scholarships over
a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Tech can accept the committee's report as the final word in the
case or appeal any element of it to the NCAA Infractions Appeals
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Should the university accept the report without appeal, it will
mark the end of an investigation that began three years ago when
Tech became enmeshed in the national scandal that emerged after
Baylor basketball coaches were found to have helped four recruits
receive phony correspondence-course credit from Southeastern
College.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other schools have received institutional penalties from
the NCAA for various infractions relating to basketball players
having obtained credit for correspondence courses offered by the
Lakeland, Fla., Bible college. A finding of academic fraud in the
Gaines case would make Tech's football program the first tied to
wrongdoing involving Southeastern College.

COMMENTARY: CLINTON'S FOREIGN DEBT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct ``next week'' to ``this month) in graf 8)   By THOMAS L FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ I thought that by going all the way to
Brazil, I might actually escape the Bill Clinton soap opera. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Scene one: A Brazilian macho men's association recently voted
Bill Clinton ``Macho Man of the Year,'' and even delivered the
award to the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Scene two: Lunch in Rio de Janeiro with a group of Brazilian
businessmen. They want to know just one thing: What might Bill
Clinton's troubles mean for U.S. investment in Brazil? ``The whole
world is depending on U.S. capital flows,'' explains Joel Korn, a
leading Brazilian management consultant. ``If there is a change in
the U.S. situation because of the president's troubles, which
affects U.S. investment overseas, the whole world will be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   You have here in a nutshell the two basic foreign reactions to
Clinton's troubles: 1) Surely you Americans can't be serious about
prosecuting a president for adultery. World leaders always play
around _ just look at ours. And 2) My God, what if you Americans
are serious about prosecuting your president for adultery! Don't
you realize how important you are for the rest of the world? You
are the world's only superpower. Nothing happens without you. And
every emerging market is depending on your economic stability.
Maybe you think you don't need a president _ but the rest of the
world does.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Half the time the rest of the world is
snickering at us as naive Puritans and half the time they are
unnerved that we might actually devour another president, with all
the uncertainty that might entail.
</P>
<P>
   They are right to be concerned. Americans may think the world is
safe for us to indulge in this entertaining Clinton saga _ and for
U.S. foreign policy to come to a standstill while it plays out _
but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Look what's going on out there: Russia, with 20,000 nuclear
weapons and an impoverished arms industry ready to sell anything to
anyone, is teetering on the edge of collapse. Kosovo and Albania
are imploding. China is considering devaluing its currency, in a
move that could trigger a whole new downward economic spiral in
Asia that would surely hurt the U.S. economy. Japan is stumbling
around, lost. Saddam Hussein is preparing to rear his ugly head
again. Iran is testing a long-range missile. The Arabs are moving
closer to Iran, out of a feeling that the United States is too weak
now to protect them from any Iranian meddling. The expansion of
U.S. free trade, through the fast-track process, is frozen because
the president is afraid to confront Congressional Democrats on this
issue, because they are his only core support. And the Arab-Israeli
peace process is frozen, in part because the White House has
completely wimped out from its vow to confront Israel's prime
minister, Bibi Netanyahu, if he continues to reject the U.S. peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not some backdoor argument for letting the president
off the hook and just ignoring this whole tawdry affair. It is an
argument for why the president, in whatever he says to the grand
jury this month or to the American public afterward, has to bring
this case to a close, once and for all. No more ``I didn't
inhale,'' ``I didn't consummate,'' ``Not to my recollection.'' It's
enough, already.
</P>
<P>
   The press is now full of reports about infighting in the White
House between aides who think the president should come clean with
the grand jury and aides who think he shouldn't. Excuse me, but are
these guys nuts? Do they really think there is any hope for
salvaging the Clinton presidency with anything less than a full
disclosure? Do they really think America's national security
interests can indefinitely tolerate a wounded president, constantly
on the run from the press, courts and Congress?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has got to say and do now what is necessary to put this
case behind him _ in a way that might give at least some chance for
him to pursue the progressive agenda, at home and abroad, for which
he was elected. He owes that to all the people who believe in the
social and economic programs for which he stood, and still might be
able to salvage. He owes that to all the people who don't want to
see an isolationist, mean-spirited Republican right shaping
America's future.
</P>
<P>
   But to have a morally impeached Bill Clinton, without a shred of
hope for Clintonism, well, what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, whatever your aides might say, your options are
to tell the truth or resign. I hope you tell the truth, because the
country and the world can't afford to have you endlessly twisting
in the wind.

MAN CHARGED WITH 4 RAPES IN BRONX

   NEW YORK _ A 28-year-old man suspected of scaling fire escapes
to rape women in the Bronx _ perhaps as many as 11 _ was captured
on Sunday after his attempt at another break-in and rape was
foiled, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Rudolph Moore, was charged Monday with four rapes
involving fire-escape break-ins after four women picked him out of
lineups, said Officer Theresa Farello, a department spokeswoman.
Moore is also a suspect in seven similar rapes during the last
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was arrested after he was seen climbing down a fire escape
into a woman's apartment in the Norwood section of the Bronx,
Farello said. Police received a 911 call about a man on a fire
escape on Knox Place, she said, but before officers arrived, the
man had climbed into a third-floor apartment and tried to rape the
woman in front of her two children.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was not identified by police because she was the
victim of an attempted rape, broke free and ran down to the street
with her two children, police said. The man escaped over the roof
and down another fire escape to the street, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After police arrived, they called for a large deployment of
officers, and Moore was arrested nearby a short time later, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators quickly realized that the method of the attack was
familiar, and they began working to determine whether Moore could
be linked to any of the other fire-escape rapes that have plagued
the Bronx in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven women have been raped there since last August, each
reporting that the attacker climbed into the apartment from a fire
escape. The most recent attack occurred on Wednesday, police said.
All the attacks took place near the Mosholu Parkway, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the descriptions of the suspect in the rapes varied
slightly _ in some accounts he was described as a dark-skinned
Hispanic man, in others as an African-American _ police divided the
cases into three distinct patterns to be investigated. Monday,
investigators said that they believed Moore was responsible for all
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who told investigators that he worked as an exotic
dancer, was convicted of first-degree robbery in 1990 and served
two years in prison.

U.S. solidifies under fire

<P>
   Americans come from behind to knock off Spain
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ It looked for the longest time like a classic
case of the Americans getting sandbagged.
</P>
<P>
   The same opponent they had hammered by 17 points in a
meaningless exhibition two weeks ago was about to rub out the U.S.
squad in a game that not only meant something, but would go a long
way toward deciding the Americans' ultimate fate in the FIBA World
Championship of Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when they needed it most, the shots started to fall, the
defense made a critical stand and Rudy Tomjanovich's team found
itself pulling off a pulsating 75-73 win over Spain on Monday at
Olympic Stadium. It was one of many strange twists on a day that
left the World Championship with no undefeated teams and no clear
favorite for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   This, it would seem, is exactly what the tournament should be
like with the ``Dream Team'' of NBA players absent. Six teams have
only one loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says it right there,'' said Jimmy King, who came off the
bench to help the Americans overcome an 11-point second-half
deficit. ``That's how competitive this tournament is. We didn't
come out here and expect to blow anybody away.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is going to be work. We can't expect to come out here
and breeze through any game. We have to work at it. To me that's
the fun part. They're giving us great competition out here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Americans learned a long time ago they don't necessarily
qualify as favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is unbeatable in this tournament,'' said Jimmy Oliver,
who had 17 points, including a 3-pointer with 1:18 to play that put
the U.S. ahead for good at 72-71. ``Everybody has their Dream Team
here, even though we don't have our NBA players here. Anybody can
be beat. You just can't expect to go out and win every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we lost, some people probably think they're the
favorites. I still say we're the favorites. So we got to play like
we're favorites. We got to go out and work for everything. We got
to be a working-class team. We're not all highly paid individuals
who can go out and expect something to come to us. We got to go out
and take what's ours. And I think this gold medal should be ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But they have a lot of ground to cover between now and
Sunday, when the medals will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Americans is that they are assured of
making the quarterfinals. Even a loss tonight to Australia wouldn't
knock them out of medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that they could finish anywhere from first to
fourth in the six-team Group F when the second round is completed
today. Obviously, the higher they finish, the lower-seeded team
they will see from Group E when the quarterfinals are played
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Monday, Italy upset Yugoslavia 61-60 to throw
Group E into a frenzy. With Greece losing to Russia, three teams
are 4-1 in Group E (Yugoslavia, Greece and Russia). Italy is 3-2
and Puerto Rico is 2-3. Canada already has been eliminated at 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   In Group F, Lithuania beat Brazil and Australia outlasted
Argentina. That left the U.S., Lithuania and Spain at 4-1, with
Australia 3-2 and Argentina 2-3. Brazil already has been eliminated
at 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday, the Americans simply are glad to be 4-1. They were
getting manhandled much of the way by Spain and it took a defensive
twist, along with better teamwork offensively, to get them back in
the game after trailing every step of the way until Oliver's
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the 95-78 whipping the U.S. put on the
Spaniards on July 19 in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches told us that was because their main guys only
played about 10 minutes when we saw them in Monaco,'' King said.
``So that wasn't really their true team.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously. The Americans had to prove they could win a game
under pressure and, after faltering in the late moments against
Lithuania last week, they came through this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great, character win for us,'' Tomjanovich said.
``I can't tell you how disappointed I was in this team in the first
half. We were not a team. All the work we had put in, I told our
guys we could get five guys off the street and played about the
same kind of game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope a really big lesson was learned about the team concept.
It would have been ugly if we had continued to play like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we made a defensive adjustment that took a
lot of communication. And offensively, we started sharing the ball.
Kiwane Garris came in and made some big shots and we put him on
their star player and he did a good job of staying in front of him,
even though he was giving up some inches.''
</P>
<P>
   Garris was giving away four inches to Alberto Herreros, Spain's
top player who finished with 27 points. But Garris pushed Herreros
to his left and got help from his teammates down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make an adjustment because they were shooting the
ball so well,'' King said. ``We decided to trap the guy with the
ball and make him make the decisions. We had to do something
because we didn't play any defense, really, in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trailed 69-64 with three minutes to play before Brad
Miller (12 points) got loose for a dunk. After a Spain turnover,
Wendell Alexis hit a 3-pointer to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Herreros and Ignacio de Miguel each missed one of two free
throws. That set up Oliver's trey.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws by both teams made it 75-73 with 10 seconds left,
giving Spain time to tie or win the game. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But when Ignacio Rodriguez and Jose Paraiso missed just before
the buzzer, the Americans had won a game in spite of only leading
for two of the 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were the right minutes,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Miller: ``We got a chance to get the No. 1 seed now, which
is important because the four teams that will come out of the other
bracket are all real good.''
