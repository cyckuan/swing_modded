	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo issued a strong protest against North Korea
for firing a missile over Japan and sent military ships Tuesday to
the spot in the Pacific Ocean where it was believed to have landed.
	   The missile launch Monday renewed worries over security in Asia
and raised serious questions about the adequacy of Japan's missile
detection and anti-missile systems.
	   ``Our relations with North Korea are going to be more severe
than they have ever been,'' said Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura
after attending a special Cabinet meeting, where the missile topped
the agenda.
	   Komura said the missile may help speed up Japan's long planned
joint development of a missile defense system with the United
States.
	   Japan, which greatly relies on the United States for its
defense, now has no missile defense system.
	   Defense officials said the missile appeared to be the new Taepo
Dong 1, which has a longer range than the old model and is capable
of reaching all of South Korea and Japan.
	   With no official diplomatic channels with the reclusive
communist state, even issuing the protest was a problem.
	   When a protest was levied in New York overnight to Kim Chang
Guk, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, he
merely repeated North Korea's usual criticism against Japan's
security arrangement with the United States, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   North Korea remained mute on the missile in its official news
being monitored by the Radiopress agency in Tokyo.
	   The Defense Agency said it will analyze any parts of the missile
the dispatched ships may retrieve. But it refused to say whether
its monitoring system had been able to detect the missile in
advance.
	   In its initial statement on the missile, the agency said the
information had come from U.S. military officials.
	   Defense tends to be a sensitive topic for many Japanese because
of the backlash from the bitter memories of extreme militarism
during World War II. The pacifist movement is a powerful lobby
group in Japan, and the slightest sign of heightened military might
draws nervous protest from Asian neighbors.
	   That is partly why the missile defense system project has been
so slow in coming.
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the liberal Asahi newspaper warned
against any hasty decision on the missile defense project, and
instead called for ``calm.'' The more conservative Yomiuri urged a
speedup.
	   The North Korean missile drew heightened concern from abroad as
well.
	   ``For North Korea, development of its military power is a
strategic issue that directly affects its survival. So it will
never give it up,'' said South Korean Defense Minister Chun
Yong-taek.
	   ``Military power is North Korea's only bargaining card to play
with the outside world,'' he told reporters before departing for
Tokyo for a meeting later in the day with the director of Japan's
Defense Agency.
	   Chun's three-day visit had been set ahead of the missile firing.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
she would raise the issue in talks with North Korea. State
Department spokesman Lee McClenny called the launch ``a matter of
deep concern to the United States.''

Clinton arrives in Russia for summit with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia reeling from a political and economic
crisis, U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived early Tuesday with for
a summit with Russia's leader Boris Yeltsin.
	   On a cold, rain-soaked morning, Clinton was met at the airport
by Russia's acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Clinton and Yeltsin were to hold talks Tuesday and Wednesday for
their first full-scale summit since March 1997. Since then, they
have met briefly a few times, most recently in May.
	   Both Yeltsin and Clinton are struggling to regain their
presidential footing. Clinton is battling a politically
debilitating sex investigation, and Yeltsin is trying to shore up
his uneasy hold on power in the midst of his country's economic
upheaval.

Bidding for South Korea's Kia Motors aborted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An international auction has failed to
find a buyer for bankrupt Kia Motor Co. because bidders demanded
more of the carmaker's huge debt be written off, officials said
Tuesday.
	   ``The auction was aborted. We will call a new bidding as soon as
possible,'' said Kia president Lee Jong-dae.
	   Lee did not reveal the schedule for a second bidding, but he
added Kia's creditor banks will discuss whether to write off more
of Kia's debt.
	   In mid-August, Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean carmakers _
Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors, Inc. _
submitted bids for Kia, South Korea's second largest auto maker
before its collapse last year.
	   Kia had planned to announce the successful bidder Tuesday.
Instead, it cancelled the auction, saying all four bidders failed
to meet terms set by Kia's creditor banks.
	   The bidders demanded that creditors write off more of the
combined dlrs 12.8 trillion won (dlrs 9.5 billion) of Kia and its
commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp. Two of the bidders, Ford
and Hyundai, also submitted bids below the minimum price set by the
creditors _ 5,000 won (dlrs 3.7) per share.
	   To make the failed company more attractive to bidders, the
creditor banks had earlier offered to write off nearly half of the
debt.
	   Bidders, however, accused Kia's creditor banks of understating
the company's debt.
	   Kia and Asia have 7.7 trillion won (dlrs 5.7 billion) in assets.
	   Kia's collapse in July, 1997, helped erode investors' confidence
in South Korea's bloated, inefficient industries, leading to a
flight of capital.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to organize a record dlrs 58 billion bailout of its
economy.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure the economy under the IMF bailout terms.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

North Korea to return two sets of remains believed to be U.S.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea will return two sets of
remains believed to be those of U.S. soldiers missing from the
Korean War, the American-led U.N. Command said Tuesday.
	   The remains will be repatriated Wednesday through the border
village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the
two Koreas, it said.
	   The remains were unearthed by a joint U.S.-North Korea team, the
command said. They will be flown to the U.S. Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for forensic tests and
identification.
	   North Korea began repatriating American remains in 1990. In
1996, it began allowing U.S. forensic experts to search for the
remains in its territory, assisted by North Korean officials.
	   About 220 sets of remains so far have been repatriated by North
Korea but less than a dozen have been positively identified.
	   More than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the 1950-53
Korean conflict, and about 8,100 of them are still unaccounted for.
	   The United States led 15 other Western countries to fight on
South Korea's side in the Korean War.

Malaysia puts curbs on currency conversion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia moved on Tuesday to
protect its exchange rate and U.S. dollar reserves by imposing
curbs on the conversion of the Malaysian currency into dollars.
	   Conversion of Malaysian ringgit accounts of non-residents into
foreign currencies can be done only with the permission of the
central bank, said a statement by Bank Negara, the central bank.
	   The new rules come into effect immediately, the statement said.
Details of the rules were expected to be announced later Tuesday.
	   The ringgit strengthened dramatically against the dollar Tuesday
morning on speculation about new capital controls.
	   But demand for ringgit evaporated in the Singapore interbank
market immediately after the Bank Negara announcement.
	   Traders were buying U.S. dollars, and the value of the ringgit
dropped sharply from 3.985 to the dollar to 4.11 by 11 a.m. (0300
GMT).
	   On Monday, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange effectively banned
the trading of Malaysian shares outside the country. Economists
suggest the authorities are acting to stop a bout of off-market
selling if Malaysia implements capital controls.
	   The new measures are aimed at containing the economic damage
that has pushed the once prosperous Southeast Asian nation into
recession. The economy is rapidly shrinking and the ringgit has
lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the dollar since the
Asian currency crisis set in last year.

	   One dealer said the question now was how quickly the Australian
market would recover.
	   ``Do we have a snap back rally to this or do we go up by the
stairs?'' the dealer said. ``The Australian sharemarket represents
excellent value, our fundamentals are fine. It's just a pity of our
geographical locality.''
	   The all resources index had dropped 26.1 points, or 2.85 per
cent, to 890.0 and the all industrials index had fallen 121.9
points, or 2.76 per cent, to 4287.1.
	   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September share price index
contract fell 53 points to 2416.0.
	   National turnover was 137.61 million valued at Australian dlrs
509.90 million (U.S. dlrs 289.5 million), with 685 falls, 232 rises
and 210 stocks steady.
	   With its U.S. exposure, Rupert Murdoch's media giant News Corp.
was again leading the market lower, with its ordinary shares losing
Australian 65 cents (U.S. 37 cents), or 6.08 percent, at Australian
dlrs 10.04 (U.S. dlrs 5.70) and its preferred scrip losing
Australian 69 cents (U.S. 39 cents), or 7.24 per cent, at
Australian dlrs 8.84 (U.S. dlrs 5.02).

	   SANZHOU TOWNSHIP, China (AP) _ Packed into creaky lean-tos of
wood and plastic sheeting on a leaky levee, thousands of refugees
await the slow retreat of a murky lake, their homes and fields
sacrificed in China's summerlong battle against disastrous
flooding.
	   A government decision to calm the raging Yangtze by blowing up
three stretches of dikes sent the swelling river through their
brick and tile homes and rich farmland in a corner of central Hubei
province early last month.
	   Not a soul was lost, officials claim. But the human cost of the
government's disaster-season triage is staggering. More than 96,000
people were made homeless. A lake 8 meters (yards) deep in some
places covers 200 square kilometers (125 square miles) of land.
	   ``Our homes are ruined. Our money, our investment, is gone,''
said one refugee, a woman surnamed Chen living in a lean-to with
her family of six. ``This wasn't done by the floods.''
	   The wreckage of Jianli county is a striking example of a measure
the government has taken repeatedly in China's worst flood season
in 44 years. President Jiang Zemin has ordered that the main
Yangtze levee and major cities be protected above all else.
Farmland goes under so that cities can be saved.
	   On a tour of the devastation given to foreign journalists
Monday, government officials explained if not for the sacrifice of
Jianli, the Yangtze's fifth flood crest could have pounded Wuhan, a
major industrial center of 7 million people downstream.
	   In Wuhan, flooded riverside parks and streets remained sealed
off on Tuesday, and a low-lying neighborhood at the confluence of
the Yangtze and Han rivers was flooded on up to the eaves of
one-story houses.
	   Residents will be moved permanently to subsidized housing five
kilometers (two miles) away so that the city can widen the narrow
neck where the two rivers meet and build flood embankments, said Wu
Shiwei, head of the city's flood control office.
	   Wu predicted the latest flood crest would not be much of a
threat in Wuhan, where 20,000 people had to be evacuated during
this summer's floods.
	   ``The flood season this year is close to an end,'' he said.
	   Upstream in the flooded areas, resignation tinged with anger and
anxiety pervaded the clusters of camps dotting a 144-kilometer
(90-mile) stretch of the levee. In one of the largest, 2,000
refugees survive on government handouts of a pound of rice and 1
yuan (12 cents) a day. Most families have little more than a bed, a
couple of stools, some cooking pots and a few chickens or pigs _
all they could move when they were ordered to evacuate on Aug 7.
	   Within sight is what used to be Sanzhou township _ now
completely submerged, its 39,000 residents displaced. On boat rides
back, the lucky ones find a rooftop cleaving the water's surface.
For others, a few planks or a bedstand snagged in the tops of
cedars and poplars are all that's left.
	   ``It has already happened. There was no other way,'' said farmer
Ouyang Junzhuang. ``We're living day by day.''
	   Ouyang and others believe it will be a month or two before the
waters recede and they can start rebuilding. On Monday, the
Yangtze's eighth flood crest this summer swelled the river upstream
from Jianli but flood control officials planned to blunt its impact
by diverting waters into reservoirs, state media reported.
	   Flooding across China has killed more than 3,000 people and left
millions homeless this summer. While heavier than normal rains
drove the flooding, the government has acknowledged that ruinous
environmental policies borne of China's need to provide for its
huge population have worsened the devastation.
	   In Jianli, projects to create farmland have encouraged settling
on the Yangtze flood plain. Wiped-out Sanzhou township was just
recovering from heavy flooding two years ago.
	   ``The land is fertile. People have reclaimed it and built houses
on it. What can we do?'' said Li Ning, a Hubei province spokesman.
	   Unlike previous tours of flooded-out areas, officials readily
answered questions and gave journalists access to refugees,
although they tried to monitor conversations.
	   In addition to refugees living atop the levees, the government
is also caring for tens of thousands housed in official tent camps,
in government buildings and in other homes. All are being provided
with rice. Medical teams are treating the sick without charge and
school fees are being waived.
	   ``Our biggest worry is what will we do when we have to rebuild
our homes,'' said Dong Huisong, a farmer living in a tent camp on a
soggy field outside Jianli's main town. ``We'll have to rely on the
government for food, but they may not have enough money to help us
with housing.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 90 prisoners on the run after riots, ADDS more

jail voluntarily Tuesday. One name for Kustopo correct in graf 5.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police on Tuesday searched for 90
prisoners who fled in northern Indonesia after mobs tore down the
steel gates of their prison during citywide riots.
	   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the debris-strewn streets of
Lhokseumawe, a day after rioters burned buildings, stoned military
trucks and looted from stores owned by ethnic Chinese. It was the
biggest riot since deadly unrest in May that helped oust former
President Suharto.
	   Shops were shuttered for fear of more violence but there were no
reports of unrest Tuesday.
	   Late Monday night, crowds raided a prison and helped or forced
dozens of prisoners to flee in the darkness, military Col. Dasiri
Musnar told local reporters. Guards fired warning shots, but only
managed to force 30 inmates back to their cells.
	   Another 30 who fled returned to jail voluntarily Tuesday in the
company of their families or village heads, warden Kustopo said by
telephone.
	   The violence in Aceh province was triggered by bitterness toward
the military but ended up targeting Indonesia's Chinese minority, a
traditional scapegoat.
	   Soldiers fired tear gas but rioters still left a wide path of
destruction, burning a hotel, a discotheque, beauty salons, a
ruling party office and part of a shopping center. Many
Chinese-owned stores were pelted with rocks and looters plundered
rice, sugar and other basic necessities.
	   The Chinese are resented because they dominate business in
Indonesia, which is struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   A human rights activist, Burhan, said by telephone that he saw a
mob throwing stones at a Chinese man. It was not known if the man
was hurt, and there were no immediate reports of arrests or
injuries.
	   The unrest in Lhokseumawe erupted after more than 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of atrocities there over the past decade.
	   When the troops pulled out after a ceremony, some spectators
pelted their vehicles with stones, shouting ``Pigs! Dogs!''
	   A resident of Lhokseumawe said teen-agers in school uniforms set
fire to the office of the ruling Golkar party, which has lost
credibility for buttressing Suharto's 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok island fought rioters
who were protesting a new governor.
	   There are fears that despite democratic reforms, the strain that
Indonesia's economic crisis is putting on millions of poor people
could lead to bigger riots.

CHICAGO: of home.

 &UR; Giants 6, Phillies 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In San Francisco, first baseman Rico Brogna's throwing error
allowed San Francisco to score the go-ahead run in a four-run
eighth inning.
	   Jeff Kent, who also hit his 25th homer, added an RBI single in
the eighth as San Francisco earned a split of the four-game series
and stayed within two games of Chicago and New York in the NL
wild-card race.
	   Ellis Burks hit a sacrifice fly and Joe Carter added an RBI
double to make it 6-2.
	   After the Phillies tied it 2-2 in the top of the eighth, Marvin
Benard walked against Wayne Gomes (9-5) to lead off the Giants'
half and went to second on a passed ball. Bill Mueller hit a
grounder to Brogna, who threw wildly trying to get Bernard at
third.
	   Jose Mesa (5-2) got four outs for the win.
 &UR; Mets 8, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Mike Piazza's return to Dodger Stadium was a
personal triumph, and a success for New York as well.
	   Piazza had run-scoring hits with two outs in his first two
at-bats to put the Mets ahead for good and New York won
three-of-four in the series.
	   Rick Reed (16-8) won for the fifth time in six decisions,
allowing nine hits and three runs in six innings-plus.
	   The Mets remained tied with the Chicago Cubs for the lead in the
NL wild-card race.
	   Piazza was a five-time All-Star for the Dodgers before they
traded him to Florida on May 15, and the Mets acquired him a week
later.
	   Playing at Dodger Stadium for the first time since the trades,
Piazza went 3-for-4 with a walk Monday night, and was 8-for-13 with
two walks in the series.
	   Chan Ho Park (11-8) took the loss.
 &UR; Padres 5, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Greg Vaughn hit his 45th homer and Wally Joyner
and George Arias also connected as San Diego rediscovered its
offense.
	   The Padres had lost two straight to the lowly Expos, who are 33
games below .500, and split the four-game series. The Padres had as
many home runs Monday as they did hits in each of their last two
games, 3-1 and 2-1 losses.
	   San Diego (89-49) pulled within one game of Atlanta (90-48) for
the best record in the NL.
	   Vaughn extended his club single-season record and career-high
when he lined a pitch from Carl Pavano (4-7) over the left-field
fence leading off the second to tie it at 1.
	   Joyner, who missed the last four starts with a strained
quadriceps, hit his 11th homer with two out in the fifth, also off
Pavano. Arias, recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas on Aug. 23, had a
pinch-hit homer, his first as a Padre, off Anthony Telford with two
out in the sixth to make it 5-2.
	   Joey Hamilton (12-11) won his second straight start, allowing
two runs and five hits in six innings. Trevor Hoffman pitched a
perfect ninth for his 44th save, tying the club record set by Mark
Davis in 1989.

Sri Lanka's cricket chiefs flay attack on Muralitharan's bowling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's cricket chief on Tuesday
criticized renewed attack on the bowling of one of the finest
off-spinners, Muttiah Muralitharan, who demolished England's
batting in the just concluded test.
	   ``There is no issue as far as we are concerned, but surely the
insinuation is disgusting,'' said Dammika Ranatunga, chief
executive of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka.
	   English coach David Lloyd's comments Sunday in London about the
unorthodox action of Muralitharan may open old wounds. It could
start a new controversy before Sri Lanka goes to Australia in
January for a triangular tournament.
	   Muralitharan suffers from a birth deformity in his right arm
that cannot be set right, Ranatunga said. To overcome the problem
he uses an unusual double jointed wrist action.
	   Muralitharan was first called for throwing by Ross Emerson, one
of two Australian umpires, during a tour of Australia in 1995. He
underwent bio-mechanical tests in Hong Kong and Australia.
	   Three Australian cricket specialists, Daryl Foster, David Lloyd
and Angus Burnett of the University of Western Australia viewed
high speed films that shot 24 delivers from six angles at 200
frames a second.
	   ``It is clear that this apparent straightening of the bowling
arm was a visual illusion,'' the team said in a report. The
International Cricket Council then cleared Muralitharan.
	   The 26-year-old bowler, who belongs to Sri Lanka's Tamil
minority, returned the fifth best bowling figures in test cricket,
taking 16 wickets in 113.5 overs in the one-off test that ended
Monday, which Sri Lanka won by 10 wickets.
	   Coach Lloyd was quoted as saying he would make his views known
to cricket authorities. ``The way he bowls and with the action he
has got, he will always be a handful.''
	   Thilanga Sumathipala, president of the Board of Control for
Cricket in Sri Lanka, said: ``We are disappointed Lloyd expressed
his views through the public instead of going through the proper
channels.''
	   Ranatunga said such allegations have a negative impact on the
players.
	   ``Our records are straight and we have tons of evidence to show
that Murali is a perfect bowler and he will continue to bowl,'' he
said.

Philippines awaits ruling in emotional death penalty debate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Moved earlier to some points &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNTINLUPA, Philippines (AP) _ As he sits in his death row cell,
Leo Echegaray often fights his growing anguish by looking at a
photograph of his son, reading letters of support he has received
from strangers, and talking to his priest.
	   While he awaits a final court decision that could make him the
first criminal to be executed in the Philippines in 22 years, a
heated debate is taking place on whether the death penalty should
be restored.
	   President Joseph Estrada has said he would never pardon
Echegaray because of the serious crime he committed: raping his
10-year-old stepdaughter. The victim herself appeared on TV with
her face concealed to demand his punishment.
	   On the other side of the debate stands the Roman Catholic
Church. In the only nation in Asia with a Catholic majority,
bishops have joined civilian activist groups in a campaign to urge
the government to abolish the death penalty.
	   Echegaray's fate, which could be decided in a final ruling by
the Supreme Court this week, has set off a debate over how the
Philippines should combat heinous crimes such as murder and rape,
especially when they target children.
	   ``The moment we start executing criminals again, people will
realize the government isn't joking about crime,'' said Vicente
Vinarao, a former director of the nation's prisons.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 criminals by
electrocution.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty, but it
gave Congress the option of restoring it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators took that option in 1994, when they brought back
executions, by electric chair and gassing. Two years later, the law
was changed to make lethal injections the only method of execution.
	   Today, Echegaray is one of 663 death row inmates in the
Philippines, including 286 who were convicted of rape.
	   All of them are housed at the prison in Muntinlupa, a suburb of
Manila. Outside the prison sits a one-story, windowless lethal
injection chamber that is painted red. It was built there last
year, but has not been used yet.
	   Many of the inmates in Echegaray prison have been on death row
for years, awaiting the conclusion of a long, slow judicial appeals
process.
	   The Supreme Court has upheld 16 of the death sentences,
including that of Echegaray, a poor house painter who was convicted
of raping his stepdaughter five times in 1994, the first time while
her mother was away from home gambling in a house next door. The
family was so poor that the children sold cigarettes on the street.
	   Echegaray, who has not been allowed to give any interviews with
the media from his cell, maintains his innocence.
	   Last year, the Supreme Court upheld Echegaray's conviction and
approved his execution. But later the court delayed it to consider
his appeal on the constitutionality of lethal injections.
	   Like death penalty opponents in other countries, Echegaray's
advocates argue that because legal systems are not infallible,
innocent people may find themselves facing execution for a crime
they did not commit.
	   They also say poor people don't have access to the same quality
of legal defense as rich people do, and that the death penalty
rarely leads to a drop in crime.
	   But the debate on the nation's talk shows also has attracted
many death penalty proponents. Crimes such as rape, murder and
kidnapping for ransom are often sensationally covered in the
country's media.
	   For years in the Philippines, crimes committed against children
were seldom discussed publicly, but that began to change in the
mid-1980s. Today the victims of rapes such as the one involving
Echegaray often appear in public to demand retribution.

Following the Dow's example, Asian markets fall again

 &UR; Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with slight recoveries in Hong
Kong and Singapore at midday.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Not to be outdone by Wall Street, Asian stocks
wasted little time heading south Tuesday as the region's top three
indexes all fell sharply the moment trading opened.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, one of
the few bright spots in Asian trading Monday, fell 284.06 points,
or 2.0 percent, to 13,823.83 in the first hour. By midday, it stood
at 13,929.03, down 178.87 points, or 1.27 percent.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who tried to
reassure Americans that despite the big fall on Wall Street Monday
the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, who recently urged world leaders to
hold a summit meeting to discuss the global market chaos.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index opened at 7,018.68
points, 3.5 percent lower from Monday, but recovered somewhat by
midday when it was down 119.81 points, or 1.6 percent, at 7,155.23.
Traders noted signs of bargain hunting.
	   And in Singapore, it took only nine minutes for the benchmark
Straits Times Index to tumble 3.5 percent, reaching a 12-year low
of 826.63. By midday, it recovered 12.72 points but was still 2
percent down and appeared headed for another record low.
	   One after another, Asian traders pointed to Monday's chaos in
U.S. and European markets to explain their own problems.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 512.61
points, or 6.4 percent, to 7,539.07.
	   That brought the Dow, which had recently been enjoying an 18
percent gain on the year, down to a 4.7 percent annual loss. It
also could be moving toward its first bear market since 1990.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   Japan _ the world second's largest economy, and now coping with
its own recession _ ``is not only a major contributor to this
global meltdown, but also a victim of it,'' said Umetsu. ``This is
a self-feeding spiral.''
	   To make matters worse, as investors began trading in Japan, Hong
Kong and Singapore on Tuesday, the newspapers they read and the TV
shows they watched contained more bad news.
	   In Japan, the government sharply criticized Communist North
Korea for firing a long-range ballistic missile over Japan's main
island and into the Pacific Ocean on Monday. Like U.S. officials,
the Japanese government sees the test as a dangerous development
for the volatile region's security.
	   In Hong Kong, investors found out that Standard and Poor's in
New York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's
ability to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   S and P cited the severity of Hong Kong's recession and the
government's recent round of intervention in the stock and stock
futures markets, which it called ``an increasingly complex and
risky strategy'' to defend the territory's currency.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves to prop up the stock market in a
two-week battle with speculators. On Monday, when the government
stopped its buying, the stock index plunged 7.1 percent.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government, which
is famous for its criticism of free markets and its feuding with
Singapore, took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors and hurt Singapore's
over-the-counter market, which is one of the biggest arenas for
trading Malaysian stocks outside the country.

Shares plunge after Hong Kong's credit rating slashed

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks plunged early Tuesday on news
that a credit rating agency slashed the territory's credit rating
and after sharp falls on global markets.
	   The government, which already has spent an estimated 15 percent
of its dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves, continued to stay
sidelined after its two-week stock buying spree in a battle against
speculators.
	   That absence contributed to a 7.1-percent plunge in the key
stock index Monday and the continued downward spiral, analysts
said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged through 7,000 points at
one point Tuesday, but rebounded to close the morning trading
session 1.6 percent lower at 7,155.23 points, as investors bought
back shares they sold at higher prices last week, analysts said.
	   On Monday, Standard and Poor's slashed Hong Kong's credit
rating, citing recent government intervention in the stock and
stock futures markets, which it said was ``an increasingly complex,
and risky, strategy'' to fend off speculators.
	   It said the government is likely to suffer huge losses in the
stock market with its massive accumulation of shares, ``unless the
downward trend in global equity prices is reversed.''
	   ``If the government continues to intervene it will just receive
more criticism from overseas,'' said Henry Lui, an analyst at
Mansion House Securities.
	   ``We will ask `will the government intervene?' If they do, we
will have a controlled market, and if that's the case, it would
deter future potential investors,'' said Steven Thompson, chief
banking and conglomerates analyst for Nikko Securities (Asia).
	   S and P also downgraded the credit rating of Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp., the territory's largest bank and a
subsidiary of the market's largest share, HSBC Holdings.
	   HSBC was off 2.1 percent to 161 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 20.64)
at midday.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 6.4 percent, or
512.61 points, to close at 7,539.07, suffering its second-largest
drop in points ever. The average has now erased all of 1998's
gains.
	   In Tokyo on Tuesday, Japanese stock prices dropped sharply in
morning trading following a plunge on Wall Street overnight as
investors sold off shares of big exporters such as Sony Corp. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
178.87 points, or 1.27 percent, to close the morning session at
13,929.02. It had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, the
previous day.

Airport authorities confiscate 200 boxes of Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Customs officials confiscated 200 bottles of
the impotence drug Viagra worth 250,000 pounds (dlrs 73,500),
airport officials said Tuesday.
	   The officials added that a 39-year-old man, whose name and
nationality were not given, arrived Monday from New York. The man,
a physician, had hidden the Viagra in six tea and yogurt boxes,
said the officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   They said the man was planning to sell the drug, which is banned
in this country, through a friend who is a pharmacist.
	   Egypt imposed a ban on Viagra in May, saying it wanted to
conduct its own tests on the drug despite its approved use in the
United States where it is manufactured.
	   Health inspectors and police have been raiding pharmacies to
confiscate the drug. But it continues to be sold on the streets and
in clinics for about 60 pounds (dlrs 17.50) per pill. The drug
costs dlrs 10 per pill in the United States.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The politically wounded presidents of the United
States and Russia proceeded Tuesday with their uncertain summit.
The outlook for meaningful agreements was as cloudy as the Moscow
skies.
	   With Russia's leadership in crisis and its economy spinning
toward collapse, President Bill Clinton persisted in coming here to
try to do some business with President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Burdened with his own political and personal problems back home,
such as the Monica Lewinsky affair, and hoping to get a boost from
summiteering, Clinton pledged continued U.S. support for Russia as
long as its leaders ``stay on the path of reform'' and do not
revert to the communist ways of the past.
	   ``The Russian people are to be commended for embracing democracy
and getting rid of the old communist system, but they're having
some troubles today making the transition from communism to a
free-market economy,'' he said Monday before boarding Air Force One
for his flight here.
	   Once aboard, Clinton huddled with his foreign policy advisers.
	   Assessing the outlook, Sandy Berger, the president's assistant
for national security, said Yeltsin and his designated prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, are signaling they ``are not
prepared to deviate fundamentally from the reform'' that marked
Yeltsin's troubled years in the presidency.
	   And yet, Berger acknowledged, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin were
trying to build a consensus with the Russian parliament, which is
dominated by communists and nationalists.
	   On the eve of the summit, despite doomsday warnings that Russia
faces collapse, angry lawmakers rejected Chernomyrdin, blocking
formation of a government to try to pull the country out of its
tailspin.
	   Russia has been without a government since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin
fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in the midst of an economic
crisis that has crippled the ruble and threatened to bring down the
country's banking and financial systems.
	   Despite the uncertainty, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who arrived from the Balkans ahead of Clinton, met over
dinner Monday with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on a summit
agenda. Serb attacks on ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province was a prime topic, a U.S. official said.
	   Before leaving Bosnia, Albright met with Gen. Wesley Clark, the
NATO commander, on contingency plans to attack the Serbs if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic does not end the offensive.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said they discussed
the roles allied nations would play in an attack. ``Use of force
remains a viable option,'' he said.
	   Russia is reluctant to use force, insisting diplomacy is the
preferred way to try to resolve the crisis.
	   Also on the Clinton-Yeltsin summit agenda are terrorism and the
spread of dangerous weapons.
	   Russia registered disapproval of last month's U.S. missile
attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for
terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Berger told reporters at the White House last week ``we are
talking with the Russians about things we can do to reduce
stockpiles of fissile material,'' the primary ingredients of
nuclear weapons, and ``we are talking with the Russians about
things we can do with respect to sharing information on missile
launches.''
	   This could mean notifying each other with information that a
third country was preparing to launch a missile. North Korea, for
instance, stirred concern Monday when it fired a missile over
Japanese territory into the Pacific Ocean.
	   The United States has had only limited success in persuading
Russia to curb its technology sales to questionable regimes.
	   Russia still has the second-largest nuclear arsenal in the
world. Among the topics on the Moscow summit agenda is Russia's
failure so far to ratify the START II nuclear arms treaty the two
countries signed in January 1993.
	   ``The reason I'm going to Russia,'' Clinton said shortly before
takeoff, ``is because we have learned the hard way that problems
that develop beyond our borders sooner or later find their way to
our doorstep unless we help our friends and our neighbors.''
	   Clinton's remarks seemed to signal his administration's worry
that Russia may backslide on its commitment _ since the demise of
Soviet communism in 1991 _ to democracy and a free market economy.

South Korea: Washington demands regular inspection of North Korean
</HEADLINE>
site
 &UR; With: BC-Japan-NKorea Missile

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The United States is demanding a
regular inspection of a construction site in North Korea to prevent
it from being used for nuclear weapons development, a South Korean
government source said Tuesday.
	   The demand was a counterproposal to a North Korean offer to
allow a one-time outside inspection of the underground site,
suspected by U.S. officials of being nuclear-related. North Korea
claims that the site is a civilian facility.
	   ``Washington believes inspectors need to visit the site
regularly to make sure that the North will not turn it into a
nuclear facility,'' the South Korean official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the United States made the demand during
recent high-level talks with North Korea in New York. It was not
immediately known how North Korea had responded to the U.S. demand.
	   The construction site 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of
Yongbyon, North Korea's main nuclear complex, has become an object
of international concern because of fears that it may be
nuclear-related.
	   The issue was a key topic of discussion at a recent series of
U.S.-North Korea talks in New York.
	   After a week-long recess, the talks resumed Monday. The talks,
which began Aug. 21, were supposed to review the North's 1994
agreement to halt nuclear weapons development in exchange for two
Western-built civilian reactors and fuel oil shipments.
	   Before the 1994 accord, North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility
was believed to have produced enough plutonium for one or two
atomic bombs.
	   North Korea has threatened to walk out of the nuclear agreement,
accusing Washington of not holding up its end of the pact by
providing 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil each year.
	   Less than half the annual supply has been shipped this year, and
North Korea says the shipment is behind schedule.
	   Another key issue at the New York meeting is the North's
test-launch of a long-range ballistic missile that crossed over
Japan's main island and crashed into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.

Strangers to marry in radio competition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Glenn Emerton and Leif Bunyan will have
no trouble with the tradition of spending the night apart before
their wedding Friday. They have never met, never seen a picture of
each other, and the only time they've spoken is when Emerton popped
the question.
	   Emerton, 24, and Bunyan, 22, will say `g'day' and then `I do' in
front of 400 people at Sydney's Hilton Hotel on Friday at the end
of a seven-week promotion for local radio station 2Day FM.
	   ``I think this is very romantic,'' Bunyan told The Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper Tuesday. ``I think it's more romantic than
marrying someone after going out with them for three years.''
	   Emerton, a marketing consultant, said he always wanted to get
married when he turned 24. He passed that milestone four months
ago.
	   At first Emerton's mother, Annette, was aghast. She wrote to the
Herald claiming the stunt was a sign of society's ``appalling state
of degradation.''
	   Now, says, Emerton, his mother has ``come around 100 percent.''
	   ``Now she's spoken to Leif and her parents she's really happy,''
Emerton said.
	   Bunyan said her parents don't have a problem with the marriage.
``They just want the best for me,'' she says.
	   Approaching the matchmaking quest from an attitude that 50
percent of marriages break up anyway, the station began by
searching for the perfect man.
	   ``You just can't meet someone in Sydney, whether you're a guy or
girl,'' 2DAY promotions coordinator Michelle Christison said
Tuesday. ``We started out by looking for Mr. Right and then to find
him a wife.''
	   More than 200 men showed an interest. Eighteen went to lunch
with station personalities and Emerton was drawn from a final
shortlist of five.
	   ``He seemed very sincere, very love lost, and came across as an
absolute darling,'' said Christison. ``The clincher was when he
played his own composition on a piano live to air.''
	   Bunyan was selected from 300 applicants. The list was narrowed
to nine who were then quizzed by a selection panel including four
of Emerton's friends, an astrologer and a psychologist.
	   ``They have as good a chance as anyone of staying together,''
said Christison. ``We care a lot about this, it has taken a long
time and we want it to work.''

Hackers vandalize Australian government website
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Computer hackers in Australia targeted
the ruling party's website for some mischievous re-wording,
changing Australian premier John Howard's title to ``Prime Minister
for Pain, Suffering and Inequity,'' a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The cyberspace pranksters also altered Australian Treasurer
Peter Costello 's portfolio to ``Minister for the Rich, Stomping
the Poor and Wrecking the Economy,'' the Daily Telegraph reported.
	   The ruling Liberal Party had restored the site's original
content by Tuesday morning following the assault by hackers Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was termed ``Minister for
Foreign Humiliation.'' Downer's site was also linked to
Disneyland.com, while Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith
became ``Minister for Destruction of Workplace Fairness, the
Gestapo and Propaganda.''
	   Other minister's names were linked to websites displaying
explicit pornography.
	   Australia's federal election will be held Oct. 3.

Lebanese civilian wounded in shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese woman was wounded Tuesday
when shells fired by pro-Israeli militiamen exploded on the edge of
an Israeli-occupied enclave in southern Lebanon, security officials
said.
	   Fatmeh Hijazi, 45, was lightly wounded by shrapnel when a shell
crashed near her home in Mashghara, about two kilometers (one mile)
outside the occupied zone.
	   She was being treated at a nearby hospital, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediate clear what prompted the early morning
shelling, which officials said came from militiamen of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
	   Several houses were damaged by the shelling on the town of
Mashghara, which is on the southern edge of the Bekaa Valley 28
kilometers (17 miles) north of Israel's border.
	   Israeli shells exploded in Mashghara last Tuesday, injuring six
Lebanese civilians, including a 6-year-old boy.
	   The incident triggered a rocket barrage on northern Israeli
towns and settlements by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, in
which 19 civilians were injured.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone.

Bangladesh seeks international help for flood aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh has sought international
help for providing immediate flood relief and to rehabilitate
hundreds of thousands of homeless people, officials said Tuesday.
	   Rice paddy crops have been wiped out after one-third of
Bangladesh got submerged in the longest-lasting floods to hit this
nation. Torrential rains in the Himalayas since July have swollen
rivers that burst their embankments.
	   A Finance Ministry official said Bangladesh needs dlrs 879
million in aid. Nearly one-half of that would be required for
immediate relief. The rest will be used for rehabilitating people.
	   Foreign donors and relief agencies had committed dlrs 65
million. Officials estimate that 30 million people _ one-fourth of
the population _ are affected by the floods.
	   Finance Minister Shah Mohammed Kibria asked envoys of
neighboring nations and Islamic countries to urge their governments
to give immediate help.
	   He said the expected failure of the winter crops would result in
serious food shortage.

Indonesian prosecutors say Suharto daughter clear in corruption
</HEADLINE>
probe

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The eldest daughter of former
President Suharto has not been implicated in a corruption scandal
involving a toll road company she owns, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Government prosecutors said they are not planning legal action
against Sigit Hardiyanti Rukmana, who built up a big network of
businesses while her father was in power, The Indonesian Observer
reported.
	   Critics say alleged corruption by the Suharto clan contributed
to Indonesia's economic crisis and the business dealings of some
members of his family have come under scrutiny.
	   Prosecutors are also looking into more than a dozen charitable
foundations controlled by Suharto amid allegations they were used
for corrupt purposes. The autocratic president quit in May after
riots and student protests.
	   Rukmana, also known as ``Tutut,'' has amassed a huge fortune
over the years and one of her most prominent businesses is the
network of toll roads that crisscross Jakarta, the capital.
	   Investigators suspect that managers of one toll road, the Pondok
Pinang-Jagorawi route, siphoned off money for their own benefit.
	   But the Observer quoted Anton Sujata, a deputy in the attorney
general's office, as saying he could not confirm reports that Tutut
made money from government bonds sold for the project.
	   He said Tutut should not be blamed if some of her subordinates
were corrupt and denied that prosecutors were giving her lenient
treatment because of her wealth and family ties.
	   ``The result of the investigation does not show enough evidence
to accept the accusation of her involvement,''he said.
	   Rukmana has a 10 percent stake in PT Marga Nurindo Bhakti, the
consortium company of the toll road project, as well as two other
companies involved in the project.
	   Suharto, 77, has three daughters and three sons. He is living
quietly in Jakarta while his successor, B.J. Habibie, dismantles
his authoritarian legacy and implements democratic reforms.

Microsoft releases Windows 98 in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. has launched its Chinese language
version of Windows 98 in China and said three leading Chinese
computer markers agreed to pre-install it in their desktop lines.
	   ``The pre-installation of the Chinese version of Windows 98 is
an indication that our cooperation with local partners has entered
a new stage,'' said Michael Rawding, regional director of Microsoft
Greater China. The version was launched Monday.
	   Encouraging the use of pre-installed software will also cut down
on software piracy, the company said in a press release.
	   The computer makers installing the latest Microsoft operating
system are Legend, Founder and Tontru.
	   Microsoft said it will donate 400,000 yuan (dlrs 48,000) from
initial sales of the software in China to the country's flood
stricken areas.
	   Microsoft released the English language version of Windows 98 on
June 25.

Political message wrapped up in condom giveaway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Democrats have made a
pitch for the youth vote ahead of the Oct. 3 federal election by
producing a kit including condoms and the slogan ``So It's Your
First Time, Get Some Protection _ Vote Democrats.''
	   Democrats deputy leader Natasha Stott Despoja said the kit was
to encourage young people to ``practice safe politics'' and to
explain the country's preferential voting system.
	   ``This kit is directed at many young Australians, 500,000 of
whom are voting for the first time,'' Stott Despoja said. ``It aims
to explain the preferential system, explaining why a vote for a
third party is never a wasted vote, but also explaining to people
why their preferences count.
	   ``In this election campaign, preferences will probably determine
who governs in this nation and who controls the balance of power in
both houses.''
	   Stott Despoja said the Democrats had received a number of calls
from young people, their parents and schools, asking them to
explain preferential voting and to outline some of the policies of
all political parties.
	   ``The aim is to ensure that young people have the education not
just how to vote and how it works but to encourage them to get a
lot of information in, education about the polices of all
parties,'' Stott Despoja said. The Democrats are Australia's
fourth-largest party behind the Liberal and National coalition
members and the Labor Party.

Thai government says bogus Buddhist monks working begging scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Gangs of Thai men are posing as
Buddhist monks to beg for money in neighboring countries, the
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Twenty bogus Buddhist monks from Thailand were arrested in the
past year while staging their scam in Singapore, a ministry
statement said. All were deported back to Thailand.
	   Begging is illegal in Singapore, and Buddhist monks need
permission from the authorities to seek alms.
	   Wearing saffron-colored robes and carrying bowls for donations
of food and money, Buddhist monks roam the streets each morning as
a daily ritual.
	   Those who donate to the monks believe they are making merit that
will help them be reincarnated into a better life.
	   Buddhist monks renounce worldly possessions as part of their
doctrine.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, a spokesman for the ministry, said the bogus
begging racket has tarnished the reputation of the Buddhist clergy
and of Thailand.
	   ``Their begging business has spread across Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore and Hong Kong,'' he said. ``It has been protected by a
gang controlled by Singaporeans and Thais who supplied bogus Thai
monks.''
	   There are about 227 Thai Buddhist temples in foreign lands run
by over 400 ordained abbots.

Singapore's electronic pricing in effect on all restricted roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A new electronic system that charges vehicles
for using certain highways and streets at peak travel times went
into effect Tuesday as part of Singapore's program to prevent
traffic jams.
	   The system, which operates by deducting the charge from a
prepaid cash card installed in every taxi, motorcycle, truck or
car, operates from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the central business
district.
	   On major highways, such as the one leading from town to Changi
International Airport, the charges apply from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30
a.m.
	   Drivers are charged 25 Singapore cents to three Singapore
dollars (14 cents to dlrs 1.70) depending on the type of vehicle
and the time of day it passes one of the electronic cameras
stationed over the roadways.
	   The cameras take pictures of the vehicles' license plates and
bills are sent to those who fail to place a cash card in the device
that all drivers must have installed on their dashboards.
	   The system replaces one that required drivers to buy monthly
passes or pass a booth and buy a certificate each time they wanted
to use a restricted road.
	   The electronic system went into effect last April on the airport
highway and was extended to other restricted roadways on Tuesday.

``insist'' that Viktor Chernomyrdin be named head of a new Russian
government.
	   Yeltsin visited a Moscow school Tuesday morning _ the opening
day of the school year _ and said he believed the new government
could be formed within a week despite parliament's overwhelming
opposition to Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Chernomyrdin is the candidate I have chosen for prime minister
and I will insist upon it,'' Yeltsin said Tuesday morning before
opening a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Yeltsin said he was looking forward to friendly discussions with
Clinton, though Russia's economic and political woes were expected
to dominate the talks and no major bi-lateral agreements were
expected.
	   ``Russian-American relations are developing successfully,''
Yeltsin said at the school. ``Clinton and I know one another well,
and we are friends.''
	   With Yeltsin struggling to solve the country's latest crises,
his opponents in parliament rejected Chernomyrdin's candidacy on
Monday evening by a resounding 253-94.
	   Yeltsin immediately renominated Chernomyrdin, who served as
premier for five tumultuous years before he was dismissed in March
in a previous government shakeup. A second vote is likely on
Friday, the leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, told
the Interfax news agency.
	   Opposition leaders planned to come up with their list of
candidates for the prime minister's post, but Yeltsin was not
expected to listen to their advice.
	   If Yeltsin's candidate is rejected three times, then the
president must dissolve parliament and call new elections within
three months. But the president would also be entitled to appoint
the prime minister _ presumably Chernomydin _ and could effectively
rule by decree until the new parliament is seated.
	   The bitter stand-off over Chernomyrdin's candidacy seemed to
bring Russia's political deadlock to a dangerous new high just as
Clinton began his visit to Moscow. Russians are anxious about the
growing crisis, but there have been no signs of panic on the
streets.
	   Chernomyrdin himself warned Monday that Russia was ``on the
verge of political and economic collapse.''
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since Aug.
23, when Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in the midst
of an economic crisis that has crippled the country's ruble and
stocks and sent an earthquake through world financial markets.
	   Zyuganov, leader of the Duma's vociferous Communist majority,
growled that Yeltsin's renomination of Chernomyrdin was ``a slap in
the face to the whole nation.''
	   Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems, and liberal Yabloko faction leader Grigory
Yavlinsky accused him of creating ``a semi-criminal economic
system.''
	   ``It was during his years that Russia became the world leader in
corruption,'' Yavlinsky said. ``You ask any kid what's the problem
with the government and the answer will be: `They are thieves.'''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they are confident of
winning the elections that would follow _ a view analysts don't
necessarily share.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police shot dead three men robbing
a hotel in a beach resort city, police officials said Tuesday.
	   After learning of the robbers' plans, about 50 policemen were
stationed inside the Town In Town Hotel in the city of Pattaya, 110
kilometers (68 miles) south of Bangkok, posing as hotel workers and
guests, said Phichit Tantiprasut, the hotel general manager.
	   Police said they had the three bandits under surveillance for
about two weeks.
	   On Monday, the bandits, who had checked into the hotel the
previous night, attempted to rob the payroll from the hotel's
accountant and general manager.
	   They were undercover policemen. A gun battle erupted and the
three robbers were shot dead, Phichit said.
	   One policeman was wounded in the leg and was hospitalized.
	   Police did not release the names of the dead robbers.

Thai central bank will offer bonds this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Tuesday it
will offer 10 billion baht (dlrs 238 million) worth of one-year
government bonds on Friday.
	   The Bank of Thailand had also announced that it would offer 10
billion baht worth of the bonds on Aug. 28, but ended up selling
29.909 billion baht (dlrs 711 million) worth.
	   The bonds were 1.08 times oversubscribed, meaning there was
slightly more demand than supply.
	   The auction on Sept. 4 will be the eleventh in a weekly series
of issues to replenish the Bank of Thailand's rescue fund for
financial institutions.
	   The central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund has
been allocated an initial 150 billion baht (dlrs 3.57 billion) of a
planned total of 500 billion baht (dlrs 11.9 billion) in bonds the
Finance Ministry has been authorized to issue over the next two
years.

Economic official says outlook for Japan has grown darker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With Japan already stuck in a deep downturn, a top
government official said Tuesday that economic conditions are
growing worse.
	   The Japanese economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya.
	   ``To be frank, the state of Japan's economy is even more severe
than before,'' Sakaiya said at a press conference.
	   Sakaiya blamed the moribund state of the Japanese economy on
weak consumer and corporate confidence and also on events outside
Japan, such as floods in China and economic turmoil in Russia.
	   Japan said it had slipped into its deepest recession since the
end of World War II earlier this year when it announced gross
domestic product for the fiscal year that ended in March shrank by
0.7 percent.
	   Sakaiya, an author of books about Japan's economy and the only
non-politician in Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's cabinet, is known
for his outspoken views. While many Japanese leaders have
downplayed the extent of the country's economic problems, Sakaiya
has said economic growth is likely to fall short of official
forecasts.
	   Last month, he said falling prices and wages in Japan could
trigger a deflationary spiral that would push Japan deeper into
recession.
	   Sakaiya said Tuesday it was too early to say whether an
overnight plunge on Wall Street would trigger declines worldwide.
	   ``I don't think we are in a stage of chain reaction,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo issued a strong protest against North Korea
for firing a missile over Japan and sent military ships Tuesday to
the spot in the Pacific Ocean where debris from it was believed to
have landed.
	   The missile launch Monday renewed worries over security in Asia
and raised serious questions about the adequacy of Japan's defense
systems.
	   Government spokesman Sadaaki Numata said Tuesday that Japan did
not know about the missile launch until it was informed by the U.S.
military. He added that Japan had no independent monitoring system
to warn of the launching.
	   Numata also said Japan has frozen the dlrs one billion it had
committed to a project with South Korea, the U.S. and Europe to
supply North Korea with two nuclear energy reactors. And sending
food aid to the reclusive communist state was now more difficult,
he acknowledged.
	   ``Our relations with North Korea are going to be more severe
than they have ever been,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said
after attending a special Cabinet meeting, where the missile topped
the agenda.
	   Komura said the missile may help speed up Japan's proposed joint
development of a missile defense system with the United States.
	   ``Japan's people are extremely anxious and I am deeply
worried,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Kyodo News
agency as saying.
	   Defense officials said the missile appeared to be the new Taepo
Dong 1, which has a longer range than the old model and is capable
of reaching all of South Korea and Japan.
	   With no official diplomatic channels with the reclusive
communist state, even issuing a protest was a problem.
	   When a protest was levied in New York overnight to Kim Chang
Guk, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, he
merely repeated North Korea's usual criticism against Japan's
security arrangement with the United States, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   North Korea remained mute on the missile in its official news
being monitored by the Radiopress agency in Tokyo.
	   The Defense Agency said it will analyze any parts of the missile
retrieved by the dispatched military ships. A non-military
government plane and ship were sent to the Sea of Japan where the
first stage of the missile was believed to have landed, government
officials said.
	   Defense tends to be a sensitive topic for many Japanese because
of the backlash from the bitter memories of extreme militarism
during World War II. The pacifist movement is a powerful lobby
group in Japan, and the slightest sign of heightened military might
draws nervous protest from Asian neighbors.
	   That is partly why the missile defense system project has been
so slow in coming.
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the liberal Asahi newspaper warned
against any hasty action on the missile defense project, and
instead called for ``calm.'' The more conservative Yomiuri
newspaper, however, called for a prompt decision in favor of the
project.
	   The North Korean missile drew heightened concern from abroad as
well.
	   ``For North Korea, development of its military power is a
strategic issue that directly affects its survival. So it will
never give it up,'' said South Korean Defense Minister Chun
Yong-taek.
	   ``Military power is North Korea's only bargaining card to play
with the outside world,'' he told reporters before departing for
Tokyo for a meeting later in the day with the director of Japan's
Defense Agency.
	   Chun's three-day visit had been set ahead of the missile firing.
	   Park Jie-won, South Korea's chief presidential spokesman, said,
``We strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop missile
development and join in international efforts to curb the spread of
the weapons.''
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Lee McClenny
called the launch ``a matter of deep concern to the United
States.'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was
visiting Sarajevo, said she would raise the issue in talks with
North Korea.

Japan's Sakura Bank to speed up restructuring plan, cuts jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Sakura Bank Ltd. will eliminate jobs and
close branches as part of a cost-cutting plan, the Nihon Keizai
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The steps would represent an acceleration of cost-cutting
measures begun in March and would coincide with a plan announced
Monday to increase the bank's capital by some 300 billion yen (dlrs
2.2 billion) as early as this month.
	   The new restructuring plan is expected to cut costs by 30
billion yen (dlrs 215 million) over three years, the paper said.
	   A Sakura spokesman said the bank had not officially decided on
such measures and would not confirm the report.
	   Sakura had already said it would cut some 2,000 jobs over three
years but will now increase the pace to 3,000 over the same period,
the report said.
	   Some 50 domestic branches will be merged with other ones and
closed by March 2000. In addition, about 23 overseas branches,
mostly in Europe and the United States, will be shut down, the
paper reported. Sakura had 86 foreign branches as of the end of
1997.
	   The bank will also speed up the process of reducing the number
of directors it employs from the current 45.

Bombing deaths strengthen peace resolve says Irish president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The deaths of 28 people in a car bomb
explosion at Omagh in Northern Ireland had only strengthened the
country's resolve to find a lasting solution for peace, Irish
president Mary McAleese said Tuesday.
	   The Irish people would no longer tolerate violence and bloodshed
as a way of life, McAleese told the Irish-Australian Business
Association on the second day of her 11-day Australian visit.
	   Widespread revulsion, including from the IRA, was felt across
the whole country after the bombing on Aug. 15, she said.
	   Many of the victims were women and children and the bombing came
just months after the breakthrough Good Friday Agreement, which was
signed in April and endorsed by the Irish people on May 22. The
breakaway Real IRA claimed responsibility for the car bomb.
	   McAleese said it was inevitable the agreement would be broken,
but this would only reinforce the general determination to make it
work in the long term.
	   ``We knew it would be tested,'' McAleese said. ``And it will be
tested again. The positive to come out of it was the strength of
unity from all Irish people after the bombing.''
	   McAleese said the Good Friday Agreement had led to a real sense
of optimism in Ireland. ``It is clear that most of the people of
Ireland, both North and South, see the agreement as overwhelmingly
their best hope for a better future,'' she said. ``That agreement
envisages a future based on the acceptance of diversity and on the
principles of mutual respect, equality and partnership.
	   ``The agreement offers a historic opportunity for a new
beginning in relationships within Northern Ireland and between
Britain and Ireland _ it is fair, balanced and comprehensive.''
	   McAleese said the Irish were determined to drive out the
``culture of conflict'' and replace it with a ``culture of
consensus.''
	   McAleese is on her first official overseas visit since being
elected last November.

Strangers to marry in Australian radio competition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Glenn Emerton and Leif Bunyan will have
no trouble with the tradition of spending the night apart before
their wedding Friday. They have never met, never seen a picture of
each other, and the only time they've spoken is when Emerton popped
the question.
	   Emerton, 24, and Bunyan, 22, will say `g'day' and then `I do' in
front of 400 people at Sydney's Hilton Hotel on Friday at the end
of a seven-week promotion for local radio station 2Day FM.
	   ``I think this is very romantic,'' Bunyan told The Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper Tuesday. ``I think it's more romantic than
marrying someone after going out with them for three years.''
	   Emerton, a marketing consultant, said he always wanted to get
married when he turned 24. He passed that milestone four months
ago.
	   At first Emerton's mother, Annette, was aghast. She wrote to the
Herald claiming the stunt was a sign of society's ``appalling state
of degradation.''
	   Now, says, Emerton, his mother has ``come around 100 percent.''
	   ``Now she's spoken to Leif and her parents she's really happy,''
Emerton said.
	   Bunyan said her parents don't have a problem with the marriage.
``They just want the best for me,'' she says.
	   Approaching the matchmaking quest from an attitude that 50
percent of marriages break up anyway, the station began by
searching for the perfect man.
	   ``You just can't meet someone in Sydney, whether you're a guy or
girl,'' 2DAY promotions coordinator Michelle Christison said
Tuesday. ``We started out by looking for Mr. Right and then to find
him a wife.''
	   More than 200 men showed an interest. Eighteen went to lunch
with station personalities and Emerton was drawn from a final
shortlist of five.
	   ``He seemed very sincere, very love lost, and came across as an
absolute darling,'' said Christison. ``The clincher was when he
played his own composition on a piano live to air.''
	   Bunyan was selected from 300 applicants. The list was narrowed
to nine who were then quizzed by a selection panel including four
of Emerton's friends, an astrologer and a psychologist.
	   ``They have as good a chance as anyone of staying together,''
said Christison. ``We care a lot about this, it has taken a long
time and we want it to work.''

 &UR; South Korea reconfirms support for civilian exchange with North
Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Despite security concerns over North
Korea's missile firing, South Korea will continue to expand
nongovernmental exchanges with its communist neighbor, government
officials said Tuesday.
	   ``South Korea will cope with the problem in close cooperation
with other concerned nations,'' the Unification Ministry said in a
statement.
	   Although the North's firing of a missile over Japan on Monday
undermined security in Northeast Asia, South Korea has no plan to
change its policy of separating politics from economic cooperation
in dealing with the North, it said.
	   Ministry officials reaffirmed government support for plans by
two South Korean companies to start sightseeing tours of Diamond
Mountain, a scenic tourist site in North Korea, beginning later
this month.
	   The giant Hyundai group plans to send 1,400 tourists a week on
luxury liners for a five-day visit to the mountain resort, while
Tongil, owned by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church,
wants to send 200 tourists daily on a daylong tour on high-speed
ferries.
	   Both tours are scheduled to start on Sept. 25.
	   North Korea and South Korea fought a bloody three-year war in
the early 1950s that ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Their border is sealed with nearly 2 million troops deployed on
both sides.

	   Dozens of heads of state were expected to arrive in this Indian
Ocean city for their talks Wednesday and Thursday at the 12th
summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   Formed during the Cold War to fend off domination by the White
House and the Kremlin, the movement is now struggling to define a
new role.
	   Fallout from recent U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist targets
in Sudan and Afghanistan and a growing conflict in Africa's Great
Lakes region have dominated discussions so far.
	   A lower level committee supported Sudan's call for an
investigation of Washington's missile attacks on a factory in
Khartoum to determine if the facility was a chemical weapons plant,
as Washington claims.
	   Sudan says it was a pharmaceutical factory.
	   Sudanese foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail called the
committee's decision a step forward for justice. But unless the
resolution receives unanimous backing from foreign ministers
meeting Monday and Tuesday, it will not be passed on for
consideration by the heads of state.
	   No progress on the matter was apparent on Monday.
	   Sudan's foreign minister said Monday that if Washington
acknowledged its error in bombing a factory in Khartoum, Sudan was
prepared ``to turn the page.''
	   ``We are open to turn the page against the U.S.A. if they
acknowledge they got wrong information'' about the nature of the
plant, he said at a news
	   conference.
	   The global stock market plunge that has swept across developing
countries
	   was also at the top of the summit's agenda.
	   Under discussion is a 62-page economics report commissioned at
the last Nonaligned Movement summit three years ago in Colombia.
	   The report criticized the world's major financial institutions,
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for
ignoring the needs of the developing world.
	   It recommends speedy debt relief programs and a slower
integration of poorer economies into global markets to avoid their
exploitation by developed
	   countries.
	   About 100 nations sent delegates to the summit.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, welcoming foreign
ministers, said the Nonaligned Movement should advance the cause of
the poor.
	   ``The world economy should be managed in a way that ensures the
transfer of resources from those who have them to those that do
not,'' he said.
	   Other summit topics include the war in Congo, whose government
alleges that rebels supported by Rwanda and Uganda are trying to
unseat President Laurent Kabila's year-old government.
	   Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya expressed doubt that
much could be accomplished about Congo at the summit, which is
considering a wide range of issues.
	   ``Maybe this is not the right forum, but maybe we can work out
preliminary arrangements here (for further talks),'' he told a
radio interviewer.
	   Kabila has received military support from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia, despite efforts led by South Africa to negotiate a
settlement.
	   The crisis threatens to break apart the political cohesioaid she
wanted further talks on a moratorium on building nuclear weapons,
and a ban on first-strike use of the weapons.

Indonesian minister says rice price is higher because of hoarding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A Cabinet minister accused traders of
hoarding rice to drive up the price of the staple food in
economically struggling Indonesia, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The price of low-quality rice has soared in recent months,
rising as high as 4,000 rupiah (36 U.S. cents) per kilogram (2.2
pounds) in Jakarta and other major cities. The cost is too
expensive for millions of people who are sinking into poverty.
	   The government's target of 1,750 rupiah (16 U.S. cents) to 2,000
rupiah (18 U.S. cents) per kilogram should have been attainable
because domestic supply was more than enough, said Adi Sasono,
minister of cooperatives, and small and medium enterprises.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Adi as saying that the government has
increased rice imports for the year to 4.1 million metric tons.
About 3.5 million tons have so far arrived at various ports in the
country.
	   ``If we have abundant supply while the market is short of
stocks, what do you think has happened?'' he said, implying that
traders were hoarding stocks for their own benefit.
	   Foreign donors are providing Indonesia with rice and staple
foods are being subsidized under a multi-billion dollar rescue
package managed by the International Monetary Fund.
	   A Jakarta city councilor, meanwhile, said authorities should
control rice distribution more tightly. The Post quoted councilor
Djafar Badjeber as saying speculators were obtaining the staple
food from a government agency and selling it at higher prices to
make huge profits.

India's military suggests who should control the nuclear button
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Now that India has gone nuclear, who
should control its atomic button?
	   Military leaders have suggested that the government set up a
panel of top Cabinet ministers and defense officials to control the
country's nuclear arsenal, The Indian Express reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper said army, navy and air force officials have
approved the proposal in a study titled, ``Options for India _
Formation of a Strategic Nuclear Command.''
	   The National Command Authority, which would be headed by the
prime minister, will advise a panel of the three service chiefs on
the use of nuclear weapons if necessity arises, the paper said.
	   The orders would then be executed by a command post.
	   India set off five underground nuclear explosions in May, 24
years after it first tested its first nuclear device. Pakistan
retaliated in May with six tests, triggering fears of an arms race
in the subcontinent. The tests drew international economic and
political sanction against India and Pakistan.
	   India said it needed to develop nuclear weapons to protect the
country from Pakistan and China, with whom it has fought a total of
four wars.
	   Efforts by successive prime ministers of India and Pakistan to
reduce tensions over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir have borne
no results so far. Both nations fought two wars over the region,
which is divided between them. Both claim all of Kashmir.
	   The nuclear tests aggravated tension and after a war of words,
soldiers exchanged gun and mortar fire across Kashmir for weeks.
Hundreds of people were killed or wounded in the firing.

On first day of school year, teachers strike in salary dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A teachers' strike at the start of the new
school year kept 1.5 million students at home Tuesday and disrupted
life throughout Israel, with working parents scrambling to find
last-minute care for their children.
	   Negotiations between the teachers and the Finance Ministry over
a salary increase broke off at 4 a.m. Tuesday. Teachers demanded at
least 2 percent more money to keep up with inflation and comply
with previous income agreements they say have not been honored.
	   However, Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman said he was not inclined
to pay the teachers more. He said every 1 percent salary increase
would cost the treasury 700 million shekels (dlrs 184 million.)
``That's too much for the government to handle,'' he told Israel
radio.
	   Education officials, meanwhile, complained that due to budget
cuts most students would start the school year in crowded
classrooms lacking air conditioners, heaters and proper furniture.

Malaysia restricts currency conversion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with further detail, comment from prime
minister
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Tuesday enforced
sweeping currency controls to fend off speculators and shelter its
embattled economy from the Asian financial meltdown.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the government would
set a fixed exchange rate for its currency, the ringgit, and allow
it to be traded only within the country.
	   Mahathir said there would be no value attached to the ringgit
outside Malaysia after Oct. 1. All Malaysian currency in banks
overseas will have to be brought back to the country by then.
	   ``It's a last resort measure,'' Mahathir said during a live
interview on state television.
	   The ringgit has lost its value by nearly 40 percent against the
U.S. dollar since the Asian contagion broke out in July 1997.
	   Foreigners who wish to convert ringgit into other currencies
will also need approval from the central bank, said Zeti Akhtar
Aziz, acting governor of Bank Negara.
	   ``The changes are directed at containing speculation on the
ringgit, and in minimizing the impact of short-term capital flows
on the economy,'' Zeti said. ``And they'll also give stability to
the ringgit.''
	   The capital controls will limit the transfer of ringgit to
overseas accounts with immediate effect, while foreign banks will
be curbed from obtaining ringgit-denominated loans within the
country.
	   Since Bank Negara's high-interest rate policy failed to prevent
Malaysia from being pushed into full-blown recession, Mahathir has
begun pushing for lower interest rates and increased spending as a
way of spurring investment.
	   However, monetary authorities fear that such measures would
destabilize the already wobbly currency.
	   For example, to prevent Malaysians from seeking higher interest
rates offered by banks in Singapore, Malaysians will no longer be
allowed to travel with suitcases of ringgit to deposit offshore.
	   Travelers will not be allowed to take more than 100,000 ringgit
(dlrs 23,800) out of Malaysia within one month.
	   There is no limit to how much foreign currency can be brought
into the country.

Tiger Cup thrown into disarray by bizarre match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Embarrassing. Shameful. Bad farce. An
insult to soccer and all of Vietnam.
	   All that and more was being used Tuesday to describe the Tiger
Cup match between Indonesia and Thailand that both teams actively
tried not to win.
	   Indonesia finally succeeded by putting the ball in its own net
with time running out, handing Thailand a 3-2 victory Monday night.
	   ``Thailand and Indonesia shame soccer _ Fans in fury as two
teams serve up a farce,'' said the headline in Tuesday's Bangkok
Post.
	   The situation developed because the winner of Group A will have
to fly to Hanoi and face Vietnam in the semis on Wednesday,
National Day. That is a major home-field advantage if there ever
was one, given how enthusiastic the Hanoi fans have been in the
competition.
	   Indonesia had won a semifinal spot. The only way Thailand could
miss out was to lose badly.
	   Indonesia coach Rudy Bahalwan said he was ``ashamed.'' Thailand
coach Withaya Laohakul blasted Indonesian soccer.
	   ``I feel embarrassed, but it was the Indonesians who decided the
game, not our team,'' he said. ``Now I understand why Indonesian
football cannot develop, because they had similar matches like this
at home.''
	   Still, his team had to bear its share of blame for the bizarre
match, since it only attacked when there was no chance of going
ahead.
	   An Indonesian fan named Daeng was quoted by Indonesia's daily
Kompas as saying he was planning an unpleasant reception when his
team returns home.
	   ``I will try to gather soccer fans to greet them at the airport
with rotten eggs,'' he said.
	   The eight-nation event was reeling Tuesday as it tried to figure
out how to deal with the situation.
	   Singapore and Vietnam, which had clinched semifinal spots, said
they didn't want to play either team. Vietnam Sports Minister Ha
Quang Du asked the match inspector to annul the result.
	   ``Unfortunately it is a situation that has no precedents,'' said
Paul Mony, general secretary of the ASEAN Football Federation, who
said the decision was up to the Vietnam Football Federation.
	   The VFF reportedly proposed that the match be scrapped and both
teams be banned from the semis, but it appeared there were no
provisions to do so under FIFA rules.
	   In Monday's match, several stars sat out for each team. Neither
side made a serious move on goal in a first half where there was
not a single whistle.
	   Someone must have talked with both teams at the break, because
Indonesia came out with more spirit. It also knew that a tie was
the same as a victory because it already was atop the standings.
	   Indonesia's Mirobaldo Bento found no resistance when he scored
in the 52nd minute. Thailand finally came to life, but as soon as
Dritsada Piandet equalized, the Thais died again.
	   Aji Santoso put Indonesia back ahead 2-1 in the 85th minute, and
Thailand's Therdsak Chaiman tied it at 2-2 four minutes later.
	   With time running out, Indonesia moved deep into its own
territory. Two quick passes, and Yusuf Ekodono scored as goalkeeper
Hendro Kartiko, who earlier made several offensive forays to leave
the goal open, stepped out of the way.

U.N. Rwanda tribunal to issue first ruling on genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ In the world's first judgment on
genocide, a U.N. tribunal pledged to deliver on Wednesday its first
verdict in the 1994 slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis
in Rwanda.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, ex-mayor of the central village of Taba, has
maintained his innocence on 15 counts of genocide, crimes against
humanity, torture and rape throughout his thrice-postponed trial
that finally began Jan. 9, 1997.
	   Defense lawyer Nicholas Taingaye, at closing arguments in March,
said the former teacher, born in 1953, should be acquitted of
charges he ordered the killings of 2,000 people because ``a
wrongful conviction would lend credence to the tribunal's
detractors.''
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper countered that Akayesu knew of crimes
against Tutsis, ``and at times, was present during their
commission, but failed to prevent them, and actually aided and
abetted their commission.''
	   On Friday, the court _ formally known as the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda _ was scheduled to sentence the prime
minister who led Rwanda's government during the 1994 genocide. Jean
Kambanda pleaded guilty May 1 and promised to testify against other
alleged ringleaders of the slaughter.
	   The United Nations said Kambanda was the first person in history
to plead guilty to genocide charges before an international
tribunal, and the judgment on Akayesu will be the first for the
crime of genocide by an international court.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.
	   ``The success of this court in prosecuting genocide is a
historic milestone and a defining example of the ability of the
United Nations to create institutions which fulfill the highest
aspirations of mankind,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in
New York.
	   Rwandan Hutu extremists plotted the genocide carried out for 90
days beginning April 7, 1994, mostly by peasants who used machetes
or clubs studded with nails to brutally kill their neighbors.
Tutsi-led rebels ousted the Hutu government in July 1994 and ended
the killings.
	   It also will be the first time an international court rules on
sexual violence _ the indictment against Akayesu was amended
mid-trial to include charges of rape.
	   ``If Akayesu is convicted on the rape charges which have been
brought against him, his case will represent the first successful
prosecution of sexual violence by an international tribunal,'' said
Faiza Jama Mohamed, Africa's director of Equality Now, a New
York-based group organization focusing on violations of women's
rights.
	   The tribunal, set up in November 1994, frequently has been
criticized as slow and incompetent. Judge Lennart Aspegren of
Sweden said he will resign at the end of the year, six months
early, to protest bad management and inadequate working conditions.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandans have come to expect little from the tribunal, based in
the remote northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   ``Everyone wants to see justice prevail, but no one is confident
it will,'' said Mary Balikungeri, director of the Hope Clinic,
which counsels Tutsi women who survived the genocide. ``It is like
a dream to them. It has been far too long.''
	   In addition, to them, the maximum life sentence the tribunal can
impose is inadequate.
	   ``In the minds of ordinary Rwandans, if you killed you have to
be killed,'' Balikungeri said. ``Everyone knows the tribunal's
mandate _ if you killed, you are not killed.''
	   In contrast to the tribunal's plodding pace, Rwandan courts _ in
trials criticized by foreign lawyers as often unjust _ have tried
at least 330 people in the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to
death. More than 125,000 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, the Rwandan government executed 22 genocide
convicts by firing squad, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   ``We've seen executions taking place, but the people who have
suffered want to see more,'' Balikungeri said.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's share market recovered
after an early slide on the back of Wall Street's plunge to finish
less than one percent lower Tuesday.
	   The all ordinaries index finished down 22.5 points at 2458.2,
more than 71 points above its early low of 2386.7 on a futures-led
recovery.
	   The September share price index contract was down four points
for the day at 2465.0, trading at a premium to the physical market
on expectations of a bounce of up to 200 points on Wall Street
Tuesday.
	   The market also adjudged the U.S. sell-off came as a result of
that market being overvalued _ while the local market was not.
	   ``They traded around 20 points up for most of the afternoon
because they are expecting a big bounce on Wall Street tonight,''
said Nevitts broker Steve Negrine.
	   ``Our stocks have had crashes already and it's hard to believe
the market here has been so sensible.''
	   The all industrials index was down 40.2 points at 4368.8, with
banking stocks leading the afternoon recovery.
	   Rupert Murdoch's media giant News Corp. bore the brunt of the
U.S. drop, with the ordinary and preferred shares both closing
Australian cents 42 (U.S. cents 24) down at Australian dlrs 10.27
(U.S. dlrs 5.83) and Australian dlrs 9.11 (U.S. dlrs 5.17)
respectively.
	   Preliminary turnover figures showed 302.97 million shares traded
at a value of Australian dlrs 1.136 billion (U.S. dlrs 645
million), with falls outnumbering rises by 730 to 414.

freed Tuesday and flown in Bangkok, where he expressed a longing to
return to his own country and keep struggling for democracy.
	   At least two Vietnamese-Americans who had been jailed for
alleged plots to overthrow the Hanoi government were also freed,
Vietnamese officials said.
	   Doan Viet Hoat, serving a 15-year sentence for publishing
pro-democracy newsletters, was freed from Hanoi Prison and put on a
flight to Bangkok. U.S. officials said they have accepted him for
resettlement.
	   ``I regret that they don't let me stay in Vietnam,'' Hoat told
reporters on arrival. ``I don't want to leave my country. I love my
country. I want to contribute to freedom and democracy.''
	   U.S. and Thai officials whisked away Hoat, who appeared to be in
good health, and said he would be staying in the Thai capital
overnight. They said he would make a statement later.
	   Although he is little known inside Vietnam, where the government
controls the media, his case was taken up by the European
Parliament and the World Association of Newspapers, which earlier
this year gave him its Golden Pen of Freedom for his commitment to
a free press.
	   Another top dissident, Nguyen Dan Que, also was being released
and was expected to leave the country Tuesday for resettlement in
the United States.
	   They were freed as part of an amnesty for 5,219 inmates to mark
National Day on Wednesday. Vietnamese officials told a news
conference last Friday that several expatriates, including
Americans, were on the list.
	   A government source said Tuesday that Vietnamese-Americans Jimmy
Tran and Ly Tong had been released. Tong was on the passenger list
for a flight to Hong Kong but did not board the plane, a Vietnam
Airlines official said.
	   In September 1992, Tong _ a former South Vietnamese air force
pilot _ hijacked a Vietnam Airlines jet from Thailand and dropped
50,000 anti-government leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon.
	   He then parachuted to the ground, apparently intending to lead
the revolution he hoped would follow, but was instead arrested.
	   Tran, a Vietnamese-American who also was opposed to the Hanoi
government, was sentenced to 20 years in jail in 1993 for plotting
to explode bombs in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, the old
South Vietnamese capital.
	   Vietnam denies it holds anyone for political or religious
beliefs, only those who have broken the law.
	   Human-rights groups counter that a number of people are jailed
for violating the all-encompassing national security law or the
strict regulation of religious activities.

Japanese stocks rebound, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices, late-afternoon dollar and
bond prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed sharply higher Tuesday after
a dramatic rebound in late trading on speculation that government
related funds were moving in to support the market.
	   The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   After falling to a new 12-year low in morning trading, the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rallied in the closing
minutes of the trading session to post a gain of 261.74 points, or
1.86 percent, at 14,369.63. It had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent, the previous day.
	   The gain came despite a massive decline on Wall Street Monday
that many traders and investors feared would spill over into Tokyo
markets.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second-biggest point
loss ever Monday, falling 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, to close
at 7,539.07.
	   In Tokyo, traders said that pension funds linked to the
government were buying stock futures, helping to push the market
higher.
	   ``Investors were frightened following the plunge on Wall Street,
but buying by pension funds and hedge funds put a brake on the
sell-off,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock
division at Chuo Securities.
	   A partial recovery in overnight trading in U.S. stock futures in
Asia helped the market by boosting hopes that Wall Street would
rebound from Monday's dramatic loss.
	   Many investors said the gain was unlikely to last as bad loan
problems at Japanese banks and the government's inability to decide
on a way to fix them would continue to weigh on the market.
	   At one point, the Nikkei fell as low as 13,664.74 in early
trading, a new 12-year low, before recovering in the afternoon. On
Friday the average dropped below 14,000 for the first time since
March 1986.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 3.66 points, or 0.33
percent, to 1,110.15. On Monday, it had gained 19.50 points, or
1.79 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar weakened amid
concern over plummeting stock prices on Wall Street and continuing
political turmoil in Russia, traders said.
	   The dollar bought 139.29 yen in afternoon trading, down 2.23 yen
from late trading in Tokyo on Monday and also below its level of
140.78 yen in late New York trading.
	   The dollar was quoted as low as 138.50 yen during Tokyo trading
Tuesday.
	   ``It's now the dollar's problem that's driving trading, instead
of some other currencies','' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of
the international treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.060 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040
percent, driving its price down to 112.71 yen from 112.86 yen.

13 executed in China's Xinjiang region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Thirteen people were executed for robbery and
murder in Urumqi, capital of China's far western Xinjiang
autonomous region, a government-controlled newspaper reported.
	   The Urumqi Intermediate People's Court sentenced them at a mass
rally on Wednesday, and they were immediately taken away and
executed, according to a Thursday copy of the Xinjiang Daily seen
in Beijing on Tuesday.
	   In all but one case, those executed were convicted of crimes
that took place in the second half of last year, the report said.
	   Among those executed were Wu Zhijun, Fang Baosheng and Lin
Chenhu, who were convicted of breaking into a family's home on Dec.
29 and killing two sisters and an 8-month-old baby and stealing
gold and jade materials, other jewelry and cash.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs defied anti-riot police and
attacked Chinese-owned shops for a second day Tuesday in a northern
town where mobs tore down the gates of a prison, freeing dozens of
prisoners.
	   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled debris-strewn Lhokseumawe, a day
after crowds burned buildings, stoned military trucks and looted
stores. It was the biggest riot since deadly unrest in May helped
oust former President Suharto.
	   Most of the town of 600,000 was quiet Tuesday. But in the
business district, young men gathered to hurl rocks at shops
despite police warning shots and volleys of tear gas.
	   Some Chinese shopkeepers cowered inside their shuttered stores
as rioters pounded the doors, walls and windows with a hail of
stones.
	   ``I'm scared. But there are police and soldiers in front of the
shop,'' David Liong said by telephone from his gold jewelry
business. His terrified family fled the town earlier Tuesday.
	   The violence in Aceh province was triggered by bitterness toward
the military but ended up targeting Indonesia's Chinese minority, a
traditional scapegoat.
	   The Chinese are resented because they dominate business in
Indonesia, which is struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Ninety prisoners were on the run Tuesday after crowds raided a
prison the previous night, helping or forcing inmates to flee in
the darkness even though guards fired warning shots.
	   Thirty inmates who fled returned to jail voluntarily in the
company of their families or village heads, warden Kustopo said by
telephone.
	   Trader Hajah Fatimah said police at times dispersed the crowds
in Tuesday's unrest, but the mobs soon drifted back.
	   ``It seems the young people aren't afraid of the police,'' she
said by telephone.
	   On Monday, rioters burned a hotel, a discotheque, beauty salons,
a ruling party office and part of a shopping center. Many
Chinese-owned stores were pelted with rocks and looters plundered
rice, sugar and other basic necessities.
	   A human rights activist, Burhan, said he saw a mob throwing
stones at a Chinese man. It was not known if the man was hurt, and
there were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
	   The unrest in Lhokseumawe erupted after more than 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of atrocities there over the past decade.
	   When the troops pulled out after a ceremony, some spectators
pelted their vehicles with stones, shouting ``Pigs! Dogs!''
	   A resident of Lhokseumawe said teen-agers in school uniforms set
fire to the office of the ruling Golkar party, which has lost
credibility for buttressing Suharto's 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok island fought rioters
who were protesting a new governor.
	   There are fears that despite democratic reforms, the strain that
Indonesia's economic crisis is putting on millions of poor people
could lead to bigger riots.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The politically wounded presidents of the United
States and Russia opened their uncertain summit Tuesday. The
outlook for meaningful agreements was as cloudy as the Moscow
skies.
	   With Russia reeling from a political and economic crisis,
President Boris Yeltsin welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton
outside the Kremlin after wreath-laying at Moscow's Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
	   ``Russian-American relations are developing successfully,''
Yeltsin declared just before the meeting.
	   The formal wreath-laying and Kremlin welcome projected a
business-as-usual air as the leaders' meetings got underway.
	   Earlier, Clinton was welcomed at the airport on a cold,
rain-soaked morning by Russia's acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   Yeltsin opened the day still focused on his domestic woes,
saying at a Moscow school that he would ``insist'' the parliament
reverse itself and accept Chernomyrdin's appointment. The body
overwhelmingly rejected his nomination on Monday.
	   Yeltsin sounded a warm tone for Clinton. ``Clinton and I know
one another well, and we are friends,'' Yeltsin said at the school.

Thai forestry official in bribe controversy fired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture has
fired a high-ranking official who allegedly attempted to donate
money garnered through corruption to a charity fund run by Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, the ministry said Tuesday.
	   Earlier this year, Prawat Thanadka, deputy chief of the Royal
Forestry Department, attempted to give Chuan 5 million baht (dlrs
1.2 million) as a donation to the Thai-Help-Thai Campaign.
	   The campaign sought donations to help the country pay off its
foreign debts. Thailand is mired in its worst economic crisis in
decades and at one point its foreign reserves were nearly depleted.
	   When Chuan demanded to know where Prawat came up with the large
sum of money, the forestry official was forced to admit it had been
given to him as a bribe by people involved in illegal logging.
	   The incident sparked an investigation into illegal logging in
national parks and reserves near the Thai-Myanmar border.
	   Government officials, police, the military, ethnic rebels from
Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ and businessmen have all been
implicated in the scandal.
	   No one, however, has yet to be prosecuted.
	   A hardwood logging ban has been in place in Thailand since 1989.
The country is severely deforested. Most timber is imported from
neighboring Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. Cambodia is also severely
deforested.
	   Prawat has 30 days to appeal his firing to the Civil Servants
Committee.

Former major Japanese airport head convicted on bribery charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The former president of Japan's newest
international airport was convicted on Tuesday of taking bribes in
exchange for rigging a lucrative airport maintenance contract.
	   Tsuneharu Hattori, 65, was sentenced to an 18-month prison term,
fined 1.74 million yen (dlrs 12,492) and ordered to return a
300-gram solid gold bar received as a gift, said a Tokyo District
Court spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   As is common in Japan, the jail term was suspended for a
three-year probation period so no actual prison time is likely to
be served.
	   Hattori was president of the quasi-public company which runs the
Kansai International Airport _ which opened in 1994 _ for five
years starting in 1991.
	   Construction of the 1.5 trillion yen (dlrs 11 billion) airport
near Osaka on a man-made island was plagued by cost overruns and
delays. U.S. officials and American companies complained at the
time that Japanese companies were favored in construction bids.
	   Once a top-ranked Transportation Ministry official, Hattori
pleaded innocent to the charges of having accepted expensive
presents and lavish meals from an oil wholesaler who wanted a
cleaning contract awarded to a friend.
	   He reportedly acknowledged taking the gifts, but denied that
they were given as bribes in exchange for preferential treatment.
	   Junichi Izui, the oil wholesaler, has also claimed making
payments to top bureaucrats, business leaders and politicians
including Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gearing up for a renewed confrontation with a
hostile parliament, President Boris Yeltsin said Tuesday he will
``insist'' that Viktor Chernomyrdin be named head of a new Russian
government.
	   Yeltsin visited a Moscow school Tuesday morning _ the opening
day of the school year _ and said he believed the new government
could be formed within a week despite parliament's overwhelming
opposition to Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Chernomyrdin is the candidate I have chosen for prime minister
and I will insist upon it,'' Yeltsin said Tuesday morning before
opening a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Yeltsin said he was looking forward to friendly discussions with
Clinton, though Russia's economic and political woes were expected
to dominate the talks and no major bi-lateral agreements were
expected.
	   ``Russian-American relations are developing successfully,''
Yeltsin said at the school. ``Clinton and I know one another well,
and we are friends.''
	   With Yeltsin struggling to solve the country's latest crises,
his opponents in parliament rejected Chernomyrdin's candidacy on
Monday evening by a resounding 253-94.
	   Yeltsin immediately renominated Chernomyrdin, who served as
premier for five tumultuous years before he was dismissed in March
in a previous government shakeup.
	   A second vote is likely next Monday, the speaker of the
parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov, said. But the
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin's
prospects remained dim, and claimed Yeltsin was leading the country
to ruin.
	   ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war,''
Zyuganov said.
	   Zyuganov, who planned to meet with Clinton on Wednesday, also
criticized Western countries for their unflagging support of
Yeltsin.
	   Western nations ``have given unequivocal support to the man
(Yeltsin) who has drunk himself to degradation, who is insulting
the nation and the common sense of all of us,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Opposition leaders planned to draw up their own list of
candidates for the prime minister's post, but Yeltsin was not
expected to listen to their advice.
	   If Yeltsin's candidate is rejected three times, then the
president must dissolve parliament and call new elections within
three months. But the president would also be entitled to appoint
the prime minister _ presumably Chernomydin _ and could effectively
rule by decree until the new parliament is seated.
	   The bitter stand-off over Chernomyrdin's candidacy seemed to
bring Russia's political deadlock to a dangerous new high just as
Clinton began his visit to Moscow. Russians are anxious about the
growing crisis, but there have been no signs of panic on the
streets.
	   Chernomyrdin himself warned Monday that Russia was ``on the
verge of political and economic collapse.''
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since Aug.
23, when Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in the midst
of an economic crisis that has crippled the country's ruble and
stocks and sent an earthquake through world financial markets.
	   Zyuganov, leader of the Duma's vociferous Communist majority,
growled that Yeltsin's renomination of Chernomyrdin was ``a slap in
the face to the whole nation.''
	   Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems, and liberal Yabloko faction leader Grigory
Yavlinsky accused him of creating ``a semi-criminal economic
system.''
	   ``It was during his years that Russia became the world leader in
corruption,'' Yavlinsky said. ``You ask any kid what's the problem
with the government and the answer will be: `They are thieves.'''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they are confident of
winning the elections that would follow _ a view analysts don't
necessarily share.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed sharply higher Tuesday after
a dramatic rebound in late trading on speculation that government
related funds were moving in to support the market.
	   The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   After falling to a new 12-year low in morning trading, the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rallied in the closing
minutes of the trading session to post a gain of 261.74 points, or
1.86 percent, at 14,369.63. It had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent, the previous day.
	   The gain came despite a massive decline on Wall Street Monday
that many traders and investors feared would spill over into Tokyo
markets.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second-biggest point
loss ever Monday, falling 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, to close
at 7,539.07.
	   In Tokyo, traders said that pension funds linked to the
government were buying stock futures, helping to push the market
higher.
	   ``Investors were frightened following the plunge on Wall Street,
but buying by pension funds and hedge funds put a brake on the
sell-off,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock
division at Chuo Securities.
	   A partial recovery in overnight trading in U.S. stock futures in
Asia helped the market by boosting hopes that Wall Street would
rebound from Monday's dramatic loss.
	   Many investors said the gain was unlikely to last as bad loan
problems at Japanese banks and the government's inability to decide
on a way to fix them would continue to weigh on the market.
	   At one point, the Nikkei fell as low as 13,664.74 in early
trading, a new 12-year low, before recovering in the afternoon. On
Friday the average dropped below 14,000 for the first time since
March 1986.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 3.66 points, or 0.33
percent, to 1,110.15. On Monday, it had gained 19.50 points, or
1.79 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar weakened amid
concern over plummeting stock prices on Wall Street and continuing
political turmoil in Russia, traders said.
	   The dollar bought 139.29 yen in afternoon trading, down 2.23 yen
from late trading in Tokyo on Monday and also below its level of
140.78 yen in late New York trading.
	   The dollar was quoted as low as 138.50 yen during Tokyo trading
Tuesday.
	   ``It's now the dollar's problem that's driving trading, instead
of some other currencies','' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of
the international treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.060 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040
percent, driving its price down to 112.71 yen from 112.86 yen.

In western China, trained locust-killing chickens do their work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In the biggest locust infestation in a decade in
northwestern China, trained chickens are the heroes.
	   A program to use 100,000 chickens to control locusts worked so
well getting the insect plague under control this year that
counties around Urumqi, the regional capital, have decided to raise
200,000 special chickens next year, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The report said the chickens had to be trained for two months so
that they would start hunting locusts in the grassland at the sound
of a herdsman's whistle. No details of the training regimen were
revealed.
	   Each chicken can cover half a hectare (about an acre) of
grassland during a summer. What's more, chickens fattened on
protein-rich locusts fetch a much higher price than ordinary
chickens, Xinhua reported.
	   The region also has built shelters for migrating starlings to
attract them to stop and feed on locusts as well.

Government defends intervention after being downgraded by credit
</HEADLINE>
agency

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government on Tuesday defended recent
efforts to prop up stock prices, one day after a leading credit
agency downgraded the territory's debt rating and criticized the
intervention.
	   The government said in a statement the intervention in stock and
stock futures markets was necessary to quash market manipulation by
speculators and restore market order.
	   The statement said the government has no intention to prop the
stock market to any particular level and only wants ``to ensure a
level playing field for market practitioners and to ensure the
efficiency of the markets.''
	   On Monday, Standard and Poor's in New York downgraded its rating
of the territory's creditworthiness by one notch, citing the
government's meddling in the markets.
	   The rating agency said the intervention was ``an increasingly
complex, and risky strategy'' to fend off speculators, and the
government is likely to suffer huge losses with its massive
accumulation of shares ``unless the downward trend in global equity
prices is reversed.''
	   The agency also said the government is losing its financial
flexibility as many of the region's economies, including Hong Kong,
have slipped into recession.
	   But the government defended its move, saying the blue-chip
shares it has bought are ``all good quality assets which we will
hold for the long term.'' But it refused to disclose its portfolio
because the speculative attacks are still ongoing, the statement
said.
	   To drive up the market as a way to punish speculators who bet
the market would go down, the government has been buying shares
aggressively for two weeks. The intervention climaxed on Friday,
when analysts estimate the government spent U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion
buying shares.
	   Market players estimate the government has spent a total of
about 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves
propping up stock prices.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index has risen 1,200 points since the
government's intervention started, but it plunged 7.1 percent on
Monday when the government took a breather.
	   On Tuesday, the index plunged another below 7,000 points but
rebounded later to end the morning session 1.6 percent lower at
7,155.23.
	   Analysts say the battle is far from over, saying the government
cannot unload all its shares without triggering a market collapse.
Many expect another showdown with speculators soon.
	   Critics say the government is undermining its long-standing
hands-off policy, which is widely credited for its economic
success.
	   ``We will ask `will the government intervene?' If they do, we
will have a controlled market, and if that's the case, it would
deter future potential investors,'' said Steven Thompson, chief
banking and conglomerates analyst for Nikko Securities (Asia).

Australian stocks down but recover from US-led plunge

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's share market recovered
after an early slide on the back of Wall Street's plunge to finish
less than one percent lower Tuesday.
	   The all ordinaries index finished down 22.5 points at 2458.2,
more than 71 points above its early low of 2386.7 on a futures-led
recovery.
	   The September share price index contract was down four points
for the day at 2465.0, trading at a premium to the physical market
on expectations of a bounce of up to 200 points on Wall Street
Tuesday.
	   The market also adjudged the U.S. sell-off came as a result of
that market being overvalued _ while the local market was not.
	   ``They traded around 20 points up for most of the afternoon
because they are expecting a big bounce on Wall Street tonight,''
said Nevitts broker Steve Negrine.
	   ``Our stocks have had crashes already and it's hard to believe
the market here has been so sensible.''
	   The all industrials index was down 40.2 points at 4368.8, with
banking stocks leading the afternoon recovery.
	   Rupert Murdoch's media giant News Corp. bore the brunt of the
U.S. drop, with the ordinary and preferred shares both closing
Australian cents 42 (U.S. cents 24) down at Australian dlrs 10.27
(U.S. dlrs 5.83) and Australian dlrs 9.11 (U.S. dlrs 5.17)
respectively.
	   Preliminary turnover figures showed 302.97 million shares traded
at a value of Australian dlrs 1.136 billion (U.S. dlrs 645
million), with falls outnumbering rises by 730 to 414.

Japan's stocks rise again, despite the Dow's fall

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the second day in a row Tuesday, Japan's stock
market defied the example of nearly every other major index in the
world, including Wall Street, and closed sharply higher.
	   But many analysts saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given
how wildly the stocks gyrated _ and some pointed at a temporary
intervention by government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who tried to
reassure Americans that despite the big fall on Wall Street Monday
the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, who recently urged world leaders to
hold a summit meeting to discuss the global market chaos.
	   Key stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore all opened
sharply lower Tuesday in reaction to Monday's 6.4 percent drop on
the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
	   Asia's benchmark indexes quickly fell 2 percent in Tokyo, 3.5
percent in Hong Kong, and 3.5 percent in Singapore.
	   However, it didn't take long for signs of recovery to emerge in
Japan, the world's second largest economy, and to a lesser extent
in the other two markets.
	   By midday, Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had
narrowed its loss to 1.27 percent, and by the end of the day it
finished trading at 14,369.63, up 261.74, or 1.86 percent.
	   On Monday, the Nikkei also had defied the odds of the world
markets by finishing 1.38 percent higher.
	   But the index, which had just sunk to a 12-year low on Friday,
also swung wildly in a 700-point range Tuesday. And many analysts
dismissed this week's recovery as a short technical rebound,
pointing out that many of the major problems weighing on Japan's
economy and stocks remained in place.
	   ``Investors were frightened following the plunge on Wall Street,
but buying by government-linked pension funds and hedge funds put a
brake on the sell-off,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of
the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Ken Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said
Tuesday's rise was a temporary reprieve and that the Nikkei could
fall below 14,000 again if U.S. stocks weaken further.
	   ``The Japanese government is nowhere near solving the problems
with its indebted banks, so there is a big danger that we will see
the stock market fall even further,'' said Yoshio Inamura, a fund
manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi Asset Management.
	   On Monday, the Dow dropped 512.61 points to close at 7,539.07.
That brought the index, which had recently been enjoying an 18
percent gain on the year, down to a 4.7 percent annual loss. It
also could be moving toward its first bear market since 1990.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   To make matters worse, more bad news surfaced in Asia.
	   In Japan, the government sharply criticized Communist North
Korea for firing a long-range ballistic missile over Japan's main
island and into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
	   Like U.S. officials, the Japanese government sees the test as a
dangerous development for the volatile region's security.
	   In Hong Kong, investors found out that Standard and Poor's in
New York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's
ability to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   S and P cited the severity of Hong Kong's recession and the
government's recent round of intervention in the stock and stock
futures markets, which it called ``an increasingly complex and
risky strategy'' to defend the territory's currency.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves to prop up the stock market in a
two-week battle with speculators. On Monday, when the government
stopped its buying, the stock index plunged 7.1 percent.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government, which
is well-known for its criticism of free markets and its feuding
with Singapore, took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors and hurt Singapore's
over-the-counter market, which is one of the biggest arenas for
trading Malaysian stocks outside the country.

Vietnam frees dissidents, at least two Vietnamese-Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second dissident apparently still in Vietnam,
U.S. reaction, grafs 7-8.
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Vietnam's best-known dissident was
freed Tuesday and flown in Bangkok, where he expressed a longing to
return to his own country and keep struggling for democracy.
	   At least two Vietnamese-Americans who had been jailed for
alleged plots to overthrow the Hanoi government were also freed,
Vietnamese officials said.
	   Doan Viet Hoat, serving a 15-year sentence for publishing
pro-democracy newsletters, was freed from Hanoi Prison and put on a
flight to Bangkok. U.S. officials said they have accepted him for
resettlement.
	   ``I regret that they don't let me stay in Vietnam,'' Hoat told
reporters on arrival. ``I don't want to leave my country. I love my
country. I want to contribute to freedom and democracy.''
	   U.S. and Thai officials whisked away Hoat, who appeared to be in
good health, and said he would be staying in the Thai capital
overnight. They said he might make a statement later.
	   Although he is little known inside Vietnam, where the government
controls the media, his case was taken up by the European
Parliament and the World Association of Newspapers, which earlier
this year gave him its Golden Pen of Freedom for his commitment to
a free press.
	   Another dissident, Nguyen Dan Que, was also released and has
been approved for resettlement in the United States. U.S. Embassy
officials in Bangkok said Que appeared not to have left Vietnam
yet.
	   ``We congratulate the government for releasing both of these
men,'' a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
	   They were released as part of an amnesty for 5,219 inmates to
mark National Day on Wednesday. Vietnamese officials told a news
conference last Friday that several expatriates, including
Americans, were on the list.
	   A government source said Tuesday that Vietnamese-Americans Jimmy
Tran and Ly Tong had been released. Tong was on the passenger list
for a flight to Hong Kong but did not board the plane, a Vietnam
Airlines official said.
	   In September 1992, Tong _ a former South Vietnamese air force
pilot _ hijacked a Vietnam Airlines jet from Thailand and dropped
50,000 anti-government leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon.
	   He then parachuted to the ground, apparently intending to lead
the revolution he hoped would follow, but was instead arrested.
	   Tran, a Vietnamese-American who also was opposed to the Hanoi
government, was sentenced to 20 years in jail in 1993 for plotting
to explode bombs in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, the old
South Vietnamese capital.
	   Vietnam denies it holds anyone for political or religious
beliefs, only those who have broken the law.
	   Human-rights groups counter that a number of people are jailed
for violating the all-encompassing national security law or the
strict regulation of religious activities.

Thai inflation slows, should beat IMF target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Inflation in recession-bound Thailand
has begun to slow and should finish the year under the target set
by the International Monetary Fund, the Ministry of Commerce said
on Tuesday.
	   Thailand is mired in its worst economic crisis in modern times
and is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout supervised by the IMF.
The agency has set targets on a range of economic indicators it
wants the Thai government to achieve as part of its rescue package.
	   Thai consumer prices rose 7.6 percent year-on-year in August,
while wholesale prices jumped 12.9 percent, in a significant
moderation of the country's inflation rate, the ministry said
Tuesday.
	   The consumer price index rose to 129.4, up 0.4 percent from
July. In July the index was up 10.0 percent year-on-year, while the
wholesale price index shot up 19.5 percent.
	   Inflation as measured by the CPI has eased from a peak in June
of 10.7 percent year-on-year, the biggest increase in a decade.
	   Karun Kittitaporn, director general of the ministry's Business
Economics Department, said the CPI increase for the whole year
should come in under the most recent target of 9.2 percent
specified by the IMF.
	   In the first eight months of the year, consumer prices rose 9.5
percent on the same period last year, while wholesale prices were
up 18.4 percent year-on-year.

Indonesian prosecutors say Suharto daughter clear in corruption

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The eldest daughter of former
President Suharto has not been implicated in a corruption scandal
involving a toll road company she owns, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Government prosecutors said they are not planning legal action
against Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, who built up a sprawling network
of businesses while her father was in power, The Indonesian
Observer reported.
	   Critics say alleged corruption by the Suharto clan contributed
to Indonesia's economic crisis and the business dealings of some
members of his family have come under scrutiny.
	   Prosecutors are also looking into more than a dozen charitable
foundations controlled by Suharto amid allegations they were used
for corrupt purposes. The autocratic president quit in May after
riots and student protests.
	   Rukmana, also known as ``Tutut,'' has amassed a huge fortune
over the years and one of her most prominent businesses is the
network of toll roads that crisscross Jakarta, the capital.
	   Investigators suspect that managers of one toll road, the Pondok
Pinang-Jagorawi route, siphoned off money for their own benefit.
	   But the Observer quoted Anton Sujata, a deputy in the attorney
general's office, as saying he could not confirm reports that Tutut
made money from government bonds sold for the project.
	   He said Tutut should not be blamed if some of her subordinates
were corrupt and denied that prosecutors were giving her lenient
treatment because of her wealth and family ties.
	   ``The result of the investigation does not show enough evidence

Defense, prosecution fail to reach plea bargain agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The attorney of a German man accused of
plotting a suicide bombing in Israel resigned Tuesday after he
failed to reach agreement with the prosecution on a plea bargain.
	   The attorney, Dan Assan, said his client, Stephan Smyrek, has
not been paying him and that he was not prepared to go through a
lengthy trial without a fee.
	   ``As long as there was a chance for a plea bargain, I was
prepared to continue to represent Mr. Smyrek. But under the present
conditions, I do not feel prepared to continue,'' Assan told the
Tel Aviv District Court.
	   Prosecutor Devora Chen said she preferred a trial to a plea
agreement. ``When the whole world is fighting terrorism, one cannot
expect the state of Israel to settle matters in such a manner,''
Chen told the court.
	   Smyrek, 26, was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at Israel's
Ben-Gurion Airport. He is accused of plotting with the
Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah to carry out the
bombing in Israel.
	   In August 1997, Smyrek allegedly traveled to Lebanon to train in
the use of light arms, explosives and other weapons. Three months
later, Smyrek came to Israel via Amsterdam, equipped with a video
camera, a map of Israel and dlrs 4,000 from Hezbollah, according to
the charge sheet against him.
	   No details have been made public about the bombing Smyrek was
allegedly plotting.
	   He is charged with conspiring to carry out an attack in Israel,
harming state security and belonging to a terror organization.
	   The charges carry a maximum penalty of two life sentences plus
five years.
	   Smyrek seemed healthy and composed Tuesday as he appeared in
court wearing a black and gray warm-up suit. He was handcuffed and
escorted by Assan. In previous court appearances, Smyrek was
coughing and seemed to suffer from ill health.
	   Smyrek asked Judge Natan Amit through a translator to appoint a
public defender.
	   The judge set the next hearing for Oct. 23.

Mild earthquake hits Manila, nearby provinces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with seismologists saying quake occurred at a shallow
depth and wasn't strong enough to generate destructive waves in 4th
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A mild earthquake shook Manila and
nearby provinces before dawn Tuesday. There were no immediate
reports of damage or casualties, government seismologists said.
	   The temblor with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 was the second
to hit the capital in more than a week and could have been
triggered by an offshore fault that generated the first one,
seismologists said.
	   The latest earthquake occurred at 3:16 a.m. (1916 GMT Monday),
affecting several areas of metropolitan Manila and the nearby
northern provinces of Pampanga and Zambales, said the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.
	   It was centered beneath the seabed about seven kilometers (4.3
miles) southwest of the coastal town of San Felipe in Zambales.
Although the quake had a shallow depth, it wasn't strong enough to
whip up destructive waves, seismologists said.
	   The temblor was probably caused by movement in the same fault
that triggered a 6.1 magnitude shock on Aug. 23, seismologist
Delfin Garcia said.
	   The Aug. 23 earthquake knocked items off store shelves and
alarmed many people in the capital because it happened
simultaneously with thunder and hail storms that briefly cut off
power.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

Fire reportedly causes evacuation effort on airliner

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) - As heads of state began arriving
Tuesday for a summit of the nonaligned nations, rescue crews rushed
to evacuate a commercial airliner after a fire apparently broke
out.
	   A fire truck went to the South African Airways plane and escape
chutes were attached to aircraft but it was not immediately clear
if anyone was evacuated.
	   Journalists covering the arrivals of the dignitaries were about
1 1/2 kilometers (1 miles) away from the plane and were kept away
from the site. Airport workers said an engine had caught fire but
that there were no injuries.
	   A harried South African Airways official at Durban's airport
refused to comment.
	   It was unknown if the plane was connected to the summit. Most of
the dozens of heads of state were arriving in private aircraft or
their national air carriers.

Taiwan gunners stage exercises, more displays in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Military gunners staged a live firing
exercise on the Penghu Island group Tuesday as the Defense Ministry
announced that major military displays will be conducted in
southern Taiwan in October.
	   Howitzers, mobile artillery and M60A3 tanks fired over 2,000
rounds to simulate repelling a Chinese invasion of the Penghu
islands, located in the Taiwan Strait about 55 kilometers (34
miles) off Taiwan's west coast, the military said.
	   Displays scheduled for Oct. 2-7 will put the air force and
navy's newly acquired hardware on display in a live firing
exercise, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Taiwan has beefed up its air defenses with American F-16 and
French Mirage 2000 jets, and sea power with French Lafayette and
other U.S. and home-built missile frigates.
	   ``Over recent years, China has frequently staged landing
exercises and tri-service combined exercises. Only by practicing,
can we learn to defeat the enemy and meet the task of defending
Penghu,'' Mo Jen-kuo, commander of the exercises, told reporters.
	   China has considered Taiwan a breakaway province to be reunited
with by force if necessary since the two sides divided politically
in 1949.
	   Tuesday's exercise was originally planned for June, but was
delayed until after U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China in
June-July amid speculation that Taiwan did not want to provoke
Beijing
	   Exercises by the armed forces of Taiwan and China have been
closely watched since China staged war games in 1995-1996 aimed at
intimidating Taiwan independence supporters.
	   A Taiwanese military display around the time of Hong Kong's
return to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997 was widely construed as a
reminder to Beijing of the island's ability to defend itself.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen's party officially declared poll winner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party was
officially named the winner Tuesday of the July 26 parliamentary
elections, a day after Cambodia's highest appeals body dismissed
opposition complaints of electoral fraud.
	   The Cambodian People's Party won 41.27 percent of the vote,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC 31.70 and its ally, the Sam
Rainsy Party, 14.27.
	   That translates into 64 seats for Hun Sen in the National
Assembly against 58 for the opposition, short of the two-thirds
majority the CPP needs to form a government alone.
	   The results _ while no surprise _ came as a blow to the
opposition which, for the past nine days, has been staging an
unprecedented round-the-clock protest against Hun Sen and alleged
election fraud.
	   The demonstrators have called for Hun Sen's ouster and turned
the small park in front of the National Assembly into a tent city
with crowds at times reaching over 10,000.
	   They accuse Hun Sen of resorting to intimidation and killings in
the run-up to the polls and allege widespread cheating in the
tallying of ballots to ensure victory for the CPP.
	   The mood in the park was lackluster Tuesday, but the opposition
vowed to continue the protests.
	   The official results were released one day after the
Constitutional Council, which is stacked with Hun Sen's supporters,
rejected all the opposition's complaints about fraud.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-prime minister in a bloody coup. More than 100 of the
prince's supporters were killed in the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new polls would help him win back lost
legitimacy and aid.
	   Though Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have threatened to boycott the
assembly if their concerns were not addressed, they are now hinting
they will take part and use their power to freeze the government.
	   Hun Sen has asked both parties to form a coalition, but they
have so far refused. It remains to be seen if he will succeed in
buying off opposition members to win two-thirds majority control.

Vietnam frees dissidents, at least two Vietnamese-Americans

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Vietnam's best-known dissident was
freed Tuesday and flown in Bangkok, where he expressed a longing to
return to his own country and keep struggling for democracy.
	   At least two Vietnamese-Americans who had been jailed for
alleged plots to overthrow the Hanoi government were also freed,
Vietnamese officials said.
	   Doan Viet Hoat, serving a 15-year sentence for publishing
pro-democracy newsletters, was freed from Hanoi Prison and put on a
flight to Bangkok. U.S. officials said they have accepted him for
resettlement.
	   ``I regret that they don't let me stay in Vietnam,'' Hoat told
reporters on arrival. ``I don't want to leave my country. I love my
country. I want to contribute to freedom and democracy.''
	   U.S. and Thai officials whisked away Hoat, who appeared to be in
good health, and said he would be staying in the Thai capital
overnight. They said he might make a statement later.
	   Although he is little known inside Vietnam, where the government
controls the media, his case was taken up by the European
Parliament and the World Association of Newspapers, which earlier
this year gave him its Golden Pen of Freedom for his commitment to
a free press.
	   Another dissident, Nguyen Dan Que, was also released and has
been approved for resettlement in the United States. U.S. Embassy
officials in Bangkok said Que appeared not to have left Vietnam
yet.
	   ``We congratulate the government for releasing both of these
men,'' a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
	   They were released as part of an amnesty for 5,219 inmates to
mark National Day on Wednesday. Vietnamese officials told a news
conference last Friday that several expatriates, including
Americans, were on the list.
	   A government source said Tuesday that Vietnamese-Americans Jimmy
Tran and Ly Tong had been released. Tong was on the passenger list
for a flight to Hong Kong but did not board the plane, a Vietnam
Airlines official said.
	   In September 1992, Tong _ a former South Vietnamese air force
pilot _ hijacked a Vietnam Airlines jet from Thailand and dropped
50,000 anti-government leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon.
	   He then parachuted to the ground, apparently intending to lead
the revolution he hoped would follow, but was instead arrested.
	   Tran, a Vietnamese-American who also was opposed to the Hanoi
government, was sentenced to 20 years in jail in 1993 for plotting
to explode bombs in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, the old
South Vietnamese capital.
	   Vietnam denies it holds anyone for political or religious
beliefs, only those who have broken the law.
	   Human-rights groups counter that a number of people are jailed
for violating the all-encompassing national security law or the
strict regulation of religious activities.

 &UR; EDs: explains preferential voting system after 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Democrats have made a
pitch for the youth vote ahead of the Oct. 3 federal election by
producing a kit including condoms and the slogan ``So It's Your
First Time, Get Some Protection _ Vote Democrats.''
	   Democrats deputy leader Natasha Stott Despoja said the kit was
to encourage young people to ``practice safe politics'' and to
explain the country's preferential voting system.
	   Australia's preferential voting system requires all major
parties to list candidates from other groups in a descending order
of preference. Preferences, or secondary votes, can often result in
candidates winning election.
	   ``This kit is directed at many young Australians, 500,000 of
whom are voting for the first time,'' Stott Despoja said. ``It aims
to explain the preferential system, explaining why a vote for a
third party is never a wasted vote, but also explaining to people
why their preferences count.
	   ``In this election campaign, preferences will probably determine
who governs in this nation and who controls the balance of power in
both houses.''
	   Stott Despoja said the Democrats had received a number of calls
from young people, their parents and schools, asking them to
explain preferential voting and to outline some of the policies of
all political parties.
	   ``The aim is to ensure that young people have the education not
just how to vote and how it works but to encourage them to get a
lot of information in, education about the polices of all
parties,'' Stott Despoja said.
	   The Democrats are Australia's fourth-largest party behind the
Liberal and National coalition members and the Labor Party.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon currency and bond rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dramatic decline on Wall Street drove the
dollar sharply lower against the Japanese yen Tuesday while Tokyo
stocks rebounded from early losses to close higher for a second
day.
	   A 6.4 percent plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Index overnight
sent the dollar tumbling in Asia.
	   The U.S. currency bought 138.22 yen in late afternoon trading,
down 3.30 yen from late trading in Tokyo on Monday and also below
its level of 140.78 yen in late New York trading.
	   Continuing political turmoil in Russia also weighed on the U.S.
currency, traders said.
	   The dollar was quoted as low as 138.10 yen Tuesday after trading
as high as 139.95 earlier in the day.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, share prices closed sharply higher
on speculation that government related funds were moving to support
the market.
	   After falling to a 12-year low in morning trading, the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rallied in the closing minutes of
the session to post a gain of 261.74 points, or 1.86 percent, at
14,369.63. The Nikkei had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, the
previous day.
	   The gain came despite the massive decline on Wall Street that
many traders feared would spill over into Tokyo markets.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second-biggest point
loss ever Monday, falling 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, to close
at 7,539.07.
	   In Tokyo, traders said that pension funds linked to the
government were buying stocks, helping to push the market higher.
	   ``Investors were frightened following the plunge on Wall Street,
but buying by pension funds and hedge funds put a brake on the
sell-off,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock
division at Chuo Securities.
	   A partial recovery in a U.S. stock index that is traded in Asia
also helped the market by boosting hopes that Wall Street would
rebound when trading opens there on Tuesday.
	   But many investors said Tokyo's gain was unlikely to last as bad
loan problems at Japanese banks and the government's inability to
decide on a way to fix them would continue to weigh on the market.
	   Before the late afternoon rally, the Nikkei fell as low as
13,664.74, a new 12-year low. On Friday the average dropped below
14,000 for the first time since March 1986.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 3.66 points, or 0.33
percent, to 1,110.15. On Monday, it had gained 19.50 points, or
1.79 percent.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 597 to 572, while 150 issues were
unchanged. Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at
a modest 444 million shares, up from 430 million Monday.

Taiwan government plans measures to prop up stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan share prices plunged to a near
two-year low Tuesday, and the government said it is considering
setting up a special fund to prop up the market.
	   The Taiwan Stock Exchange's key Weighted Idex tumbled 215.02
points, or 3.3 percent, to 6335.09, its lowest level in 23 months.
The fall followed a 185-point decline on Monday.
	   Dealers blamed slump on overnight Wall Street plunges amid
gloomy prospects of the global economy.
	   ``It's all connected to the international environment. If the
U.S. stock markets keep falling, Taiwan shares can't help but be
affected,'' said Andy Wei, assistant manager of MasterLink
Securities Corp.
	   Meeting securities firms officials to discuss the current market
woes, President Lee Teng-hui questioned how money had moved out of
the market given Taiwan's relatively sound economy, according to a
statement from his office.
	   Lee said Taiwan should take measures to prevent market
speculations, such as attacks at the Hong Kong markets by U.S.
financier George Soros. Taiwan has been concerned that the Soros
funds would make the island their next target.
	   Perng Fai-nan, governor of the Central Bank, said Taiwan has
been prepared to block speculations from Soros. The government has
banned non-deliverable forward trading that could have provided
funds for the speculators, he said.
	   Authorities have also launched a probe on whether any Soros
funds are being sold illegally in Taiwan, Perng added.
	   Lee also agreed to study investors' suggestions, such as raising
the ceiling of margin loans and cutting stock transaction taxes.
	   Meanwhile, Lin Tsung-yung, head of the Securities and Futures
Commission, said authorities were planning to set up a special fund
with money from pension funds and postal savings funds to invest in
the market should the prices fall any further.
	   Officials said the fund could amount to 200 billion Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.7 billion.)
	   The fund was last established and used in 1995 to prop up the
stock market when China test-fired missiles near Taiwanese waters
to intimidate the Taiwanese.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Sakura Bank Ltd. will eliminate jobs and
close branches as part of a cost-cutting plan, the Nihon Keizai
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The steps would represent an acceleration of cost-cutting
measures begun in March and would coincide with a plan announced
Monday to increase the bank's capital by some 300 billion yen (dlrs
2.2 billion) as early as this month.
	   The new restructuring plan is expected to cut costs by 30
billion yen (dlrs 215 million) over three years, the paper said.
	   A Sakura spokesman said the bank had not officially decided on
such measures and would not confirm the report.
	   Sakura had already said it would cut some 2,000 jobs over three
years but will now increase the pace to 3,000 over the same period,
the report said.
	   Some 50 domestic branches will be merged with other ones and
closed by March 2000. In addition, about 23 overseas branches,
mostly in Europe and the United States, will be shut down, the
paper reported. Sakura had 86 foreign branches as of the end of
1997.
	   The bank will also speed up the process of reducing the number
of directors it employs from the current 45.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ With Japan already stuck in a deep downturn, a top
government official said Tuesday that economic conditions are
growing worse.
	   The Japanese economy is now going through one of its ``darkest
stages,'' said Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya.
	   Speaking at a press conference, Sakaiya blamed the moribund
state of the Japanese economy on weak consumer and corporate
confidence and also on events outside Japan, such as floods in
China and economic turmoil in Russia.
	   Japan said it had slipped into its deepest recession since the
end of World War II earlier this year when it announced gross
domestic product for the fiscal year that ended in March shrank by
0.7 percent.
	   Sakaiya, an author of books about Japan's economy and the only
non-politician in Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's cabinet, is known
for his outspoken views. While many Japanese leaders have
downplayed the extent of the country's economic problems, Sakaiya
has said economic growth is likely to fall short of official
forecasts.
	   Last month, he said falling prices and wages in Japan could
trigger a deflationary spiral that would push Japan deeper into
recession.
	   Sakaiya said Tuesday it was too early to say whether an
overnight plunge on Wall Street would trigger declines worldwide.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An international auction has failed to
find a buyer for bankrupt Kia Motor Co. because bidders demanded
more of the carmaker's huge debt be written off, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Kia president Lee Jong-dae did not reveal the schedule for a
second bidding, but he added Kia's creditor banks will discuss
whether to write off more of Kia's debt.
	   In mid-August, Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean carmakers _
Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors, Inc. _
submitted bids for Kia, South Korea's second largest auto maker
before its collapse last year.
	   Kia had planned to announce the successful bidder Tuesday.
Instead, it canceled the auction, saying all four bidders failed to
meet terms set by Kia's creditor banks.
	   The bidders demanded that creditors write off more of the
combined dlrs 12.8 trillion won (dlrs 9.5 billion) of Kia and its
commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp. Two of the bidders, Ford
and Hyundai, also submitted bids below the minimum price set by the
creditors _ 5,000 won (dlrs 3.7) per share.
	   To make the failed company more attractive to bidders, the
creditor banks had earlier offered to write off nearly half of the
debt. Bidders, however, accused Kia's creditor banks of
understating the company's debt.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Shell Eastern Petroleum said Monday it will cut
crude oil processing at the country's biggest refinery to just
under half of its capacity, reflecting Asia's dwindling demand for
petroleum following the regional economic crisis.
	   The Bukom refinery, run by a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
will process about 29,000 metric tons a day in September, or 49
percent of design capacity.
	   Last month, Bukom operated at about 71 to 73 percent of full
capacity, producing 42,000 to 43,000 tons of petroleum a day.
	   The refinery, designed to process 59,000 tons a day, has been
operating at below capacity for most of the last year because of
low prices and a weak export market.
	   But the September operating level, announced by a Shell
spokesman because of ``continuing adverse market conditions,'' will
be the lowest monthly output for the year.
	   Among Singapore's other three refiners, Singapore Refining Co.
and Mobil Corp. have cut crude runs by 15 to 16 percent. Figures
for Exxon Corp. were not immediately available.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Inflation in recession-bound Thailand
has begun to slow and should finish the year under the target set
by the International Monetary Fund, the Ministry of Commerce said
on Tuesday.
	   As part of a dlrs 17.2 billion bail out, the International
Monetary Fund has set targets for a range of economic indicators
that it wants the Thai government to achieve.	   Thai consumer prices rose 7.6 percent in August from the same
month last year, while wholesale prices jumped 12.9 percent, the
ministry said Tuesday.
	   Both figures reflect a significant moderation of the country's
inflation rate. Last month, prices as measured by the consumer
price index jumped by 10.0 percent, while the wholesale prices shot
up 19.5 percent.
	   Inflation has eased from a peak in June of 10.7 percent, the
biggest increase in a decade.
	   Karun Kittitaporn, director general of the ministry's Business
Economics Department, said the increase by the consumer price index
for the whole year should come in under the most recent target of
9.2 percent specified by the IMF.
	   In the first eight months of the year, consumer prices rose 9.5
percent from the same period last year, while wholesale prices were
up 18.4 percent.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. has launched its Chinese language
version of Windows 98 in China and said three leading Chinese
computer markers agreed to pre-install it in their desktop lines.
	   ``The pre-installation of the Chinese version of Windows 98 is
an indication that our cooperation with local partners has entered
a new stage,'' said Michael Rawding, regional director of Microsoft
Greater China. The version was launched Monday.
	   Encouraging the use of pre-installed software will also cut down
on software piracy, the company said in a press release.
	   The computer makers installing the latest Microsoft operating
system are Legend, Founder and Tontru.
	   Microsoft said it will donate 400,000 yuan (dlrs 48,000) from
initial sales of the software in China to the country's flood
stricken areas.
	   Microsoft released the English language version of Windows 98 on
June 25.

<TEXT>
	   GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson was involved in a minor
auto accident and had to be restrained by his own bodyguards from
fighting the driver of the other car, police said.
	   The former heavyweight champion complained of chest pains after
Monday's accident, described by police as minor in this Washington,
D.C., suburb. No one was arrested.
	   Tyson was a passenger in the Mercedes convertible driven by his
wife, Monica Turner, who apparently struck the car in front of
hers, said Derek Baliles, a spokesman for the Montgomery County
police.
	   Tyson got out of the car and ``appeared to want to fight the
other driver,'' said Baliles. ``He was restrained by his wife and
members of his security detail who were traveling in a second
car.''
	   The other driver was not identified.
	   Because passers-by called to report the incident, police stopped
Tyson a short time later, he said.
	   ``Because of the reports of a fight we wanted to be sure
everyone was OK,'' said Baliles. ``While we were speaking to Mr.
Tyson, he requested an ambulance, complaining of chest pains.''
	   But once the ambulance arrived, Tyson refused to be taken to a
hospital, saying his wife was a doctor and would tend to him,
Baliles said. The Tyson group was then allowed to leave.
	   However, several hours later a spokesman for Shady Grove
Hospital said Tyson was treated and released from the hospital's
emergency room. Tyson did not come by ambulance and his condition
was not serious, said spokesman Robert Jepson, who declined to give
further details.
	   Baliles said there were no immediate plans to file charges.
	   It is up to the other driver to decide whether to make a
complaint to police, and it was unclear if he wanted to pursue the
matter, Baliles said.
	   A telephone call to the New York office of Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel was not returned Monday night.
	   Tyson is scheduled to appear Sept. 19 at a hearing before the
Nevada Athletic Commission to determine if the state will let him
box again.
	   Tyson was banned by the commission in July 1997 after biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight championship
fight. His license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3 million.
	   He was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada on July 9,
but bypassed the state and went through the licensing process in
New Jersey. On the eve of that licensing decision, he abruptly
withdrew the application in New Jersey and said he would seek
licensing in Nevada.

Indonesia promises to help women victims of military in northern
</HEADLINE>
province
 &UR; With Indonesia-Riots

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government said Tuesday it will
form a team in northern Aceh province to protect women against
violence in the wake of military violations, the official Antara
news agency reported.
	   Human rights workers allege many widows of men killed while the
military was crushing an Islamic separatist movement in Aceh have
suffered rape and torture. Hundreds of women are said to have lost
their husbands in the fighting.
	   Rioting over the past two days in the Aceh town of Lhokseumawe
was triggered by bitterness toward the military, although mobs
quickly turned their fury on the ethnic Chinese, a traditional
scapegoat in times of tension.
	   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, has pulled some troops out
of Aceh, on the tip of Sumatra island, and has apologized for any
wrongdoing during military operations in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
	   ``The immediate task is to restore the social condition of the
families of victims of the military operation,'' Antara quoted
Tutty Alawiyah, the women's affairs minister, as saying.
	   In Aceh, the government team will provide education and training
to widows and orphans. It forms part of a national panel to help
women, set up in response to riots in May that helped oust former
President Suharto.
	   Women's groups have said at least 168 Chinese women and girls
were raped during the riots in Jakarta, which claimed 1,200 lives.
	   However, Alawiah and military chiefs have said they had failed
to find evidence of mass rapes.
	   Human rights activists say rape victims may be unwilling to seek
help because of the stigma associated with the crime and because
they may view police as being corrupt.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo issued a strong protest against North Korea
for firing a missile over Japan and sent military ships Tuesday to
the spot in the Pacific Ocean where it was believed to have landed.
	   The missile launch Monday renewed worries over security in Asia
and raised serious questions about the adequacy of Japan's missile
detection and anti-missile systems.
	   Government spokesman Sadaaki Numata said Tuesday that Japan did
not know about the missile launch until it received word from the
U.S. military. He added Japan had no independent monitoring system
to warn of the launching.
	   Numata also said Japan has frozen the dlrs 1 billion it had
committed to a project with South Korea, the United States and
Europe to supply North Korea with two nuclear energy reactors. And
sending food aid to the reclusive communist state would now be more
difficult, he acknowledged.
	   ``Our relations with North Korea are going to be more severe
than they have ever been,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said
after attending a special Cabinet meeting where the missile topped
the agenda.
	   Komura said the missile firing may help speed up Japan's
proposed joint development of a missile defense system with the
United States.
	   Defense officials said the missile appeared to be the new Taepo
Dong 1, which has a longer range than an older model and is capable
of reaching all of South Korea and Japan.
	   The South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek and his
Japanese counterpart, meeting in Tokyo, agreed to set up a group of
top defense officials from both nations that will meet specifically
to discuss North Korea's missile program.
	   ``We agreed that the missile was a threat to both nations,''
said Fukushiro Nukaga, director of the Defense Agency.
	   With no official diplomatic channels with the reclusive
communist state, even issuing a protest was a problem.
	   When a protest was levied in New York overnight to Kim Chang
Guk, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, he
merely repeated North Korea's usual criticism against Japan's
security arrangement with the United States, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   North Korea remained mute on the missile in its official news
being monitored by the Radiopress agency in Tokyo.
	   The Defense Agency said it will analyze any parts of the missile
retrieved by the dispatched military ships. Nonmilitary government
ships and plane were sent to the Sea of Japan where the first stage
of the missile was believed to have landed, government officials
said.
	   Defense tends to be a sensitive topic for many Japanese because
of the country's disastrous experience with militarism before and
during World War II. The pacifist movement is a powerful lobby
group in Japan, and the slightest sign of heightened military might
draws nervous protest from Asian neighbors.
	   That is partly why the missile defense system project has been
so slow in coming.
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the liberal Asahi newspaper warned
against any hasty action on the missile defense project, and
instead called for ``calm.'' The more conservative Yomiuri
newspaper, however, called for a prompt decision in favor of the
project.
	   The North Korean missile drew heightened concern from abroad as
well.
	   In Russia, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakmanin was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency that a ministry
official has been sent to North Korea ``for an explanation of the
incident.''
	   ``The circumstance that a North Korean missile, according to
some data, splashed down within the boundaries of Russia's economic
zone, gives rise to concern,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by
Itar-Tass.
	   Park Jie-won, South Korea's chief presidential spokesman, said,
``We strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop missile
development and join in international efforts to curb the spread of
the weapons.''
	   Russia's Interfax news agency reported that North Korea had
notified Moscow in advance of the firing, but Russian officials
were not aware of the missile's flight path. Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao denied a news report that China knew
of the missile test in advance.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the second day in a row, Japan's stock market
defied the example of Wall Street and nearly every other major
index in the world and closed sharply higher Tuesday.
	   But many analysts saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given
how wildly the stocks gyrated _ and some pointed at a temporary
intervention by government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who tried to
reassure Americans that despite the big fall on Wall Street Monday
the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, who recently urged world leaders to
hold a summit meeting to discuss the global market chaos.
	   Stock markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore opened sharply
lower Tuesday in reaction to Monday's 6.4 percent decline on the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
	   By the end of the day, Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index had
closed down 212.57 points, or 2.9 percent, at 7,062.47; and
Singapore's Straits Times Index had fallen 33.1 points, or 2.7
percent, to 823.37, a new 12-year low.
	   Europe's two biggest markets also opened lower.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by 135.6 points, or 2.6 percent, at 5,113.8, after a half hour of
trading. All of the year's remaining gains were wiped away in the
selloff. In Frankfurt, the blue chip Xetra DAX index was off by 2
percent at 4,713.77 in the midmorning.
	   However, it didn't take long for signs of recovery to emerge in
Japan, the world's second largest economy.
	   By midday Tuesday, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
had narrowed its loss to 1.27 percent, and by closing it stood at
14,369.63, up 261.74, or 1.86 percent.
	   The Nikkei also defied the odds of the world markets on Monday
when it finishing 1.38 percent higher.
	   But the index, which fell to a 12-year low on Friday, swung
wildly in a 700-point range Tuesday. And many analysts dismissed
this week's recovery as a short technical rebound, pointing out
that many of the major problems weighing on Japan's economy and
stocks remained in place.
	   ``Investors were frightened following the plunge on Wall Street,
but buying by government-linked pension funds and hedge funds put a
brake on the sell-off,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of
the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Ken Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said
Tuesday's rise was a temporary reprieve and that the Nikkei could
fall below 14,000 again if U.S. stocks weaken further.
	   ``The Japanese government is nowhere near solving the problems
with its indebted banks, so there is a big danger that we will see
the stock market fall even further,'' said Yoshio Inamura, a fund
manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi Asset Management.
	   On Monday, the Dow dropped 512.61 points to close at 7,539.07.
That brought the index, which had recently been enjoying an 18
percent gain on the year, down to a 4.7 percent annual loss. It
also could be moving toward its first bear market since 1990.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   To make matters worse, more bad news surfaced in Asia.
	   In Japan, the government sharply criticized Communist North
Korea for firing a long-range ballistic missile over Japan's main
island and into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
	   Like U.S. officials, the Japanese government sees the test as a
dangerous development for the volatile region's security.
	   In Hong Kong, investors found out that Standard and Poor's in
New York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's
ability to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   S and P cited the severity of Hong Kong's recession and the
government's recent round of intervention in the stock and stock
futures markets, which it called ``an increasingly complex and
risky strategy'' to defend the territory's currency.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves to prop up the stock market in a
two-week battle with speculators. On Monday, when the government
stopped its buying, the stock index plunged 7.1 percent.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government _
well-known for its criticism of free markets and its feuding with
Singapore _ took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors and hurt Singapore's
over-the-counter market, which is one of the biggest arenas for
trading Malaysian stocks outside the country.

Klaus' party owes thousands in back taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ An opposition party that was
forced out of power over a financing scandal late last year still
owes more than dlrs 75,000 in back taxes and fines, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said the Civic Democratic Party of
ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus failed to pay taxes properly over the past
three years and now owes the state some 2.5 million koruna (dlrs
76,000.)
	   Taxes were not paid on some financial donations made to the
party.
	   The daily quoted chief party manager Oldrich Vojir as saying the
party will pay the debt this month. The bulk of what the party owes
_ 2 million koruna _ is a fine for not paying taxes on time.
	   However, party officials dispute tax authorities' claims that
taxes were not paid properly,
	   ``It is not clear ... when money coming from a party member
should be considered dues and when it is a donation,'' deputy party
chairman Ivan Langer was quoted by Mlada Fronta Dnes as saying.
	   But Langer said his party will comply with the state's
interpretation.
	   Parliament is expected to discuss a new party finance law.
	   Klaus, who now is speaker of parliament, was forced to resign as
premier late last year after his party admitted having received
money from fake sponsors.
	   The party since has paid some 8 million koruna (dlrs 244,800) in
back taxes and fines.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs defied anti-riot police and
attacked Chinese-owned shops for a second day Tuesday in a northern
town where gangs tore down the gates of a prison, freeing dozens of
prisoners.
	   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled debris-strewn Lhokseumawe, a day
after crowds burned buildings, stoned military trucks and looted
stores. It was the biggest riot since deadly unrest in May helped
oust former President Suharto.
	   Most of the town of 600,000 was quiet Tuesday. But in the
business district, young men gathered to hurl rocks at shops
despite police warning shots and volleys of tear gas.
	   Some Chinese shopkeepers cowered inside their shuttered stores
as rioters pounded the doors, walls and windows with a hail of
stones.
	   ``I'm scared. But there are police and soldiers in front of the
shop,'' David Liong said by telephone from his gold jewelry
business. His terrified family fled the town earlier Tuesday.
	   The violence in Aceh province was triggered by bitterness toward
the military but ended up targeting Indonesia's Chinese minority, a
traditional scapegoat.
	   The Chinese are resented because they dominate business in
Indonesia, which is struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Ninety prisoners were on the run Tuesday after crowds raided a
prison the previous night, helping or forcing inmates to flee in
the darkness even though guards fired warning shots.
	   Thirty inmates who fled returned to jail voluntarily in the
company of their families or village heads, warden Kustopo said.
	   Trader Hajah Fatimah said police at times dispersed the crowds
in Tuesday's unrest, but the mobs soon drifted back.
	   ``It seems the young people aren't afraid of the police,'' she
said by telephone.
	   In two days of rioting, police have recorded only one injury, a
looter who fell down while trying to escape from officers.
	   Police Maj. Amrim Remico said authorities had briefly detained
at least 50 looters, recording their names and confiscating their
booty before sending them home. Looted items included tires, soap
and shampoo.
	   On Monday, rioters burned a hotel, a discotheque, beauty salons,
a ruling party office and part of a shopping center. Many
Chinese-owned stores were pelted with rocks and looters plundered
rice, sugar and other basic necessities.
	   The unrest in Lhokseumawe erupted after more than 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of atrocities there over the past decade. As they pulled
out, some spectators pelted their vehicles with stones.
	   After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok island fought rioters
who were protesting a new governor.
	   There are fears that despite democratic reforms, the strain that
Indonesia's economic crisis is putting on millions of poor people
could lead to bigger riots.

Armed man points gun at wife of U.S. diplomat, steals car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A man jumped into a car driven by
the wife of the top U.S. diplomat in Yugoslavia, pointed a gun at
her head and later stole the car, a Belgrade newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Dnevni Telegraf daily said Sharon Miles, wife of U.S. charge
d'affaires Richard Miles, was stopped at a traffic light Monday
afternoon in downtown Belgrade when the young man got into the BMW
she was driving.
	   The man pointed his gun at the back of Mrs. Miles' head and told
her in fluent English to drive out of the city center. He then
ordered her to stop, hand over the keys and get out of the car.
	   The man then drove away in the BMW, which had diplomatic license
plates, Dnevni Telegraf said.
	   Mrs. Miles called police from a nearby mechanic's shop.
	   The U.S. embassy in Belgrade confirmed Tuesday that Mrs. Miles'
car had been stolen and said she was uninjured in the theft.
	   An investigation is under way, the embassy said. No further
details were released.

Shares plunge after Hong Kong's credit rating slashed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks plunged further Tuesday on
news that a credit rating agency slashed the territory's status and
after sharp falls on global markets.
	   The government, which already has spent an estimated 15 percent
of its dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves, stayed on the sidelines
after its two-week stock buying spree in a battle against
speculators.
	   That absence contributed to the downward spiral, following
7.1-percent plunge in the key stock index Monday, analysts said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged 212.57 points, or 2.9
percent, to close at 7,062.47. It fell below 7,000 points at one
point.
	   Trading volume was worth 6.20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 795 million), compared with 6.57 billion Hong Kong dollars
(dlrs 842 million) Monday and Friday's record high of 78 billion
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion, when government
intervention reached its height.
	   On Monday, Standard and Poor's slashed Hong Kong's credit
rating, citing recent government intervention in the stock and
stock futures markets, which it said was ``an increasingly complex,
and risky, strategy'' to fend off speculators.
	   It said the government is likely to suffer huge losses in the
stock market with its massive accumulation of shares, ``unless the
downward trend in global equity prices is reversed.''
	   ``We will ask `will the government intervene?' If they do, we
will have a controlled market, and if that's the case, it would
deter future potential investors,'' said Steven Thompson, chief
banking and conglomerates analyst for Nikko Securities (Asia).
	   S and P also downgraded the credit rating of Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp., the territory's largest bank and a
subsidiary of the market's largest share, HSBC Holdings.
	   Another credit agency, Fitch IBCA, on Tuesday also downgraded
ratings for eight Hong Kong banks, including Hongkong and Shanghai
bank and another HSBC affiliate, Hang Seng Bank.
	   HSBC Holdings fell 6.0 Hong Kong dollars to 158.5, and Hang Seng
Bank was down 1.0 to 40.70. Among others, property giant Cheung
Kong Holdings lost 1.0 to 28.9, and conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa
lost 1.0 to 32.60.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 6.4 percent, or
512.61 points, to close at 7,539.07, suffering its second-largest
drop in points ever. The average has now erased all of 1998's
gains.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government on Tuesday defended recent
efforts to prop up stock prices, one day after a leading credit
agency downgraded the territory's debt rating and criticized the
intervention.
	   The government said in a statement that the intervention in
stock and stock futures markets was necessary to quash market
manipulation by speculators and restore market order.
	   The statement said the government has no intention to prop the
stock market to any particular level and only wants ``to ensure a
level playing field for market practitioners and to ensure the
efficiency of the markets.''
	   On Monday, Standard and Poor's in New York downgraded its rating
of the territory's creditworthiness by one notch, citing the
government's meddling in the markets.
	   On Tuesday, another rating agency, Fitch ICBA, cut the ratings
of eight Hong Kong banks, reflecting the growing impact of
``intensifying economic gloom'' in the local market.
	   S and P said the government intervention was ``an increasingly
complex, and risky strategy'' to fend off speculators, and the
government is likely to suffer huge losses with its massive
accumulation of shares ``unless the downward trend in global equity
prices is reversed.''
	   The agency also said the government is losing its financial
flexibility as many of the region's economies, including Hong Kong,
have slipped into recession.
	   But the government defended its move, saying the blue-chip
shares it has bought are ``all good quality assets which we will
hold for the long term.'' But it refused to disclose its portfolio
because the speculative attacks are still ongoing, the statement
said.
	   To drive up the market as a way to punish speculators who bet
the market would go down, the government has been buying shares
aggressively for two weeks. The intervention climaxed on Friday,
when analysts estimate the government spent U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion
buying shares.
	   Market players estimate the government has spent a total of
about 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves
propping up stock prices.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index has risen 1,200 points since the
government's intervention started, but it plunged 7.1 percent on
Monday when the government took a breather.
	   On Tuesday, the index plunged another 2.9 percent to close at
7,062.47 points.
	   Analysts say the battle is far from over, saying the government
cannot unload all its shares without triggering a market collapse.
Many expect another showdown with speculators soon.
	   Critics say the government is undermining its long-standing
hands-off policy, which is widely credited for its economic
success.
	   ``We will ask `will the government intervene?' If they do, we
will have a controlled market, and if that's the case, it would
deter future potential investors,'' said Steven Thompson, chief
banking and conglomerates analyst for Nikko Securities (Asia).

Malaysia announces sweeping currency controls

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Tuesday imposed
sweeping currency controls designed to fend off currency
speculators and shelter its embattled economy from the Asian
financial meltdown.
	   In what is seen as a last-ditch effort, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad announced the government would set a fixed exchange rate
for the currency and allow it to be traded only within the country.
	   Mahathir said there would be no value attached to the ringgit
outside Malaysia after Oct. 1. All Malaysian currency in banks
overseas will have to be brought back to the country by then.
	   ``It's a last resort measure,'' Mahathir said during a live
interview on state television.
	   The ringgit has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since the Asian contagion broke out in July 1997.
Malaysia went into formal recession last week as the government
announced that economic growth shrank by another 6.8 percent in the
second quarter of 1988.
	   The government hopes the curbs would bring more money into the
domestic market to boost growth. The steps are a reversal of a
policy that favored controlling the exchange rate by austerity
measures and a tight monetary policy.
	   These steps were advocated by the central bank and Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim; the central bank governor and his deputy
resigned last week and Anwar is currently out of favor.
	   After Mahathir's comments, central bank officials denied there
would be a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit. They said the
ringgit's level would be determined by the local currency market.
	   Foreigners who wish to convert ringgit into other currencies
will also need approval from the central bank, said Zeti Akhtar
Aziz, acting governor of Bank Negara.
	   Further measures include a ban on withdrawing foreign
investments in the stock markets for one year from the date the
money was put into shares.
	   ``The only way we can manage the economy is to insulate us from
the activities of currency traders and share market speculators,''
Mahathir said. ``The free-market system has failed, failed
disastrously because of abuses.''
	   Tuesday's curbs are a culmination of months of vitriolic
rhetoric against currency traders, a group Mahathir sees as the
culprits responsible for Malaysia's economic troubles.
	   Since the economic crisis set in, Mahathir has used every
speaking forum to attack currency traders, especially those in the
West. He has denied charges that weak economic fundamentals such as
a fragile banking system and lavish spending were responsible for
Malaysia's failed economy.
	   Travelers will not be allowed to take foreign currencies worth
more than 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,380) out of Malaysia within a
one-month period. There is no limit on how much foreign currency
can be brought into the Southeast Asian country.

Defense given until Oct. 25 to examine prosecution documents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Kenyan magistrate on Tuesday gave the
defense nearly two months to examine prosecution evidence in the
decade-old killing of British tourist Julie Ward.
	   Magistrate Uniter Kidullah ordered an adjournment in the case
until Oct. 25 so both she and the defense can examine three boxes
of documents presented to the court at Tuesday's hearing.
	   A game warden, Simon ole Makallah, was arrested more than a
month ago in connection with the slaying of the 28-year-old Ward,
whose mutilated and charred remains were discovered in in the
Maasai Mara National Reserve in September 1988.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals. Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for
her murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June
1992.
	   Police at that time were criticized for conducting a flawed
investigation.
	   At the court's Oct. 25 session, the magistrate is expected to
rule on whether to release Makallah or bring him before the high
court on murder charges.
	   Earlier, Kidullah has granted several prosecution requests for
more time to put a case together before formal charges are filed.
The defense, citing delays, sought to have the charges dismissed,
but the magistrate rejected the appeal.
	   Makallah, a senior warden in the Kenya Wildlife Service, was
arrested July 17. The following day, Attorney General Amos Wako,
flanked by Ward's father, John, said there was sufficient
circumstantial evidence to arraign him and hold a second trial.
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to bring his daughter's killers to
justice.

Singapore's main index dives, biggest plunge of the year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Severe currency and stock trading restrictions
announced by Malaysia sparked panic selling by foreign fund
investors and triggered the Singapore stock exchange's biggest
nosedive of the year Tuesday.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index crashed 5.5 percent to 811.02
just before last-minute bargain buying pushed the closing level
back up to 823.37. That was still a 12-year low and a 2.7-percent,
or 33.1-point, fall from the opening.
	   After falling to steadily new low levels for the past two
months, the benchmark index fell through the psychological barrier
of 900 last Friday and looked set to pierce 800 before the end of
the week.
	   The UOB OTC Index, which tracks the over-the-counter market of
mainly Malaysian shares, plunged 13 percent, or 32.19 points, to
222.57 as investors scrambled to unload their Malaysian holdings.
	   The Malaysian government announced Tuesday morning that the the
ringgit would have no value outside the country after Oct. 1, and
foreigners were immediately banned from exchanging the currency
without Central Bank permission.
	   That followed a Monday night announcement that banned trading on
shares of Malaysian-listed companies outside the country,
effectively shutting down Singapore's over-the-counter-trading that
deals mostly in Malaysian stocks.
	   The Singapore stock exchange had started falling within minutes
of opening on the bad overnight news of plunging U.S. and European
markets. But the fresh news from Malaysia seemed to open the
floodgates.

Supreme Court clears way for dismissal of Subic freeport chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court cleared
the way Tuesday for President Joseph Estrada to remove a major
freeport who has been fired but has refused to step down.
	   In a two-page resolution, the high tribunal said Richard Gordon,
ousted chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, failed to
present convincing arguments to overturn a lower court ruling last
Aug. 21.
	   Estrada has replaced Gordon with a top critic, Felicisimo
Payumo, but Gordon has refused to step down.
	   Gordon argues that he has a six-year term after he was
re-appointed in February by former President Fidel Ramos. He has
held the post since 1992.
	   Gordon's supporters barricaded the freeport's headquarters
building to prevent his ouster until police forced them out in a
clash that injured more than 100 people in July. Gordon and his
supporters then occupied another building.
	   Payumo set up an office at the local airport.
	   Gordon was unavailable for comment. He still has 15 days to make
a final appeal.
	   Payumo said he was happy about the court's decision and urged
Gordon to order his followers camped in the freeport to disperse.
	   ``We welcome the decision of the Supreme Court, as it vindicates
the rightness of our position all along,'' said Payumo. ``It is
either cowardice nor treason to Mr. Gordon's cause for his
followers to respect the majesty of the law.''
	   The dispute over the freeport's leadership has caused confusion
among investors, many of whom don't know who to deal with when
renewing business permits or paying fees.
	   Subic, a former U.S. naval base 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Manila, was converted into an industrial and tourism center after
the Americans left in 1992. It has since become the showcase of
Philippine economic growth.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the second day in a row, Japan's stock market
defied the example of Wall Street and nearly every other major
index in the world and closed sharply higher Tuesday.
	   But many analysts saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given
how wildly the stocks gyrated _ and some pointed at a temporary
intervention by government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who tried to
reassure Americans that despite the big fall on Wall Street Monday
the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, who recently urged world leaders to
hold a summit meeting to discuss the global market chaos.
	   Stock markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore opened sharply
lower Tuesday in reaction to Monday's 6.4 percent decline on the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
	   By the end of the day, Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index had
closed down 212.57 points, or 2.9 percent, at 7,062.47; and
Singapore's Straits Times Index had fallen 33.1 points, or 3.8
percent, to 823.37, a new 12-year low.
	   Europe's two biggest markets also opened lower.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by 135.6 points, or 2.6 percent, at 5,113.8, after a half hour of
trading. All of the year's remaining gains were wiped away in the
selloff. In Frankfurt, the blue chip Xetra DAX index was off by 2
percent at 4,713.77 in the midmorning.
	   However, it didn't take long for signs of recovery to emerge in
Japan, the world's second largest economy.
	   By midday Tuesday, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
had narrowed its loss to 1.27 percent, and by closing it stood at
14,369.63, up 261.74, or 1.86 percent.
	   The Nikkei also defied the odds of the world markets on Monday
when it finishing 1.38 percent higher.
	   But the index, which fell to a 12-year low on Friday, swung
wildly in a 700-point range Tuesday. And many analysts dismissed
this week's recovery as a short technical rebound, pointing out
that many of the major problems weighing on Japan's economy and
stocks remained in place.
	   ``Investors were frightened following the plunge on Wall Street,
but buying by government-linked pension funds and hedge funds put a
brake on the sell-off,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of
the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Ken Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said
Tuesday's rise was a temporary reprieve and that the Nikkei could
fall below 14,000 again if U.S. stocks weaken further.
	   ``The Japanese government is nowhere near solving the problems
with its indebted banks, so there is a big danger that we will see
the stock market fall even further,'' said Yoshio Inamura, a fund
manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi Asset Management.
	   On Monday, the Dow dropped 512.61 points to close at 7,539.07.
That brought the index, which had recently been enjoying an 18
percent gain on the year, down to a 4.7 percent annual loss. It
also could be moving toward its first bear market since 1990.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   To make matters worse, more bad news surfaced in Asia.
	   In Japan, the government sharply criticized Communist North
Korea for firing a long-range ballistic missile over Japan's main
island and into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
	   Like U.S. officials, the Japanese government sees the test as a
dangerous development for the volatile region's security.
	   In Hong Kong, investors found out that Standard and Poor's in
New York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's
ability to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   S and P cited the severity of Hong Kong's recession and the
government's recent round of intervention in the stock and stock
futures markets, which it called ``an increasingly complex and
risky strategy'' to defend the territory's currency.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves to prop up the stock market in a
two-week battle with speculators. On Monday, when the government
stopped its buying, the stock index plunged 7.1 percent.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government _
well-known for its criticism of free markets and its feuding with
Singapore _ took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors and hurt Singapore's
over-the-counter market, which is one of the biggest arenas for
trading Malaysian stocks outside the country.

Former Opera House designer to be consulted on changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Danish architect who designed the
Sydney Opera House is to be consulted over plans to improve
Australia's most famous building for performers, audiences and
staff.
	   The Sydney Opera House Trust on Tuesday pledged that any changes
to the Opera House would reflect the original vision of Joern
Utzon, who quit the project in 1966 and has not seen the building
since.
	   Living in Europe and too frail to travel to Australia, the
80-year-old Utzon would be consulted by phone over any changes, the
trust said.
	   While considered an architectural masterpiece, the 25-year-old
Opera House has been criticized for poor acoustics in the Concert
Hall and a lack of performance and backstage space in the Opera
Theater.
	   The trust also wants to improve disabled access to the Opera
House to try to fulfill Utzon's original plans, some of which had
not been realized when it opened in 1973.
	   The trust announced architectural firm Denton Corker Marshall,
which designed the Museum of Sydney and the Melbourne Exhibition
Center, had been commissioned to advise on changes to the building.
	   ``The challenge facing the trust is to safeguard the integrity
of Utzon's vision, while addressing a number of practical
limitations affecting the function of the building,'' said trust
chairman Joseph Skrzynski.
	   Utzon, who resigned as the building's architect in 1966 after
disputes over the project, would be consulted to ensure any changes
were consistent with his vision, Skrzynski said.

Rebels denied safe passage in western Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A group of rebel fighters trying to flee
western Congo have been refused safe passage by government and
allied forces in the region, a government official said Tuesday.
	   An unspecified number of rebels left behind after the withdrawal
of their forces are holed up near the town of Songololo, about 250
kilometers (150 miles) southwest of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``They will not be given safe passage until all Rwanda and
Uganda forces withdraw from the east,'' Deputy Interior Minister
Faustin Munene said on state radio. ``They are effectively
considered prisoners of war.''
	   President Laurent Kabila says Rwandan and Ugandan troops invaded
eastern Congo as part of a rebel uprising to topple the government
in Kinshasa.
	   The rebels still control several key cities in the east, but
have virtually abandoned their efforts to take the capital after
Kabila enlisted the support of Angolan and Zimbabwean troops in the
area.
	   The rebels, a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
members of Kabila's army, lost their last strongholds in western
Congo over the weekend when Angolan troops marched into the river
port town of Matadi.
	   Rwanda denies it has ground forces in Congo, but says it may
intervene in the country's month-old civil war to protect its vital
interests.
	   Uganda says it has troops inside Congo as part of a joint border
defense agreement and not in support of the rebels.
	   Although Kinshasa still was without electricity Tuesday, life
was slowly returning to normal after pitched battles on the eastern
and western outskirts last week left scores of bodies littered on
the streets and sent thousands of civilians into hiding.
	   In downtown Kinshasa, civilians and government troops went on a
rampage last week, lynching dozens of suspected rebels. Although an
exact number of summary executions was not available, more than 37
bodies have been spotted in recent days in various parts of the
city.
	   Troops continue to man checkpoints throughout the city, but more
traffic is venturing into the streets.
	   Having pushed back rebel gunmen that just weeks ago were poised
to capture Kinshasa, Kabila on Monday said the war's focus would
now turn to the east.
	   Kabila said his army along with Angolan and Zimbabwean troops
would launch offensives to recapture rebel-held cities in eastern
Congo, including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.

Former minister wins libel suit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - A former minister has won a libel
suit against a newspaper that accused him of being connected to a
gang of mercenary murderers, media reported Tuesday.
	   Under the court ruling Monday, former Czechoslovak Interior
Minister Petr Cermak is to be paid 1 million koruna (dlrs 30,000)
by the Pravo daily, the highest sum any media in the Czech Republic
has ever had to pay in compensation to a politician.
	   In February, Pravo wrote in a front page story that Cermak
provided a gang member with a letter of safe conduct to smuggle a
BMW car to Russia in 1993. At that time, Cermak was interior
minister.
	   The daily apologized 10 days later, stating that the story
contained incorrect information. Still, Cermak decided to sue the
daily for 30 million koruna (dlrs 917,000). The court ruled the
compensation be 30 times lower.
	   ``One million koruna is still an unusually (high) sum, but it's
also unusual that a journalist connects me or any other person with
a gang of murderers,'' the Mlada Fronta Dnes daily quoted Cermak as
saying after the court ruling.
	   Zdenek Porybny, editor in chief of Pravo, could not be reached
for comment Tuesday morning.

Cat lost during plane transit stop found _ three months later

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The mystery of the missing Ling has
been solved.
	   The eight-year-old Burmese cat disappeared from an airplane
during a transit stop in Bangkok nearly three months ago, leaving
his retired British naval officer owner inconsolable.
	   Now, Ling is about to be returned to Geoff Graham _ thanks to a
kindhearted Thai woman, high technology and a serious cash offer.
	   Roger Lohanan, manager of the Thai Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, said Tuesday that Graham had offered a reward
of 50,000 baht (dlrs 1,200) after the large, golden cat went
missing June 6 during a journey from Surabaya, Indonesia, to
London. His second cat, Dao, made it safely to Britain.
	   Thai newspapers gave wide publicity to the offer. Cat in hand,
some 25 hopefuls had applied for the reward, but none proved to be
the wayward feline.
	   Until Monday.
	   Vacharee Panjai was tearful when she brought the cat she called
``Sophia'' to the society's office, said Lohanan.
	   The 43-year-old housewife said she had become really attached to
the animal and if it hadn't been for the reward money, wouldn't
have given her up, Lohanan said.
	   ``Sophia'' proved to be Ling after his identity was checked
through an electronic scan of a microchip embedded under the cat's
skin several years ago.
	   Ling might have been winging his way home sooner had there not
been some confusion over his gender.
	   Vacharee had called the society soon after a friend from the
airport gave the cat to her, having found it near a runway.
	   Told the missing feline was a male, she gave the matter no more
thought, believing her cat was female.
	   The shocking truth was revealed last Friday, when she took the
animal to a veterinarian to be treated for falling fur, and learned
her cat was a castrated male.
	   The society said Tuesday it had kept secret the information
about the embedded microchip, the neutering, and a missing toe on
Ling's left hind leg, the better to make a positive identification
if and when he turned up.
	   A press release noted: ``We do not wish to end up having people
go around cutting off cat scrotums or cat toes in order to collect
the reward.''
	   Ling is under a veterinarian's care pending Graham's decision on
whether to come to Thailand to retrieve him or simply to fly him
back to Britain.

Wounded leaders, Yeltsin and Clinton, meet to prop each other up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS Yeltsin quotes, more details throughout; combines
previous and trims outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The politically wounded presidents of the United
States and Russia opened their uncertain summit Tuesday. Despite a
poor outlook for meaningful agreements, Boris Yeltsin declared
``Russian-American relations are developing successfully.''
	   Yeltsin tried to put the best face possible on his meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, greeting the American leader inside
the Kremlin with a bear hug and handshake in the presidential
study.
	   The first agreement to trickle out was a joint pledge to
eliminate some stockpiles of plutonium taken from dismantled
missile warheads.
	   ``Clinton and I know one another well, and we are friends,''
Yeltsin said earlier at a Moscow school.
	   With Russia reeling from a political and economic crisis,
Yeltsin formally welcomed Clinton outside the Kremlin after
wreath-laying at Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
	   At the start of their meeting, Yeltsin presented Clinton with a
loaf of salted bread, a traditional East European symbol of
welcome. Clinton pushed at the bread with the heel of his hand, and
it sprang back up.
	   ``Amazing, kind of like you,'' Clinton told his embattled host
	   Yeltsin also gave Clinton a replica of an American flag that a
U.S. delegation brought to Moscow 132 years ago. In Russian, he
quoted an Americans at that time as saying: ``I pray to God so that
those who will head our nations in the distant future still see the
light of friendship of our time.''
	   Republican Sen. Pete Domenici who flew here with Clinton, told a
reporter on Tuesday that the two presidents would sign on Wednesday
an agreement to get rid of about 50 metric tons of plutonium on
each side and break down the weapons material so it cannot be used
for military purposes.
	   ``We both have way more than we need,'' Domenici said.
	   A draft of the leaders' joint statement said the plutonium would
be withdrawn in stages, with financing arrangements to be set by
year's end.
	   ``Measures to manage and reduce such stockpiles are an essential
element of irreversible arms reduction efforts and necessary to
ensure that these materials do not become a proliferation risk,''
the draft said.
	   Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman, also part of the delegation
traveling with Clinton, sharply disagreed with critics who said
Clinton should have scrapped the summit.
	   ``It's very prudent,'' Bingaman said. ``The president needed to
come and there are important things to discuss between the two
countries.''
	   The welcome projected a business-as-usual air as the leaders'
meetings got underway.
	   Earlier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, acting prime minister, met Clinton
and his wife, Hillary, at the Moscow airport.
	   Yeltsin opened the day still focused on his domestic woes,
saying at a Moscow school that he would ``insist'' the parliament
reverse itself and accept Chernomyrdin's appointment. The body
overwhelmingly rejected his nomination on Monday.
	   Burdened with his own political and personal problems back home,
such as the Monica Lewinsky affair, and hoping to get a boost from
summiteering, Clinton pledged continued U.S. support for Russia as
long as its leaders ``stay on the path of reform'' and do not
revert to the communist ways of the past.
	   ``The Russian people are to be commended for embracing democracy
and getting rid of the old communist system, but they're having
some troubles today making the transition from communism to a
free-market economy,'' he said Monday before boarding Air Force One
for his flight here.
	   Once aboard, Clinton huddled with his foreign policy advisers.
	   Assessing the outlook, Sandy Berger, the president's assistant
for national security, said Yeltsin and his designated prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, are signaling they ``are not
prepared to deviate fundamentally from the reform'' that marked
Yeltsin's troubled years in the presidency.
	   And yet, Berger acknowledged, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin were
trying to build a consensus with the Russian parliament, which is
dominated by communists and nationalists.
	   On the eve of the summit, despite doomsday warnings that Russia
faces collapse, angry Russian lawmakers rejected Chernomyrdin,
blocking formation of a government to try to pull the country out
of its tailspin.
	   Russia has been without a government since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin
fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in the midst of an economic
crisis that has crippled the ruble and threatened to bring down the
country's banking and financial systems.

Negotiator: contacts with Israel go on, but no agreement yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite disagreements over a West
Bank troop withdrawal, Israel and the Palestinians have not broken
off their secret talks, a Palestinian negotiator said Tuesday.
	   U.S. mediators told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat earlier
this month he could not hope for high-profile U.S. involvement and
that the Palestinians must negotiate with Israel directly.
	   The low-key talks have been conducted by the speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, and Yitzhak Molcho,
an attorney and confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Qureia said Tuesday that many differences remained. ``There are
contacts, but there is no agreement,'' Qureia told The Associated
Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger Israel's security.
	   However, earlier this month, Israel for the first time agreed in
writing to a 13 percent pullback, with several conditions attached.
Excerpts from the document Molcho handed to Qureia were published
Monday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The document appeared to contradict assurances Netanyahu
reportedly gave to hardline Cabinet minister Limor Livnat last
month that Israel had not committed itself to 13 percent in
writing. Netanyahu aides were quoted as playing down the document,
saying it was an unsigned working paper.
	   A key sticking point is Israel's demand that 3 percent of the
land be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinians will not be
allowed to build. Overall control over security would remain in
Israeli hands.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that in the future they will take
full control of areas designated nature reserves. They also want
Palestinian police be able to operate in those areas.
	   The Palestinians also demand that Israel respond to all elements
of the U.S. initiative, including a requirement that Israel carry
out an additional pullback as it promised in an earlier
U.S.-sponsored agreement.
	   Israel says that withdrawal could be discussed at a later time,
but has made no reference to how the scope should be determined.
The United States proposed that the next withdrawal be discussed by
an Israeli-Palestinian committee.
	   In a sign of some U.S. involvement, CIA officials met recently
with Arafat's security chiefs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, to review understandings about
security cooperation and the Palestinians' war against terrorism
that were worked out in December.
	   The understandings _ negotiated at the time by Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. security officials _ specify, for example,
that the United States would have a say in whether Islamic
militants could be released from Palestinian jails.
	   The understandings were never put into practice because
Netanyahu refused to approve them, arguing at the time that Israel
should have a bigger role in monitoring Palestinian compliance.
	   Rajoub said Tuesday that the Palestinians would not agree to
changes in the document. ``It stands as it is,'' he said.

Malaysia announces sweeping currency controls

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Tuesday imposed
sweeping currency controls designed to fend off currency
speculators and shelter its embattled economy from the Asian
financial meltdown.
	   In what is seen as a last-ditch effort, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad announced the government would set a fixed exchange rate
for the currency and allow it to be traded only within the country.
	   Mahathir said there would be no value attached to the ringgit
outside Malaysia after Oct. 1. All Malaysian currency in banks
overseas will have to be brought back to the country by then.
	   ``It's a last resort measure,'' Mahathir said during a live
interview on state television.
	   The ringgit has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since the Asian contagion broke out in July 1997.
Malaysia went into formal recession last week as the government
announced that economic growth shrank by another 6.8 percent in the
second quarter of 1988.
	   The announced measures caused the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to
collapse late Tuesday afternoon. The benchmark index plunged 41.25
points, or 13.6 percent.
	   The government hopes the curbs would bring more money into the
domestic market to boost growth. The steps are a reversal of a
policy that favored controlling the exchange rate by austerity
measures and a tight monetary policy.
	   But analysts said Tuesday's moves marked a growing
disillusionment with the free market policies that a growing number
in Asia blame for their region's difficulties.
	   ``We may be seeing the beginning of the end of free traders in
the currency markets,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive
director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a private
think tank.
	   The steps were advocated by the central bank and Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim; the central bank governor and his deputy
resigned last week and Anwar is currently out of favor.
	   After Mahathir's comments, central bank officials denied there
would be a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit. They said the
ringgit's level would be determined by the local currency market.
	   Foreigners who wish to convert ringgit into other currencies
will also need approval from the central bank, said Zeti Akhtar
Aziz, acting governor of Bank Negara.
	   Further measures include a ban on withdrawing foreign
investments in the stock markets for one year from the date the
money was put into shares.
	   ``The only way we can manage the economy is to insulate us from
the activities of currency traders and share market speculators,''
Mahathir said. ``The free-market system has failed, failed
disastrously because of abuses.''
	   Tuesday's curbs are a culmination of months of vitriolic
rhetoric against currency traders, a group Mahathir sees as the
culprits responsible for Malaysia's economic troubles.
	   Since the economic crisis set in, Mahathir has used every
speaking forum to attack currency traders, especially those in the
West. He has denied charges that weak economic fundamentals such as
a fragile banking system and lavish spending were responsible for
Malaysia's failed economy.
	   Travelers will not be allowed to take foreign currencies worth
more than 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,380) out of Malaysia within a
one-month period. There is no limit on how much foreign currency
can be brought into the Southeast Asian country.

Protest by religious dissidents opens window into schism in Tibetan

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A silent protest march by about 150
religious dissidents Tuesday opened a window onto schisms in the
Tibetan exile society that was once seen as cohesive.
	   Believers in Dorje Shugden, a Tibetan deity whose worship was
banned by the Dalai Lama in 1996, took part in the march. They wore
white face masks to symbolize what they called attempts to silence
them.
	   Though Dorje Shugden Society members say they have no idea why
their deity was banned, the Dalai Lama believes the spirit of Dorje
Shugden is working against him, hampering his goal of seeking
autonomy for Tibet with minimal interference from Beijing.
	   ``We want the world to know that Tibetan society has problems.
There is religious repression,'' said Cheme Tsering, general
secretary of the society and spokesman for Tuesday's marchers.
	   Thubten Samphal, an official in the Dalai Lama's exile
government, denied the Tibetan religious and spiritual leader was
guilty of repression. He said the more than 100,000 Tibetans in
exile in India had a voice in regular elections for a council that
advised the Dalai Lama.
	   ``Tibetan society is not a monolith and dissent is inevitable,''
Samphal said, describing Dorje Shugden worshippers as a tiny
minority.
	   Tuesday's protesters, mostly monks but also some lay followers,
carried placards and banners reading, ``Stop your religious
intolerance and discrimination,'' and ``Don't make us victims.''
	   In literature distributed to journalists, the society said
Shugden worshippers were discriminated against, banned from jobs in
the Dalai Lama's administration and subjected to restrictions on
foreign travel. They said Tibetans are urged to inform on Shugden
worshippers within their families.
	   The literature also questioned whether the Dalai Lama was the
legitimate leader of the Tibetan people and included
unsubstantiated, inflammatory allegations that he was carrying on
business deals and was crushing alternative leadership within the
community.
	   ``These allegations are on the lips of every politically
conscious Tibetan,'' Tsering said.
	   Since he fled to India from Tibet after an abortive anti-China
uprising, the Dalai Lama has conducted a global campaign from
Dharmsala, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) north of New Delhi. He
accuses China of occupying his homeland, while China says Tibet is
its rightful province.
	   Shugden worshippers also question the Dalai Lama's decision to
dilute Tibet's claim for independence to just autonomy.
	   ``This Tibetan autonomy issue has not been decided by the
Tibetan people in a democratic way. It is just the Dalai Lama's
personal viewpoint,'' Tsering said.
	   Impatience with the Dalai Lama's peaceful, moderate approach
erupted earlier this year. A group of Tibetans demanding
independence went on a hunger strike in New Delhi despite pleas to
stop from the Dalai Lama, who said the fast was a violent act. Six
were forcibly hospitalized after living seven weeks on water and
lemon juice. A former monk protested the end of the strike by
setting himself on fire, and he later died.

Officials say only fines likely for `unsportsmanlike' match

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The results of a bizarre Tiger Cup match,
in which Indonesia deliberately lost by scoring on itself as time
was running out, apparently will be allowed to stand, organizers of
the eight-nation soccer tournament said Tuesday.
	   There had been calls for Indonesia and Thailand to be thrown out
of the competition after both tried to lose Monday night because a
victory would mean facing host Vietnam in the semifinals on
National Day.
	   But both Tiger Cup and FIFA officials said there is little they
can do while the competition is going on other than fine the teams,
give them a stern warning and consider more serious sanctions
afterward.
	   The semifinal between Indonesia and Vietnam, scheduled for
Wednesday, has been pushed back a day to provide time for the Tiger
Cup's disciplinary subcommittee to meet Tuesday night and make a
final decision.
	   The group includes the vice chairman of the Vietnam Football
Federation and all the Tiger Cup coaches except Indonesia and
Thailand.
	   ``I believe they would have to let the result stand,'' a FIFA
spokesman said by telephone from the Zurich headquarters of world
soccer's ruling body.
	   ``To kick the teams out would require a decision by the ASEAN
Football Federation, backed by the Asian Football Confederation.
Time wise, I don't think anything can be done in the next 24
hours.''
	   The maximum that either team can be fined is dlrs 40,000. That
means if either Indonesia or Thailand wins the dlrs 80,000 first
prize, they still would come out ahead. Second place is dlrs
40,000.
	   But more serious sanctions after the tournament would be
possible if it is determined that the teams ``brought the game into
disrepute.'' Those could include suspensions for a period of time
or from specific events.
	   Vietnam Football Federation President Mai Van Muon issued a
statement calling the match unsportsmanlike and saying the teams
showed contempt for the fans attending the match in Ho Chi Minh
City.
	   Muon said the organizing committee and the match supervisor
asked the coaches of both teams at the break _ after neither
mounted an attack in the first half _ to remind their players to be
active.
	   ``The players did not respect fair play,'' Muon wrote. ``It
badly affected the prestige of Southeast Asian football.''

	   The announced measures caused the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to
collapse late Tuesday afternoon. The benchmark index plunged 41.25
points, or 13.6 percent.
	   The government hopes the curbs would bring more money into the
domestic market to boost growth. The steps are a reversal of a
policy that favored controlling the exchange rate by austerity
measures and a tight monetary policy.
	   But analysts said Tuesday's moves marked a growing
disillusionment with the free market policies that a growing number
in Asia blame for their region's difficulties.
	   ``We may be seeing the beginning of the end of free traders in
the currency markets,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive
director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a private
think tank.
	   The steps were advocated by the central bank and Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim; the central bank governor and his deputy
resigned last week and Anwar is currently out of favor.
	   After Mahathir's comments, central bank officials denied there
would be a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit. They said the
ringgit's level would be determined by the local currency market.
	   Foreigners who wish to convert ringgit into other currencies
will also need approval from the central bank, said Zeti Akhtar
Aziz, acting governor of Bank Negara.
	   Further measures include a ban on withdrawing foreign
investments in the stock markets for one year from the date the
money was put into shares.
	   ``The only way we can manage the economy is to insulate us from
the activities of currency traders and share market speculators,''
Mahathir said. ``The free-market system has failed, failed
disastrously because of abuses.''
	   Tuesday's curbs are a culmination of months of vitriolic
rhetoric against currency traders, a group Mahathir sees as the
culprits responsible for Malaysia's economic troubles.
	   Since the economic crisis set in, Mahathir has used every
speaking forum to attack currency traders, especially those in the
West. He has denied charges that weak economic fundamentals such as
a fragile banking system and lavish spending were responsible for
Malaysia's failed economy.
	   Travelers will not be allowed to take foreign currencies worth
more than 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,380) out of Malaysia within a
one-month period. There is no limit on how much foreign currency
can be brought into the Southeast Asian country.

Negotiator: contacts with Israel go on, but no agreement yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite disagreements over a West
Bank troop withdrawal, Israeli and Palestinian officials have not
broken off secret talks, a Palestinian negotiator said Tuesday.
	   U.S. mediators told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat earlier
this month he could not hope for high-profile U.S. involvement and
that the Palestinians must negotiate with Israel directly.
	   The low-key talks have been conducted by the speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, and Yitzhak Molcho,
an attorney and confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Qureia said Tuesday that many differences remained. ``There are
contacts, but there is no agreement,'' Qureia told The Associated
Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger Israel's security.
	   However, earlier this month, Israel for the first time agreed in
writing to a 13 percent pullback, with several conditions attached.
Excerpts from the document Molcho handed to Qureia were published
Monday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The document appeared to contradict assurances Netanyahu
reportedly gave to hardline Cabinet minister Limor Livnat last
month that Israel had not committed itself to 13 percent in
writing. Netanyahu aides were quoted as playing down the document,
saying it was an unsigned working paper.
	   A key sticking point is Israel's demand that 3 percent of the
land be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinians will not be
allowed to build. Overall control over security would remain in
Israeli hands.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that in the future they will take
full control of areas designated as nature reserves. They also want
Palestinian police to be able to operate in those areas.
	   The Palestinians also demand that Israel respond to all elements
of the U.S. initiative, including a requirement that Israel carry
out an additional pullback as it promised in an earlier
U.S.-sponsored agreement.
	   Israel says that withdrawal could be discussed at a later time,
but has made no reference to how the scope should be determined.
The United States proposed that the next withdrawal be discussed by
an Israeli-Palestinian committee.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hillary Clinton, making her first public
appearance since her husband admitted an improper relationship with
a White House intern, took tea with Russian businesswomen and gave
a brief, firm response Tuesday when asked how she's been.
	   ``I've been getting along fine,'' she said to journalists,
emphasizing ``fine'' with a nod of her head.
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared jet lagged but otherwise happy to be
hobnobbing about Moscow with Naina Yeltsin, wife of Russian leader
Boris Yeltsin.
	   The two toured a private women's clothing factory and took part
in a discussion with women small business owners before setting off
for a tour of the Tretyakov Gallery, one of Moscow's premier art
museums.
	   Mrs. Clinton walked slowly through the brightly lit factory
floor, admiring designs hanging on dress models and watching the
blue-aproned women stitch and iron.
	   ``It's a very nice work environment,'' she said admiringly.
	   The visit was designed to highlight the work of women small
business owners, who in addition to the regular trials facing
entrepreneurs also must battle the sexism pervasive in Russian
society.
	   ``It's a pity that so many of our business owners are men,''
Mrs. Yeltsin said, noting that only 18 percent of Russian
businesses are owned by women. ``Men love to be in charge. I think
that's bad.''
	   The owner, Tatyana Nedzvetskaya, said it was a tremendous honor
and surprise that Mrs. Clinton chose to visit her factory. And she
was frank about the cost Russia's current crisis could have on her
business _ increased prices for fabric, maybe even some layoffs.
	   ``We'll hold out until the last minute, of course,'' she said,
but expressed optimism that the hardship may not come to that. ``We
have to smile and put up with it.''
	   Nedzvetskaya said she was struck by Mrs. Clinton's openness and
intelligence, and said it never even occurred to her to bring up
the scandal surrounding the U.S. president's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``What goes on behind the bedroom doors is nobody else's
business,'' she said. ``If you start asking that kind of question,
you have fascism, not democracy.''

Singapore's main index takes biggest plunge of the year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 2nd graf Tuesday's plunge is 3.8 percent

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Severe currency and stock trading restrictions
announced by next-door Malaysia sparked panic selling among foreign
fund investors in Singapore on Tuesday, sending the benchmark index
to its biggest loss of the year.
	   The Straits Times Index fell as much as 5.5 percent, to 811.02,
just before last minute bargain buying pushed the closing level
back up to 823.37. That was still a 12-year low and a 3.8 percent,
or 33.1 point, fall from the open.
	   After dropping steadily to new lows for the past two months, the
benchmark index fell through the psychological barrier of 900 last
Friday and looked set to pierce 800 before the end of the week.
	   The UOB OTC Index, which tracks the over-the-counter market of
mainly Malaysian shares, plunged 13 percent, or 32.19 points, to
222.57 as investors scrambled to off load their Malaysian holdings.
	   The Malaysian government announced Tuesday morning that the the
ringgit would have no value outside the country after Oct. 1, and
foreigners were immediately banned from exchanging the currency
without Central Bank permission.
	   That followed a Monday night announcement that prohibited
trading on shares of Malaysian-listed companies outside the
country, effectively shutting down the over-the-counter market in
Singapore.
	   The Singapore stock exchange had started falling within minutes
of opening, with the drops overnight by U.S. and European markets
also hurting investor sentiment. But the fresh news from Malaysia
seemed to open the floodgates.

Mexican president faces nation with great problems, reduced powers

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Crime is up, the peso is down and the peace
process in Chiapas is stagnant as President Ernesto Zedillo
presents his annual state of the union speech to Congress late
Tuesday.
	   Yet in tackling these problems, he lacks the tool his
predecessors took for granted: unquestioned power.
	   For most of the century, Mexican presidents _ for better or
worse _ could do pretty much as they pleased. The Institutional
Revolutionary Party had a virtual monopoly on power and Congress
acceded to the president's wishes. The government also largely
controlled the economy.
	   But the country opened up politically and economically in recent
years, including the election of the first opposition-led Congress
in 1997. And while Zedillo has taken pride in making Mexico more
democratic since he was elected to a six-year term in 1994, he's
also had to deal with the consequences.
	   His biggest battle these days is over the government's proposal
to assume the debts of the bank savings protection fund. The debts,
now worth about dlrs 55 billion, were generated after the 1994 peso
crisis. The government has argued the bailout is needed for the
nation's financial health.
	   Opposition parties have made the issue the nation's hottest
political debate. They want to know how the debt was generated and
whether taxpayers are being asked to pay debts generated by
millionaires.
	   The center-left Democratic Revolution Party organized an
informal referendum in which 95 percent of the 3 million
participants backed its rejection of Zedillo's proposal.
	   The opposition has also criticized the government's failure to
achieve a lasting peace with rebels from the Zapatista National
Liberation Army, which staged an uprising in 1994 in the name of
Indian rights and greater democracy. Talks have been stalled for a
year and tensions have been high in the southern state of Chiapas
between Zapatista sympathizers and supporters of the government.
	   Not all the new limits on Zedillo's power come from the
opposition. Global economic conditions beyond the government's
control seem to have an ever-greater effect on the country.
	   Falling international oil prices have hit Mexico hard, forcing
the government to cut spending three times this year.
	   With the worldwide turmoil in stock and currency markets, the
Mexican stock market has fallen to levels not seen since 1995,
including a 5 percent drop Monday. The peso has lost about 27
percent of its value over the past year, raising fears of
inflation. Interest rates have also risen, which could slow growth.
	   On Monday, the government canceled its auction of treasury bills
because, it said, the bids didn't reflect the real state of the
economy.
	   The Treasury ministry said the bids ``reflected the
extraordinary external volatility observed in recent days.''

Russian ruble trading still suspended, market falls in limited
</HEADLINE>
deals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Official trading in the ruble was suspended for a
fifth day Tuesday and the Russian stock market slid further amid
continuing political uncertainty.
	   The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange plans to resume fixing
the ruble's exchange rate against the dollar no later than
Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Official ruble trading has been suspended since last Wednesday,
when Russia's central bank admitted it was no longer able to
support the ruble amid heavy selling. It also stopped selling
dollars to commercial banks amid high demand for dollars.
	   The central bank on Monday lowered the official rate of the
ruble to 9.33 to the dollar, from 7.9 last week. That makes each
ruble worth 10.7 U.S. cents, down from the previous 12.7 cents.
	   Meanwhile, the acting government of Viktor Chernomyrdin
threatened to impose sanctions against commercial banks which delay
settling client payments, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
The action follows a pledge by Chernomyrdin that he would not allow
the Russian banking system to collapse.
	   In limited early trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange, leading
shares plunged again. The gas company Gazprom fell 10.3 percent in
the first few minutes, the power company Unified Energy Systems of
Russia was down 30 percent, the oil giant Lukoil slipped 11.1
percent and the energy firm Mosenergo dipped 15 percent.
	   In more bad news for Russian industry, the State Statistics
Committee said production of oil and gas condensate for the first
half of the year was down 0.3 percent from the year-earlier period.
Natural gas production rose 2.1 percent for the period, however.

Adams continues the war of words
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England defender Tony Adams' criticism of coach
Glenn Hoddle in his recently published book have created ``no
problems'' within the England team, the Football Association said
Tuesday.
	   In his book ``Addicted,'' currently being serialized in the Sun
newspaper, Adams accuses Hoddle of treating his World Cup players
like children.
	   Adams was in camp with Hoddle and the England team preparing for
Saturday's European Championship qualifier against Sweden in
Stockholm when the excerpts were published in the Sun.
	   The Arsenal captain's book is being released just weeks after
Hoddle's own World Cup diary, which was also serialized in the Sun
and sparked a massive controversy.
	   Hoddle was accused of betraying the confidences of his players
by revealing information about them in his account of the World Cup
campaign.
	   David Davies, FA director of public affairs _ also ghost writer
of Hoddle's book _ said Adams was ``perfectly entitled'' to express
his views.
	   He said Adams' book should be read in full and not in headlines
or single sentences.
	   The Sun reported that Adams believed he should have been
England's World Cup captain instead of Alan Shearer and that the
national coach humiliated David Beckham in front of the players.
	   Adams also suggested that Hoddle encouraged Paul Gascoigne to
drink the night before he axed him from the France 98 squad.
	   Davies released a statement Tuesday saying Adams' book will not
affect his international career.
	   ``Glenn and Tony have talked together. There is no problem
between them. Both are dedicated to England's next objective _
victory in Euro 2000,'' he said.
	   ``We are living in 1998, not 1939, and Tony has expressed his
honestly held views at particular times over the past year.
	   ``He is perfectly entitled to them.''

Philippine Airlines says its financial losses worsening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines, which has been
devastated by recent strikes, said Tuesday it lost 2.2 billion
pesos (dlrs 51 million) in the first quarter of the fiscal year
mainly due to the work stoppages.
	   PAL officials said a 22-day strike by its pilots in June dealt
the heaviest damage, canceling two-thirds of its flights and
causing revenue losses of about 200 million pesos (dlrs 4.6
million) a day.
	   The airline said its losses also rose due to soaring
dollar-denominated payments and continuing lease payments on unused
planes, which have not yet been returned.
	   In a financial report submitted to Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission, PAL said its liabilities increased to 26.67
billion pesos (dlrs 620 million) in the first quarter of the year
started April from 9.83 billion pesos (dlrs 229 million) in the
preceding quarter.
	   In the last fiscal year, the national flag carrier reported a
loss of 8.08 billion pesos (dlrs 188 million).
	   PAL is seeking to restructure its debts and has obtained
permission to suspend payments to domestic and international
creditors amounting to dlrs 2 billion while it prepares a
rehabilitation plan.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   The airline fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a
government return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than
13,000 workers to minimize its losses. It also halted an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion refleeting and modernization program.
	   The ground crew union went on strike last July but returned to
work after the company agreed to suspend for one month the
retrenchment of 1,800 of its members who were laid off.
	   The union has agreed on the need for retrenchments to save the
airline, and both sides accepted guidelines on how it should be
done.
	   PAL officials said the financial troubles of the 57-year-old air
carrier have brought it at the brink of closure.

U.N. rights chief will visit Tibet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Authorities have given the go-ahead to U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson to travel to Tibet during a forthcoming
visit to China, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Robinson will spend two days in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa,
meeting authorities and local officials. She will hold talks with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin upon her return to Beijing, said her
spokesman, Jose Diaz.
	   But there are no plans for Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights, to meet dissidents or prisoners either in Tibet
or elsewhere in China.
	   Given Chinese sensitivities over criticism of its rights record,
U.N. officials are anxious not to ruffle Beijing's feathers. It is
the first time the U.N. human rights chief has visited the country
_ and officials hope it will mark the start of a gradual process
toward improved cooperation and understanding.
	   Rather than high-profile visits to prisons or campaigns on
behalf of political detainees, Robinson will therefore give
priority to technical meetings with the foreign and justice
ministries. She will also meet representatives of women's groups
and U.N. agencies.
	   ``It is a big opportunity to engage in a serious dialogue on
human rights,'' said Diaz.
	   For years China has been condemned by the West and human rights
groups for suppressing dissent. In an attempt to blunt that
criticism, the government earlier this year said it would sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights _ meant to
guarantee individual liberties. It has also released some
well-known political prisoners.
	   Human rights organizations are particularly concerned about the
clampdown on the independence movement in Tibet. The Chinese seized
the mountainous territory in 1950 and have ruled it as a province
of China ever since.
	   Robinson arrives in China Sept. 6 for the week-long visit.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) - As heads of state began arriving
Tuesday for a summit of the nonaligned nations, rescue crews rushed
to evacuate a commercial airliner after smoke and sparks began
spewing from one of its engines.
	   A fire truck went to the South African Airways plane and escape
chutes were attached to aircraft. All 47 passengers and eight crew
then evacuated the Johannesburg-bound plane down the chutes without
injury.
	   SAA spokeswoman Zelda Schwalbach said the plane had started its
engine and was preparing to taxi down to the runway when a starter
mechanism in one engine failed. As black smoke billowed from the
engine, the pilot ordered an evacuation.
	   ``There was no actual fire, but the crew ordered everyone to
immediately leave the plane,'' she said.
	   The incident occurred as dozens of leaders from around the world
are touching down in Durban for the 12th Nonaligned Movement
summit. Journalists covering the arrivals of the dignitaries were
about 1 1/2 kilometers (1 miles) away from the plane and were kept
away from the site.
	   At the same time, a bomb scare caused the airport to be briefly
evacuated, Schwalbach said, but added that things were soon back to
normal.

Britain imposes firearm license checks agreed after Dunblane
</HEADLINE>
tragedy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Months after imposing a near-total ban on handguns
in response to the massacre of 16 pupils and their teacher, Britain
on Tuesday tightened checks on those applying for firearms
licenses.
	   Police now have the right to seek the full medical history of
all applicants, including details of any mental health problems.
	   Every applicant will have to provide police with the names of
two referees who have known them for at least two years and who
support their application.
	   Britain adopted some of the world's toughest gun laws after
disturbed loner Thomas Hamilton walked into a school in Dunblane,
Scotland, in March 1996 and opened fire with four legally owned
handguns.
	   Hamilton, who belonged to a local gun club, killed 16
kindergarten pupils and their teacher before taking his own life.
	   Weapons over .22 caliber were banned last year and a ban on
weapons of .22 caliber and below took effect on March 1.
	   Exceptions to the ban include pistols of antique and historical
interest, starting pistols, and shot pistols with very small
caliber charges that are used against rats, mice and other pests.
	   In his report into the shooting, Lord Cullen criticized the
rules then in place that enabled Hamilton to acquire and retain a
gun license, despite concern about his suitability.
	   Alun Michael, an official at the Home Office, which administers
gun control, said the new rules will give police enough information
to make an informed judgment on whether an applicant was suitable
to hold a firearm license.
	   ''Public safety remains our number one priority where firearms
licensing is concerned,'' he said.

New sign of impact of Russian crisis emerges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Financial markets in central Europe opened
mostly lower Tuesday while a Hungarian furniture company halted
imports to Russia in another sign of impact by the Russian economic
crisis.
	   Any further exports to Russia would require ``extraordinary''
circumstances, with payment guaranteed, said a statement by the
Hungarian company, Graboplast Rt. Up to 10 percent of its work
force of 3,161 could be cut by the end of the year because of the
situation, it said.
	   ``Graboplast will maintain this practice as long as there is no
visible improvement in the Russian economy,'' it said.
	   The announcement contributed to a 4.7 percent drop in share
prices on the Hungarian stock exchange in early trading. The forint
currency, propped up by two government interventions last week,
also weakened in early trading.
	   Zoltan Pacsi, managing director of the Budapest Stock Exchange,
said unpredictability would govern the market, adding that drops of
``several hundred points, as well as minor rises are possible.''
	   Regional leaders have insisted the persistent plunges in
currency values and share prices over the past two weeks were due
to an outdated perception that former Soviet satellites remained
economically integrated with Russia.
	   While Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic now trade mostly
with the European Union, sending less than 10 percent of exports to
Russia, they remain at some risk due to their proximity and
continuing trade ties.
	   Graboplast said its sales in Russia fell to dlrs 5.2 million in
the first half of this year, compared to dlrs 6.8 million over the
same period last year.
	   Traders and analysts warn continuing meltdown in Russia would
extend the volatility in central European markets, though the rush
by investors to sell assets to cover losses in Russia has slowed so
far this week.
	   In Poland, stock prices fell again after reaching a two-year low
Monday while the zloty currency rebounded from an early fall to
climb above the midpoint of its trading band with five Western
currencies.
	   The Czech koruna also was slightly stronger Tuesday morning in
quiet trading, with dealers saying uncertainty over the Russian
situation was holding down volume. But the Prague PX-50 stock index
showed a 2.2 percent decline in morning trade.
	   In Romania, the leu currency dropped slightly Tuesday morning,
and traders predicted government intervention if the fall
continued. The government sold dollars last week to bolster the leu
during the initial shock of the Russian crisis.

French president declares support for Ukraine's reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ France is determined to support Ukraine in
its efforts to maintain independence, develop democracy and promote
closer relations with other countries, French President Jacques
Chirac said.
	   Chirac is scheduled to arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday on the
first official visit by a French president to this former Soviet
republic.
	   Speaking in an interview to Ukrainian television on the eve of
his arrival to Kiev, Chirac said his visit aims at making new steps
to develop bilateral relations and showing Ukrainians that their
country ``has its own place in Europe.''
	   He said that Ukraine and France can cooperate in such sectors as
energy production, telecommunications, nuclear energy, space
research, food industry and others.
	   France has expressed interest in completion of Ukraine's AN-70
military transport plane, and the country's construction materials
giant Lafarge is interested in investing in the Ukrainian cement
industry.
	   Chirac said that during his meetings with President Leonid
Kuchma, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and Parliament Speaker
Oleksandr Tkachenko, he would discuss other possibilities for
channeling French investment to Ukraine.
	   During Chirac's three-day visit, meetings are also scheduled
between the two countries' foreign ministers, foreign trade
ministers and health ministers.
	   The sides are to sign four agreements, including pacts on
peaceful use of nuclear energy, nuclear safety and energy
cooperation, and cooperation between the Ukrainian and French law
enforcement bodies.
	   Turning to the financial crisis in Russia and its effects on
Ukraine, Chirac said Ukraine ``has to be very attentive and
continue reforms crucial for its stable development.''
	   ``I believe in the Ukrainian people, believe in its leaders and
believe in Ukraine,'' the French president said.
	   Chirac is scheduled to fly to the Moldovan capital Chisinau on
Friday after completing his visit to Ukraine.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, making her first public
appearance since her husband admitted an inappropriate relationship
with a White House intern, took tea with Russian businesswomen
Tuesday and gave a brief, firm response when asked how she's been.
	   ``I've been getting along fine,'' the first lady said to
journalists, emphasizing ``fine'' with a nod of her head.
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared jet-lagged but otherwise happy to be
hobnobbing about Moscow with Naina Yeltsin, wife of Russian leader
Boris Yeltsin.
	   The two toured a private women's clothing factory and took part
in a discussion with women small business owners before setting off
for a tour of the Tretyakov Gallery, one of Moscow's premier art
museums.
	   Mrs. Clinton walked slowly through the brightly lit factory
floor, admiring designs hanging on dress models and watching the
blue-aproned women stitch and iron.
	   ``It's a very nice work environment,'' she said.
	   The visit was designed to highlight the work of women business
owners, who in addition to the regular trials facing entrepreneurs,
also must battle the sexism pervasive in Russian society.
	   ``It's a pity that so many of our business owners are men,''
Mrs. Yeltsin said, noting that only 18 percent of Russian
businesses are owned by women. ``Men love to be in charge. I think
that's bad.''
	   The owner, Tatyana Nedzvetskaya, said it was a tremendous honor
and surprise that Mrs. Clinton chose to visit her factory. And she
was frank about the cost Russia's current crisis could have on her
business _ increased prices for fabric, maybe even some layoffs.
	   ``We'll hold out until the last minute, of course,'' she said,
but expressed optimism that the hardship may not come to that. ``We
have to smile and put up with it.''
	   Nedzvetskaya said she was struck by Mrs. Clinton's openness and
intelligence, and said it never occurred to her to bring up the
controversy surrounding President Bill Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``What goes on behind the bedroom doors is nobody else's
business,'' she said. ``If you start asking that kind of question,
you have fascism, not democracy.''

Hyundai workers reject layoff pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rank-and-file members of the Hyundai
Motor Co. labor union overruled their leadership Tuesday and voted
to reject a pact that would allow management to lay off workers.
	   The vote was largely a show of discontent by workers with their
leaders and has no legal effect on the layoff agreement struck a
week ago between South Korea's largest carmaker and union
officials.
	   Hard-line union members, however, began calling for the
resignation of the union leaders and threatened to organize new
strikes to prevent layoffs.
	   In Tuesday's vote, 26,000 unionized workers at Hyundai Motor
voted down the Aug. 24 agreement by a 2-to-1 margin.
	   After weeks of government-mediated negotiations, union leaders
and management reached a compromise Aug. 24 to dismiss 277 workers
in what both sides called ``a minimum level of layoffs.''
	   Before the deal, management had insisted on shedding 1,538
workers while the union had wanted no layoffs at all.
	   The compromised ended a 36-day strike at Hyundai Motor, but it
triggered angry protests by both business leaders and labor
activists.
	   By agreeing to a limited layoff, business leaders charged, the
Hyundai compromise raised questions about South Korea's ability to
ensure a flexible labor market, a key demand of the International
Monetary Fund, which organized a dlrs 58 billion bailout for the
country's battered economy in December.
	   Workers blasted the deal as a bad precedent. Hyundai was the
first major labor union to accept layoffs.
	   South Korea adopted a new labor law in February allowing
layoffs. But accustomed to lifetime employment, militant workers
have been fighting with a spate of strikes.
	   Hyundai and other South Korean conglomerates have sought to
reduce their work forces because of sharply falling sales at home
and abroad.
	   Hyundai Motor has been operating at 40 percent of its annual
capacity of 1.65 million units. It had shed 6,100 workers earlier
this year through early retirements.

Police press charges against ultranationalist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Police requested Tuesday that charges be
filed against ultranationalist party leaders who recently burned
copies of an independent daily and protested U.S. policy in the
Balkans.
	   If prosecuted and found guilty of disturbing public peace and
order, two leaders of the New Croatian Rightists could face a
maximum fine equivalent to dlrs 180, or be imprisoned for up to 30
days.
	   The party has only a handful of members and no political
influence, but frequently provokes incidents. It regularly pays
tribute to Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state and often
denounces ``Western values.''
	   Saturday, several party members burned copies of the privately
owned daily Jutarnji list. Party members say the paper is
anti-Croat because it is critical of the government.
	   They also claimed that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who visited Zagreb on Sunday, is an ``enemy'' of Croatia.
	   The protest was held in Zagreb's main square. Police were on
hand but did not intervene.
	   A Croatian law prohibits and punishes the spreading of national
and racial hatred, but so far the group has not been prosecuted on
those grounds.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party was
officially named the winner Tuesday of the July 26 parliamentary
elections, a day after Cambodia's highest appeals body dismissed
opposition complaints of electoral fraud.
	   The mood at a nine-day protest against Hun Sen in a park
opposite the National Assembly was somber. The crowd, which at
times has exceeded 10,000 during protests unprecedented in size or
duration, fell to 500.
	   According to the results, which mirrored a preliminary tally
issued three weeks ago, the Cambodian People's Party won 41.42
percent of the vote, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC 31.70 and
its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, 14.27.
	   Under a formula the opposition says was never legally approved,
that translates into 64 seats for Hun Sen in the National Assembly
against 58 for the opposition _ still short of the two-thirds
majority the CPP needs to form a government alone.
	   Chheng Phon, chairman of the National Election Committee, said
in a speech to be aired on state-run television that ``the will of
93 percent of voters shows to foreigners that Cambodians want
democracy and independence.''
	   The results _ while no surprise _ came as a blow to the
opposition which has been staging a round-the-clock protest against
Hun Sen and alleged election fraud. Demonstrators have turned the
small park they call ``Democracy Square'' in front of the assembly
into a tent city.
	   They accuse Hun Sen of resorting to intimidation and killings in
the run-up to the polls and allege widespread cheating in the
tallying of ballots to ensure victory for the CPP.
	   International observers have given the election a largely
credible bill of health, but critics noticed that they looked
primarily at only the voting day and the initial counting. The
tally ultimately took 10 days.
	   The Asian Network for Free and Fair Elections, which performed
one of the most thorough jobs among the observer groups, urged the
international community Monday to reconsider its verdict until the
election problems are properly considered.
	   ``Short of this, ANFREL believes that the results will not be
credible and will not reflect the will of the people,'' the network
said.
	   The official results were released one day after the
Constitutional Council, which is stacked with Hun Sen's supporters,
rejected all the opposition's complaints about fraud.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-prime minister in a bloody coup. More than 100 of the
prince's supporters were killed in the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new polls would help him win back lost
legitimacy and aid.
	   Though Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have threatened to boycott the
assembly if their concerns were not addressed, they are now hinting
they will take part and use their power to freeze the government.
	   Hun Sen has asked both parties to form a coalition, but they
have so far refused. It remains to be seen if he will succeed in
buying off opposition members to win two-thirds majority control.

Parts of Sydney given approval to stop boiling water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Some Sydney suburbs received a clean
bill of health on their tap water Tuesday but residents in other
areas remained under orders to boil water as a contamination crisis
continued.
	   More than 250,000 of the city's 3.7 million residents were given
the go-ahead to stop boiling their tap water on Tuesday.
	   But the rest of Sydney was still being asked to boil all tap
drinking water for one minute, while those given the all-clear were
told to run their taps for two minutes if they had not been used
every day.
	   The water scare is the second time in four weeks that Sydney
residents have had to boil their water due to contamination by the
parasites giardia and cryptosporidium.
	   On Wednesday, Sydney Water customers will learn how much of a
rebate they could receive for being forced to boil their drinking
water during the two parasite contamination scares.
	   New South Wales Health director-general Michael Reid said he
hoped to give the all-clear to more suburbs in the next couple of
days as suburban testing continued.

Mahathir: Would accept deputy's resignation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: STANDS for BC-Malaysia-Mahathir on digest
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Economy
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Is Malaysia's finance minister
staying or quitting?
	   The festering question wasn't settled even on Tuesday when Prime
Mahathir Mohamad ambiguously confirmed that Anwar Ibrahim, who is
also the deputy prime minister, still held office _ for now.
	   ``There is no truth until it becomes a truth,'' Mahathir told
reporters after he announced sweeping measures to curb currency
fluctuations.
	   Mahathir said during Tuesday's extraordinary Cabinet meeting to
discuss the economy that he had not asked Anwar to resign. Neither
had Anwar offered to do so.
	   But he said that he would not reject the resignation of his
deputy, who until recently was seen as an automatic heir to the
prime minister's post.
	   ``If he gives a good reason why he wants to resign, I have to
accept,'' Mahathir said. ``If he says, `It's health reasons, I
cannot breathe anymore,' how do I say you have to continue
breathing? It all depends upon the reasons.''
	   There may be many reasons for Anwar to resign, observers say.
The central bank governor and his deputy resigned on Thursday over
policy differences with Mahathir.
	   The 51-year-old finance minister has been sidelined in economic
decisions after he differed with his boss on the course for
economic recovery.
	   Anwar and the central bank had preferred high interest rates and
austerity measures to control Malaysia's sliding currency, the
ringgit. Mahathir and his chief economic aide have pushed through a
policy of greater government spending and lower rates to boost the
economy, which has slipped into recession after nearly a decade of
high growth.
	   Many of the measures announced Tuesday did not have Anwar's seal
on them and the finance minister has yet to comment on the drastic
measures.
	   Anwar was seen by many as being in the forefront of a campaign
for political reform when the governing United Malays National
Organization held its annual convention in July. Mahathir
immediately crushed the campaign against nepotism and cronyism at
high government levels.
	   In recent weeks, Anwar has been embarrassed by accusations of
sexual misconduct contained in a book. The authors of the book
entitled, ``50 reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be Prime Minister'' are
being tried in a court for defamation.
	   On Monday, Anwar once again denied he was quitting. ``I have
also heard such talk many times but it is not true,'' he told
reporters.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the second day in a row, Japan's stock market
defied the example of Wall Street and nearly every other major
index in the world and closed sharply higher Tuesday. But many
analysts saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given how wildly the
stocks gyrated _ and some pointed at a temporary intervention by
government-linked pension funds. Stock markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong
and Singapore opened sharply lower Tuesday in reaction to Monday's
6.4 percent decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. By the end
of the day, Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index had closed down
212.57 points, or 2.9 percent, at 7,062.47; and Singapore's Straits
Times Index had fallen 33.1 points, or 3.8 percent, to 823.37, a
new 12-year low. Europe's two biggest markets also opened lower.
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by
135.6 points, or 2.6 percent, at 5,113.8, after a half hour of
trading. All of the year's remaining gains were wiped away in the
selloff. In Frankfurt, the blue chip Xetra DAX index was off by 2
percent at 4,713.77 in the midmorning. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Official trading in the ruble was suspended for a
fifth day Tuesday and the Russian stock market slid further amid
continuing political uncertainty. The Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange plans to resume fixing the ruble's exchange rate against
the dollar no later than Thursday, the Interfax news agency
reported. Official ruble trading has been suspended since last
Wednesday, when Russia's central bank admitted it was no longer
able to support the ruble amid heavy selling. It also stopped
selling dollars to commercial banks amid high demand for dollars.
The central bank on Monday lowered the official rate of the ruble
to 9.33 to the dollar, from 7.9 last week. That makes each ruble
worth 10.7 U.S. cents, down from the previous 12.7 cents. (RUSSIA
MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world's first vaccine against the leading
cause of childhood diarrhea _ a virus that hospitalizes 55,000
American children each year and kills 1 million in other countries
_ has won approval by the U.S. government. Widespread vaccination
with RotaShield could prevent children from getting diarrhea caused
by the intestinal infection rotavirus, said manufacturer
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which is selling the vaccine created by
the U.S. National Institutes of Health. In developing countries,
experts say the vaccine could save thousands of children's lives _
if other countries also approve the drug and can afford to buy it.
Wyeth will sell RotaShield for dlrs 38 a dose in the United States,
but declined to say how much it would charge in poorer countries.
The scientist who invented the drug said Wyeth officials have
promised him they'll somehow get the vaccine to developing
countries, probably by using profits from rich countries to
subsidize poor ones. (MED-US-DIARRHEA VACCINE)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An international auction has failed to
find a buyer for bankrupt Kia Motor Co. because bidders demanded
more of the carmaker's huge debt be written off, officials said
Tuesday. Kia president Lee Jong-dae did not reveal the schedule for
a second bidding, but he added Kia's creditor banks will discuss
whether to write off more of Kia's debt. In mid-August, Ford Motor
Co. and three South Korean carmakers _ Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo
Motor Co. and Samsung Motors, Inc. _ submitted bids for Kia, South
Korea's second largest auto maker before its collapse last year.
The bidders demanded that creditors write off more of the combined
dlrs 12.8 trillion won (dlrs 9.5 billion) of Kia and its commercial
vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp. Two of the bidders, Ford and
Hyundai, also submitted bids below the minimum price set by the
creditors _ 5,000 won (dlrs 3.7) per share. Kia and Asia have 7.7
trillion won (dlrs 5.7 billion) in assets. (SKOREA-KIA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Tuesday imposed
sweeping currency controls designed to fend off currency
speculators and shelter its embattled economy from the Asian
financial meltdown. In what is seen as a last-ditch effort, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the government would set a
fixed exchange rate for the currency and allow it to be traded only
within the country. Mahathir said there would be no value attached
to the ringgit outside Malaysia after Oct. 1. ``It's a last resort
measure,'' Mahathir said. The ringgit has lost nearly 40 percent of
its value against the U.S. dollar since the Asian contagion broke
out in July 1997. Malaysia went into formal recession last week as
the government announced that economic growth shrank by another 6.8
percent in the second quarter of 1988. The announced measures
caused the main index on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to plunge
41.25 points, or 13.6 percent. (MALAYSIA-ECONOMY)

Mobs stone shops for a second day in Indonesian town, two killed

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two people killed, witnesses saying shot by

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shouting separatist slogans,
stone-throwing mobs attacked Chinese-owned shops for a second day
Tuesday in northern Indonesia. Riot officers shot and killed two
people, residents said.
	   Dozens of prisoners, meanwhile, were on the run after crowds
raided a prison Monday in Lhokseumawe in the biggest riots since
deadly unrest in May helped oust former President Suharto. Mobs
burned buildings and stoned military trucks. Even children looted
stores.
	   Two people died when security forces fired at young men who were
hurling rocks, said residents who requested anonymity.
	   Police Maj. Amrin Remico said a 14-year-old boy and a
27-year-old man died. But he did not confirm that police shot them.
	   The rioting Tuesday was largely confined to the business
district in Lhokseumawe. But there was scattered looting in
villages on the outskirts of the town in Aceh province, on the
northern tip of Sumatra island.
	   Some rioters shouted ``Free Aceh'' in anger at the Indonesian
military, which is accused of atrocities during a campaign against
Islamic separatist rebels in the province.
	   The violence in Aceh province was triggered by bitterness toward
the armed forces but ended up targeting Indonesia's Chinese
minority, a traditional scapegoat.
	   Some Chinese shopkeepers cowered inside their shuttered stores
as rioters pounded the doors, walls and windows with a hail of
stones.
	   ``I'm scared. But there are police and soldiers in front of the
shop,'' David Liong said by telephone from his gold jewelry
business. His terrified family fled Lhokseumawe earlier Tuesday.
	   The Chinese are resented because they dominate business in
Indonesia, which is struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Ninety prisoners were on the run Tuesday after crowds raided a
prison the previous night, helping or forcing inmates to flee in
the darkness even though guards fired warning shots.
	   Thirty inmates who fled returned to jail voluntarily in the
company of their families or village heads, warden Kustopo said.
	   Trader Hajah Fatimah said police at times dispersed the rioters,
but the mobs soon drifted back.
	   ``It seems the young people aren't afraid of the police,'' she
said by telephone.
	   Police said they had briefly detained at least 50 looters,
recording their names and confiscating their booty before sending
them home. Looted items included tires, soap and shampoo.
	   On Monday, rioters burned a hotel, a discotheque, beauty salons,
a ruling party office and part of a shopping center. Many
Chinese-owned stores were pelted with rocks and looters plundered
rice, sugar and other basic necessities.
	   The unrest in Lhokseumawe erupted after more than 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of atrocities there over the past decade. As they pulled
out after a ceremony, some spectators pelted their vehicles with
stones.
	   After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok island fought rioters
who were protesting a new governor.
	   There are fears that despite democratic reforms, the strain that
Indonesia's economic crisis is putting on millions of poor people
could lead to bigger riots.

Chirac awards French soccer team Legion of Honor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thanking France's soccer heroes for the ``immense
happiness'' of their World Cup victory, President Jacques Chirac on
Tuesday awarded them one of France's top honors, the Legion of
Honor.
	   ``Thank you for the unique moment that you created,'' Chirac
said as he decorated the 22 players, their coach and other team
staff.
	   ``Les Bleus'' beat Brazil at the Stade de France to win the
World Cup on July 12, giving France its first-ever World Cup
victory. The home team's surprise win touched off unprecedented
celebrations across the nation.
	   In addition to the 22 players in the squad, Chirac gave the
honor to Aime Jacquet, the coach that guided France to victory; the
team's coaching and medical staff; Michel Platini, co-president of
the World Cup organizing committee; French Football League
president Noel Le Graet; and French Football Federation president
Claude Simonet.
	   ``When France has confidence it progresses, it scores points, it
wins,'' Chirac said. ``You are champions because of a triumph of
will, continuity, intelligence and discipline.''

Burundi leader says his country not involved in Congo conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Burundi President Pierre Buyoya said
Tuesday his country was not involved in the civil war in
neighboring Congo, and said Burundi would be willing to mediate
talks between warring parties.
	   ``Our country ... is not implicated in this conflict,'' Buyoya
told reporters in the Kenyan capital. ``The only resolution to the
problem is a peaceful one, one of dialogue, negotiation.''
	   Congolese rebels, consisting of ethnic Tutsis and other
disgruntled Congolese, launched the war in late July. They were
said to be backed by Rwanda and Uganda, who only 15 months ago had
helped President Laurent Kabila take power from dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda have denied full involvement in the Congo
war. But they warned that if their own interests in eastern Congo
are threatened _ in the form of operations by their own rebels
there _ they would intervene.
	   Meanwhile, Buyoya, who was on his way to the Nonaligned
Movement's summit in South Africa, said he would raise his
longstanding demand that Burundi's neighbors drop economic
sanctions against it, whose effect he described as devastating.
	   ``This is our main preoccupation today,'' Buyoya said. ``Of
course we will bring up the embargo problem.''
	   Backed by Burundi's Tutsi military, Buyoya, a retired army major
and a Tutsi himself, took power from a weak coalition government in
a bloodless coup July 25, 1996, asserting he was the only one who
bring an end to ethnic bloodshed.
	   Less than a week later, Burundi's neighbors slapped economic and
transport sanctions on the tiny central African country to force
Buyoya to restore representative institutions and sit down to talks
with Hutu rebels. Hutus, as in Rwanda, make up 85 percent of
Burundi's population.
	   Buyoya insisted he had complied with the conditions for lifting
the sanctions by enlarging parliament, holding a national debate on
the country's future, and participating in two rounds of all-party
peace talks in neighboring Tanzania.
	   ``All the requirements have been complied with,'' Buyoya said.
``To explain maintaining the sanctions today _ I don't know of any
reason whatsoever.''
	   In Burundi, attacks by Hutu rebels and counterattacks by the
Tutsi military have claimed more than 200,000 lives since the
assassination of elected Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye in October
1993.
	   Buyoya acknowledged Tuesday that killings were continuing.
``Such a catastrophic situation does not get resolved overnight,''
he said.
	   But the president, who has written a book titled ``Mission
Possible,'' said he believed an easing of ethnic violence could be
achieved.
	   All parties at the Burundi peace talks in Tanzania agreed in
June to a cease-fire beginning in July, but dozens of deaths have
since been reported in clashes.

Chirac awards French soccer team Legion of Honor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thanking France's soccer heroes for the ``immense
happiness'' of their World Cup victory, President Jacques Chirac on
Tuesday awarded them one of France's top honors, the Legion of
Honor.
	   ``Thank you for the unique moment that you created,'' Chirac
said as he decorated the 22 players, their coach and other team
staff.
	   ``Les Bleus'' beat Brazil at the Stade de France to win the
World Cup on July 12, giving France its first-ever World Cup
victory. The home team's surprise win touched off unprecedented
celebrations across the nation.
	   In addition to the 22 players in the squad, Chirac gave the
honor to Aime Jacquet, the coach that guided France to victory; the
team's coaching and medical staff; Michel Platini, co-president of
the World Cup organizing committee; French Football League
president Noel Le Graet; and French Football Federation president
Claude Simonet.
	   ``When France has confidence it progresses, it scores points, it
wins,'' Chirac said. ``You are champions because of a triumph of
will, continuity, intelligence and discipline.''

Iran begins military exercises with parade near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran began wide-scale military exercises
Tuesday with a parade near the border with Afghanistan, where
Tehran claims that the Taliban militia is holding 47 Iranians.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers kicked off the maneuvers,
codenamed Ashura 3, with a parade in Torbat-e Jam in northeastern
Khorasan province.
	   The actual exercises are to begin Wednesday, and ground and air
troops from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the
volunteer Basij Resistance Forces will take part.
	   The three-day maneuvers, the largest this year, are the first
near the border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. They are named
``Ashura'' for the holiday marking the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's
most revered figure, Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Mohammed.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. The detainees include 11
diplomats, one journalist and 35 truck drivers.
	   A senior military official was quoted as saying Tuesday that the
aim of the exercises was to test new weapons and strengthen Iran's
defensive capabilities.
	   ``The military exercises are not aimed for any invasion of
neighboring Afghanistan,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Brig. Gen. Hussein Salami as saying.
	   However, on Saturday, Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, the
commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said that the maneuvers were
related to the crisis in Afghanistan.
	   Although the Taliban has said it knows nothing about the Iranian
diplomats, IRNA on Monday quoted a close aide to Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar as saying the diplomats and the journalist
were being held in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
	   However, the British Broadcasting Corporation quoted Omar as
saying Monday that the diplomats may have been killed in a raid on
the Iranian Embassy when the Taliban captured Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Neither of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   The Taliban has said it was holding some 30 Iranians suspected
of arming its opponents.
	   Last week, Revolutionary Guards were deployed on the border with
Afghanistan to monitor the movement of forces fighting the civil
war there.
	   Also last week, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned that
Iran might resort to force to free the Iranians.
	   On Sunday, A member of the Iranian Parliament said that the
Taliban had killed the diplomats after storming Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said in remarks
published Tuesday that the diplomats were alive and earlier reports
were wrong.
	   The Revolutionary Guard is an elite paramilitary fighting force
of about 120,000 ground, air and navy personnel.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban. Iran is suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.

Philippine central bank to allow banks to sell more U.S. dollars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine central bank said
Tuesday it will allow local banks to sell more dollars in the
currency market to ease a continuing depreciation of the peso.
	   The central bank's monetary board said a higher limit on the
amount of dollars banks can sell will be announced this week.
	   At present, Philippine banks are allowed to sell dollars
equivalent to 20 percent of their capital daily.
	   Teodoro Montecillo, a member of the monetary board, said the
local currency continues to be battered by political uncertainty in
Russia, volatility of the Japanese yen and fears of a devaluation
of the Chinese currency, the yuan.
	   The peso has lost about 40 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since a panicked selloff of it and other Asian currencies
triggered Asia's economic crisis last year.

Spanish police seize 4 million dollars' worth of hashish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUELVA, Spain (AP)_ Police in southern Spain said Tuesday they
had seized 2,340 kilos (5,140 pounds) of hashish with a street
value of dlrs 4 million.
	   Police made the seizure before dawn from a leisure boat about
three miles from the coast of Huelva. Authorities arrested three
men aged between 28 and 40.
	   Police said the suspects apparently worked for a drug
trafficking ring active in the area.
	   Authorities did not say where the boat had left from.
	   The southern Spanish coast is a popular entry point for drug
smugglers coming into Europe from Africa. The crossing between
Africa and Spain is as narrow as 15 kilometers (9 miles) at some
points.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 114 people have died of
dengue fever and over 7,750 other sufferers have been hospitalized
in the Philippines in the first eight months this year, the
Department of Health said Tuesday.
	   The department statement said more cases are expected due to the

	   Dengue is endemic to the Philippines.
	   A nationwide campaign that included emptying stagnant water from
old tires, trash cans and even flower pots began in August.

England names Ashes squad in wake of 10-wicket loss to Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England cricket selectors have purged spin-bowlers
Ian Salisbury and Ashley Giles in favor of veteran Peter Such for
the Ashes tour to Australia starting in October.
	   The 17-man England Ashes squad, announced Tuesday in the wake of
a humiliating 10-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka at the Oval, where
off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan took 16 for 220, contains two
spinners and one all-rounder.
	   Such, the 34-year-old who played the last of his eight tests in
1994, was picked to partner Robert Croft after Salisbury and Giles
managed to take just two wickets in six tests over the summer.
	   Such took six for 67 on debut against Australia at Old Trafford
n 1993 but has not played a test for four years and was the
surprise selection in the squad.
	   The England selectors have been desperate to find an effective
spin-bowling combination to counter the impact of Australia's Shane
Warne, who has destroyed England in the last two Ashes series.
	   But in the process, England's spin-bowling stocks have been
almost nullified while its batsmen have proved susceptible to spin
bowling.
	   Ben Hollioake was selected as the sole all-rounder in the squad
ahead of 20-year-old Andrew Flintoff, who made his test debut in
England's fourth test victory against South Africa this summer.
	   Wicketkeeper Alec Stewart, who steered England to its first
major series win in 12 years in his first series as captain against
South Africa this summer, will lead his first Ashes campaign.
	   The selectors chose seven batsman, including regulars Mike
Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Mark Ramprakash and Graham
Thorpe.
	   Graeme Hick was the unlucky ommission after scoring a century in
England's first innings against Sri Lanka.
	   Hick, who also scored two half-centuries in the recent
limited-overs international series after failing in two tests
against South Africa, was dropped in favor of John Crawley, who
also scored a century against Sri Lanka.
	   Seam bowler Dean Headley, overlooked since England's defeat by
South Africa at Lord's earlier this summer, has been selected on
the basis of his success against the Australian left handers in
last season's Ashes series.
	   Headley will compete with Alan Mullally and test regulars Darren
Gough, Dominic Cork and Angus Fraser for a Test place.
	   Emerging Surrey fast bowler Alex Tudor, who suffered the
ignominy of being hit for 34 runs in one over during a domestic
game earlier this summer, was also selected in the squad, where he
is expected to work with specialist pace bowling coach Bob Cottam.
	   England chairman of selectors David Graveney said the squad
comprised a very experience batting line-up.
	   ``While our choice of bowlers reflects the areas we believe we
can exploit in Australia,'' he said.
	   ``The summer has seen us enjoy success in a series against South
Africa but our defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka shows we still have
some way to go in our quest to become a top Test-playing side once
more.''
	   Selectors named a separate squad for the International
tournament in Bangladesh. The side will be captained by Adam
Hollioke, replaced by Alex Stewart as England's limited-overs
captain this season, and will include Graeme Hick, Jack Russell and
Graeme Lloyd _ son of England coach David.
	   The England squad for the Ashes tour is:
	   Alex Stewart (Surrey, Capt), Nasser Hussain (Essex, vice-capt),
Michael Atherton (Lancashire), Mark Butcher (Surrey), Dominic Cork
(Derbyshire), John Crawley (Lancashire), Robert Croft (Glamorgan),
Angus Fraser (Middlesex), Darren Gough (Yorksshire), Dean Headley
(Kent), Warren Hegg (Lancashire), Ben Hollioake (Surrey), Alan
Mullally (Leicestershire), Mark Ramprakash (Middlesex), Peter Such
(Essex), Graham Thorpe (Surrey), Alex Tudor (Surrey).

London shares plunge in wake of Dow's dive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices were lower on the London Stock Exchange by
midday Tuesday, though they managed to halve their early losses on
hopes that Wall Street might snap its decline after reopening later
in the day.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by
69.7 points, or 1.3 percent, at 5,179.7.
	   Earlier in the session, the so-called ``footsie'' had shown
losses twice that steep in reaction to Monday's 512-point loss by
the Dow Jones industrial average in New York.
	   The London market had been closed Monday for a holiday. Traders
went into the session expecting big losses, figuring prices had
some catching up to do on the downside after missing Monday's huge
selloff.

Austrian judo star goes on trial for cocaine possession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ An Austrian silver medalist in the 1996
European Judo Championships went on trial Tuesday along with
another Austrian and two Lithuanians on cocaine possession charges.
	   Thomas Schleicher, 25, had 1.4 kilograms (about 3 pounds) of
cocaine and a small quantity of amphetamines in his possession when
he was arrested April 5 by police in Salzburg province.
	   He was arrested along with another Austrian and three
unidentified Lithuanians. The charges against one of the
Lithuanians was later dropped.
	   Prosecutor Herta Krainer told the court that Schleicher began
using drugs after suffering an injury.
	   The Austria Press Agency quoted authorities as saying Schleicher
was accused of selling small amounts of cocaine to about seven
people early this year. The Lithuanians are accused of smuggling
the drugs into Austria, APA added.
	   Schleicher competed in the 71 kilogram (156 pound) class and won
the Junior European Championship title in 1992. finished ninth in
the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
	   Last spring, Austrian star ski jumper Andreas Goldberger
admitted on Austrian television that he had tried cocaine one time
in the bathroom of a Vienna disco.
	   Goldberger subsequently was suspended for six months and fined
by the Austrian Ski Federation.

United States donates dlrs 750,000 to help clear bombs in Laos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The U.S. government has made a new
contribution of dlrs 750,000 to help clear unexploded explosives in
Laos left over from the Vietnam War, a U.N. agency said.
	   The money will go towards a trust fund launched by the United
Nations Development Program in 1996 to increase Laotian capability
to clear unexploded ordnance, said a U.N. statement, received in
Bangkok on Tuesday.
	   The agreement to provide the new funds was signed Saturday by
U.S. Ambassador to Laos Wendy Chamberlin and a representative of
the U.N. Development Program, Jeffrey Avina.
	   The American government is the largest single donor to the
unexploded ordinance _ UXO _ program, contributing more than dlrs
10 million since 1996.
	   The United States has financed a training program, employing
American military personnel to train and equip Laotian staff. More
than 660 students have graduated from a U.S.-supported training
center and are now working in nine provinces, the statement said.
	   Between 1964 and 1973, U.S. warplanes flew more than
half-a-million bombing missions over Laos, dropping about 2 million
tons of bombs. The tonnage of bombs exceeded the amount of
explosives dropped by the Allies on Germany during World War II.
	   Other unexploded ordnance such as land mines and artillery
shells are also found in many parts of the country.

China warns of nasty computer virus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police are urging computer users to watch
out for a virulent computer virus that has spread to several
regions of the country.
	   The ``CIH'' virus is the first in China to directly attack and
destroy computer hardware, and has caused serious losses for
organizations whose computers have been infected, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The virus has affected computer information networks and can
spread via the Internet and by copying computer software, it said.
	   The Public Security Ministry issued a notice asking computer
users to take preventative steps against the virus. Computer users
that discover the virus were told to report to the police, Xinhua
said.

Indonesian government says Suharto-run foundations may have misused
</HEADLINE>
funds

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The government said Tuesday that
evidence indicates that charities set up and controlled by former
President Suharto funneled money to companies owned by his family.
	   The attorney general's office said it is investigating
allegations the charities misused their funds. Critics allege
Suharto, who resigned in May after a wave of protests and riots,
abused his power to give himself and his family billions of dollars
of his country's wealth.
	   Suharto has denied this along with allegations that he used the
charitable foundations to enrich himself.
	   The foundations reaped special levies from the paychecks of
thousands of civil servants and enjoyed other government
privileges.
	   ``There is some indication of an unlawful use of funds collected
by the foundations,'' Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib said,
without elaborating.
	   He said the legal and financial audit of funds collected by five
foundations would continue for another two or three months.
	   ``Suharto said that he will be ready for questioning after
auditing of the foundations is completed,'' Ghalib said.
	   President B.J. Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto who
succeeded him as head of state, ordered the inquiry and has said
that the ex-leader would be held accountable under the law if any
wrongdoing was uncovered.
	   In a bid to curb other alleged corrupt practices from the
Suharto era, the government also said it will review contracts
granted to companies to operate toll roads.
	   Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, Suharto's eldest daughter, has amassed
a huge fortune over the years, and one of her most prominent
businesses is the network of toll roads that crisscross Jakarta,
the capital.
	   The Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday that government
prosecutors are not planning legal action against Rukmana in a
corruption scandal involving one toll road company she owns. There
is no evidence implicating her, the newspaper said.

Army asks Jewish settlements to fence themselves in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army has asked Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to build fences around their communities, a
proposal settler leaders rejected Tuesday as ineffective and an
obstacle to future expansion.
	   The army's request came after several attacks on Jewish settlers
by Palestinian militants, including the shooting deaths of two
settlers outside the West Bank settlement of Itzhar last month.
	   The army said it sent the request to settlements that don't have
a security fence yet. Israel army radio said 21 of 144 settlements,
including Maaleh Adumim and Givat Zeev near Jerusalem, were asked
to build fences.
	   Settler leaders said fences were ineffective and would create a
siege atmosphere. ``They (the army) should close off the
(Palestinian) villages since the attacks come from them,'' said
Yehudit Tayar, spokeswoman of the Jewish Settlers Council.
	   Benny Kashriel, mayor of Maaleh Adumim, said he would not meet
the army's request because it would send the wrong message to
residents. ``In Tel Aviv and Jerusalem there were also attacks but
does that mean we should fence in the city centers,'' he said.
	   Settlers also oppose such boundaries since they might be an
obstacle to future expansion.
	   The Peace Now group, which advocates the creation of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, said the settlers'
refusal to build fences showed that their opposition to a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians was not based on security
concerns, as they claim.
	   ``Peace Now calls on the government to evacuate each settlement
that refuses to be enclosed by a fence,'' Peace Now said.

German stock volatile in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German share prices showed signs of
volatility in early trading Tuesday, as the market turned its
attention away from Russia and toward Wall Street.
	   The blue chip Xetra DAX index was off by 2 percent at 4,713.77
in the morning. However, traders said that sharp sell-offs didn't
materialize as expected after the Dow Jones Industrial average made
its second-largest point drop ever Monday.
	   Traders were waiting for a sign from Wall Street later in the
day as the Russian financial crisis took a subordinate role in
setting the tone.
	   ``Of course, Russia is still present in our minds, but Wall
Street is now the determining factor,'' Deutsche Bank dealer
Andreas Kehl said.

Greece's EMU course not affected by global crisis, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The current long-term global financial
crisis will not affect Greece's efforts to qualify for the European
Union's single currency in 2001, Greek National Economy and Finance
Minister Yannos Papantoniou said Tuesday.
	   ``It is definitely a long term crisis, but there are clear
indication that the situation is under control,'' Papantoniou said
after meeting with Greek Premier Costas Simitis.
	   ``The course of the (Greek) economy has been determined. Our
aims will be kept and nothing indicates that Greece will not be a
member of the Economic Monetary Union (EMU) on January 1, 2001,''
he added.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member European Union which
failed to qualify for the first round of EMU, with the government
vowing to be ready to join the single currency club by 2001.
Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining in the first
round.
	   Greek bonds, currency markets and the stock market came under
pressure Tuesday, following developments in the Russian economic
and political crisis and the U.S. stock market's heavy losses
Monday.
	   The minister stressed Greece's economy suffered no more than the
economies of other European countries from the crisis.
	   ``The Greek economy reacted maturely as the other European
economies did to the recent international turmoil,'' he noted.

Australian nanny denies murdering infant in her care
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Australian nanny Louise Sullivan appeared in court
Tuesday and denied murdering a 6-month-old baby in her care.
	   During the brief pre-trial hearing at London's Old Bailey,
Sullivan, 26, said little. But when asked whether she murdered
Caroline Jongen at her north London home in April, she replied
firmly, ''Not guilty.''
	   News reports said her trial had been due to start on Nov. 16,
but could now be delayed until next year. No reasons were given.
	   Sullivan, from Sydney, remains free on bail on condition that
she does not seek employment that involves caring for children
under 16 and does not apply for travel documents.
	   Police had originally charged her with inflicting grievous
bodily harm to the youngster, who was admitted to hospital on April
17 and died four days later when her life-support machine was
switched off.
	   But last month, after extensive inquiries including an
investigation in Sullivan's native New South Wales, police changed
the charge to murder and Sullivan was committed for trial.
	   At a London inquest on April 27, pathologist Dr. Freddy Patel
testified that Caroline probably was a victim of ``shaken baby
syndrome,'' the result of being roughly shaken or dropped.
	   Sullivan was employed as a live-in nanny by Caroline Jongen's
parents, Dutchman Marcel Jongen and his French wife Muriel.
	   In 1997, a British au pair, Louise Woodward, was convicted in
Massachusetts of killing an 8-month-old boy. A jury convicted her
of second-degree murder, but a judge reduced the verdict to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had already
served.

Sudan and Iraq discuss attack on Sudanese plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir met Tuesday with
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan -Bashir to discuss
possible plots on Arab and Muslim nations, the official Sudan News
Agency reported.
	   Ramadan expressed Iraq's denunciation of the ``unjust American
aggression'' on the Sudanese pharmaceutical plant hit by a U.S.
missile attack, SUNA said.
	   On Aug. 20, missiles fired from ships in the Red Sea destroyed
the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in North Khartoum, which
American officials claimed made a precursor to the deadly VX nerve
gas, possibly with Iraq's help.
	   Sudan insists the factory made only medicines. Iraq also has
denied it helped Sudan build chemical weapons.
	   El-Bashir and Ramadan discussed the importance of solidarity in
combating ``any plotting that faces Arab and Muslim nations,'' SUNA
reported.
	   Sudan and Iraq are both on the U.S State Department list of
nations accused of sponsoring terrorism.
	   U.S relations with Sudan soured soon after a 1989 coup brought
the Islamic government to power. The United States has cut off all
but humanitarian aid, withdrawn its diplomats and imposed sanctions
banning American investment in the country.
	   The United States has been the strongest supporter of
maintaining sanctions on Iraq imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait.

Serb hard-liners display pictures of Radovan Karadzic at party
</HEADLINE>
rally

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The international
organization overseeing this month's Bosnian election decided
Tuesday to punish the hardline Serb party for displaying pictures
of war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic at a rally.
	   Nicole Szulc, a spokeswoman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, said two candidates of the Serb
Democratic Party, or SDS, were removed from the candidate list for
the assembly in the Bosnian Serb-ruled part of the country.
	   The punishment came after the SDS displayed pictures of
Karadzic, who led Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war,
at a rally in the northern town of Brcko on Aug. 8. U.S. troops are
stationed outside Brcko to help enforce the terms of the 1995
Dayton peace agreement which ended the war.
	   According to the OSCE's elections rules, people who have been
indicted for war crimes by the U.N. tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, cannot participate in the Sept. 12-13 balloting in any
way.
	   Karadzic has been indicted for war crimes and genocide but
remains at large.
	   Meanwhile, Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos
Westendorp, decided to fire the mayor of the northern Bosnian
Croat-dominated town of Orasje, Marko Benkovic, for preventing the
return of non-Croat refugees to Orasje.
	   Rida Attarashany, a spokesman for the Westendorp's office, said
the mediator told the head of the ruling Bosnian Croat party, Ante
Jelavic, to name a new mayor of Orasje to take office within two
weeks.

Barclays to take writeoffs over Russian loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Barclays PLC said Tuesday that the Russian
economic crisis probably will cost it 325 million pounds (dlrs 543
million) in bad loans and trading losses.
	   Barclays said it expects to take a writeoff of 250 million
pounds (dlrs 418 million) to cover shaky loans in Russia.
	   The banking company said in a statement that it has 340 million
pounds (dlrs 568 million) in Russian loans and securities, much of
which now seems at risk in the ``highly volatile'' situation.
	   Barclays said it likely will take the one-time charge in the
second half of 1998, which will slash after-tax profits for
shareholders by about 150 million pounds (dlrs 250 million).
	   Meanwhile, as Russia's downturn rattled financial markets
globally, the Barclays Capital subsidiary has recorded another 75
million pounds (dlrs 125 million) in related trading losses over
the past two months, the banking company said.

Italian rider handed six-month suspension, fined
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Cyclist Francesco Casagrande, ranked fifth
in the world, has been suspended for six months by the disciplinary
commission of Italy's professional cycling league because he twice
tested positive for banned substances.
	   Casagrande, 28, had elevated levels of testosterone in doping
tests he took at the Tour of Trentino in April and the Tour of
Romandy in May. The Italian claimed his body's testosterone level
fluctuates naturally.
	   Monday night's ruling, which also included a fine of 2,000 Swiss
Francs (dlrs 1,400), does not bode well for Casagrande's contract
with the French team Cofidis. He was the team's leader at the Tour
de France before retiring with an injury.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Kenyan magistrate on Tuesday gave the
defense two weeks to examine prosecution evidence in the decade-old
killing of British tourist Julie Ward.
	   Magistrate Uniter Kidullah ordered an adjournment in the case
until Sept. 15 so both she and the defense can examine three boxes
of documents presented to the court at Tuesday's hearing.
	   A game warden, Simon ole Makallah, was arrested more than a
month ago in connection with the slaying of the 28-year-old Ward,
whose mutilated and charred remains were discovered in in the
Maasai Mara National Reserve in September 1988.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals. Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for
her murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June
1992.
	   Police at that time were criticized for conducting a flawed
investigation.
	   At the court's Sept. 15 session, the magistrate is expected to
rule on whether to release Makallah or bring him before the high
court on murder charges.
	   Earlier, Kidullah has granted several prosecution requests for
more time to put a case together before formal charges are filed.
The defense, citing delays, sought to have the charges dismissed,
but the magistrate rejected the appeal.
	   Makallah, a senior warden in the Kenya Wildlife Service, was
arrested July 17. The following day, Attorney General Amos Wako,
flanked by Ward's father, John, said there was sufficient
circumstantial evidence to arraign him and hold a second trial.
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to bring his daughter's killers to
justice.

Army asks Jewish settlements to fence themselves in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army has asked Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to build fences around their communities, a
proposal settler leaders rejected Tuesday as ineffective and an
obstacle to future expansion.
	   The army's request came after several attacks on Jewish settlers
by Palestinian militants, including the shooting deaths of two
settlers outside the West Bank settlement of Itzhar last month.
	   The army said it sent the request to settlements that don't have
a security fence yet. Israel army radio said 21 of 144 settlements,
including Maaleh Adumim and Givat Zeev near Jerusalem, were asked
to build fences.
	   Settler leaders said fences were ineffective and would create a
siege atmosphere. ``They (the army) should close off the
(Palestinian) villages since the attacks come from them,'' said
Yehudit Tayar, spokeswoman of the Jewish Settlers Council.
	   Benny Kashriel, mayor of Maaleh Adumim, said he would not meet
the army's request because it would send the wrong message to
residents. ``In Tel Aviv and Jerusalem there were also attacks but
does that mean we should fence in the city centers,'' he said.
	   Settlers also oppose such boundaries since they might be an
obstacle to future expansion.
	   The Peace Now group, which advocates the creation of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, said the settlers'
refusal to build fences showed that their opposition to a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians was not based on security
concerns, as they claim.
	   ``Peace Now calls on the government to evacuate each settlement
that refuses to be enclosed by a fence,'' Peace Now said.

New sign of impact of Russian crisis emerges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-6 with reaction from Hungarian foreign
minister &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Financial markets in central Europe opened
mostly lower Tuesday while a Hungarian furniture company halted
imports to Russia in another sign of impact by the Russian economic
crisis.
	   Any further exports to Russia would require ``extraordinary''
circumstances, with payment guaranteed, said a statement by the
Hungarian company, Graboplast Rt. Up to 10 percent of its work
force of 3,161 could be cut by the end of the year because of the
situation, it said.
	   ``Graboplast will maintain this practice as long as there is no
visible improvement in the Russian economy,'' it said.
	   The announcement contributed to a 4.7 percent drop in share
prices on the Hungarian stock exchange in early trading. The forint
currency, propped up by two government interventions last week,
also weakened in early trading.
	   But Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi, after meeting in
Warsaw with his Polish counterpart, shrugged off the results as
short-term reactions and insisted the economy would withstand any
fallout from Russia.
	   ``The Budapest Stock Exchange is paying the price of being
well-developed and solvent,'' he said of falling share prices.
``The high sale has an influence on the forint but the Hungarian
economy is strong as a rock.''

EU approves dlrs 1.1 million in aid for Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved 1 million
European currency units (dlrs 1.1 million) in aid Tuesday for the
victims of recent flooding in Bangladesh.
	   The funds will help provide food, drinking water, medical
supplies and proper hygiene to millions of people left homeless by
torrential rains over the past two months, the EU executive
Commission said in a statement.
	   More than 550 people have been killed, and some 25 million
displaced in the floods that have submerged most of the country.
	   The aid will be channeled through humanitarian organizations,
including Oxfam, the International Federation of the Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies to carry out projects over the next few
months.

Religious group wins libel case against Singapore newspapers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Central Christian Church, part of a
religious group founded in Boston in 1979, won a libel case against
two Singapore newspapers that called it a cult, according to a
ruling released Tuesday.
	   The church, however, lost its suit against the Christian
magazine whose 1991 article had served as a source for the
newspaper stories, and was ordered by the Court of Appeal to pay
the publication's legal costs.
	   The judgment, delivered Aug. 28, overturned a lower court ruling
last November in favor of the two government-controlled newspapers.
	   The three-judge Appeals Court said The New Paper, an afternoon
tabloid, and the Chinese evening paper, Lianhe Wanbao, were
reporting a statement _ that the group was allegedly a cult _ as if
it were a fact.
	   The ruling also said The New Paper had sensationalized the story
under big headlines such as: ``CULTS EXPOSED.''
	   Each paper was ordered to pay legal costs, plus 20,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 11,560) to the Central Christian Church. The New
Paper was also ordered to pay an additional 30,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 17,340) to a 35-year-old Malaysian, John Philip
Louis, who came from London to found the group's Singapore branch.
	   The group had sued the two newspapers' editors and publishers
for 2.2 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.27 million).
	   Louis' work permit had been withdrawn after the newspaper
articles appeared in 1991, but it has since been restored and he
will return to Singapore to lead the church, spokeswoman Yoke Ling
said Tuesday.
	   The Central Christian Church is part of the Boston Church of
Christ founded in 1979 and the London Church of Christ founded in
1982. Members are urged to confess their sinful thoughts and acts
to each other, recruits from Christian churches are told they must
be rebaptized, and the group forms a tight-knit community where
friendships, Bible study and free time are supervised by leaders.
	   The church sued the Singapore-published Christian magazine,
Impact, for 1 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 578,000) for articles
warning local churches about the group's practice of recruiting
among existing congregations and youth groups.
	   But the Court of Appeals said that Impact was protected by the
defenses of fair comment and qualified privilege because its
articles were written fairly and it had a duty to publish them
within the Singapore Christian community.
	   The Central Christian Church was ordered to pay Impact's legal
costs.

Clinton urges Russians to show courage, determination

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton, Albright quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the Russian
people Tuesday to weather their current economic turmoil with the
same ``courage and determination'' that has carried them through
past crises.
	   Clinton spoke after opening a two-day summit with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. The two politically wounded presidents
were unlikely to deliver any sweeping agreements.
	   ``Your country is going through some difficult changes right now
and I know things are not always easy for a lot of people,''
Clinton told parents, students and teachers at a school near the
Kremlin.
	   ``But I also know that in times of crisis, the Russian people
have always risen to the occasion with courage and determination,''
he said.
	   Despite the poor outlook for meaningful progress, Yeltsin
declared just before his summit meetings that ``Russian-American
relations are developing successfully.''
	   He greeted Clinton with a bear hug and handshake in the
Kremlin's presidential study. The first agreement to trickle out
was a joint pledge to eliminate some stockpiles of plutonium taken
from dismantled missile warheads.
	   ``Clinton and I know one another well, and we are friends,''
Yeltsin said earlier, as he made his own stop at a Moscow school to
salute students returning for the start of the fall term.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Clinton will
tell Yeltsin that while Russia has U.S. support, it cannot expect
more international aid unless it sticks to reforms that will
produce a free market economy.
	   ``Nobody expects the West to keep throwing money into this
country if they are not willing to undertake the fundamental
reforms, so it's a combination of holding out some carrots _ some
money _ and at the same time making clear that there need to be
some fundamental changes,'' Albright said in an interview on ABC's
``Good Morning America.''

Chinese court upholds spying verdict against Taiwan businessmen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese court on Tuesday rejected a Taiwanese
businessman's appeal against a four-year prison sentence for
spying, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court agreed with a lower
court that Kou Chien-ming and three other Taiwanese businessmen
were collecting political, economic and military information for
Taiwanese intelligence, Xinhua said.
	   ``Their espionage activities all seriously endangered China's
state security,'' the court said.
	   The three other businessmen _ Chen Shao-yu, Han Yue-ting and
Chou Chang-ming _ were also convicted on August 12 of espionage but
were exempted from criminal punishment.
	   Only Kou, Han and Chou appealed the original ruling, Xinhua
said.
	   Taiwan's intelligence agencies and the men's families have
strongly denied the men were spies. Kou's wife, Chang Wen-chi, said
his sentencing may have resulted from differences between what
constitutes classified information in Taiwan and China.
	   The four were detained earlier this year while in China on what
their families said were business trips. China announced their
arrests May 28, claiming the men confessed to spying for Taiwan.

South African rugby union elects first black president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African Rugby
Football Union elected its first black president on Tuesday, ending
a racially charged dispute and topping off the Tri-Nations
championship the team won last month.
	   Former union vice president Silas Nkanunu, 65, a lawyer from
Port Elizabeth, was elected at a meeting in Johannesburg of the
organization's board of directors.
	   The post has been vacant since Louis Luyt resigned in May amid
accusations of racism that pitted the union against the government
and the National Sports Council, an umbrella organization composed
of all of the country's sports governing bodies.
	   The 1995 World Cup champion had slumped on the field amid the
organization headaches at home. But it won the Tri-Nations rugby
championship with a 29-15 victory over Australia last month.
	   Long a bastion of Afrikaners, the white descendants of Dutch
settlers who ruled during decades of apartheid, rugby was hated by
the majority of blacks.
	   But President Nelson Mandela was determined to use sports to
bridge the racial divide, and in 1995 donned the famous green and
yellow national team rugby jersey after the World Cup victory at
Ellis Park.
	   Mandela last year assigned a judicial commission to investigate
allegations of corruption, racism and mismanagement in SARFU. The
union challenged the move and forced Mandela to testify in court on
why he appointed the investigating commission.
	   That enraged the National Sports Council and others, who
believed the rugby union had humiliated Mandela.
	   Luyt's resignation averted a call for an international boycott
of South African rugby.
	   Ronnie Masson of Western Province was elected senior vice
president while Keith Parkinson of Natal was elected junior vice
president.

New sign of impact of Russian crisis emerges

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Financial markets in central Europe were
mixed in volatile trading Tuesday while a Hungarian furniture
company halted imports to Russia in another sign of impact by the
Russian economic crisis.
	   Any further exports to Russia would require ``extraordinary''
circumstances, with payment guaranteed, said a statement by the
Hungarian company, Graboplast Rt. Up to 10 percent of its work
force of 3,161 could be cut by the end of the year because of the
situation, the company said.
	   ``Graboplast will maintain this practice as long as there is no
visible improvement in the Russian economy,'' it said.
	   Despite the announcement, the Budapest Stock Exchange overcame
an early drop to close slightly higher, while the forint currency,
propped up by two government interventions last week, held steady.
	   Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi, after meeting in
Warsaw with his Polish counterpart, insisted the economy would
withstand any fallout from Russia.
	   ``The Budapest Stock Exchange is paying the price of being
well-developed and solvent,'' he said of falling share prices in
recent days. ``The high sale has an influence on the forint but the
Hungarian economy is strong as a rock.''
	   Zoltan Pacsi, managing director of the exchange, said
unpredictability would govern the Hungarian market, adding that
drops of ``several hundred points, as well as minor rises are
possible.''
	   Regional leaders have insisted the persistent plunges in
currency values and share prices over the past two weeks were due
to an outdated perception that former Soviet satellites remained
economically integrated with Russia.
	   While Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic now trade mostly
with the European Union, sending less than 10 percent of exports to
Russia, they remain at some risk due to their proximity and
continuing trade ties.
	   Graboplast said its sales in Russia fell to dlrs 5.2 million in
the first half of this year, compared to dlrs 6.8 million over the
same period last year.
	   Traders and analysts warn continuing meltdown in Russia would
extend the volatility in central European markets, though the rush
by investors to sell assets to cover losses in Russia has slowed so
far this week.
	   In Poland, stock prices fell again after reaching a two-year low
Monday while the zloty currency rebounded from an early fall to
climb above the midpoint of its trading band with five Western
currencies.
	   The Czech koruna also strengthened Tuesday, but the Prague PX-50
stock index showed a 2.2 percent decline in morning trade.
	   In Romania, the leu currency dropped slightly Tuesday morning,
and traders predicted government intervention if the fall
continued. The government sold dollars last week to bolster the leu
during the initial shock of the Russian crisis.

Russian track officials assure uneasy stars that Moscow conditions

OK &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing a potential boycott by international track
and field stars, Russian athletics officials are providing
assurances there will be no safety problems for participants in
Saturday's Grand Prix final.
	   Their comments came after about 50 top athletes signed a
petition last week calling for the prestigious, season-ending track
meet to be moved to ``a more serene venue'' in view of the economic
and political crisis enveloping Russia.
	   The International Amateur Athletics Federation, track and
field's governing body, has insisted the event will go ahead as
planned at Moscow's Luzhniki Olympic Stadium. But it's not clear
how many of the 180 athletes will be no-shows.
	   ``I can understand those who expressed safety concerns about
coming to Moscow,'' Valentin Balakhnichev, president of the Russian
Athletics Federation, was quoted as saying in The Moscow Times on
Tuesday. ``But I can assure you and everyone else that personal
safety will not be a factor here.''
	   Claiming Moscow is safer than many other track venues around the
world, he said the athletes had been unduly influenced by alarmist
media coverage of the Russian crisis.
	   ``I have to remind you that it was in Atlanta, not Moscow, where
during the 1996 Summer Olympics a bomb exploded in the Olympic
park,'' Balakhnichev said.
	   He admitted that the economic crisis has caused problems in
organizing the meet. On Monday, the electricity and phones at the
federation's offices were shut off for failure to pay the bills.
	   Some dlrs 5 million in prize money is to be awarded at the meet.

Three Serb war crimes suspects freed until trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSIJEK, Croatia (AP) _ Three Serbs who face retrial on war
crimes charges were released from jail and will remain free during
the retrial, the chief district court judge said Tuesday.
	   The three were released late Monday, Judge Petar Kljajic told
the state-run news agency HINA.
	   The men, Pero Klickovic, 45, Vujo Halavanja, 45, and Zeljko
Keskenovic, 47, were among 19 Serbs who had been convicted in
absentia in 1995 in the Osijek District Court on charges of killing
Croats. They were sentenced to prison terms of between 11 and 20
years.
	   The 19 are from the village of Sodolovci in the region known as
Eastern Slavonia, which rebel Serbs seized in 1991.
	   When the region reverted to government rule in January, group
members appealed the sentence because they had been tried in
absentia. They were granted a retrial.
	   International officials, who administered the area during the
transition to Croat rule, insisted that the defendants remain free
during the retrial.
	   But the Supreme Court upheld Kljajic's request to have the group
detained and they were apprehended Friday.
	   Local Serbs had protested the arrest.
	   David Scheffer, the U.S. special envoy for war crimes issues,
said Monday a ``satisfactory solution'' was reached in his talks
with government officials regarding the three.
	   No trial date has been set yet.
	   Another war crimes suspect, Goran Vusurovic, surrendered earlier
and is currently being retried. The others remain at large.

Yemen arrests four Hunt Oil Company strikers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen has arrested four leaders of the
strike against the American Hunt Oil Company, a union statement
announced Tuesday.
	   The four strike leaders, including the head of Yemen's Refinery
and Oil Fields General Laborers Union, were taken from their homes
Monday night, said the statement.
	   It said the union president, Mahmoud Maqtari, and three members
of the union's executive committee were arrested for going on
strike. No immediate statement about the arrests was issued by
Yemeni authorities.
	   Some 1,300 Yemeni workers at the Hunt Oil Company began an
open-ended strike Monday.
	   The decision to strike came after the union failed to reach a
compromise with the oil company and the Oil Ministry.
	   The workers, including technical and management staff, are
demanding full medical insurance, overtime payments, late shift and
risk incentives and equal treatment with American co-workers, he
said.
	   ``We call on all the workers to continue to strike until our
demands are met and our colleagues are released,'' the statement
said.
	   Hunt Oil, which is headquartered in Texas, has a concession in
an oil field at Marib in northern Yemen with a production capacity
of 165,000 barrels per day.
	   In addition to its Yemeni staff, the company has 30 foreign
workers in the country.

Europe's central bankers meet as global markets shudder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As gloomy financial news piled up
around the world, Europe's central bankers met Tuesday to discuss
their continent's planned monetary union.
	   The central bank chiefs from the European Union's 15 member
states declined to say what impact they expected the weakening
world economy would have on the planned monetary union scheduled
for launch in four months, on Jan. 1. They were meeting for the
first time since July.
	   Despite Russia's growing economic crisis, continued falls on
Asian and European stock markets and a 512.61-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial index Monday, economists said the bank's main
challenges still lie in getting monetary strategy right, not in
worrying about the weak global economy.
	   ``Asia and Russia are of course major concerns for central
banks, but what can they do?'' said Holger Schmieding, senior
European economist at U.S. investment house Merril Lynch.
	   Outstanding issues include the important one of whether the
European Central Bank will use money supply or inflation data to
target monetary policy.
	   ``It's urgent for them. They have to start their policy on Jan.
1 next year and for that they have to get their strategy right,''
Schmieding said.
	   Concern that Russia's economic crisis could affect economic
growth in Europe has prompted some calls for cuts in interest rates
to boost economies.
	   On Monday, the new president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, Horst Koehler, said he couldn't
rule out that the Russian crisis could drag down Europe's growth.
	   Strong economic growth in the European Union and the United
States are key to stemming the current crises in Russia and Asia,
Koehler said. The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has
forecast growth in EU countries in 1998 will average about 3.6
percent.
	   The European Central Bank, inaugurated at the end of June, will
begin operating on Jan. 1, 1999, when it will run a unified
monetary policy for the 11 European countries launching the single
currency, or euro.
	   No agenda was released ahead of the European Central Bank's
general council's first meeting since the summer break. The council
includes all 15 EU central bank chiefs and the European Central
Bank president and vice president.
	   Policy makers from the European Central Bank's governing board
were meeting later. They include central bank chiefs from the 11
nations launching the common currency and the six-member ECB's
executive board.
	   Countries joining the monetary union are Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Portugal and Finland.
	   The other four EU nations _ Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece
_ will not join immediately.

coming to Moscow,'' Russian Athletics Federation president Valentin
Balakhnichev was quoted as saying in The Moscow Times on Tuesday.
``But I can assure you and everyone else that personal safety will
not be a factor here.''

the world, he said the athletes had been unduly influenced by
alarmist media coverage of the Russian crisis.
	   ``I have to remind you that it was in Atlanta, not Moscow, where
during the 1996 Summer Olympics a bomb exploded in the Olympic
park,'' Balakhnichev said.
	   He admitted that the economic crisis has caused problems in
organizing the meet. On Monday, the electricity and phones at the
federation's offices were shut off for failure to pay the bills.
	   About dlrs 5 million in prize money is to be awarded at the
meet.

	   TARRAGONA, Spain (AP)_ At least five people died Tuesday and
eight were injured when a bus heading to a beach collided head-on
with a truck, news reports said.
	   The accident occurred on a highway just outside the northeastern
town of Tarragona. The drivers of the vehicles were both killed, as
were three bus passengers, the state news agency Efe reported.
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, a Tarragona
police spokesman said.
	   The accident added to a death toll of 41 over the past four days
as people returning from August vacations packed highways all over
Spain, according to the National Traffic Directorate.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo issued a strong protest against North Korea
for firing a missile over Japan and sent military ships Tuesday to
the spot in the Pacific Ocean where it was believed to have landed.
	   The missile launch Monday renewed worries over security in Asia
and raised serious questions about the adequacy of Japan's missile
detection and anti-missile systems.
	   Government spokesman Sadaaki Numata said Tuesday that Japan did
not know about the missile launch until it received word from the
U.S. military. He added Japan had no independent monitoring system
to warn of the launching.
	   Numata also said Japan has frozen the dlrs 1 billion it had
committed to a project with South Korea, the United States and
Europe to supply North Korea with two nuclear energy reactors. And
sending food aid to the reclusive communist state would now be more
difficult, he acknowledged.
	   ``Our relations with North Korea are going to be more severe
than they have ever been,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said
after attending a special Cabinet meeting where the missile topped
the agenda.
	   Komura said the missile firing may help speed up Japan's
proposed joint development of a missile defense system with the
United States.
	   Defense officials said the missile appeared to be the new Taepo
Dong 1, which has a longer range than an older model and is capable
of reaching all of South Korea and Japan.
	   The South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek and his
Japanese counterpart, meeting in Tokyo, agreed to set up a group of
top defense officials from both nations that will meet specifically
to discuss North Korea's missile program.
	   ``We agreed that the missile was a threat to both nations,''
said Fukushiro Nukaga, director of the Defense Agency.
	   Kyodo News agency, citing unidentified government officials,
reported Tuesday that Japan will abandon its yearlong offer to
resume talks aimed at establishing diplomatic ties with North
Korea.
	   With no official diplomatic channels with the reclusive
communist state, even issuing a protest was a problem.
	   When a protest was levied in New York overnight to Kim Chang
Guk, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, he
merely repeated North Korea's usual criticism against Japan's
security arrangement with the United States, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   North Korea remained mute on the missile in its official news
being monitored by the Radiopress agency in Tokyo.
	   The Defense Agency said it will analyze any parts of the missile
retrieved by the dispatched military ships. Nonmilitary government
ships and plane were sent to the Sea of Japan where the first stage
of the missile was believed to have landed, government officials
said.
	   Defense tends to be a sensitive topic for many Japanese because
of the country's disastrous experience with militarism before and
during World War II. The pacifist movement is a powerful lobby
group in Japan, and the slightest sign of heightened military might
draws nervous protest from Asian neighbors.
	   That is partly why the missile defense system project has been
so slow in coming.
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the liberal Asahi newspaper warned
against any hasty action on the missile defense project, and
instead called for ``calm.'' The more conservative Yomiuri
newspaper, however, called for a prompt decision in favor of the
project.
	   The North Korean missile drew heightened concern from abroad as
well.
	   In Russia, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakmanin was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency that a ministry
official has been sent to North Korea ``for an explanation of the
incident.''
	   ``The circumstance that a North Korean missile, according to
some data, splashed down within the boundaries of Russia's economic
zone, gives rise to concern,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by
Itar-Tass.
	   Park Jie-won, South Korea's chief presidential spokesman, said,
``We strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop missile
development and join in international efforts to curb the spread of
the weapons.''
	   Russia's Interfax news agency reported that North Korea had
notified Moscow in advance of the firing, but Russian officials
were not aware of the missile's flight path. Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao denied a news report that China knew
of the missile test in advance.

Three Georgians go on trial in gangland slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Under extraordinary security, three
Georgians went on trial Tuesday in the 1996 gangland slaying of a
50-year-old Georgian businessman whom prosecutors call the
``godfather'' of a Georgian criminal empire.
	   David Sanikidze was shot dead July 11, 1996 as he strolled
through Vienna's downtown area with a woman companion, who was
seriously injured.
	   A few days later, the alleged gunmen, Akaki Javakhadze, 22, and
Georgi Onianu, 23, were arrested in Budapest, Hungary, and charged
with the murder. A third Georgian, Shukri Burtschuladze, is charged
with accesory to murder.
	   All three pleaded innocent.
	   Sanikidze, who was involved in hotel construction projects in
Russia and Georgia, was also a major figure in a criminal syndicate
active in extortion and protection rackets the former Soviet
republic, prosecutors say.
	   Austria media have reported he was also a friend of Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze and his son Paata.
	   Investigators have speculated the killing was linked to illegal
business deals among Georgian criminal gangs.
	   The trial is expected to last more than a week.

Sudanese plane arrives in Libya in apparent violation of sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A delegation of Sudanese officials arrived
Tuesday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli in an apparent violation
of U.N. sanctions that ban flights to and from the North African
country.
	   Libyan television, monitored in Cairo, interrupted its normal
programs to show the arrival of a plane from the national carrier
Sudan Airways. It carried a delegation coming for celebrations of
the 29th anniversary of the coup that brought Col. Moammar Gadhafi
to power.
	   The television showed members of the Sudanese delegation leaving
the plane chanting anti-American slogans. ``We will not obey the
Americans,'' they chanted as welcoming Libyans responded with the
same words.
	   It was not immediately clear if the Sudanese had sought an
exemption to the six-year U.N. embargo against international
flights to Libya.
	   On Friday a Libyan plane loaded with medicines and humanitarian
goods, violated the embargo by flying to Sudan. Gadhafi said then
the medicine was to make up for stocks destroyed in last month's
U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum.
	   In June, the Organization of African Unity urged member states
to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and religious
implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   Several African leaders have flown to and from Libya since then
in defiance of the sanctions.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The United States and Britain recently reversed long-standing
demands that the two men be tried only in their countries and urged
a trial before Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   Libya has said it accepts the offer but wants negotiations to
ensure the safety of the two men. In the past, it urged a trial in
a third country, arguing the two suspects could not get a fair
trial in the United States or Britain.

Italian minister announces quotas soon for legal immigrants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: SUBS 6th graf to drop extraneous word &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will soon start setting quotas on the number
of foreigners allowed to legally enter and work in the country,
Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano has announced.
	   Following a meeting on security issues with officials Monday in
southern Italy, which has borne the brunt of waves of illegal
immigrants, Napolitano said a decree would be drawn up limiting the
number of entries by nationality for the rest of 1998, followed by
a second decree for all of 1999.
	   Italy currently grants permission to stay to all who can prove
they are victims of persecution at home or if they have a job
awaiting them.
	   Napolitano said the quotas would reflect the number and type of
workers requested by authorities region by region.
	   Many businesses, especially in the agricultural sector,
currently rely on illegal immigrants for seasonal jobs such as
tomato picking. The new decree is intended to assure employers the
workers they need for jobs that Italians won't take, despite
Italy's 12.5 percent unemployment rate.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants have reached Italian shores
this summer, forcing the government to set up detention centers
throughout the south. According to Italy's new immigration law,
within 30 days illegal arrivals must be repatriated. But many
immigrants arrive without identity papers, making it impossible to
be sent back home.
	   On Tuesday, police blocked 175 mostly Albanian and Kurdish
would-be immigrants in the southern region of Puglia and in Sicily.
Police arrested two people who allegedly took money to ferry the
immigrants to Italian shores.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party was
officially named the winner Tuesday of the July 26 parliamentary
elections, a day after Cambodia's highest appeals body dismissed
opposition complaints of electoral fraud.
	   Opposition leaders responded by reiterating their vow not to
attend parliament unless their complaints of an unfair election
were satisfactorily addressed. Such a refusal could deadlock the
formation of a new government.
	   The mood at a nine-day protest against Hun Sen in a park
opposite the National Assembly was somber after the results were
announced. The crowd, which at times has exceeded 10,000, fell to
500, but swelled again to 5,000 late Tuesday when popular
opposition politician Sam Rainsy came to speak.
	   According to the election results, which mirrored a preliminary
tally issued three weeks ago, the Cambodian People's Party won
41.42 percent of the vote, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
31.70 and its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, 14.27.
	   Under a formula the opposition says was never legally approved,
that translates into 64 seats for Hun Sen in the National Assembly
against 58 for the opposition _ still short of the two-thirds
majority the CPP needs to form a government alone.
	   Chheng Phon, chairman of the National Election Committee, said
in a speech to be aired on state-run television that ``the will of
93 percent of voters shows to foreigners that Cambodians want
democracy and independence.''
	   Opposition supporters have been staging a round-the-clock
protest against Hun Sen and alleged election fraud at a small park
they call ``Democracy Square'' in front of the assembly into a tent
city.
	   International observers generally gave the election a clean bill
of health, but critics noted that their judgment was based mostly
on monitoring of voting and the initial counting. The tally
ultimately took 10 days.
	   The Asian Network for Free and Fair Elections, which performed
one of the most thorough jobs among the observer groups, urged the
international community Monday to reconsider its verdict until the
election problems are properly considered.
	   ``Short of this, ANFREL believes that the results will not be
credible and will not reflect the will of the people,'' the network
said.
	   In a printed statement, Sam Rainsy said Tuesday that the
``electoral process has failed to meet legal and democratic
standards from start to finish.''
	   He said opposition party members have been threatened,
intimidated, murdered; that there has been virtually no media
access for Hun Sen's political opponents; that the official
election boards rejected all complaints about election fraud; and
the electoral machinery was biased in favor of the ruling party.
	   ``Now we call to account the international community that funded
this failed process and pronounced it a success before it was
complete. We ask the international community to make a revised
assessment of the electoral process as a whole,'' he wrote.
	   The official results were released one day after the
Constitutional Council, which is stacked with Hun Sen's supporters,
rejected all the opposition's complaints about fraud.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-prime minister in a bloody coup. More than 100 of the
prince's supporters were killed in the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new polls would help him win back lost
legitimacy and aid.
	   Hun Sen has asked both parties to form a coalition, but they
have so far refused. It remains to be seen if he will succeed in
buying off opposition members to win two-thirds majority control.

Ugandan military to maintain troops in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBO, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army will keep troops in
eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels there, a spokesman said
Tuesday, despite a demand by Congolese President Laurent Kabila for
foreign troops to leave.
	   ``We cannot pull out of Congo now,'' said Capt. Shaban
Bantariza, speaking at military headquarters in Bombo, 40
Kilometers (25 miles) north of Kampala. ``We have to maintain a
buffer zone against the rebels. It is both tactical and
strategic.''
	   Uganda, which along with Rwanda backed the rebellion that
brought Kabila to power in May 1997, has had troops in eastern
Congo as a part of a joint defense agreement.
	   Kabila recently accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting
Congolese rebels who are fighting to oust him. Both countries have
denied involvement in the conflict, although Rwanda is widely
believed to be giving crucial support to the coalition of Congolese
rebels, which include minority Tutsis.
	   Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government is fighting Hutu rebels who
are also operating from eastern Congo.
	   On Aug. 22, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni warned that his
country may be forced to intervene in the Congo conflict if other
countries assisted Kabila's troops and Ugandan security was
threatened.
	   Bantariza said Tuesday that Kabila was incapable of controlling
his vast country and that rebels fighting Museveni's rule had free
rein in eastern Congo.
	   ``The rebels attacking Uganda from Congo operate without
(Kabila's) understanding because he cannot control the whole
country,'' Bantariza said.
	   Kabila's forces were able to recapture most of western Congo
from the rebels in recent days after getting reinforcements from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   This week the Congolese president said he was not focusing on
recapturing territories in eastern Congo still controlled by rebel
forces.
	   Bantariza did not specify whether Ugandan troops would play any
other role in eastern Congo and whether they would fight Congolese
or other regional troops fighting on behalf of Kabila.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Implementing interest-free banking is the
best way to help the Iranian economy out of its depression, Iran's
finance minister said Tuesday.
	   Introducing an Islamic Banking system would not have a negative
impact on President Mohammad Khatami's economic reform package,
Hussein Namazi said in remarks carried on Tehran radio.
	   He said with the enforcement of the Islamic system, ``the banks
would collect only their real fee,'' and the profit from investment
in economic activities would go to the people who made the
investment.
	   The minister said the Central Bank of Iran has been entrusted
with the task of removing obstacles toward enforcing the Islamic
banking system.
	   Iran nationalized its banking sector during the 1979 Islamic
revolution, but didn't institute Islamic banking, although Iran has
been one of the system's biggest advocates.
	   The country's banks still use the interest-based banking system
inherited from the shah's regime.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The state-owned Bahrain Petroleum Co.,
better known as Bapco, is expected to award a dlrs 53.5 million
contract to an international company later this month to upgrade
the oil blending system at its aging oil refinery, the Al Ayam
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   It quoted Bapco sources as saying that four international
companies _ the U.S. Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Construction, Foster
Wheeler, Stone &AMP; Webster and Japan's engineering and construction
company JGC Corp _ are bidding for the project.
	   A decision on who will get the contract will be taken by the
middle of this month, the paper said.
	   The blending project will increase the value of oil products by
about dlrs 18 million a year and is also expected to bring a
one-time saving of about dlrs 14 million by reducing storage
requirements, the paper said.
	   Last July, the government approved a plan to spend dlrs 400
million over four years to modernize the 62-year-old refinery.
	   The refinery was built in 1936, four years after the discovery
of oil in Bahrain. It has an output capacity of 250,000 barrels per
day. Owned by the government, it is the only refinery on the
island.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed slightly lower at the end of August compared to the end of
July, but the volume of trading rose considerably, a report said
Tuesday.
	   The index closed at 2,137.6 points Aug. 31, 5.2 points, or 0.24
percent, lower than July 31, according to a monthly report
published by The Securities House Co.
	   The volume of shares that changed hands, however, grew by 88
percent to reach 2.43 billion shares. The value of these shares
also rose by 47 percent to 443.58 million dinars (dlrs 1.44
billion).
	   The Securities House noted there were no major economic or
political changes in Kuwait in August, and investors were still
awaiting promised measures to restructure the oil-dependent
economy. The steps include the introduction of taxes and fees for
some public services, changes that are opposed by the 50-seat
parliament of this rich Gulf state known for its generous welfare
system.
	   Unprecedented heavy trading in stocks of United Arab Emirates
companies was greatly responsible for pushing up the volume of
trading, the report said. The demand was partly due to rumors about
ownership of these companies and listing them at home, the report
added without elaborating.
	   The exchange lists 76 companies, including nine from neighboring
Arab states in the Gulf. Trading is restricted to Kuwaitis and
nationals of these countries.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The state-owned Kuwait Oil Tankers Co. is
considering a plan to acquire five new vessels for transporting oil
products, the Al-Watan daily reported Tuesday.
	   If the KOTC goes ahead with the plan, it will self-finance these
purchases, Abdullah al-Roumi, the company's chief executive, told
the daily. He said KOTC had about dlrs 200 million (61.2 million
dinars) in liquidity.
	   He did not say where the ships would be built or how much would
be earmarked for the additions to the company's fleet of 32
tankers.
	   KOTC transports Kuwait's crude, natural gas and refined
products. It has posted record profits of dlrs 78.43 million (24
million dinars) in the fiscal 1997-98 that ended June 30.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ An international rating agency has
upgraded the Lebanon's financial outlook from stable to positive,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Kamal Shehadi, vice president and director of sovereign rating
for the Middle East and North Africa for Thomson Bankwatch, said
the agency was maintaining its B-plus rating for Lebanon, which it
issued last December, while raising the outlook.
	   ``The government has been rather good at reining in departments
that have spent irresponsibly in the past,'' Shehadi said in a
statement carried by the English-language Daily Star and others
newspapers.
	   ``The outlook has improved due to progress in reducing the
fiscal deficit and the rate of inflation,'' the statement added.
	   It also cited rising tourism revenues and foreign exchange
reserves and a successful dlrs 1 billion Eurobond issue in April as
determining factors in the agency's decision.
	   The upgrade by Thomson Bankwatch is the first following a series
of negative reports by top international agencies.
	   Lebanon, which has launched a multibillion-dollar program to
rebuild from the devastating 1975-90 civil war, has been struggling
to improve economic performance as deficit and debt continued to
rise and growth dropped.

Japan's stocks climb again, despite the Dow's fall

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the second day in a row, Japan's stock market
defied the example of Wall Street and nearly every other major
index in the world and closed sharply higher Tuesday.
	   But many analysts saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given
how wildly the stocks gyrated _ and some pointed at a temporary
intervention by government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who tried to
reassure Americans that despite the big fall on Wall Street Monday
the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, who recently urged world leaders to
hold a summit meeting to discuss the global market chaos.
	   Still, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up
261.74, or 1.86 percent, at 14,369.63.
	   Other world markets didn't fare as well, especially after
Monday's 6.4 percent decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
	   In Asia, the Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index dropped
212.57 points, or 2.9 percent, to 7,062.47. Singapore's Straits
Times Index set a new 12-year low, tumbling 33.1 points, or 3.8
percent, to 823.37.
	   Prices on the biggest European markets plunged in early dealings
then showed partial recoveries.
	   By early afternoon, prices had recovered most of their lost
ground on the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, on
speculation that the Dow Jones industrial average might be about to
snap its big losing streak.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by
49.5 points, or 0.9 percent, at 5,199.9. Earlier, the so-called
``footsie'' had been off by nearly 3.3 percent.
	   In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX index was off by just 0.2 percent in
the early afternoon, bouncing back sharply from early losses that
had pushed it as much as 3.3 percent lower.
	   Analysts said they were concerned further declines may scare
away investors _ and drive down share prices even further over the
short term.
	   ``The more money is withdrawn and the more the indices fall,
then the worse the problem becomes. And it's difficult to see where
the floor is going to be in that sort of situation,'' said Richard
Jeffrey, chief economist at the London brokerage Charterhouse
Tilney.
	   In Russia, where the most recent round of selling began, trading
in the ruble was suspended for a fifth day, helping drive down
Russian stocks even further amid continuing political uncertainty.
	   In limited early trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange, leading
shares plunged again. The power company Unified Energy Systems of
Russia was down 30 percent and the energy firm Mosenergo dipped 15
percent.
	   It appeared at first glance that Japan would once again come to
the rescue of world financial markets, as it did in October 1987
when a rally in Tokyo reassured world investors shaken by the
dizzying declines of Black Monday on Wall Street.
	   But Japan is not the economic powerhouse that it was 11 years
ago.
	   Investors in Tokyo dismissed this week's recovery as
short-lived, pointing out that many of the major problems weighing
on Japan's economy and stocks remained in place.
	   ``The Japanese government is nowhere near solving the problems
with its indebted banks, so there is a big danger that we will see
the stock market fall even further,'' said Yoshio Inamura, a fund
manager at Tokyo Mitsubishi Asset Management.
	   On Monday, the Dow dropped 512.61 points to close at 7,539.07.
That brought the index, which had recently been enjoying an 18
percent gain on the year, down to a 4.7 percent annual loss. It
also could be moving toward its first bear market since 1990.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   To make matters worse, more bad news surfaced battered already
shaky Asian markets.
	   In Hong Kong, investors awoke to find Standard and Poor's in New
York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's ability
to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government _
well-known for its criticism of free markets and its feuding with
Singapore _ took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors and hurt stock prices in
Singapore, which is one of the biggest arenas for trading Malaysian
stocks outside the country.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A senior U.N. human rights envoy was injured in a
car crash while investigating the situation in Burundi, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   Paulo Sergio Pinheiro received a broken arm when a truck hit the
car he was traveling in Monday. He was evacuated to the Kenyan
capital Nairobi and then on to Geneva for treatment.
	   Pinheiro, a Brazilian professor, was on his fifth fact-finding
mission to Burundi. He was gathering information to report back to
the U.N. Human Rights Commission under a procedure reserved for
countries with serious violations.
	   U.N. spokesman Jose Diaz said there were no further details on
Pinheiro's injuries or whether anyone else was hurt in the
accident.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo issued a strong protest against North Korea
for firing a missile over Japan and sent military ships Tuesday to
the spot in the Pacific Ocean where it was believed to have landed.
	   The missile launch Monday renewed worries over security in Asia
and raised serious questions about the adequacy of Japan's missile
detection and anti-missile systems.
	   Government spokesman Sadaaki Numata said Tuesday that Japan did
not know about the missile launch until it received word from the
U.S. military. He added Japan had no independent monitoring system
to warn of the launching.
	   Numata also said Japan has frozen the dlrs 1 billion it had
committed to a project with South Korea, the United States and
Europe to supply North Korea with two nuclear energy reactors. And
sending food aid to the reclusive communist state would now be more
difficult, he acknowledged.
	   Japan also abandoned its yearlong offer to resume talks aimed at
establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea, a Foreign Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Our relations with North Korea are going to be more severe
than they have ever been,'' Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said
after attending a special Cabinet meeting where the missile topped
the agenda.
	   Komura said the missile firing may help speed up Japan's
proposed joint development of a missile defense system with the
United States.
	   Defense officials said the missile appeared to be the new Taepo
Dong 1, which has a longer range than an older model and is capable
of reaching all of South Korea and Japan.
	   The South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek and his
Japanese counterpart, meeting in Tokyo, agreed to set up a group of
top defense officials from both nations that will meet specifically
to discuss North Korea's missile program.
	   ``We agreed that the missile was a threat to both nations,''
said Fukushiro Nukaga, director of the Defense Agency.
	   With no official diplomatic channels with the reclusive
communist state, even issuing a protest was a problem.
	   When a protest was levied in New York overnight to Kim Chang
Guk, the North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Nations, he
merely repeated North Korea's usual criticism against Japan's
security arrangement with the United States, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   North Korea remained mute on the missile in its official news
being monitored by the Radiopress agency in Tokyo.
	   The Defense Agency said it will analyze any parts of the missile
retrieved by the dispatched military ships. Nonmilitary government
ships and plane were sent to the Sea of Japan where the first stage
of the missile was believed to have landed, government officials
said.
	   Defense tends to be a sensitive topic for many Japanese because
of the country's disastrous experience with militarism before and
during World War II. The pacifist movement is a powerful lobby
group in Japan, and the slightest sign of heightened military might
draws nervous protest from Asian neighbors.
	   That is partly why the missile defense system project has been
so slow in coming.
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the liberal Asahi newspaper warned
against any hasty action on the missile defense project, and
instead called for ``calm.'' The more conservative Yomiuri
newspaper, however, called for a prompt decision in favor of the
project.
	   The North Korean missile drew heightened concern from abroad as
well.
	   In Russia, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakmanin was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency that a ministry
official has been sent to North Korea ``for an explanation of the
incident.''
	   ``The circumstance that a North Korean missile, according to
some data, splashed down within the boundaries of Russia's economic
zone, gives rise to concern,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by
Itar-Tass.
	   Park Jie-won, South Korea's chief presidential spokesman, said,
``We strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop missile
development and join in international efforts to curb the spread of
the weapons.''
	   Russia's Interfax news agency reported that North Korea had
notified Moscow in advance of the firing, but Russian officials
were not aware of the missile's flight path. Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao denied a news report that China knew
of the missile test in advance.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Australian nanny Louise Sullivan appeared in court
Tuesday and denied murdering a 6-month-old baby in her care.
	   During the brief pre-trial hearing at London's Old Bailey,
Sullivan, 26, said little. But when asked whether she murdered
Caroline Jongen at the child's north London home in April, she
replied firmly, ``Not guilty.''
	   Judge John Blofeld rescheduled the trial for the second week of
January after Sullivan's lawyer, Nadine Radford, said the defense
is instructing eight medical experts and will not be ready to
present its case on Nov. 16, the original trial date.

Investigators find `safety problems' at Scottish nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A nuclear plant in Scotland, which stopped
processing nuclear material after leaks were discovered nearly two
years ago and is now slated to close, has ``many chronic safety
problems'', a report released Tuesday said.
	   Investigators found no immediate public danger, but argued that
``considerable effort, time and resources'' were needed to make the
Dounreay plant on the sparsely inhabited northern coast of Scotland
safe.
	   The Health and Safety Executive, which monitors civilian nuclear
sites, and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency began its
three-month audit at Dounreay on June 1 following an accident in
May when a power cable was sliced by a digger, cutting off power
for 16 hours.
	   In the report, investigators heaped criticism on The United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which runs the plant, and warned
that management was too weak to safely decommission the facility.
	   ``We suspect the UKAEA has been operating plants without clear
knowledge of some of the risks,'' the report said.
	   Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar said, ``One thing is clear -
Dounreay must get tough on safety.'' He pledged to consider all 143
recommendations in the report, such as the need for a comprehensive
plan to deal with some radioactive waste and less reliance on
outside contractors.
	   Dounreay, which was built in 1957, shut down its fast reactor in
1994 and stopped producing electricity, but it continued to accept
nuclear material for reprocessing. However, reprocessing ceased for
a time in September 1996 when a radioactive leak was discovered.
	   In June, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Dounreay would
close after it processes all remaining nuclear material on the
site, including an April shipment of uranium from the former Soviet
republic of Georgia. The expected closure date is 2006.

Dutch government banned export of chemicals to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government disclosed
Wednesday that it banned a shipment of chemicals to Sudan earlier
this year because of fears they might be used to make nerve gas.
	   The shipment involved so-called ``dual-use'' chemicals which
have both a civilian and military application, said Economic
Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Paula de Jonge.
	   Although the Dutch exporter wanted to sell the chemicals as raw
materials for use in the manufacture of fertilizer, the ministry
``had indications that it might be used for other ends,'' De Jonge
said.
	   De Jonge would not say which chemicals were named on an April
export application or where in Sudan they were destined for. She
also declined to say how the Dutch government came to the
conclusion that there was a risk the chemicals might be put to
strategic use.
	   Sudan's possible involvement in the production of chemical
weapons was highlighted Aug. 20 when a U.S. cruise missile attack
destroyed a Sudanese factory that the Clinton administration
claimed was making precursors for VX nerve gas.
	   The Sudanese government insists the El Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant manufactured only drugs.

South African rugby union elects first black president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African Rugby
Football Union elected its first black president on Tuesday, ending
a racially charged dispute and topping off the Tri-Nations
championship the team won last month.
	   Former SARFU vice president Silas Nkanunu, 65, a lawyer from
Port Elizabeth, was elected at a meeting in Johannesburg of the
organization's board of directors.
	   The post has been vacant since Louis Luyt resigned in May amid
accusations of racism and mismanagement that pitted the union
against the government and the National Sports Council, an umbrella
organization composed of all of the country's sports governing
bodies.
	   The 1995 World Cup champion had slumped on the field amid the
organization headaches at home. But it won the Tri-Nations
championship with a 29-15 victory over Australia last month.
	   Long a bastion of Afrikaners, the white descendants of Dutch
settlers who ruled during decades of apartheid, rugby was hated by
the majority of blacks.
	   But President Nelson Mandela was determined to use sports to
bridge the racial divide, and in 1995 donned the famous green and
yellow national team rugby jersey after the World Cup victory at
Ellis Park.
	   Mandela last year assigned a judicial commission to investigate
allegations of corruption, racism and mismanagement in SARFU. The
union challenged the move and forced Mandela to testify in court on
why he appointed the investigating commission.
	   The suit enraged the National Sports Council and others, who
believed the rugby union had humiliated Mandela.
	   Luyt's resignation averted a call for a call by the NSC for an
international boycott of South African rugby.
	   Ronnie Masson of Western Province was elected senior vice
president while Keith Parkinson of Natal was elected junior vice
president.

Montenegrin president predicts breakup of present Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The reformist president of
Montenegro openly predicted Tuesday the breakup of present-day
Yugoslavia and blamed it on federal President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   In an interview with Vijesti daily, Milo Djukanovic accused
Milosevic of autocratic rule and disregard of Montenegro in the
Yugoslav federation it forms with Serbia.
	   ``Yugoslavia will break up, not because of Montenegrin
separatism, but because of political and economic rotting, which
began long ago because of the autocratic rule of one man,''
Djukanovic said.
	   Djukanovic, a pro-Western politician who became president of
Montenegro this year, is at odds with Milosevic over many issues.
	   Their rift culminated earlier this year when Milosevic appointed
his protege in Montenegro, Momir Bulatovic, to the post of the
federal premier without the approval of Montenegrin officials.
	   Bulatovic, a former president of Montenegro, lost elections this
spring to Djukanovic.
	   Serbia and Montenegro, which remained in Yugoslavia after other
republics seceded, should share power on a federal level, although
Montenegro is much smaller.
	   Djukanovic said Milosevic can save Yugoslavia if he replaces
Bulatovic and lets Djukanovic's camp name the federal premier.
	   ``If the contrary happens, Montenegro will not accept the
decisions of the so-called federal government ... and that would
lead directly to the breakup of the federal state,'' he said.

England captain against money driven Super League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer captain Alan Shearer has come out
against the proposed breakaway European Super League, saying the
concept was motivated by money and contrary to the traditions of
the game.
	   The Newcastle striker weighed into the Super League debate
Tuesday, days after European soccer's governing body UEFA vowed to
fight the breakaway competition by revitalizing its own
tournaments.
	   The 20,000 pounds-per-week (dlrs 32,800) player was quoted in
the Guardian newspaper as saying that if Super League was created,
then ``a lot of (Premier League) romance would be taken away.''
	   Shearer said for reasons of tradition, a Newcastle or Manchester
United versus Wimbeldon match would alway matter more than
Newcastle playing Milan twice a season.
	   ``From what I can gather there wouldn't be any relegation or
promotion, yet that's what football is all about,'' he said. ``The
uncertainty of how the season unfolds is the great thing about
football.''
	   Shearer said the game of soccer was in tremendous shape at the
moment, particularly in England.
	   ``To change all that for the sake of money....for one or two or
three, or however many clubs to break away, it would, in my
opinion, be wrong,'' he said.
	   Rudolfo Hecht, whose Milan-based marketing company Media
Partners is behind plans to create the European Super League, said
after meetings with representatives of Europe's leading clubs last
week that he was confident the competition would kick off by 2000.
	   The proposed competition would incorporate 32 teams in two
divisions.
	   The top 16 teams would include clubs of the calibre of
Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United from England's Premier
League, plus Juventus, Inter and AC Milan of Italy, Dutch giants
Ajax and Germany's Bayern Munich.
	   However, UEFA's governing Executive Committee met in Monaco on
Saturday to discuss measures to avoid the possibility of a
breakaway league and decided to form a taskforce.
	   UEFA announced a new 14-man task force, due to make initial
recommendations before Christmas, which includes representatives
from five clubs _ Ajax Amsterdam, Bayern Munich, Juventus,
Liverpool, and Marseille.
	   It will be the first time that clubs have ever sat on a UEFA
committee.

NATO-led peace force requests removal of Bosnian Croat general
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat general was
suspended from the army after the NATO-led peace force requested
his removal for sending his troops to battle wildfires in
neighboring Croatia without permission, officials said Tuesday.
	   According to Croatian officials and media, Gen. Stanko Sopta had
asked the peace force to allow his troops to join local
firefighters and French and Italian soldiers battling fires that
swept along the Croatian coast this summer.
	   The NATO-led peace force is in charge of the movements of all
local army units in Bosnia.
	   Permission was slow to arrive, so Sopta moved his troops to
Croatia after informing Bosnian Croat authorities.
	   Because Sopta acted without permission, peace force commander
Gen. Eric Shinsecki sent a letter to Kresimir Zubak, the Croat
member of the Bosnian joint presidency, requesting Sopta's removal.
	   Peace force spokesman Maj. Richard Saint Louis confirmed the
information Tuesday, but refused to discuss further details.
	   Following the NATO request, Zubak suspended Sopta from duty. The
date of the suspension was not announced.
	   Throughout the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war, Croatia gave financial,
political and military support to Bosnian Croats. Many Bosnian
Croats still see the Croatian leadership as their ultimate
authority and Croatia as their motherland.
	   Sopta is one of the most powerful Bosnian Croat senior officers
and Bosnian Croat hard-line leaders used the suspension to launch a
campaign against Zubak, who recently split from the ruling Croat
Democratic Union, HDZ, and formed a new, moderate party.
	   The two parties are viciously battling for Bosnian Croat votes
ahead of Sept. 12-13 general elections.
	   Ante Jelavic, HDZ's president in Bosnia, told Croatian national
television Monday night that Zubak ``implemented orders of
foreigners, instead of his own people.''

Myanmar pro-democracy leader to meet foreign diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi is scheduled to meet Wednesday with foreign diplomats, a move
which may antagonize her country's military rulers.
	   Suu Kyi is locked in a bitter battle with the junta which took
power in 1988 and refuses to turn over power to a parliament
democratically elected in 1990, when Suu Kyi's party won a
landslide victory in the polls.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman described the planned get-together as a
routine meeting of diplomats with Suu Kyi to discuss relations
between her party, the National League for Democracy, and the
government.
	   The meeting was also intended to ``to foster dialogue, national
reconciliation and a peaceful transition to democracy,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity by telephone with
The Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The authorities in the past have occasionally blocked Suu Kyi
from meetings with foreign diplomats, but it was unclear what they
would do this time.
	   The league last week announced its would unilaterally convene a
parliamentary session. The government has given strong warnings
that would be illegal, putting participants at risk of long prison
terms and making the league liable to be banned.
	   Harsh government repression gives Myanmar's pro-democracy
movement little chance to rally mass support inside the country, so
it values international support.
	   The junta opposes any foreign sympathy for Suu Kyi and subjected
the foreign press and diplomats to particular criticism.
	   Last Friday a commentary in a state-run newspaper attacked
foreign diplomats for allegedly sympathizing with the pro-democracy
movement.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, spent 13
days last month parked in a van on a bridge outside Yangon in
protest after the authorities prevented her for the fourth time
from traveling to the provinces to meet supporters.

Taiwan government plans measures to prop up stock market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments by premier Siew, cancellation
of reserve requirement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan is mulling use of an emergency fund
to prop up share prices that have plunged to their lowest level in
nearly two years, Premier Vincent Siew said Tuesday.
	   Siew told reporters the government would take ``necessary
steps'' to stabilize the stock market, but said no decision has
been taken yet on establishing a stabilization fund that officials
said could total 200 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.7
billion).
	   Lin Tsung-yung, head of the Securities and Futures Commission,
said the fund _ set up from from pension funds and postal savings _
would be used to invest in the market should prices fall any
further.
	   The Taiwan Stock Exchange's key Weighted Index tumbled 215.02
points, or 3.3 percent, on Tuesday, to 6335.09, its lowest level in
23 months. Blamed on overnight Wall Street plunges amid gloomy
prospects for the global economy, the drop followed a 185-point
decline on Monday.
	   In a meeting with the heads of top securities firms, President
Lee Teng-hui said the government would consider suggestions to
boost the market by raising the ceiling for margin loans and
cutting stock transaction taxes.
	   Lee said Taiwan should take measures to prevent speculation
similar to the recent attacks on Hong Kong's markets by U.S.
financier George Soros.
	   Though sale and trading of Soros funds is illegal in Taiwan, the
government is concerned Taiwan may become the financier's next
target.
	   Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said the government was
investigating whether any Soros funds are being traded in the
Taiwan market, possibly through proxy accounts.
	   In a move to gradually release some 24 billion Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 685 million) into the money supply, the central bank
announced it has canceled the reserve requirement it demanded for
private savings accounts under the post office.

 &UR; Israeli soldier, Lebanese civilian wounded in south Lebanon &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli soldier wounded in second incident,
CHANGES overline and dateline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was wounded Tuesday when
Hezbollah guerrillas fired mortars at his post in southern Lebanon,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate confirmation from Israel on the attack,
which triggered retaliatory fire from Israeli forces.
	   The incident occurred near the village of Blatt, which is 5
kilometers (3 miles) from the Israeli border. Hezbollah issued a
statement claiming responsibility.
	   Earlier, a woman was hit by shrapnel when shells fired by
Israeli-backed militiamen exploded near her home in Mashghara, the
security officials said.
	   They said Fatmeh Hijazi, 45, was treated at a local hospital and
released. The officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
Several houses also were damaged in the shelling.
	   It was not immediate clear what prompted the early morning
shelling, which the officials blamed on the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia.
	   Israeli shells exploded in Mashghara last Tuesday, injuring six
Lebanese civilians, including a 6-year-old boy. The incident
triggered a rocket barrage on northern Israeli towns and
settlements by Hezbollah in which 19 civilians were injured.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from Israel's
self-styled ``security zone'' in south Lebanon. Israel set up the
zone in 1985 to try to protect its northern settlements from
cross-border guerrilla raids.

	   In a speech focusing broadly on the future of Russia and its
quest for democracy and free enterprise, Clinton said the slide in
stock prices around the world in recent days was proof that the
national economies of the world are more closely linked than ever
before. He noted, as an example, that Latin American stocks have
been hurt by Japan's economic problems.
	   ``What does that say?'' Clinton asked. ``Whether we like it our
not, we are going to be affected by'' the actions of other nations,
whether it is Russia, Japan, China or other major powers.
	   While reassuring investors, Clinton and his senior aides are
scrambling to keep up with spreading global financial turmoil.
	   Rubin said he spent much of his just-ended vacation on the phone
talking about the world economy. ``The world is currently working
its way through a difficult period,'' he said Monday.
	   Rubin said he had also talked Monday with Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, stock market regulators at the Securities
and Exchange Commission and finance officials around the world.
	   After the frenzied consultations, Rubin assured Americans, ``The
fundamentals of the United States economy are strong. Prospects for
growth, low unemployment, low inflation continue to be strong.''
	   Calls, nevertheless, came from several quarters for action to
protect U.S. finances.
	   The National Association of Manufacturers recommended that the
Federal Reserve cut interest rates to improve other countries'
access to American capital, as did Congressman Jim Saxton, chairman
of the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
	   Rubin said it was particularly important that Japan, the world's
second-largest economy, ``move ahead with actions to put its
economy back on track so that it can be a source of strength for
the rest of the world.''
	   He also entreated Republicans in Congress to authorize U.S.
contributions to the International Monetary Fund, which helps
support countries in financial trouble.

President Kuchma: Ukraine likely to receive IMF loan this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - With Ukraine struggling to avoid economic
meltdown in the wake of Russia's financial crisis, national leaders
stressed Tuesday the need for quick approval of a dlrs 2.2 billion
IMF loan.
	   ``Approval of the loan would support Ukraine both politically
and economically, and would serve as confirmation by international
financial institutions that Ukraine is a country to do business
with,'' President Leonid Kuchma told reporters in Kiev.
	   Kuchma's remarks followed the Ukrainian leader's telephone
conversation with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday, in which
Gore lent his support for granting the loan, and with the
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus on Monday.
	   The IMF was to consider the loan to Ukraine at the end of
August, but the board meeting was delayed over the need to study
possible effects of Russia's financial crisis on Ukraine.
	   Ukraine, which exports more than dlrs 10 billion worth of
commodities, or a third of its total exports, to Russia, has been
among the countries hit hardest by the turmoil in the Russian
financial markets.
	   The hryvna currency has been falling steadily in the past two
weeks and has already reached the upper limit of a government-set
currency fluctuation band of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar.
	   Prices in outdoor markets and some shops have gone up, and
people are lining up at currency exchange booths to buy dollars.
	   The government urgently needs foreign aid to replenish the
Central Bank's reserves, which have dwindled significantly due to
the efforts to defend the hryvna.
	   The reserves, which stood at dlrs 1.75 billion in July, have
already dropped to about dlrs 900 million.
	   The Central Bank was selling up to dlrs 40 million at the
currency exchange each day last week to satisfy banks' growing
demand for the U.S. currency and keep the hryvna from leaving the
currency corridor.
	   Such massive selling of dollars sparked fears that Ukraine could
run out of reserves by the end of September.
	   However, Kuchma pledged that the hryvna would not slip very far
out of the present fluctuation band.
	   ``It's definite that there won't be any significant changes to
the corridor,'' Kuchma said.

Bangladesh seeks international help for flood aid

aid and the latest death toll. Edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh made yet another appeal
Tuesday for international help to provide immediate flood relief
and to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of homeless people, a
finance ministry official said.
	   Rice paddy crops have been wiped out by floods that submerged
two-thirds of Bangladesh, leaving more than 600 people drowned or
killed by collapsing homes, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Torrential rains in the Himalayas since July have swollen rivers
that burst their embankments.
	   The official said Bangladesh needs dlrs 879 million in aid.
Nearly one-half of that would be required for immediate relief. The
rest will be used for rehabilitating people.
	   Foreign donors and relief agencies had committed dlrs 65
million. Officials estimate that 30 million people _ one-fourth of
the population _ are affected by the floods. Most of Bangladesh's
population doesn't live in the flood-prone areas.
	   On Tuesday, Finance Minister Shah Mohammed Kibria asked envoys
of neighboring nations and Islamic countries to urge their
governments to give immediate help.
	   He said the expected failure of the winter crops would result in
serious food shortage.
	   Also Tuesday, the European Union approved 1 million European
currency units (dlrs 1.1 million) in aid Tuesday for the flood
victims.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a message of support but no financial help,
U.S. President Bill Clinton urged Russians Tuesday to ``reject the
failed policies of the past'' in coping with their current economic
crisis.
	   ``Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions,'' Clinton told a new
generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State University of
International Relations.
	   He repeatedly said that Russia must ``play by the rules'' of
international commerce and get rid of corruption.
	   Clinton met earlier with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the
first session of a two-day summit unlikely to deliver sweeping
agreements from the politically wounded presidents.
	   With Russia's economic turmoil throwing the summit agenda into
uncertainty, Clinton addressed the crisis with frankness, but
offered no specific ideas on how the infant democracy could weather
the tailspin of its currency.
	   ``I do not believe it is by reverting to the failed policies of
the past. I do not believe it is by stopping the reform process in
midstream,'' he said.
	   ``I believe you will create the conditions of growth if _ but
only if _ you continue to move decisively along the path of
democratic, market-oriented constructive revolution.''
	   Clinton traced America's own two centuries of democracy and said
``the road has not always been easy,'' referring to the Civil War,
Great Depression and two world wars.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Citing a continued strong job market and a
balanced budget, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that
despite turmoil in the stock market ``we believe our fundamental
economic policy is sound.''
	   Clinton added his voice to the U.S. administration's efforts to
reassure nervous investor after Monday's dramatic declines on Wall
Street.
	   Noting that he had consulted with Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin during Monday's stock sell-off, Clinton told students at

Mass trial of suspected Islamic extremists gets under way
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FLEURY-MEROGIS, France (AP) _ The trial of nearly 140 suspected
Islamic militants accused of aiding Islamic insurgents in Algeria
opened Tuesday in a prison gym with several defense lawyers
immediately seeking a postponement.
	   The defense lawyers, who contest the conditions of the trial,
also asked for freedom for the 27 defendants who have been jailed
since their arrests in 1994 and 1995.
	   The remainder of the 138 defendants being judged in the
two-month trial have been free on their own recognizance.
	   The defendants are accused of belonging to three separate but
overlapping networks that served as support bases for the Islamic
insurgency in Algeria, now in its seventh year.
	   They are accused of sending arms and medicine, recruiting
fighters and providing safe havens in France for insurgents and
funds for the cause.
	   Charged with ``criminal association with a terrorist
enterprise,'' they risk up to 10 years in prison.
	   Some of the more than 100 defense lawyers contend the
proceedings are a ``political trial'' for France to show support
for Algeria's military-backed regime. They had indicated they would
walk out after the first day.
	   The lawyers, calling the trial a ``judicial aberration,''
contest its size, its length and the site, a gymnasium of the
National School of Penitentiary Administration at the
Fleury-Merogis Prison outside Paris, renovated for the proceedings
at a cost of more than 10 million francs (some dlrs 1.7 million).
	   The gym replaces the Palais de Justice in central Paris, where
courtrooms are too small to accommodate the proceedings.
	   Defense lawyers claim most of the defendants have but a passing
connection to the three leaders of the networks, who they say
should be tried separately.
	   The leading defendants are Mohamed Kerrouch, the alleged
ideologue and top leader, arrested in Britain in April 1996 and
extradited to France; Mohamed Chalabi, and Mourad Tacine.
	   Kerrouch is accused of organizing support networks and
provisions for the Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the
now-banned Algerian political party the Islamic Salvation Front.
He's accused of then continuing the same work for the Armed Islamic
Group, the radical insurgency movement accused of numerous
massacres.
	   Chalabi is accused of setting up a group to collect arms,
medicine and clothing for insurgents. Tacine is accused of heading
a third group that allegedly provided false documents and lodging
for insurgents who took refuge in France.

mobsters Tuesday in a major crackdown on organized crime in the

	   Among those arrested was the lawyer Giorgio De Stefano, the
brother of a murdered Mafia boss, described by the president of
parliament's anti-Mafia commission as belonging to one of the
region's most dangerous clans.
	   A former vice-president of the province of Reggio Calabria,

Clinton urges Russians to show courage, determination

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a message of support but no financial help,
U.S. President Bill Clinton urged Russians Tuesday to ``reject the
failed policies of the past'' in coping with their current economic
crisis.
	   ``Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions,'' Clinton told a new
generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State University of
International Relations.
	   Clinton spoke after he and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
opened a two-day summit unlikely to deliver sweeping agreements
from the politically wounded presidents.
	   With Russia's economic turmoil throwing the summit agenda into
uncertainty, Clinton addressed the crisis with frankness, but
offered no specific ideas on how the infant democracy could weather
the tailspin of its currency.
	   In his speech, Clinton repeatedly said that Russia must ``play
by the rules'' of international commerce and get rid of corruption.
	   ``I believe you will create the conditions of growth if _ but
only if _ you continue to move decisively along the path of
democratic, market-oriented constructive revolution.''
	   Clinton traced America's own two centuries of democracy and said
``the road has not always been easy,'' referring to the Civil War,
Great Depression and two world wars.
	   Despite the poor outlook for meaningful progress, Yeltsin
declared just before his summit meetings that ``Russian-American
relations are developing successfully.''
	   He greeted Clinton with a bear hug and handshake in the
Kremlin's presidential study. The first agreement to trickle out
was a joint pledge to eliminate some stockpiles of plutonium taken
from dismantled missile warheads.
	   ``Clinton and I know one another well, and we are friends,''
Yeltsin said earlier, as he made his own stop at a Moscow school to
salute students returning for the start of the fall term.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Clinton will
tell Yeltsin that while Russia has U.S. support, it cannot expect
more international aid unless it sticks to reforms that will
produce a free market economy.
	   ``Nobody expects the West to keep throwing money into this
country if they are not willing to undertake the fundamental
reforms, so it's a combination of holding out some carrots _ some
money _ and at the same time making clear that there need to be
some fundamental changes,'' Albright said in an interview on ABC's
``Good Morning America.''
	   The first agreement to trickle out was a joint pledge to
eliminate some stockpiles of plutonium taken from dismantled
missile warheads.
	   Republican Sen. Pete Domenici who flew here with Clinton, told a
reporter on Tuesday that the two presidents would sign on Wednesday
an accord to get rid of about 50 metric tons of plutonium on each
side and break down the weapons material so it cannot be used for
military purposes.
	   ``We both have way more than we need,'' Domenici said.
	   A draft of the leaders' joint statement said the plutonium would
be withdrawn in stages, with financing arrangements to be set by
year's end.
	   ``Measures to manage and reduce such stockpiles are an essential
element of irreversible arms reduction efforts and necessary to
ensure that these materials do not become a proliferation risk,''
the draft said.
	   Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman, also part of the delegation
traveling with Clinton, sharply disagreed with critics who said
Clinton should have scrapped the summit.
	   ``It's very prudent,'' Bingaman said. ``The president needed to
come and there are important things to discuss between the two
countries.''
	   Just before meeting Clinton, Yeltsin said at a Moscow school,
``Clinton and I know one another well, and we are friends.''
	   With Russia reeling from a political and economic crisis,
Yeltsin formally welcomed Clinton outside the Kremlin after
wreath-laying at Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
	   At the start of their meeting, Yeltsin presented Clinton with a
loaf of salted bread, a traditional East European symbol of
welcome. Clinton pushed at the bread with the heel of his hand, and
it sprang back up.
	   ``Amazing, kind of like you,'' Clinton told his embattled host
	   The welcome projected a business-as-usual air as the leaders'
meetings got underway.
	   Earlier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, acting prime minister, met Clinton
and his wife, Hillary, at the Moscow airport.
	   Yeltsin opened the day still focused on his domestic woes,
saying at a Moscow school that he would ``insist'' the parliament
reverse itself and accept Chernomyrdin's appointment. The body
overwhelmingly rejected his nomination on Monday.
	   Burdened with his own political and personal problems back home,
such as the Monica Lewinsky affair, and hoping to get a boost from
summiteering, Clinton pledged continued U.S. support for Russia as
long as its leaders ``stay on the path of reform'' and do not
revert to the communist ways of the past.

Kazak president: Russia's crisis will be felt, but not to worry

	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ President Nursultan Nazarbayev said
Tuesday that shock waves from Russia's economic crisis would hit
Kazakstan, and appealed to his compatriots to stay calm.
	   Nazarbayev also appealed to foreign investors in the Central
Asian nation, pledging to create favorable conditions for their
work and stressing that Kazakstan is no longer part of the Soviet
empire and should be regarded separately from Russia, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``Attempts to compare Kazakstan and Russia are absolutely
unfounded,'' Nazarbayev told a parliament session in the nation's
capital, Astana.
	   Many foreign companies have moved into Kazakstan to explore oil
fields near the Caspian Sea. Nazarbayev credits his policies with
attracting foreign investors, but he has lagged behind in political
and economic reform and does not permit challenges to his
authority.
	   Last week, Nazarbayev said that foreign investment in Kazakstan
totaled dlrs 11 billion since 1993.
	   At the parliament session Tuesday, Nazarbayev also touted
``positive tendencies in Kazakstan's economy,'' despite the effects
of Russia's crisis.
	   He told lawmakers that Kazakstan's gross domestic product
totaled 735.6 billion tenge (dlrs 9.4 billion) in the first half of
this year, up 2.2 percent from the same period last year. Foreign
trade turnover was up 5 percent, reaching dlrs 7.2 million in the
first half of 1998, he said.
	   The state's debt was just over 12 percent of the GDP, he said.
	   Nazarbayev also said that inflation was 3.4 percent as of Aug.
1, down from 7.5 percent in the first half of 1997, Interfax
reported.

Severe water shortages in Western Saudi cities due to heat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Severe water shortages in the
Western cities of Jiddah and Mecca because of scorching heat are
expected to ease soon, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The Arabic-language Okaz paper quoted Mohammed Ali al-Faghr, an
official with the Mecca water department, as saying that several of
the country's desalination plants would be increasing output so
that ``the shortage will be resolved within the next few days.''
	   Problems began about a month ago, residents said. They noted
that the demand for water was higher than usual because of
temperatures hovering near 40 Centigrade (104 Fahrenheit) and
humidity registering about 75 percent.
	   Over the past week, residents of the Red Sea port city of Jiddah
and the holy city of Mecca, which together have some five million
residents, have had to make do with a couple hours of water service
a day.
	   Families have been been buying water privately, and prices have
gone up, Al-Bilad newspaper reported Monday. The paper said the
price of drinking water had risen from 1 riyal (25 cents) a ton to
600 riyals (dlrs 160) a ton and that families have to wait several
days to get it.
	   Saudi Arabia relies solely on desalinization plants for its
water supply. There are 23 plants processing 715 million cubic
meters (250 billion cubic feet) annually from the Gulf and the Red
Sea.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the second day in a row, Japan's stock market
defied the example of Wall Street and nearly every other major
index in the world and closed sharply higher Tuesday.
	   But many analysts saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given
how wildly the stocks gyrated _ and some pointed at a temporary
intervention by government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who tried to
reassure Americans that despite the big fall on Wall Street Monday
the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.
	   U.S. stocks started higher Tuesday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average gaining 107.36 points at 7,646.43 in the opening
minutes of trading, a gain of 1.4 percent.

Montenegrin president predicts breakup of present Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro's president predicted
Tuesday that his republic and Serbia, which together make up
Yugoslavia, would someday dissolve their union because of federal
President Slobodan Milosevic's disregard for its much smaller
partner.
	   In an interview with Vijesti daily, the Milo Djukanovic accused
Milosevic of autocratic rule and disregard of Montenegro in the
Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Yugoslavia will break up, not because of Montenegrin
separatism, but because of political and economic rotting, which
began long ago because of the autocratic rule of one man,''
Djukanovic said.
	   Djukanovic, a pro-Western politician who became president of
Montenegro this year, is at odds with Milosevic over many issues.
	   Their rift culminated earlier this year when Milosevic appointed
his protege in Montenegro, Momir Bulatovic, to the post of the
federal premier without the approval of Montenegrin officials.
	   Bulatovic, a former president of Montenegro, lost elections this
spring to Djukanovic.
	   Serbia and Montenegro, which remained in Yugoslavia after other
republics seceded, should share power on a federal level, although
Montenegro is much smaller.
	   Djukanovic said Milosevic can save Yugoslavia if he replaces
Bulatovic and lets Djukanovic's camp name the federal premier.
	   ``If the contrary happens, Montenegro will not accept the
decisions of the so-called federal government ... and that would
lead directly to the breakup of the federal state,'' he said.

Supreme Court clears way for dismissal of Subic freeport chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court cleared
the way Tuesday for President Joseph Estrada to remove an
industrial zone official who refused to leave his post after being
fired.
	   In a two-page resolution, the high tribunal said Richard Gordon,
ousted chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, failed to
present convincing arguments to overturn a lower court ruling last
Aug. 21.
	   Estrada has replaced Gordon with a top critic, Felicisimo
Payumo, but Gordon has refused to step down.
	   Gordon argues that he has a six-year term after he was
re-appointed in February by former President Fidel Ramos. He has
held the post since 1992.
	   Gordon's supporters barricaded the freeport's headquarters
building to prevent his ouster until police forced them out in a
clash that injured more than 100 people in July. Gordon and his
supporters then occupied another building.
	   Payumo set up an office at the local airport.
	   Gordon was unavailable for comment. He still has 15 days to make
a final appeal.
	   Payumo said he was happy about the court's decision and urged
Gordon to order his followers camped in the freeport to disperse.
	   ``We welcome the decision of the Supreme Court, as it vindicates
the rightness of our position all along,'' said Payumo. ``It is
either cowardice nor treason to Mr. Gordon's cause for his
followers to respect the majesty of the law.''
	   The dispute over the freeport's leadership has caused confusion
among investors, many of whom don't know who to deal with when
renewing business permits or paying fees.
	   Subic, a former U.S. naval base 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Manila, was converted into an industrial and tourism center after
the Americans left in 1992. It has since become the showcase of
Philippine economic growth.

All-Ireland match for Omagh bombing victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ireland could meet Northern Ireland in a
rare international soccer series to raise money for the victims of
the Omagh bomb tragedy.
	   The Football Association of Ireland, based in Dublin, said
Tuesday it had joint plans with Northern Ireland's Irish Football
Assocation for a two-match series to be played in Dublin and
Belfast.
	   FAI chief executive Bernard O'Byrne said an agreement had been
reached between the two organizations and only dates, probably in
November and February, had to be confirmed.
	   Ireland manager Mick McCarthy, currently in Dublin preparing his
side for its European Championship qualifier against Croatia on
Saturday, has already backed the proposal and his Northern Ireland
conterpart, Lawrie McMenemy, is also expected to agree.
	   ``I cannot imagine anybody who wouldn't help such a cause,''
McCarthy said Tuesday.
	   ``We must all pull together at international and club level to
make sure that these games go ahead to help the victims of the
bombing and their families.''
	   The political divide which separates the two countries has meant
the two sides have met only eight times since 1978, the last match
resulting in a 1-1 draw at Dublin in March 1995.
	   Northern Ireland canceled an international match against Malta
scheduled on Aug. 19 as a sign of respect for the victims of
Northern Ireland's single worst terrorist attack in 30 years.
	   A car bomb killed 28 people and injured more than 220 when it
exploded in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, 70 miles west of
Belfast, on Aug. 15.
	   Northern Ireland plays its opening European Championship
qualifying match against Turkey on Saturday.

Dutch government banned export of chemicals to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government banned a
shipment of chemicals to Sudan earlier this year because of fears
they might be used to make nerve gas, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   The shipment involved so-called ``dual-use'' chemicals which
have both a civilian and military application, said Economic
Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Paula de Jonge.
	   Although the Dutch exporter wanted to sell the chemicals as raw
materials for use in the manufacture of fertilizer, the ministry
``had indications that it might be used for other ends,'' De Jonge
said.
	   De Jonge would not say which chemicals were named on an April
export application or where in Sudan they were headed. She also
declined to say how the Dutch government decided there was a risk
the chemicals would be used for military ends.
	   On Aug. 20, the United States launched a cruise missile attack
that destroyed a Sudanese factory, which the U.S. government
claimed was making precursors for VX nerve gas.
	   The Sudanese government insists the El Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant manufactured only drugs.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was wounded Tuesday in a
mortar attack by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   The Israeli army confirmed that a soldier was ``very lightly
wounded in the attack, which apparently occurred while he was on
patrol. The army said no one was hurt in a second mortar barrage on
a fortified Israeli position.
	   The mortar attacks triggered retaliatory fire from Israeli
forces, the Lebanese officials said.
	   The incidents occurred near the village of Blatt, which is 5
kilometers (3 miles) from the Israeli border. Hezbollah issued a
statement claiming responsibility.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A unique high school aimed at
educating Czech Gypsies to become social workers opened Tuesday in
central Bohemia.
	   Jan Kejklicek, head of a regional schooling committee, said 45
students will study at the boarding school, the only one of its
kind in Europe. The school is located in Kolin, 60 kilometers (37
miles) east of Prague.
	   Graduates are expected to take jobs as assistants and advisers
in the state administration and help fellow Gypsies, also known as
Roma, in their dealings with authorities.
	   Emil Scuka, head of the Roma Civic Initiative, complained that
although ``all officials say that integration of Roma can be
reached through education only,'' the state never provides enough
funds, the news agency CTK reported.
	   But Kejklicek said the school was set up privately so the state
could not intervene. He stressed, however, that the project had the
state's full support.
	   The building housing the school was paid for by a foundation set
up by George Soros, U.S. financial wizard and philanthropist. The
Canadian and British embassies helped furnish it.
	   All the students are Roma, but only one teacher is Roma,
Kejklicek said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domingo Martinez hit a one-run double and Ken
Suzuki smashed two home runs as the Seibu Lions beat the Pacific
League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 9-4 at Tokyo Dome on
Tuesday.
	   The Fighters, who suffered their fourth straight defeat, still
are 2 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Lions, who extended their
winning streak to four.
	   The Lions led 4-3 when Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A
Rochester, doubled home a run and Norio Tanabe drove in another run
with a sacrifice fly in the fourth. Then the Lions went on to beat
the Fighters.
	   Suzuki, who hit a home run in the second and his second homer of
the game in the ninth, has 17 homers this season.
	   At Osaka Dome, Luis Lopez slugged a three-run home run in the
five-run seventh as the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks trounced the Kintetsu
Buffaloes 7-1. Lopez, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, has 15
homers.
	   At Chiba, former Milwaukee Brewers player Julio Franco ignited a
three-run fourth inning with a single, leading the Chiba Lotte
Marines to 3-2 victory over the Orix BlueWave.
	   In the Central League, the Yomiuri Giants rapped out 14 hits
with four home runs, including a homer by Hideki Matsui and downed
the front-running Yokohama BayStars 10-5 at Yokohama.
	   Matsui has 29 homers and leads the league.
	   The BayStars are still two games ahead of the second-place
Chunichi Dragons, who suffered a 5-3 defeat at the hands of the
Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Hiroshima.
	   The Dragons led 3-0 on Leo Gomez's two-run homer run in the
first inning and his second homer of the game in the seventh, both
against former Boston Red Sox hurler Nathan Minchey.
	   But pinch-hitter Alejandro Quesada smashed a two-run home run in
the bottom of the seventh, and Tomoaki Kanemoto belted a two-run
home run and Itsuki Asai drove in a run with a sacrifice fly in the
eighth for the Carp.
	   Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has 23 homers.
	   Quesada, a 20-year-old Dominican, has one homer, and Kanemoto

Record number of Hasids expected to celebrate new year in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Record numbers of Hasidic Jews are expected
in the Ukrainian city of Uman this month to take part in the annual
celebration of Jewish New Year, officials said Tuesday.
	   About 7,000 Hasidim from 20 countries are to arrive in Uman
between Sept. 16 and Sept. 28 to celebrate the holiday, known as
Rosh Hashana, said Hennady Naumenko, the deputy chairman of the
State Committee for Tourism.
	   The believers will gather at the 19th-century grave of their
spiritual leader, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav.
	   Naumenko said the Ukrainian government welcomes the Hasidim and
is taking all necessary measures to make their stay in Uman
comfortable.
	   He said several Ukrainian tour agencies were negotiating with
local residents to rent their apartments to the guests.
	   Also, special bus routes to Uman from the Black Sea port of
Odessa and Kiev's Boryspil airport are being organized to transport
the Hasidim.
	   Naumenko told a news conference that the number of Hasidic Jews
coming to Uman to mark Rosh Hashana has been increasing steadily
each year since the end of the 1980s, when the then-Soviet
government lifted restrictions on celebrating the holiday.
	   During the decades of Soviet rule, Nachman's followers secretly
made their way to the central Ukrainian city of 100,000 people to
discreetly pay homage at the tombstone on a crumbling street.
	   Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, the yearly pilgrimage has grown
into a major annual event in Ukraine.
	   Thousands of Jews used to live in Uman, but more than a century
of pogroms, Stalinist repression, Nazi massacres and emigration
have cut their number down to just a few hundred.

Israeli soldier, Lebanese civilian wounded in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was wounded Tuesday when
Hezbollah guerrillas fired mortars at his post in southern Lebanon,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate confirmation from Israel of the attack,
which triggered retaliatory fire from Israeli forces.
	   The incident occurred near the village of Blatt, which is five
kilometers (three miles) from the Israeli border. Hezbollah issued
a statement claiming responsibility.
	   Earlier, a Lebanese woman was hit by shrapnel when shells fired
by Israeli-backed militiamen exploded near her home in Mashghara,
the security officials said.
	   They said Fatmeh Hijazi, 45, was treated at a local hospital and
released. The officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
Several houses also were damaged in the shelling.
	   It was not immediate clear what prompted the early morning
shelling, which the officials blamed on the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia.
	   Israeli shells exploded Aug. 25 in Mashghara, injuring six
Lebanese civilians, including a 6-year-old boy. The incident
triggered a rocket barrage on northern Israeli towns and
settlements by Hezbollah that injured 19 civilians.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from Israel's
self-styled ``security zone'' in south Lebanon. Israel set up the
zone in 1985 to try to protect its northern settlements from
cross-border guerrilla raids.

Chernomyrdin urges government approval now
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said
Tuesday he was submitting proposals for his new Cabinet to
President Boris Yeltsin despite parliament's rejection of his
candidacy the previous day.
	   Chernomyrdin, who clings to hopes of winning confirmation by the
lower chamber of parliament, the State Duma, in another vote as
soon as Friday, told his acting ministers that Russia must form a
government without delay.
	   ``Lack of action can throw us all back a few years,'' the
Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. ``This won't
happen. To allow such an outcome is impossible under any
circumstances.''
	   To ensure a quick appointment of a new government, Chernomyrdin
is prepared for ``any talks'' with political parties and movements,
as well as parliamentary factions, Interfax and the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   His choices for ministers' spots have not yet been revealed.
	   Earlier, in a Kremlin discussion among top U.S. and Russian
officials, he pledged to make tax cuts and take other ``radical
steps'' to change the taxation system.
	   He also reaffirmed that the government would ensure the safety
of personal bank deposits.

Goalkeeper Ladic to play Euro 2000 qualifier; Boksic and Suker out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Drazen Ladic, the Croatian goalkeeper who
was widely praised for his World Cup performance, will join the
national team for its Euro 2000 qualifying match Saturday against
Ireland _ at President Franjo Tudjman's request.
	   Ladic, who plays for the Zagreb team Croatia, earlier told Coach
Miroslav Ciro Blazevic not to call him to the squad, saying France
98 was the pinnacle of his career.
	   But Croatian newspapers reported Tuesday that Ladic changed his
mind after Tudjman personally insisted he should play.
	   ``The coach told me the president wants me to play,'' Ladic told
Sportske Novosti daily. ``When I hesitated, Blazevic said: `OK, you
call him on the phone and tell him you won't play.'
	   ``But I couldn't do that,'' Ladic admitted.
	   Tudjman controls all walks of life in Croatia, including his
passion _ soccer.
	   He regularly attends major soccer matches, including the France
98 semifinals in which Croatia won bronze. Tudjman later awarded
medals to the players for their achievement.
	   A few years ago, Tudjman changed the Zagreb team's name from
Dinamo to Croatia. Most of the fans refuse to accept the change and
still cheer ``Dinamo'' at matches, although Tudjman is in the
stands.
	   Blazevic faces some setbacks for Saturday's match: Alen Boksic,
who initially was named to the roster, won't play because he hasn't
recovered from knee surgery. Boksic, a striker with Italy's Lazio,
missed the World Cup because of surgery.
	   Davor Suker, the No. 1 World Cup striker, cannot play either
because of an unspecified minor injury. Suker plays with Spain's
Real Madrid.
	   Blazevic had to call another striker, Igor Pamic, who plays in
Rostock, Germany.
	   Robert Prosinecki, who doesn't get along with Blazevic, is also
out of the lineup, as well as six other bronze-winning players who
have suffered slight injuries.
	   Blazevic is expected to announce a new, final lineup later this
week.

Russians skeptical Clinton can help Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Many Russians don't understand why Bill Clinton is
in such hot water these days, saying the president is entitled to
his private life.
	   Russians seem untroubled by Clinton's admission of an affair
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Some are frankly
incredulous that the president, who arrived Tuesday for a two-day
summit, got in so much trouble because of it.
	   ``We need a healthy president who knows how to run the country,
who thinks, who has good ideas,'' said Alexander, a 42-year-old
driver who refused to give his last name.
	   ``Clinton is one of the great presidents, like Roosevelt. He's a
young guy. My God, that affair wasn't a big deal at all.''
	   Other Russians said they had no problem separating affairs with
interns from affairs of state.
	   ``How can we not respect him?'' said Galina Borovitskaya, a
teacher who was selling grapes to make extra income. ``Maybe the
affair wasn't right, but as a president, as a leader, I still trust
him.''
	   Many Russians approve of Clinton, with women saying they like
him because he is romantic, according to some opinion polls.
	   Few Russians are looking to Clinton to rescue Russia from
crisis. To most people the two-day state visit is, at best, a
distraction from their own troubles: failing banks, falling
currency, and a power struggle in the government.
	   ``Maybe they'll come to some agreement, but what we need must
come from within,'' said Pavel Brilyov, a 23-year-old security
guard. ``He can say `You can do this, do that differently,' but it
won't change anything.''
	   They are far less forgiving of what they see as Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's performance as the country has staggered
through the financial crisis.
	   If Clinton's visit has elicited criticism, it has been on
nationalist grounds.
	   ``We are already totally dependent on America,'' said Natasha
Lyubimova, a housewife. ``Clinton is playing a game with our
economy.''
	   Lyubimova did not condemn Clinton, but worried about his wife
Hillary.
	   ``I'm sad for her. Not just sad _ this sort of thing happens all
the time to so many people, but everybody is focusing on her.''

Indian industrialist group drops plan to set up domestic airline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Frustrated by government delays and
opposition from trade unions, India's top industrial group said
Tuesday it is canceling plans to set up a domestic airline.
	   Tata Industries Ltd. accused the Civil Aviation Ministry of
stalling its proposal to set up a dlrs 14.75 billion airline even
though it had met all regulations. It said the ministry gave no
reason for delaying the project, which has been pending with
successive governments for the past three years.
	   Last week, the government deferred a decision on the project for
the fourth time after lawmakers and trade unions said the new
airline would pose a serious threat to the state-run Indian
Airlines.
	   India opened up its sky in 1992 and several private airlines
began domestic operations two years later.
	   The Tata group originally proposed setting up a domestic airline
in collaboration with Singapore Airlines, but the government
rejected the application after changing the civil aviation policy
to ban foreign airlines from investing in domestic airline
companies.
	   The group then decided to set up the airline on its own.
	   On Tuesday, the Tata group said in a statement its proposal
``remained on paper due to the inability of four successive
governments to implement their own policies.''
	   ``Given the absence of a credible time-frame for a decision,
Tatas have withdrawn their application and project,'' it said.
	   Citing similar reasons, the group had earlier withdrawn a
proposal to build an international airport at Bangalore in southern
India. The airport was to be jointly built by the Tata Group,
Singapore's Changi Airport Authority and Raytheon Inc. of the
United States.

Court orders network to air ad by far-right party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ A state court ruled Tuesday that the
national television network SAT-1 must air a campaign spot for a
far-right party, saying that it violates no laws.
	   SAT-1 and competing network RTL both have refused to run the
spot that claims the founders of Germany's postwar democracy would
support the Republican party's campaign. Both cited laws protecting
the legacy of deceased politicians.
	   The party has lodged a separate complaint against RTL.
	   SAT-1 said it regretted that the Mainz state court ``is forcing
us to show our viewers this ad. Its content remains irreconcilable
with our understanding of democracy.''
	   The network said it would start running the spot later Tuesday.
	   The Republicans are running a national campaign for the Sept. 27
elections, seeking to capitalize on momentum gained by another
right-wing party that won seats in the Saxony Anhalt state
parliament in April.
	   Parties need at least 5 percent of the vote to enter the lower
house of parliament.

 &UR; Netanyahu says deal was close as negotiator confirms secret talks

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday that back-peddling by the Palestinians
disrupted chances several days ago to wrap up a deal over a West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The prime minister's comments came as a Palestinian negotiator
confirmed that secret talks were still under way between the sides
despite the disagreements over the scope of the withdrawal.
	   U.S. mediators told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last month
he could not count on high-profile U.S. involvement to coax Israel
into a deal and that the Palestinians must negotiate with Israel
directly.
	   The low-key talks have been conducted by the speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, and Yitzhak Molcho,
an attorney and confidant of Netanyahu.
	   Qureia said Tuesday that many differences remained. ``There are
contacts, but there is no agreement,'' Qureia told The Associated
Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger Israel's security.
	   However, earlier this month, Israel for the first time agreed in
writing to a 13 percent pullback, with several conditions attached.
	   ``We were very close, very close to an agreement on the
negotiations with the Palestinians a few days ago,'' Netanyahu told
a conference on Middle East affairs. ``There has been a retreat on
the Palestinian side and I think it's important that the
Palestinians come back to the table and restore and move on
understandings that were achieved in the negotiations,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu did not disclose what had been agreed upon but it was
not the first time in recent weeks that Israeli officials have said
	   they were close to a deal. The Palestinians have long accused
Israel of inflating progress in order to deflect U.S. pressure.
	   Excerpts from the document Molcho handed to Qureia were
published Monday in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The document appeared
to contradict assurances Netanyahu reportedly gave to hardline
Cabinet minister Limor Livnat last month that Israel had not
committed itself to 13 percent in writing. Netanyahu aides were
quoted as playing down the document, saying it was an unsigned
working paper.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from the far right-wing in his
coalition and the influential Jewish settler lobby to cede as
little land as possible.
	   Tuesday, he said complained that personal political risks he had
taken for the peace process were not being matched by his
Palestinian counterpart.
	   ``It cannot be that while I am indicating my willingness to risk
political concession and political attacks, the Palestinian side
takes no risks, and they only address one side of the equation,''
Netanyahu said.
	   A key sticking point is Israel's demand that 3 percent of the
land be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinians will not be
allowed to build. Overall control over security would remain in
Israeli hands.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that in the future they will take
full control of areas designated nature reserves. They also want
Palestinian police to be able to operate in those areas.
	   In a sign of some U.S. involvement, CIA officials met recently
with Arafat's security chiefs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, to review understandings about
security cooperation and the Palestinians' war against terrorism
that were worked out in December.
	   The understandings _ negotiated at the time by Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. security officials _ specify, for example,
that the United States would have a say in whether Islamic
militants could be released from Palestinian jails.
	   The understandings were never put into practice because
Netanyahu refused to approve them, arguing at the time that Israel
should have a bigger role in monitoring Palestinian compliance.
	   Rajoub said Tuesday that the Palestinians would not agree to
changes in the document. ``It stands as it is,'' he said.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Minister for Social Reintegration
Albino Malungo said Tuesday it could take some 300 years for Angola
to be cleared of land mines.
	   Malungo was speaking at a seminar on ``The Consequences of Land
Mines'' to coincide with the first anniversary of the death of
Britain's Princess Diana, who brought worldwide publicity to the
anti-mine crusade of the Red Cross.
	   The government official said 14,790 mines had been removed and
68,990 explosives deactivated since a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace
accord halted a two-decade civil war between former UNITA rebels
and the government.
	   Fighting in recent months has endangered the peace settlement
and led to the laying of new mines.
	   Malungo said more than 6,000 mine fields had been discovered,
but criticized UNITA for not revealing the exact location of the
mines it planted. The former rebels have said they have no maps.
	   The vast Southwest African country is one of the world's most
mined countries, with an estimated 9 to 20 million mines.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Fourteen members of a soccer team in
southeastern Nigeria were presumed drowned when their boat capsized
as they were returning from a match in a neighboring village,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The accident occurred Sunday as members of the Ronaldo Football
Club from the town of Warri, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east
of the commercial capital of Lagos, were taking a 15-minute boat
ride home from nearby Aladja along the lagoon, according to several
Lagos daily papers.
	   Survivors said the boat tipped over when its owner tried to turn
it around after an argument with players over fares. Only eight
team members made it to shore.
	   Grief-stricken parents and family members camped by the river
most of Sunday night waiting for searchers to find bodies. By noon
Monday, five corpses had reportedly been recovered.
	   Although no figures are available, hundreds and possibly
thousands of people are believed killed every year in boating
mishaps on Nigerian rivers and coastal areas.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The government has freed 277
Sierra Leonean peacekeepers who were arrested more than five months
ago on suspicion of backing the West African country's ousted
military junta, officials said.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah announced in a state radio
broadcast Monday evening that authorities were releasing the
prisoners because they had not discovered any evidence of
wrongdoing.
	   A military official said Tuesday on condition of anonymity
Tuesday that the freed soldiers would rejoin the West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG and likely be deployed to patrol
rebel-plagued areas in Sierra Leone's interior.
	   The soldiers were arrested in neighboring Liberia in mid March
without being charged. They were transferred to Sierra Leone after
Kabbah returned to power following the ouster of junta leader Lt.
Col. Johnny Paul Koroma by Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops.
	   At the time of their arrest, the detainees were themselves
members of Sierra Leone's 370-strong contingent in ECOMOG
peacekeeping Liberian peacekeeping operations.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Up to 3,000 metalworkers protested
downtown in the capital to support wage demands by auto workers,
who went on strike Tuesday.
	   The protesters marched to the offices of the South African Motor
Industry Employers' Association.
	   A number of workers from the engineering and auto parts industry
took part in solidarity with metalworkers.
	   The metalworkers union has rejected a 4.5 percent increase on
minimum wages offered by employers in the motor industry, and is
demanding a pay rise of between 12 and 18 percent.

oil in this tiny archipelago off West Africa has made a dlrs 3
million payment to the government as part of a joint-venture deal,
a central bank spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The payment was the second and final instalment of a dlrs 5
million package negotiated between Environmental Remediation
Holding Corp. and the government, the source said on condition of
anonymity.
	   ERH Corp. and the government set up a joint-venture company in
July to develop the country's oil and gas reserves. Drilling is to
begin later this year.
	   The U.S. firm started offshore oil exploration in July 1997 but
has not released estimates of the reserve size.
	   Oil exports could provide a major boost to the economy of this
impoverished population of 100,000, who rely mainly on the export
of tropical produce including cocoa.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Two of the country's largest
newspaper publishers plan to launch a Sunday newspaper to serve
mainly black readers.
	   Times Media Limited and New Africa Publications would jointly
publish Sunday World, to be distributed around Johannesburg and
into the northern and eastern parts of South Africa, TML chairman
Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday.
	   The publishers planned a March debut for the initial run of
about 100,000 copies.
	   Ramaphosa said the paper would target more than 700,000 mostly
black readers of the daily Sowetan, published in the black township
of Soweto outside Johannesburg, who he said currently do not read a
Sunday newspaper.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ President Joaquim Chissano met with
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, who ended a three-day state
visit on Tuesday.
	   The Algerian delegation included ministers of trade, foreign
affairs, agriculture and industry, who participated in talks
preparing for a joint cooperation commission meeting in December in
Algiers.
	   ``We need a strong and stable southern Africa to consolidate the
negotiating capacity with only one voice,'' Zeroual said at a
banquet on Monday.
	   Chissano received training as a freedom fighter in Algeria in
the 1960s, when FRELIMO _ the Portuguese acronym for Mozambique
Liberation Front _ was seeking to unseat the Portuguese colonial
rulers.
	   FRELIMO has ruled since independence in 1975.

Iran begins military exercises with parade near Afghan border

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran began wide-scale military exercises
Tuesday with a parade near the border with Afghanistan, where
Tehran claims that the Taliban militia is holding 47 Iranians.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers kicked off the maneuvers,
codenamed Ashura 3, with a parade in Torbat-e Jam in northeastern
Khorasan province.
	   The actual exercises are to begin Wednesday, and ground and air
troops from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the
volunteer Basij Resistance Forces will take part.
	   The three-day maneuvers, the largest this year, are the first
near the border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. They are named
``Ashura'' for the holiday marking the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's
most revered figure, Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Mohammed.
	   The Guard Corps commander, Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, told
the assembled troops that ``Iran will not tolerate foreign
interference at its borders ... and will defend its territorial
integrity,'' according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. The detainees include 11
diplomats, a journalist and 35 truck drivers.
	   Safavi also warned the United States and Israel against attempts
to destabilize the region, saying their efforts would backfire.
	   ``Insecurity in the region will also affect themselves,'' Safavi
was quoted as saying. ``I hope our friends have got the message and
the enemies pay heed to our advice,'' he said.
	   Earlier, a senior military official was quoted as saying that
the aim of the exercises was to test new weapons and strengthen
Iran's defensive capabilities.
	   ``The military exercises are not aimed for any invasion of
neighboring Afghanistan,'' IRNA quoted Brig. Gen. Hussein Salami as
saying.

Italian federation doctor suggests Austrians use drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A doctor with the Italian winter sports
federation has suggested that top Austrian skiers, including
Olympic gold medalist Hermann Maier, use performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   In an interview in the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper, Herbert
Schonhuber said he had no proof of doping but questioned the
increase in muscle mass of Maier and downhiller Andreas Schifferer.
	   Schonhuber, head of the Italian federation's medical commission,
said the muscle growth is ``impossible with normal weight work or
with electro-stimulation. You can't get them with clean methods.''
	   Schonhuber said that both Maier and Schifferer worked with Bernd
Pansold, a doctor on trial in Berlin _ along with other
communist-era sports figures _ for harming East German swimmers
with performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``I don't have proof of doping,'' the Italian doctor was quoted
as saying in Gazzetta dello Sport's Saturday edition. ``But the
entire world of skiing has suspicions about results that don't have
explanations. Those increases in muscle mass can be achieved in two
ways: either with anabolic steroids or with Human Growth Hormone.
While the first can be detected in anti-doping tests, HGH can't be
detected. Whoever uses it remains unpunished.''
	   At the Nagano Games, Maier recovered from a spectacular fall in
the men's downhill to capture gold in the giant slalom and super-G
as Austria won 11 medals, its most ever in Olympic Alpine skiing.
	   ``At Nagano I couldn't sleep for four, five nights before the
start of the games,'' Schonhuber was quoted as saying. ``Our
(athletes) didn't take (banned substances) so I knew they did not
have a chance of winning. The results then confirmed my feeling.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The North Korea missile fired over Japan this week
not only stunned and dismayed Tokyo _ it also has defense planners
seriously worried about the nation's vulnerability to missile
attack.
	   Japan has no independent monitoring system to warn of such a
launching and had no way of knowing about the firing until
receiving word from the U.S. military, government spokesman Sadaaki
Numata said Tuesday.
	   The missile fired Monday was the first known demonstration by
North Korea of a rocket that can hit Japan, and provided a dramatic
reminder of the nation's shoddy antimissile defense.
	   Up to now, Japan has stalled making a firm decision on a
long-mulled proposal for joint research with the United States to
develop a missile defense system.
	   But Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Tuesday that the
missile may speed up talks about such a system.
	   ``Our relations with North Korea are going to be more severe
than they have ever been,'' he said.
	   In a Cabinet meeting held especially to discuss the North Korean
missile, many members brought up the missile defense system,
Japanese media reports said.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a theater missile defense system with the United States, and has
reportedly earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs. 3.6 million) for the
project next year.
	   But quick action is unlikely.
	   Defense is a sensitive issue in Japan, which is still haunted by
militarist policies before and during World War II. The pacifist
movement is a powerful lobby group, and the slightest sign of
heightened military might draws nervous protest from Asian
neighbors. And public opinion has been split over the antimissile
project.
	   Illustrating the divide, the liberal Asahi newspaper on Tuesday
warned against any hasty action and instead urged ``calm,'' while
the more conservative Yomiuri newspaper called for a prompt
go-ahead.
	   Tokyo, however, wasted no time in issuing a formal protest
against North Korea, denouncing the launch as ``dangerous.''
	   Numata, the government spokesman, lambasted as ``deplorable''
the firing of the missile, believed to be a new model with an
improved range called Taepo Dong 1.
	   North Korea was not likely to receive, at least for now, the
dlrs 1 billion Japan had promised for nuclear power plants, or any
additional food aid, Numata said.
	   ``If the firing was intentional, it's quite fair to say that a
war could have broken out,'' lawmaker Yoshiro Mori was quoted by
Kyodo News agency as saying.
	   Japan also abandoned its yearlong offer to resume talks aimed at
establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea, a Foreign Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   When Fukushiro Nukaga, Defense Agency director general, met his
South Korean counterpart in Tokyo Tuesday, he proposed setting up a
group of top defense officials from both nations that will meet
specifically to discuss North Korea's missile program.
	   The agency said it was first time Japan and South Korea had set
up such a group.
	   ``We agreed that the missile was a threat to both nations,''
Nukaga said.
	   South Korea's Defense Ministry said that both sides had agreed
that North Korea's action was ``an irresponsible military threat,''
and that the two nations promised to work together to track the
North's missile development.
	   Outside the Defense Agency in Tokyo, two right-wing trucks
blared slogans like: ``If the missile had landed on Japan, what a
disaster it'd have been!'' Several ultrarightists, wearing combat
boots and fatigues, shouted at the gate, demanding entrance, but
were turned away.
	   Also Tuesday, a military plane and ships sent to the Pacific
where the missile apparently landed searched for missile parts, the
Defense Agency said. The agency said it planned to analyze any
found parts.
	   Nonmilitary government ships and plane were sent to the Sea of
Japan where the first stage of the missile, or booster, was
believed to have landed.
	   North Korea remained mute on the missile in its official news
being monitored by the Radiopress agency in Tokyo.

Ukraine hopes to construct and sell landing ships for Greek navy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to construct several military
landing ships for the Greek navy, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The Ukrainian navy's landing vessel Donetsk is scheduled to
leave for Greece on Wednesday for two weeks of demonstration
maneuvers before representatives of the Greek Defense Ministry and
top navy commanders, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   If the ship performs well during the presentation, which is
scheduled to begin Saturday, a shipyard in the Crimean city of
Feodosia is likely to receive an order for construction of a few
such ships for the Greek navy, the Ukrainian navy press service
said, according to Interfax.
	   The Donetsk vessel has a 30-member crew and is capable of
carrying up to 10 amphibious tanks and 360 landing troops.

Severe water shortages in Western Saudi cities due to heat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Scorching heat has caused severe
water shortages in the western Saudi Arabian cities of Jiddah and
Mecca, where water service has been limited to two hours a day.
	   The shortages are expected to ease soon, the Arabic-language
Okaz paper reported Tuesday.
	   Several of the country's desalination plants would be increasing
output so ``the shortage will be resolved within the next few
days,'' Mohammed Ali al-Faghr, a Mecca water department official,
told the newspaper.
	   Problems began about a month ago, when the demand for water rose
with the temperatures, which have been hovering at about 104
degrees (40 degrees C) with humidity at 75 percent.
	   In the past week, the 5 million residents of the Red Sea port
city of Jiddah and the holy city of Mecca have had to make do with
a couple hours of water service a day.
	   The Al-Bilad newspaper reported that the price of drinking water
had risen from 1 riyal (25 cents) a ton to 600 riyals (dlrs 160) a
ton and that families have to wait several days to get it.
	   Saudi Arabia relies solely on desalinization plants for its
water supply. There are 23 plants processing water from the Gulf
and the Red Sea.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street's selloff resumed Tuesday after an
early buying spree failed to halt a rout that knocked 512 points
off the Dow industrials monday and more than wiped out all of this
year's gains.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up 143.41 in an early bid at a
rebound, was down 97.07 at 7,442.00 at midmorning. Broader
indicators also were giving up early gains.
	   Unlike past declines in a bull market that has prevailed since
October 1990, investors have been waiting for the market to rise to
sell stocks. In the past, big drops in stocks were awaited as
buying opportunities by bargain hunters.
	   Monday's 6.4 percent plunge was the second-biggest point drop
ever for Wall Street's best-known indicator. Only the Oct. 27, 1997
plunge of 554.26 points was larger. But it was only the 25th
largest percentage drop and well behind the 22.6 percent collapse
of ``Black Monday,'' when it fell 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987.
	   The selloff Monday, a drop of 512.61 to 7,539.07, left the Dow
down 19.3 percent from its July 17 record high of 9,337.97 and 4.7
percent below where it began the year. The selling spree, which
accelerated in the final hour of Monday's session, brought Wall
Street plunging toward its first bear market since 1990.
	   President Clinton Tuesday added his voice to efforts to restore
calm to shaken markets. ``We believe our fundamental economic
policy is sound,'' he said, echoing comments Monday by Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin.
	   There were fresh signs of economic strength in two private
reports Tuesday. A manufacturing group said its closely followed
index of industrial activity climbed in August, and a private
research group said the Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose
in July, halting a two-month decline and signaling the nation's
economy continues expanding at a moderate clip.
	   Stock markets in Asia and Europe gave more ground Tuesday in the
aftermath of Monday's slide on Wall Street. But Japan's stock
market closed sharply higher and European markets were cutting
their losses by this afternoon.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was off by 1.8 percent after being down by 3.3 percent. In Paris,
the CAC 40 index, once down 3.7 percent, was off 1.2 percent in
afternoon trading.
	   Analysts said they were concerned further declines may scare
away investors _ and drive down share prices even further over the
short term.
	   ``The more money is withdrawn and the more the indices fall,
then the worse the problem becomes. And it's difficult to see where
the floor is going to be in that sort of situation,'' said Richard
Jeffrey, chief economist at the London brokerage Charterhouse
Tilney.
	   In Russia, where the most recent round of selling began, trading
in the ruble was suspended for a fifth day, helping drive down
Russian stocks even further amid continuing political uncertainty.
	   Despite the second straight Japanese stock rise, many analysts
saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given how wildly the stocks
gyrated _ and some pointed to a temporary intervention by
government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than Clinton.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya.
	   Key indicators fell 2.9 percent in Hong Kong and 3.8 percent in
Singapore, which dropped to a 12-year low.
	   But Japan's main index gained 1.86 percent, continuing to
recover from Friday's swoon to a 12-year low. Many analysts
dismissed this week's recovery as a short technical rebound,
pointing out that many of the major problems weighing on Japan's
economy and stocks remained in place.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   To make matters worse, more bad news surfaced in Asia.
	   In Japan, the government sharply criticized communist North
Korea for firing a long-range ballistic missile over Japan's main
island and into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
	   Like U.S. officials, the Japanese government sees the test as a
dangerous development for the region's security.
	   In Hong Kong, investors found out that Standard and Poor's in
New York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's
ability to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   Standard and Poor's cited the severity of Hong Kong's recession
and the government's recent round of intervention in the stock and
stock futures markets, which it called ``an increasingly complex
and risky strategy'' to defend the territory's currency.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of its dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves to prop up the stock market in a
two-week battle with speculators. On Monday, when the government
stopped its buying, the stock index plunged 7.1 percent.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government _
well-known for its criticism of free markets and its feuding with
Singapore _ took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors.

Germany gets new soccer captain, Oliver Bierhoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Striker Oliver Bierhoff on Tuesday became the
captain of Germany's new-look national team, replacing Juergen
Klinsmann who retired after the World Cup.
	   ``I have decided for Oliver Bierhoff because he has a close link
to me,'' coach Berti Vogts said in Malta, where the Germans are
playing two exhibition games this week.
	   Bierhoff, 30, was the top scorer last season in the Italian
league, where he played for Udinese. He has transferred to AC
Milan.
	   The job went to Bierhoff although he angered Vogts recently by
publicly criticizing the coach's leadership style.
	   ``We've spoken about it, I gave him my point of view and there
are no problems,'' Bierhoff said. ``The captain has to have trust
in the coach and the other way around. This should not be shaken if
you have a different opinion once in a while.''
	   After getting eliminated in the quarterfinals of the World Cup,
Vogts is rebuilding the German team and has called up eight rookies
for the matches against Malta and Romania this week.
	   Vogts also plans to try out a new system by scrapping the
sweeper, or libero, position, which has been a key role in the
German team for more than 20 years.
	   ``At the World Cup, all four semifinalists played with a
four-man back line,'' Vogts said.

Kohl: May have overrated Russia's ability to reform

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl admitted Tuesday
that he may have overrated Moscow's ability for market reform, but
he portrayed the Russia's financial crisis as a temporary setback.
	   He defended the West's policy of pumping billions in aid into
Russia to spur the transition to capitalism, saying the change
could not happen overnight.
	   ``From a German perspective, there was no alternative,'' he told
a news conference. ``It was in our elementary interest that Russia
finds its way.''
	   Asked whether he had overestimated Russia's capacity to reform,
he said, ``That may be.'' But he rejected the notion that the
country would slide back toward a communist-style command economy.
	   Kohl, who is running for a record fifth term, is using the
backdrop of global instability to promote himself as a reliable,
experienced leader in the final weeks of campaigning for Sept. 27
national elections.
	   He unveiled a series of TV ads and new campaign posters with a
slogan: ``Security, not risk.''
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel also sought to calm fears about the
effect of Russia's instability and turmoil in global markets,
saying the German economy is fundamentally sound.
	   In Frankfurt, Germany's blue-chip stock index was slightly lower
midday Tuesday after recovering from steep early losses linked to
the Russian crisis. The DAX was down 10.37 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 4823.52.
	   Kohl sought to remain unperturbed about Russia.
	   ``Our policy was the right one. I never said this will be a
policy without setbacks,'' he said. ``Has there ever been a time in
the last 100 years of Russian and Soviet policymaking when there
was no corruption?''
	   A European Union emergency meeting made little sense given the
struggle for power in Moscow, but EU leaders are drafting a
statement on Russia, he said.
	   ``There is no point in organizing a meeting right now and then
having nothing to show for it,'' he said.
	   Waigel said the government's growth forecast of nearly 3 percent
this year remains unchanged.
	   ``What's decisive is the fact that Germany's fundamental data
are sound,'' he said when asked to comment on Monday's sharp fall
in the U.S. stock market.

Two Germans arrested in anti-foreigner arson; no one injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Police arrested two Germans Tuesday
in connection with a deliberately set fire at a home for
asylum-seekers in central Germany.
	   The building's 10 residents were not at home at the time of the
blaze late Saturday in Warburg, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of Duesseldorf. The fire caused minimal damage.
	   The suspects, a 22-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man, face
possible arson charges.
	   Police said the woman told officers she wanted to drive away the
asylum-seekers not harm them, but that it didn't matter to her if
any had been killed.

Poland, Hungary say Russian crisis justifies shift to West
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Poland and
Hungary said Tuesday that Russia's crisis shows the wisdom of
joining trade and strategic alliances with the West.
	   Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi came to Warsaw to
discuss the Russian situation, trade relations and cooperation in
negotiating membership into the European Union.
	   He and Poland's Bronislaw Geremek stressed the two countries
were coping well with Russia's economic crisis, which Geremek said
provided ``new arguments in their drive to join NATO and the EU.''
	   Martonyi added: ``The crisis shows to the world that Poland and
Hungary belong to the West, that their economies are bound with the
Western economy.''
	   He blamed the recent fall of Hungary's forint currency on
Western investors selling shares to compensate for losses in
Russia. Hungary's government intervened twice last week to prop up
the forint.
	   In general, Martonyi said, Hungary's stock exchange and economy
were sound.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are preparing to join
NATO in April, and the two ministers agreed to hold regular
meetings that would include their defense ministers to discuss the
move.
	   They said the first such meeting would likely be in Budapest to
discuss, purchases of military equipment, including planes for
their air forces. No date was announced.
	   The two ministers also called the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA), which took affect in 1993, the region's greatest
success which contributed to growth in mutual trade. It covers
Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
Bulgaria will join it Jan. 1.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday that back-peddling by the Palestinians
disrupted chances several days ago to wrap up a deal over a West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The prime minister's comments came as a Palestinian negotiator
confirmed that secret talks were still under way between the sides
despite the disagreements over the scope of the withdrawal.
	   ``We were very close, very close to an agreement on the
negotiations with the Palestinians a few days ago,'' Netanyahu told
a conference on Middle East affairs. ``There has been a retreat on
the Palestinian side and I think it's important that the
Palestinians come back to the table and restore and move on
understandings that were achieved in the negotiations,'' he said.
	   U.S. mediators told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last month
he could not count on high-profile U.S. involvement to coax Israel
into a deal and that the Palestinians must negotiate directly with
Israel.
	   The low-key talks have been conducted by the speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, and Yitzhak Molcho,
an attorney and confidant of Netanyahu.
	   Qureia said Tuesday that many differences remained. ``There are
contacts, but there is no agreement,'' Qureia told The Associated
Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger Israel's security.
	   However, earlier this month, Israel for the first time agreed in
writing to a 13 percent pullback, with several conditions attached.
	   Netanyahu did not disclose what had been agreed upon in the
talks, but it was not the first time in recent weeks that Israeli
officials have said they were close to a deal. The Palestinians
have long accused Israel of inflating progress in order to deflect
U.S. pressure.
	   Excerpts from the document Molcho handed to Qureia were
published Monday in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The document appeared
to contradict assurances Netanyahu reportedly gave last month that
Israel had not committed itself in writing to the 13 percent
withdrawals. Netanyahu aides were quoted as saying it was an
unsigned working paper.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from the far right-wing in his
coalition and the influential Jewish settler lobby to cede as
little land as possible.
	   Tuesday, he said complained that personal political risks he had
taken for the peace process were not being matched by his
Palestinian counterpart.
	   ``It cannot be that while I am indicating my willingness to risk
political concession and political attacks, the Palestinian side
takes no risks, and they only address one side of the equation,''
Netanyahu said.
	   A key sticking point is Israel's demand that 3 percent of the
land be declared a nature reserve where Palestinians could not
build. Overall control over security would remain in Israeli hands.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that they will eventually take full
control of areas designated nature reserves. They also want
Palestinian police to be able to operate in those areas.

Japan suspends offer of normalization talks with North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Japan-NKorea Missile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will abandon its yearlong offer to resume
talks to establish diplomatic ties with North Korea because of that
country's firing of a missile over Japan, a Foreign Ministry
official said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other top Japanese leaders
reached the decision on Monday in a meeting over the missile, half
of which landed in the Sea of Japan and half in the Pacific.
	   Japan had offered to resume normalization talks without
conditions but will abandon this for the time being, the Foreign
Ministry spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The leaders _ Obuchi, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, Defense
Agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromo
Nonaka _ also agreed not to provide food aid to North Korea for
now.
	   In addition, they also agreed to suspend work on an
international project to build light-water reactors in North Korea,
in cooperation with the United States and South Korea.
	   Japan will consult with South Korea and the United States on
holding ministerial-level talks in New York on North Korea on the
sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly scheduled for late
September, the official said.
	   Talks aimed at normalizing bilateral relations with North Korea
began in January 1991, but collapsed after eight rounds of
negotiations in November 1992 when Pyongyang rejected Japan's
demand that it provide information on a Japanese woman allegedly
abducted by North Korean agents.
	   In August last year, the two countries agreed to reopen the
negotiations soon, but no such talks have been held since.
	   In 1995, Japan provided 500,000 tons of rice to North Korea and
500,000 dollars through the United Nations in emergency food aid to
the country. In 1996, Japan contributed dlrs 6 million dollars in
food aid through the United Nations.

One killed, three wounded in North Ossetia skirmish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One person was killed and three were wounded in a
firefight Tuesday between police and gunmen in the Caucasus region
of southern Russia, a news agency reported.
	   Unidentified attackers opened fire from a car after police
pulled them over in the region of North Ossetia, near the border
with the region of Ingushetia. The North Ossetian police returned
fire, killing one and injuring another, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Two policemen were wounded in the skirmish, one of them
seriously, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Police in North Ossetia reported that a house owned by an Ingush
man was blown up Monday night, according to ITAR-Tass. No one was
injured.
	   Ingushetia, a largely Muslim region, fought a bloody war with
North mostly Christian North Ossetia in 1992. Hundreds of people
were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.
	   The two sides accuse each other of orchestrating frequent
kidnappings and attacks that have occurred since then.
	   North Ossetia and Ingushetia lie in the mountainous northern
Caucasus. Breakaway Chechnya is also located in the volatile
region.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces attacked an ethnic
Albanian village southwest of here Tuesday after inhabitants
ignored a warning to surrender weapons following an ambush on a
Serb patrol, according to sources on both sides.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said the attack began
Tuesday morning on the village of Tusus, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) southwest of here. Smoke could be seen rising from four
other villages in the area, located near the border with Macedonia.
	   A source in the party of Kosovo's main Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, told The Associated Press that the attack began
after villagers ignored a warning by Serb police to hand over their
weapons or face attack.
	   The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Serb sources, also
asking not to be identified by name, confirmed ``skirmishes'' were
underway around the village, located near the town of Prizren.
	   According to the Serb sources, the operation began after
Albanian militants ambushed a Serb police patrol earlier in the
day.
	   Fighting has continued in this rebellious Serbian province
despite U.S. and European efforts to reach a cease-fire and begin
talks between the government and the Albanian leadership on
Kosovo's future.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the main province of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has promised to discuss autonomy -- favored by
the Americans and Europeans -- which he revoked in 1989.
	   But he has refused to grant independence, although Albanians
outnumber Serbs here by 9-to-one.
	   On Tuesday, a close Milosevic aide, Dragan Tomic, urged Kosovo
Albanian politicians to ``stop the agony of their own people'' and
open talks with the government.
	   Rugova has formed a panel Aug. 13 to negotiate with the
government. But so far, no face-to-face talks have been held. The
government accuses the Albanians of foot-dragging.
	   The Albanians have insisted that the Serbs first halt military
operations, which began Feb. 28 to destroy the KLA.

moving west across our islands and waters. A few clusters of
heavier showers were observed moving across eastern sections of
Puerto Rico leaving moderate rainfall amounts.
	   Widely scattered showers are expected this morning across the

scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms to develop across west
and interior Puerto Rico Tuesday afternoon with slightly less
activity across the Virgin Islands. A tropical wave just over 200
miles east of the lesser Antilles Tuesday morning is forecast to
move into the eastern Caribbean Wednesday and will encounter
Tuesday unstable upper atmosphere to produce widespread showers and
thunderstorms across the northeast Caribbean.
	   High pressure will begin to decrease across the northeast
Caribbean Tuesday evening as the tropical wave begins to reach the
extreme eastern Caribbean. Tuesday will produce a gradual increase
in wind and seas across the regional waters. A surface low pressure
system is expected to accompany the tropical wave into the eastern
Caribbean Wednesday afternoon and Thursday and could increase winds
across our Caribbean waters to 30 knots.

Europe's central bankers meet as global markets shudder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with comment by Belgian central banker &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As gloomy financial news piled up
around the world, Europe's central bankers met Tuesday to discuss
their continent's planned monetary union.
	   Belgian central bank chief Alfons Verplaetse told reporters
after the meeting that financial turbulence in Russia would have no
impact on the European Central Bank's monetary policy being drawn
up for the launch of the single currency in four months.
	   Verplaetse spoke after a regular meeting of the inner circle of
the European Central Bank, which will run the unified monetary
policy for the 11 European countries adopting the single currency,
or euro, on Jan. 1.
	   The governing council of the European Central Bank was meeting
for the first time since July.
	   Despite Russia's growing economic crisis, continued falls on
Asian and European stock markets and a 512-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial index Monday, economists said the bank's main
challenges still lie in getting monetary strategy right, not in
worrying about the weak global economy.
	   ``Asia and Russia are of course major concerns for central
banks, but what can they do?'' said Holger Schmieding, senior
European economist at U.S. investment house Merrill Lynch.
	   Outstanding issues include the important one of whether the
European Central Bank will use money supply or inflation data to
target monetary policy.
	   ``It's urgent for them. They have to start their policy on Jan.
1 next year and for that they have to get their strategy right,''
Schmieding said.
	   Concern that Russia's economic crisis could affect economic
growth in Europe has prompted some calls for cuts in interest rates
to boost economies.
	   On Monday, the new president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, Horst Koehler, said he couldn't
rule out that the Russian crisis could drag down Europe's growth.
	   Strong economic growth in the European Union and the United
States are key to stemming the current crises in Russia and Asia,
Koehler said. The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has
forecast growth in EU countries in 1998 will average about 3.6
percent.
	   No agenda was released ahead of the European Central Bank's
general council's first meeting since the summer break. The council
includes all 15 EU central bank chiefs and the European Central
Bank president and vice president.
	   Policy makers from the European Central Bank's governing board
met later. They include central bank chiefs from the 11 nations
launching the common currency and the six-member ECB's executive
board.
	   Countries joining the monetary union are Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Portugal and Finland.
	   The other four EU nations _ Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece
_ will not join immediately.

Indian flood spreads: over 1,100 dead, 10 million suffering

	   ITAUNJA, India (AP) _ Cobras and vipers slithered across deep
floodwaters Tuesday as raging rivers smothered new areas across the
stark countryside of northern India. Officials said the death toll
climbed to 1,118.
	   Nearly 10 million people in 23,300 villages in Uttar Pradesh _
India's most populous state with 150 million people _ were
displaced or lost their livelihood in the past three weeks, said
Ashok Kumar, the state relief commissioner.
	   The dead included 120 people who died of waterborne diseases.
Relief volunteers said the number was expected to go up once the
floodwaters started receding.
	   Next, they said, malnutrition would show.
	   ``The main problems right now are diarrhea, hepatitis and
cholera, and we expect malaria to follow,'' said Neeraj Bora, a
local doctor, who has visited several villages in a boat.
	   Villagers stranded in relief camps have little or no access to
drinking water and often used the same muddy water for bathing and
washing clothes.
	   ``Poisonous snakes like cobras, vipers and kraits are rushing
out of their pits and a large number of people have been killed by
snake bites,'' Bora said. Villagers took the snake-bitten patients
to witch doctors instead of hospitals, he added.
	   Most of those displaced by the floods or marooned in their
half-submerged homes are poor farmers, living in mud-thatched
houses in squalor-ridden Uttar Pradesh. In most of its 118,000
villages, there are no electricity or phones, and paved roads are
rare.
	   In Itaunja, a sleepy hamlet nearly 470 kilometers (295 miles)
southeast of New Delhi, hundreds of villagers jostled in front of a
truck as members of a political party distributed loaves of bread,
old clothes, candles and matchboxes.
	   ``There is no food. Our fields are drowned. There is water
everywhere in the village,'' said Kaushalya Devi, a nine-year-old
girl from Harda village, who stood at the back of the crowd.
	   A few meters (yards) away the narrow road on which she stood
sloped and disappeared into an ocean-like expanse of water, broken
by the top of submerged trees.
	   ``Most of the people in the villages in this area are here, but
several old people have stayed back to guard their homes,'' said
Bora, pointing to large clay mounds on which dozens of tents have
been pitched for days.
	   The government's Flood Control Center in Lucknow, the state
capital, said the state government had pumped one billion rupees
(dlrs 24 million) into the relief effort, and Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee sent an additional 15 million rupees (dlrs 360,000)
from his emergency fund.
	   The floods come after a series of landslides triggered by
torrential rains pulverized the Himalayan stretches in Uttar
Pradesh last month, killing nearly 350 people.
	   ``Over the past 31 years, we have not had floods like this,''
said Relief Commissioner Kaman.

Orient Express returns to Istanbul after 18 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ The famed Orient Express rolled into
Istanbul to a red-carpet welcome on Tuesday after an 18-year
absence.
	   A Janissary band playing old Ottoman tunes and people dressed in
turn-of-the-century costumes greeted the 120 passengers _ elegant
ladies and gentlemen in panama hats _ at Sirkeci train station.
	   The Orient Express, established in 1883 and connecting Paris to
Istanbul, was the first ever international luxury express train. It
was made even more famous by Agatha Christie's classic mystery
novel ``Murder on the Orient Express.''
	   The one-way ticket from Paris to Istanbul costs dlrs 4,625. The
five-day, four-night trip crosses seven countries.
	   The Orient Express stopped making regular runs to Istanbul in
1977, but has made a few visits since, the last in 1980.

Unique high school for Gypsies opens in Bohemia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A high school to educate Czech
Gypsies to become social workers opened Tuesday in central Bohemia.
	   Jan Kejklicek, head of a regional schooling committee, said 45
students will study at the boarding school, the only one of its
kind in Europe. The school is located in Kolin, 60 kilometers (40
miles) east of Prague.
	   Graduates are expected to take jobs as assistants and advisers
in the state administration and help fellow Gypsies, also known as
Roma, in their dealings with authorities.
	   Emil Scuka, head of the Roma Civic Initiative, complained that
although ``all officials say that integration of Roma can be
reached through education only,'' the state never provides enough
funds, the news agency CTK reported.
	   But Kejklicek said the school was set up privately so the state
could not intervene. He stressed, however, that the project had the
state's full support.
	   The building housing the school was paid for by a foundation set
up by George Soros, U.S. financial wizard and philanthropist. The
Canadian and British embassies helped furnish it.
	   All the students are Roma, but only one teacher is Roma,
Kejklicek said.

Kohl: May have overrated Russia's ability to reform

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl admitted Tuesday
that he may have overrated Moscow's ability for market reform, but
he portrayed the Russia's financial crisis as a temporary setback.
	   Kohl, who is running for a record fifth term partly on his
experience as a statesman, defended the West's policy of pumping
billions into Russia to bring about capitalism. He said the change
could not happen overnight.
	   ``From a German perspective, there was no alternative,'' he told
a news conference. ``It was in our elementary interest that Russia
finds its way.''
	   But asked whether he had overestimated Russia's capacity to
reform, he said, ``That may be.''
	   Kohl's attempt to capitalize on global instability to promote
himself as a reliable leader for Sept. 27 national elections drew
scorn from the opposition Social Democrats, whose candidate Gerhard
Schroeder leads in the polls.
	   The party's general manager called it ``a sign of helplessness''
and said Kohl was trying to distract from his failure to tackle
Germany's own problems, such as unemployment.
	   Kohl's staunch backing of his ``sauna friend'' Boris Yeltsin was
``a poor argument'' for the chancellor's competence, Franz
Muentefering said in an interview in Tuesday's Berliner Morgenpost
daily.
	   Undaunted, Kohl and his Christian Democrats unveiled a series of
TV ads and new campaign posters with a slogan: ``Security, not
risk.''
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel also sought to calm fears about the
effect of Russia's instability and turmoil in global markets,
saying the German economy is fundamentally sound.
	   In Frankfurt, Germany's blue-chip stock index was slightly lower
midday Tuesday after recovering from steep early losses linked to
the Russian crisis. The DAX was down 10.37 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 4823.52.
	   Kohl sought to remain unperturbed about Russia.
	   ``Our policy was the right one. I never said this will be a
policy without setbacks,'' he said. ``Has there ever been a time in
the last 100 years of Russian and Soviet policymaking when there
was no corruption?''
	   A European Union emergency meeting made little sense given the
struggle for power in Moscow, but EU leaders are drafting a
statement on Russia, he said. Kohl said it would be delivered in
the next few days.
	   ``There is no point in organizing a meeting right now and then
having nothing to show for it,'' he said.
	   Waigel said the government's growth forecast of nearly 3 percent
this year remains unchanged.
	   ``What's decisive is the fact that Germany's fundamental data
are sound,'' he said when asked to comment on Monday's sharp fall
in the U.S. stock market.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 1,300 firefighters have been
dispatched to contain blazes that have ravaged forests on Ukraine's
Crimean peninsula, officials said Tuesday.
	   One fire that started near the Ai-Petri Mountain on Sunday has
spread over some 100 hectares (2,470 acres) and is continuing to
grow, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Four other fires erupted in the Crimean mountains over the last
two days, including one in a government-protected state forest
reserve. Two of those blazes have already been put out.

Catholic bishop says he welcomes dialogue, but wants action, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The head of Romania's Eastern Rite
Catholics said dialogue isn't enough, and called Tuesday for the
Orthodox Church to return two cathedrals and dozens of parish
churches.
	   Eastern Rite Bishop Lucian Muresan said communists seized 2,500
Catholic churches in 1948 and the religion was banned. Only a
handful of buildings have been returned since communism ended nine
years ago and religious freedoms were extended.
	   ``We are not asking for the absurd or the impossible,'' said
Muresan during a meeting of world religious leaders to discuss
harmony and pray for peace.
	   He said his church wanted two cathedrals and 74 parish churches
returned.
	   The communists gave the seized churches to the Orthodox Church,
to which 90 percent of Romanians belong.
	   The Orthodox Church wants each community to decide the
denomination of local churches and wants Eastern Rite Catholics to
stop taking the dispute to court. The Catholics have won several
cases in recent years.
	   The property issue has caused a sharp rift between Eastern Rite
Catholics, whose authority is the Pope, and the Orthodox, whose
spiritual leader is in Istanbul.
	   There are some 300,000 Eastern Rite Catholics in Romania _ the
country's second-largest church. Most live in the northwest region
of Transylvania.
	   As he sat down to lunch with Eastern Rite Catholic and Orthodox
leaders, Ion Diaconescu, head of parliament's lower chamber, called
the split ``a wound ... grounded in political reasons.''
	   Orthodox often are accused of bowing to the communist and
current governments. Detractors charge that Catholics are
anti-Romanian.
	   Later Tuesday, more than 150 Buddhist, Jewish, Orthodox,
Protestant, Catholic, and others religious leaders are to gather in
a square in downtown Bucharest to pray for peace.
	   The 2 1/2-day conference has concentrated on religion's role in
promoting harmony between peoples and on prayers for world peace.

Chemical traces in whale bodies warn of contaminated ocean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Traces of toxic chemicals found in
the bodies of dead whales indicate that manmade pollution is
spilling deep into the Atlantic, a Dutch scientist said Tuesday.
	   Researchers at three Dutch marine research institutes discovered
polybrominated chemical compounds in the bodies of 13 whales which
washed up on the Dutch coast in recent years.
	   The toxic compounds, similar to the banned DDT, are used as
flame retardants in goods including television sets and car seats.
	   Among the aquatic mammals checked for the compounds were minke
and sperm whales which feed on fish and squid at depths of up to
3,000 feet (900 meters) in the Atlantic ocean.
	   Researcher Jan Boon of the Netherlands Institute for Marine
Research said the findings demonstrated that such industrial
pollution had spread further than previously thought into the
ocean's food chain.
	   Although similar chemicals have previously been found in the
bodies of sea life found closer to the shore, the Dutch findings,
published in a July issue of Nature magazine, mark the first time
such pollution has been discovered so deep in the Atlantic.
	   ``This was quite a shock for a lot of people,'' said Jolle
Landman of Greenpeace Netherlands.

Netanyahu says deal was close as negotiator confirms secret talks

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Backpedaling by the Palestinians
disrupted chances several days ago to wrap up a deal over a West
Bank troop withdrawal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Tuesday.
	   His comments came as a Palestinian negotiator confirmed that
secret talks were still under way between the two sides despite the
disagreements over the scope of the withdrawal.
	   U.S. mediators told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last month
he could not count on high-profile U.S. involvement to coax Israel
into a deal and that the Palestinians must negotiate with Israel
directly.
	   The low-key talks have been conducted by the speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, and Yitzhak Molcho,
an attorney and confidant of Netanyahu.
	   Qureia said today that many differences remained. ``There are
contacts, but there is no agreement,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger its security.
	   However, earlier this month, Israel for the first time agreed in
writing to a 13 percent pullback, with several conditions.
	   ``We were very close, very close to an agreement on the
negotiations with the Palestinians a few days ago,'' Netanyahu told
a conference on Middle East affairs. ``There has been a retreat on
the Palestinian side and I think it's important that the
Palestinians come back to the table and restore and move on
understandings that were achieved in the negotiations.''
	   Netanyahu did not disclose what had been agreed upon.
	   Excerpts from the document Molcho handed to Qureia were
published Monday in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The document appeared
to contradict assurances Netanyahu reportedly gave to hard-line
Cabinet minister Limor Livnat last month that Israel had not
committed itself to 13 percent in writing.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from the far right-wing in his
coalition and the influential Jewish settler lobby to cede as
little land as possible.
	   On Tuesday, he said complained that personal political risks he
had taken for the peace process were not being matched by his
Palestinian counterpart.
	   ``It cannot be that while I am indicating my willingness to risk
political concession and political attacks, the Palestinian side
takes no risks,'' Netanyahu said.
	   A key sticking point is Israel's demand that 3 percent of the
land be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinians will not be

Israeli hands.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that they will take full control of
designated nature reserves.

Chirac praises Yeltsin's leadership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday praised
Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, saying he has always chosen the right
steps in times of crisis.
	   In a 15-minute telephone call, ``the president told Boris
Yeltsin that at every decisive moment he has made the right choices
_ those of democracy and economic reforms,'' Chirac's spokeswoman,
Catherine Colonna, told reporters.
	   Chirac added that ``he knew that the Russian president was diong
all he could to continue in that same direction,'' Colonna said.
	   Chirac later this week will visit Ukraine and Moldavia, after
which he will again be in contact with Yeltsin, Colonna said.

Mobs stone shops for a second day in Indonesian town, two killed

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Chinese fled a
northern Indonesian town Tuesday after stone-throwing mobs attacked
their shops and homes in a second day of rioting. Riot officers
shot and killed two people, residents said.
	   Looters rampaged through the business district of Lhokseumawe,
grabbing anything they could: sacks of rice and bottles of soybean
ketchup, boxes of noodles, fans and electrical wiring. Many shops
were empty, abandoned by their owners.
	   The rioters, some of them shouting separatist slogans, roamed
the streets after nightfall. In some areas, soldiers mingled with
the looters, apparently willing to let the mobs vent their anger.
	   Ninety fugitives, meanwhile, were on the run after crowds
stormed a prison Monday in Lhokseumawe in the biggest riots since
deadly unrest in May helped oust former President Suharto. Mobs
burned buildings and stoned military trucks. Even children looted.
	   The violence was triggered by bitterness toward the armed forces
but ended up targeting Indonesia's Chinese minority, a traditional
scapegoat.
	   The Chinese are resented because they dominate business in
Indonesia, which is struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   There are fears that despite democratic reforms, the strain that
Indonesia's economic crisis is putting on millions of poor people
could lead to bigger riots.
	   The unrest erupted after more than 660 Indonesian soldiers left
Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which is accused of
atrocities there. As they pulled out, some spectators pelted their
vehicles with stones.
	   Two people died when security forces fired at young men who were
hurling rocks, said residents who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Police Maj. Amrin Remico said a 14-year-old boy and a
27-year-old man died. But he did not confirm that police shot them.
	   Carrying the bodies of the victims on stretchers, angry mourners
marched to the local government building and tore down the gates.
	   Some rioters shouted ``Free Aceh!'' in defiance of the
Indonesian military, which is accused of atrocities during a
campaign against Islamic separatist rebels in the province. A few
demonstrators unfurled a rebel banner when they raided the prison.
	   There was scattered looting Tuesday in outlying villages near
the town in Aceh province on Sumatra island.
	   Some Chinese shopkeepers cowered inside their shuttered stores
as rioters pounded the doors, walls and windows with a hail of
stones.
	   ``I'm scared. But there are police and soldiers in front of the
shop,'' David Liong said by telephone from his gold jewelry
business. His terrified family and other Chinese fled Lhokseumawe
in cars earlier in the day for a six-hour drive to the city of
Medan.
	   Police briefly detained at least 50 looters, confiscating their
booty, which included tires, soap and shampoo.
	   On Monday, rioters in Lhokseumawe burned a hotel, a discotheque,
beauty salons, a ruling party office and part of a shopping center.
Many Chinese-owned stores were pelted with rocks and looters
plundered rice, sugar and other basic necessities.

Clinton urges Russians to show courage, determination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results of lunch meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a message of support but no financial help,
U.S. President Bill Clinton urged Russians Tuesday to ``reject the
failed policies of the past'' in coping with their current economic
crisis.
	   ``Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions,'' Clinton told a new
generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State University of
International Relations.
	   Clinton spoke after he and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
opened a two-day summit unlikely to deliver sweeping agreements
from the politically wounded presidents.
	   With Russia's economic turmoil throwing the summit agenda into
uncertainty, Clinton addressed the crisis with frankness, but
offered no specific ideas on how the infant democracy could weather
the tailspin of its currency.
	   In his speech, Clinton repeatedly said that Russia must ``play
by the rules'' of international commerce and get rid of corruption.
	   ``I believe you will create the conditions of growth if _ but
only if _ you continue to move decisively along the path of
democratic, market-oriented constructive revolution.''
	   Clinton and Yeltsin held a luncheon discussion with senior
aides. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said it focused
mainly on Russia's economic problems and prospects. He said Yeltsin
indicated there would be no reversion to communism.
	   Summers told reporters that Russian officials cited to Clinton
``a number of areas in which they felt more active state
involvement was appropriate'' but that this did not mean ``going
backwards toward communism.''
	   ``This isn't about ideology,'' Summers said. ``This is about a
constructive economic strategy.''
	   In his speech, Clinton traced America's own two centuries of
democracy and said ``the road has not always been easy,'' referring
to the Civil War, Great Depression and two world wars.

Middlesbrough striker questioned in fraud probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Italian striker Marco Branca, currently with
English club Middlesbrough, is a target of a prosecutor's
investigation into tax evasion at Serie A club Udinese, the ANSA
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Branca was brought in for questioning Monday but employed his
right to refuse to answer ``because he was not familiar with the
evidence and the reasons for the accusations,'' ANSA quoted the
player's lawyer as saying.
	   Branca, who had three different stints with Udinese between 1986
and 1994, allegedly evaded 694 million lire (about dlrs 400,000) in
taxes.
	   Udine prosecutor Paolo Alessio Verni has been conducting an
inquiry into whether Udinese evaded taxes in transfer deals.

Greek Cypriots launch campaign against confederation proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Greek Cypriot community on Tuesday
launched a diplomatic campaign against the Turkish Cypriot proposal
for reunification of the island through a two-state confederation.
	   The proposal was made Monday by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem during Cem's visit
to the north of the island.
	   The Greek Cypriot leader, President Glafcos Clerides, rejected
the proposal as tantamount to partition of the island, branding it
``contrary and contemptuous'' of U.N. Security Council resolutions
that reject recognition of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   Foreign Minister Yianakis Cassoulides, who is in South Africa
attending a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement, said Cyprus was
considering raising the issue with the U.N. General Assembly.
	   ``This is seriously being examined,'' he said. ``I think that
partition of the island is out of the question for us.''
	   Finance Minister Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou, who is
acting foreign minister in Cassoulides' absence, said Clerides'
response has been circulated to all Security Council members.
	   Cypriot embassies also have been instructed to inform the
governments they are accredited to of the ``complete
unacceptabily'' of the Turkish proposal, he added.
	   Denktash on Monday proposed ``the establishment of a Cyprus
confederation composed of two peoples and two states.'' Cem said
the plan had Turkey's ``full backing.''
	   On Tuesday, Denktash urged the Greek Cypriots to reconsider.
	   ``This is a chance,'' Denktash said. ``Let's be partners again.
Let's live without destroying the Greco-Turkish balance.''
	   In Greece, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thedoros Thedorou said the
Turkish proposal was an attempt ``to achieve the recognition of the
pseudo-state and to undermine the Cyprus' republic's entry course
to the European Union.''
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the
wake of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with
Greece.
	   The breakaway state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Security Council resolutions call for the reunification of the
island as a single state. The resolutions, which have been rejected
by the Turkish side, call for the withdrawal of the Turkish troops
and an estimated 50,000 mainland settlers from the north and the
return of all refugees.
	   Clerides' rejection received unanimous backing Tuesday from all
the Greek Cypriot political parties, which denounced the Denktash
proposal as a move to gain recognition of his breakaway state.

Iran begins military exercises with parade near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign minister's comments in 13-14 grafs, minor
editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran began wide-scale military exercises
Tuesday with a parade near the border with Afghanistan, where
Tehran claims that the Taliban militia is holding 47 Iranians.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers kicked off the maneuvers,
codenamed Ashura 3, with a parade in Torbat-e Jam in northeastern
Khorasan province.
	   The actual exercises are to begin Wednesday, and ground and air
troops from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the
volunteer Basij Resistance Forces will take part.
	   The three-day maneuvers, the largest this year, are the first
near the border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. They are named
``Ashura'' for the holiday marking the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's
most revered figure, Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Mohammed.
	   The Guard Corps commander, Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, told
the assembled troops that ``Iran will not tolerate foreign
interference at its borders ... and will defend its territorial
integrity,'' according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. The detainees include 11
diplomats, a journalist and 35 truck drivers.
	   Safavi also warned the United States and Israel against attempts
to destabilize the region, saying their efforts would backfire.
	   ``Insecurity in the region will also affect themselves,'' Safavi
was quoted as saying. ``I hope our friends have got the message and
the enemies pay heed to our advice,'' he said.
	   Earlier, a senior military official was quoted as saying that
the aim of the exercises was to test new weapons and strengthen
Iran's defensive capabilities.
	   ``The military exercises are not aimed for any invasion of
neighboring Afghanistan,'' IRNA quoted Brig. Gen. Hussein Salami as
saying.
	   Although the Taliban has said it knows nothing about the Iranian
diplomats, IRNA on Monday quoted a close aide to Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar as saying the diplomats and the journalist
were being held in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
	   However, the British Broadcasting Corporation quoted Omar as
saying Monday that the diplomats may have been killed in a raid on
the Iranian Embassy when the Taliban captured Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi on Tuesday insisted
that the Taliban disclose the truth about the missing Iranians.
	   ``Such contradictory and ambiguous remarks are not acceptable to
Iran, and Tehran holds the Taliban responsible for the safety of
the Iranian nationals and diplomats,'' Mohammadi was quoted by IRNA
as saying.
	   The Taliban has admitted to holding some 30 Iranians, but
alleges they were arming its opponents.
	   Last week, Revolutionary Guards were deployed on the border with
Afghanistan to monitor the movement of forces fighting the civil
war there and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned that Iran
might resort to force to free the Iranians.
	   On Sunday, a member of the Iranian Parliament said that the
Taliban had killed the diplomats after storming Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But Mohammadi said in remarks published Tuesday that the
diplomats were alive and earlier reports were wrong.
	   The Revolutionary Guard is an elite paramilitary fighting force
of about 120,000 ground, air and navy personnel.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban. Iran is suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.

Thai Cabinet approves privatizing 59 state enterprises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet approved a master
plan Tuesday to privatize the country's 59 state enterprises,
meeting a deadline set by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Under the terms of a dlrs 17.2 billion economic rescue package
of the Thai economy administered by the IMF, the government was
required to come up with a plan by Sept. 1.
	   The Cabinet named four sectors with 28 state enterprises given
priority for privatization: telecommunications, energy, transport
and water.
	   Plans for the privatization of 31 other state enterprises will
be considered at a later stage.
	   Government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said at a news
conference that the plan was aimed at increasing the efficiency of
the state enterprises and cutting the government's funding
responsibility for them.
	   He said the master plan laid down a broad framework on the
privatization and action plans for each of the four priority
sectors would be completed by the end of December.
	   Despite the master plan, the pace and extent of privatization is
likely to vary considerably among the state enterprises. Each is
currently governed under its own law and by various government
ministries. Bureaucracy and corporate culture will also make the
process easier for some than for others.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A jittery Wall Street tried Tuesday to come back
from Monday's rout, which knocked 512 points off the Dow
industrials and more than wiped out this year's gains.
	   In a day of wide swings, the Dow Jones industrial average first
shot up 143.41 points in an early bid at a rebound, then tumbled to
a loss of 138.77, only to begin rising again. It was up 121.26 at
7,660.33 by late morning. Broader indicators also were rising,
including the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which
plunged a record 140.43 on Monday.
	   For the Dow, Monday's 6.4 percent plunge was the second-biggest
point drop ever for Wall Street's best-known indicator. Only the
Oct. 27, 1997, deluge of 554.26 points was larger. But it was only
the 25th largest percentage drop and well behind the 22.6 percent
collapse of ``Black Monday,'' when it fell 508 points on Oct. 19,
1987.
	   The selloff Monday, a drop of 512.61 to 7,539.07, left the Dow
down 19.3 percent from its July 17 record high of 9,337.97 and 4.7
percent below where it began the year. The selling spree, which
accelerated in the final hour of Monday's session, brought Wall
Street plunging toward its first bear market since 1990. A bear
market is defined as a drop of 20 percent from the high.
	   President Clinton added his voice to efforts to restore calm to
shaken markets. ``We believe our fundamental economic policy is
sound,'' he said in Russia Tuesday, echoing comments Monday by
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
	   There were mixed signs of economic strength in two private
reports Tuesday. A private research group, the Conference Board,
reported the Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose in July,
halting a two-month decline and signaling the nation's economy
continues expanding at a moderate clip.
	   Separately, a manufacturing group said its closely followed
index of industrial activity pointed to slower growth for a third
straight month, even though the index was higher in August than in
July. The survey by the National Association of Purchasing
Management also said, however, that the overall economy grew in
August for the 88th straight month.

Clinton asks Russians to reject 'failed policies of the past'

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with additional Clinton remarks on specific Russian
measures on taxes, loan payments. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a message of support but offering no
financial help, President Bill Clinton urged Russians Tuesday to
``reject the failed policies of the past'' in coping with their
current economic crisis.
	   ``Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions,'' Clinton told a new
generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State University of
International Relations.
	   Clinton met earlier with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the
first session of a two-day summit unlikely to deliver sweeping
agreements from the politically wounded presidents.
	   Despite the poor outlook, Yeltsin declared just before meeting
with Clinton that ``Russian-American relations are developing
successfully.''
	   With Russia's economic turmoil throwing the summit into
uncertainty, Clinton addressed the crisis with frankness, but also
sympathy, saying the the country has had only seven years'
experience with market reform. In the end, he said, Russia must
find its own solutions.
	   ``I do not believe it is by reverting to the failed policies of
the past. I do not believe it is by stopping the reform process in
midstream,'' he told students.
	   ``Today's financial crisis does not require you to abandon your
march to free markets,'' he said.
	   Urging Russians to ``play by the rules,'' Clinton said they
should ``pay their fair share of taxes'' and he admonished a
defaulting government that ``the people who lend money to this
nation must be treated fairly'' so they will extend loans again in
the future.
	   ``I believe you will create the conditions of growth if _ but
only if _ you continue to move decisively along the path of
democratic, market-oriented constructive revolution,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Owen has given Glenn Hoddle no choice but
to name him in England's starting team for its opening European
Championship qualifier against Sweden at Stockholm on Saturday.
	   The 18-year-old striker scored three goals in Liverpool's 4-1
win over Newcastle in a Premier League game Sunday, forcing Hoddle
to concede Owen was the No. 1 striker in England.
	   Owen's feat was splashed across the headlines of every major
newspaper in England on Tuesday.
	   ``He was sensational on Sunday...he is an automatic choice when
he puts in performances like that,'' Hoddle was quoted as saying in
the Sun.
	   Hoddle was widely criticized for leaving Owen out of his
starting team for the early matches at the France 98 World Cup,
saying he was not ``a natural goalscorer.''
	   However, Owen proved him wrong by scoring one of the goals of
the tournament and starring against Argentina during England's
elimination from the World Cup. He has already scored four goals in
three Premier League games for Liverpool and leads the scoring
table.
	   His new mentor at Liverpool, co-coach Gerard Houllier, said Owen
had room to improve on his left foot and his shooting but Hoddle is
apparently convinced that Owen can be paired with England captain
Alan Shearer for a winning combination.
	   Hoddle said Owen had earned the respect of the soccer world
after the World Cup.
	   ``The way (Owen) has performed since the World Cup, he's done
everything right. His finishing at the moment is second to none in
the country,'' Hoddle said.
	   In the build-up to Saturday's game in Stockholm, Owen had a
warning for any team planning to focus too much defense on him.
	   ``If three players want to put me out of the game then that will
mean we've got two spare ones somewhere else and they can do the
business instead,'' he said.

Yeltsin, Duma stay on collision course as Clinton arrives
</HEADLINE>

Zyuganov comments, other; changes byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and the Communist-led parliament
refused to budge Tuesday in their standoff over who should lead
Russia's government during its time of turmoil, edging the nation
closer to possible early elections.
	   Yeltsin reassured U.S. President Clinton, who arrived for a
summit with Russia paralyzed by the worst financial crisis since
the Soviet era, that he won't abandon democratic reforms.
	   ``The country will continue building a market economy and a
democratic society,'' the Kremlin quoted the Russian president as
saying.
	   Yeltsin also insisted he wouldn't give up Viktor Chernomyrdin as
his choice for prime minister, despite the risk of months' more
uncertainty if that strategy fails. Russians are anxious about the
growing crisis, but there have been few signs of panic on the
streets.
	   Visiting a Moscow school on the first day of classes, Yeltsin
said he believed the new government could be formed within a week
despite Parliament's one-sided rejection Monday of Chernomyrdin's
candidacy.
	   ``Chernomyrdin is the candidate I have chosen for prime minister
and I will insist upon it,'' he said matter-of-factly.
	   If lawmakers vote down Yeltsin's choice twice more, the
president must dissolve the State Duma, Parliament's lower house,
and call new parliamentary elections within three months. That
would leave the country to be steered through crisis by Yeltsin
decrees and a stand-in government.
	   While Yeltsin seemed to be enjoying the pomp of a two-day visit
by Clinton, whom he greeted with a bear hug in the Kremlin's
presidential study, the summit held little promise of significant
achievement. The Russian crisis remained the real drama.
	   Top Communist lawmakers showed no signs of backing down. A
second vote is likely next Monday, though it could come as early as
Friday, said the speaker of the parliament's lower house, Gennady
Seleznyov.
	   ``He doesn't have a chance,'' Seleznyov declared of
Chernomyrdin.
	   Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has hurled such invectives at
Yeltsin, calling him a drunk among other things, that it seemed
unlikely he could reverse course, as Communist lawmakers have done
in past showdowns to save their jobs.
	   ``He decided to rape the State Duma and the whole nation,''
Zyuganov told reporters, referring to Yeltsin's renomination of the
rejected Chernomyrdin. ``That is an insult to all people of Russia.
	   ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war,'' said
the Communist leader, who meets with Clinton on Wednesday.
	   Parliament's upper house, the Federation Council, has
traditionally supported Yeltsin, and may try to broker a compromise
when it holds a session Friday.
	   Among names circulated as possible compromise candidates are
Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's nationalist mayor, and Yegor Stroyev, a
Yeltsin loyalist who is the Federation Council speaker.
	   Chernomyrdin, who could head an interim government for months if
new elections are called, laid out a plan for addressing the crisis
at a meeting of the holdover Cabinet.
	   ``Lack of action can throw us all back a few years,'' the
Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. ``This won't
happen.''
	   He demanded immediate proposals to radically overhaul a taxation
system that he oversaw during five turbulent years as premier. Very
few Russians and Russian companies pay taxes, leaving the
government unable to pay state workers and pensioners.
	   ``Without tax reform, which would stimulate production, we won't
survive,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Security agents on Tuesday detained Vladimir Petrov, the acting
first deputy finance minister, on suspicion of corruption. Petrov,
who was involved in negotiations on an International Monetary Fund
bailout, is suspected of taking bribes ``on a grand scale,''
prosecutors said.
	   Petrov's detention was expected to undermine the credibility of
Chernomyrdin's interim government, which has done little to stop
the economic chaos.

Italian federation institutes surprise blood, urine tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Players in Italy's top soccer league will be
subjected to surprise, blood and urine anti-doping tests in the new
season, Italian soccer federation president Luciano Nizzola said
Tuesday.
	   Nizzola made the announcement after meeting with the Italian
Olympic Committe's ruling council, which approved new testing for
10 different sports.
	   Last season, some Serie A players were randomly selected to
provide urine samples after weekend league games. Under the new
guidelines, blood and urine tests for banned performance-enhancing
substances can be carried out unannounced at any time during the
week.
	   The International Olympic Committee relies only on urine tests
because it says blood tests are less reliable.
	   ``We'll try to do the tests from the beginning of the season.
Maybe we won't have them right from the first game but we will soon
after that,'' Nizzola said.
	   Representatives of sports doctors, the players' association and
the coaches' association will meet Monday to discuss specifics of
the new testing.
	   The Serie A season opens Sept. 12.
	   The Italian soccer world was shaken last month by three separate
investigations _ two by city prosecutors and one by the Italian
Olympic Committee's anti-doping commission _ into possible use of
banned substances after AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman remarked he was
``amazed'' by the sudden muscular growth of some players.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel fighters holed up in western Congo
have been refused safe passage out of the area by government-allied
troops, a government official said Tuesday.
	   An unspecified number of rebels near the town of Songololo about
250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of the capital are
``effectively considered prisoners of war,'' Deputy Interior
Minister Faustin Munene said on state radio.
	   ``They will not be given safe passage until all Rwanda and
Uganda forces withdraw from the east,'' he said.
	   While a recent government offensive has largely purged the
rebels from their positions in the west, the insurgents still
control several key cities in eastern Congo and have vowed to press
on with their fight to topple President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both the government and the rebels have relied on foreign
support during their month-long war: The government has received
military help from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia; at the same time,
Congo accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading the eastern border and
masterminding the rebel campaign.
	   Rwanda denies it has troops in Congo, but says it may intervene
in the country's civil war to protect its interests. Uganda says it
has troops inside Congo as part of a joint border defense agreement
and not in support of the rebels.
	   About 50 war prisoners that the government said were from Uganda
and Rwanda were put on display before the press Tuesday.
	   ``We're presenting these men as evidence that Congo has been the
victim of aggression,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said.
	   The prisoners wore plain khaki clothing provided by the
Congolese government and showed no military or national markings.
	   A Ugandan military spokesman on Tuesday said his country's army
will keep troops in eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels there.
	   ``We cannot pull out of Congo now,'' said Capt. Shaban
Bantariza. ``We have to maintain a buffer zone against the rebels.
It is both tactical and strategic.''
	   The rebels, a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
members of Kabila's army, lost their last strongholds in western
Congo over the weekend when Angolan troops marched into the river
port town of Matadi. For now, the rebels have virtually abandoned
their effort to take the capital.
	   Although Kinshasa still was without electricity today, life was
slowly returning to normal after pitched battles on the eastern and
western outskirts last week left scores of bodies on the streets
and sent thousands of civilians into hiding.
	   Civilians and government troops went on a rampage last week,
lynching dozens of suspected rebels. More than 37 bodies have been
spotted in recent days in various parts of the city.
	   Troops continue to staff checkpoints, but traffic on the streets
is gradually picking up.
	   At least eight journalists from state-controlled Voice of the
People radio were suspended Tuesday and accused of sympathizing
with the rebels, a journalist at the broadcasting service said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The government also moved to maintain tighter control over
telecommunication facilities in Kinshasa.
	   The government seized 50 percent control of Telecel, Kinshasa's
first and largest cellular telephone company. The phone service was
a joint venture owned by Congolese, Canadian and American
investors.
	   About 10 percent of Telecel was owned by ethnic Tutsi Congolese,
state television reported.
	   Tutsis in Kinshasa, whose Rwandan brethren have been accused of
leading the rebellion, have been rounded up and on occasion beaten.
	   Having pushed back rebel gunmen that just weeks ago were poised
to capture Kinshasa, Kabila on Monday said the war's focus would
now turn to the east.
	   The president said his army and its allies would launch
offensives to recapture rebel-held cities in eastern Congo,
including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.

Police deport 13 Yugoslavs trying to emigrate illegally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Border police deported 13 ethnic
Albanians from Yugoslavia as they tried to depart Tuesday for
Western Europe on fake visas, an official said.
	   The group arrived Monday at Bucharest's Otopeni Airport from
Belgrade and were intending to travel to the Netherlands and
Denmark when they aroused suspicion, said a border police official.
	   ``They said they bought the visas in front of the Swedish
Embassy in Belgrade,'' he said by telephone, declining to give his
name. He said all of the deportees were men under the age of 30.
	   Yugoslav nationals do not need visas to enter Romania.
	   Before the fall of communism in 1989, Romanians illegally
entered former Yugoslavia on their way to Western Europe. Since
troubles started in the Balkans, illegal emigration has reversed.
	   Nationals from former Yugoslavia sometimes try to fly to the
West from Bucharest's international airport or illegally board
ships at the Black Sea port of Constanta.

Austrian judo star goes on trial for cocaine possession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Schleicher convicted &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The Austrian silver medalist in the
1996 European Judo Championships was convicted Tuesday of
drug-trafficking and was sentenced to five years imprisonment.
	   Thomas Schleicher, 25, had 1.4 kilograms (about 3 pounds) of
cocaine and a small quantity of amphetamines in his possession when
he was arrested April 5 by police in Salzburg province.
	   He was arrested along with another Austrian and three
unidentified Lithuanians. The Austrian received 18 months in jail
and 18 months probation and two of the Lithuanian were sentenced to
four year terms.
	   Charges against one of the Lithuanians were dropped before the
trial.
	   The verdicts are subject to judicial review.
	   Prosecutor Herta Krainer told the court that Schleicher began
using drugs after suffering an injury.
	   The Austria Press Agency quoted authorities as saying Schleicher
was accused of selling small amounts of cocaine to about seven
people early this year. The Lithuanians are accused of smuggling
the drugs into Austria, APA added.
	   Schleicher competed in the 71 kilogram (156 pound) class and won
the Junior European Championship title in 1992. finished ninth in
the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
	   Last spring, Austrian star ski jumper Andreas Goldberger
admitted on Austrian television that he had tried cocaine one time
in the bathroom of a Vienna disco.
	   Goldberger subsequently was suspended for six months and fined
by the Austrian Ski Federation.

Fourteen Turks found in minivan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Fourteen illegal immigrants from Turkey
were found in a Ford Transit minivan in southeastern Hungary close
to the Romanian border, a border guard spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The border guards followed the van, which was moving
suspiciously, from Nagykereki, 240 kilometers (150 miles) southwest
of Budapest, Col. Attila Krisan said by telephone.
	   The Hungarian driver tried to elude officers when he noticed
they were following the van, but was stopped by police.
	   ``Most probably the 13 men and one woman arrived from Romania,
although there's no hard evidence to prove this,'' Krisan said,
adding that ``it will be difficult to send them back to Romania.''
	   Turkish citizens need visa to enter Hungary.

German stocks drop, but rebound by market close

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German share prices fell sharply
following a big drop on Wall Street but rebounded to close higher
Tuesday as the U.S. market bounced back.
	   With the market turning its attention from Russia to Wall
Street, the blue chip Xetra DAX index was off by nearly 3 percent
in afternoon trading. But it regained ground and closed at 4,855.9,
up 44.62 or 0.9 percent.
	   Traders said sharp sell-offs didn't materialize as expected
after the Dow Jones Industrial average made its second-largest
point drop ever Monday.
	   Even Germany's 5 million small investors, many of them only
recently enticed into the market by a utilities sell-off, seemed
unfazed by the world market turmoil.
	   ``There's no sign of panic,'' said spokeswoman Sabine Grothues
of Bank 24, a brokerage and telephone-banking institution.
	   Herbert Hansen of Germany's Association for the Protection of
Small Investors advised his constituency to sit tight. If Russia's
financial crisis doesn't spread substantially, the market could
continue rising in coming weeks, Hansen said.
	   Traders said the Russian financial crisis took a subordinate
role in setting the tone in Tuesday's transactions.
	   ``Of course, Russia is still present in our minds, but Wall
Street is now the determining factor,'' Deutsche Bank dealer
Andreas Kehl said.

Small parties agree to form coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Fearing the toleration pact
between the governing party and the biggest opposition party could
eliminate their political influence, four small center-right
parties agreed Tuesday to form a coalition.
	   Leaders of the Christian Democratic Party, the Freedom Union,
the Civic Democratic Alliance and the Democratic Union signed the
agreement marking ``a fundamental breakthrough on the political
scene.''
	   ``Now we are a strong alternative to the Social Democrats and
the Civic Democratic Party,'' Christian Democrat Josef Lux said
after the signing ceremony in the lower chamber of parliament.
	   Under the accord, the four parties will mutually agree to
nominate candidates for Senate elections scheduled for Nov. 13-14,
Lux said. The same accord will apply to local elections set for the
same date.
	   The Social Democratic Party of Premier Milos Zeman and the Civic
Democratic Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus signed a toleration
pact following June early elections, in which Zeman's party won
only 74 seats in the 200-seat lower chamber of parliament.
	   After the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union rejected
offers to join his Cabinet, Zeman settled on Klaus, his archenemy.
	   The pact allowed Zeman to form a single-party minority
government and gave Klaus' party the posts of parliamentary speaker
and chairmen of key parliamentary committees. The Civic Democratic
Party holds 63 seats in the lower chamber.
	   The pact immediately drew protests from the Christian Democrats
and the Freedom Union. President Vaclav Havel called it a
non-standard solution, adding such an accord could lead to ``a
permanent division of power in the state.''
	   In November elections, Senators will be elected to 27 of the
chamber's 81 seat.
	   The small parties fear the Social Democrats and Civic Democratic
Party could make changes to the constitution should they acquire a
three-fifths majority in both chambers of parliament.
	   Zeman and Klaus indicated repeatedly they may seek a majority
voting system, rather than a proportional one, in the next
elections to the lower chamber. The majority system would reduce
the number of parties that make it into parliament, which could
avoid possible political deadlock.
	   The two parties also have said they would name experts to a
committee to consider possible changes to the constitution.
	   ``In democracy, the constitution and its changes should be an
issue of all people, not just of two political parties,'' Lux said.
	   Currently, the Social Democrats hold 26 seats in the Senate and
the Civic Democratic Party holds 29. The Christian Democrats have
13 seats, the Civic Democratic Alliance has seven, the Freedom
Union has three and the Democratic Union holds only one seat.

War, walls divide Kosovo's kids on the first day of school
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kids tear around outside and the
noise is deafening as proud parents slick down the hair of their
first-graders while others crowd to read posted class lists.
	   But this is Kosovo, and Tuesday's happy bustle of school
starting up again after summer break is deceptive.
	   There are two doors to this schoolhouse, and the school is split
by concrete. One side of the wall is Serb, the other is Albanian.
Like a microscopic mirror image of Kosovo itself, two worlds exist
side-by-side in this building _ hostile, mistrustful, uncomfortably
close but seldom overlapping.
	   In one half, grade-schoolers learn about Dusan, the medieval
king who extended Serbia's boundaries further than any ruler before
or since. They hear about Kosovo's loss to the Turks after Dusan's
death, and the threat to Kosovo now from independence-minded ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population.
	   Above all, they hear that Kosovo was, is and will remain Serb.
Period.
	   On the other side, kids are taught about Skander Beg, who gave
Albanians fleeting independence in the 15th century before hundreds
of years of enslavement by Turks, Serbs and others.
	   The first inhabitants of Kosovo were descendants of Albanians,
they are told, as part of the explanation of their birthright to
the province.
	   Even the school's name depends on who you are. For Serbs, it's
Milos Crnjanski; for Albanians, Dardania.
	   There's a common schoolyard, but fear dictates caution.
	   Graffiti on the main gate reads ``This is Serbia,'' but most
Serb kids, outnumbered four to one at the school, opt for another
gate. Those who don't make a wide detour around their ethnic
Albanian schoolmates.
	   The wall, too, is explained differently according to whom one
asks.
	   English teacher Tanja Popovic says Serb authorities put it up
six years ago to protect kids from attacks by Albanian students.
Now, she says, the violence has moved outside.
	   ``Gangs of kids throw stones at our entrance. Or they gang up on
our kids,'' she says. ``That's why many parents escort their
children every day.''
	   Anna Novakovic, a wide-eyed 11-year-old, has never been
physically assaulted but knows of others who have. The Albanians
``say bad and dirty things to us,'' she says.
	   Milan Vujosevic, 12, says he plays soccer and basketball with
Albanian as well as Serb friends outside of school, and instead of
discussing the war, ``We talk about girls.''
	   But there's no doubt in his mind who owns Kosovo. ``It's Serb,
of course.''
	   Outside the building, the wall becomes a state of mind.
	   Popovic, the teacher, says former colleagues of different
ethnicities do not like to be seen talking to each other, although
some friendships endure privately.
	   ``We were always separated in a way,'' she says. ``We always had
contacts but we had our own lives.''
	   On the other side, principal Sedat Ramadani snorts when asked
about contacts with the Serb side.
	   ``Relations?'' he asks. ``They don't exist.''
	   ``If two Albanian teachers meet a Serb teacher, he will greet
us, but if it's two of them, silence,'' says Ramadani. ``I guess
because each (Serb) is afraid what the other will think.''
	   He says the Serb side surreptitiously built the wall in August
1993, while the school was closed for vacation. It was unnecessary,
he insists.
	   Asked about his feelings when he first gazed on the partition,
Ramadani says: ``Anger. Sadness. Frustration.''
	   Sixth-grader Vjosa Kevishundiere says history classes last year
took them from the roots of the Albanian presence in Kosovo to the
present _ Serbia abolishing autonomy for Kosovo in 1989 _ and right
up to the war going on now.
	   ``I learned about our ancestors, how they fought the enemy,
first the Turks, then the Serbs,'' she says. ``We learned about the
present conflict too.''
	   She has no Serb friends.
	   ``They haven't hurt me, but I don't like them because of what
they do to the others,'' she says. ``They massacre people, they
destroy houses.''
	   Walls are also going up elsewhere.
	   At the Ismail Qemali school, about five minutes' drive away,
custodian Srbi Betashi watches workmen slap mortar on cinderblocks
erected on the weekend by the Serbs on the other side.
	   Partitions at the school have been up for years, but nothing
this permanent, he explains.
	   ``We were all very happy when the Berlin Wall fell, whether
Serbs or Albanians,'' he says sadly. ``And then the put up
something like this.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amid economic turmoil sweeping Russia, security
agents on Tuesday detained the country's first deputy finance
minister on suspicion of corruption.
	   Vladimir Petrov, who was involved in the government's
negotiations on a massive International Monetary Fund bailout
package, is suspected of taking bribes ``on a grand scale'' and of
using his position to benefit a commercial bank, the state
prosecutor's office said.
	   No further details were immediately available. Russian
television said Federal Security Service agents and the chief
prosecutor's office have been investigating the case for some time.
	   Petrov's detention is expected to further undermine the
credibility of the interim government, which has done little to
stop the economic chaos. The crisis has been deepened by
uncertainty about the government's future after parliament on
Monday refused to confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   President Boris Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin last week, just
five months after replacing him with the young Sergei Kiriyenko.
Yeltsin dismissed Kiriyenko on Aug. 23.
	   Official ruble trading was suspended for a fifth day Tuesday,
but the currency weakened even more in thin trading on Moscow's
over-the-counter electronic market. The U.S. dollar sold Tuesday
for 12-13 rubles, up from 10-12 rubles on Monday.
	   Moscow's Interbank Currency Exchange said it plans to resume
fixing the ruble's exchange rate against the dollar no later than
Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Official trading in the ruble has been suspended since last
Wednesday, when Russia's Central Bank admitted it was no longer
able to support the ruble amid heavy selling. It also has stopped
selling dollars to commercial banks amid high demand for dollars.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's top market watchdog said the foreign
currency trade must be restored slowly, but that the ruble's
exchange rate must be realistic.
	   Dmitri Vasiliev, chairman of the Federal Commission on
Securities and the Capital Markets, said the Central Bank's
decision to freeze trade in foreign exchange, coupled with its
attempt to support an unrealistic exchange rate for the ruble, had
seriously deepened the financial crisis over the past week.
	   He also urged the acting government to rethink the terms of its
controversial forced debt restructuring and to lift its moratorium
on international debt payment, saying the moves were needed to
stabilize the economy and restore confidence in Russian financial
markets.
	   In other economic news Tuesday:
	   _ Chernomyrdin's acting government threatened to impose
sanctions on commercial banks that delay settling client payments,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. The action followed a
pledge by Chernomyrdin that he would not allow the Russian banking
system to collapse.
	   _ Russian stock prices ended 0.08 percent higher but volume
remained extremely thin because of economic woes and political
uncertainty. Traders said the market seemed to shrug off U.S.
President Bill Clinton's arrival in Moscow for a summit with
Yeltsin amid more immediate worries.
	   _ The crisis continued to push consumer prices up throughout
Russia. In Moscow, food prices grew by an average 20 percent for
domestic products and 80 percent for imported ones since the
downfall began, Interfax reported. Prices for imported gasoline
grew by up to 40 percent, said Sergei Borisov, president of the
Moscow Fuel Association.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hillary Clinton shared tea and sympathy with
Russian businesswomen Tuesday, making her first public appearance
since her husband admitted to having sexual relations with another
woman.
	   Mrs. Clinton appeared jet lagged but otherwise happy to be
hobnobbing about Moscow with Naina Yeltsin, wife of Russian leader
Boris Yeltsin. And she deftly parried the first reference to the
scandal.
	   When a reporter asked how she's been doing in recent weeks, she
had a curt response: ``I've been doing fine.'' She emphasized
``fine'' with a firm nod of her head.
	   The two visited a private women's clothing factory and took part
in a discussion with women small business owners before touring the
Tretyakov Gallery, one of Moscow's premier art museums.
	   Mrs. Clinton walked slowly through the brightly lit factory
floor, admiring suits and dresses arrayed on dress models and
watching the blue-aproned women stitch and iron.
	   Yelena Petukhova, a 23-year-old seamstress, had a hard time
keeping her eyes on her work and off the famous visitor.
	   ``It's a sign of trust in Russia,'' she said. ``It shows they
are interested in us and our crisis.''
	   Mrs. Clinton's visit was designed to highlight the work of women
small business owners, who in addition to the regular trials facing
entrepreneurs also must battle the sexism pervasive in Russian
society.
	   ``It's a pity that so many of our business owners are men,''
Mrs. Yeltsin said, noting that only 18 percent of Russian
businesses are owned by women. ``Men love to be in charge. I think
that's bad.''
	   The owner, Tatyana Nedzvetskaya, was frank about the cost
Russia's current crisis could have on her business _ increased
prices for fabric, maybe even some layoffs.
	   ``We'll hold out until the last minute, of course,'' she said,
expressing gritty optimism. ``We have to smile and put up with
it.''
	   Nedzvetskaya said she was struck by Mrs. Clinton's openness and
intelligence, and said it never even occurred to her to bring up
the scandal surrounding the U.S. president's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``What goes on behind the bedroom doors is nobody else's
business,'' she said. ``If you start asking that kind of question,
you have fascism, not democracy.''

Former Mexican police chief sentenced for money laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A former Mexican police chief who once helped
probe high-level corruption has been sentenced to six years in
prison for money laundering after admitting he was bribed by a
narcotics trafficker.
	   Judge Miguel Angel Aguilar Lopez imposed the sentence Monday on
Adrian Carrera Fuentes, who was earlier sentenced to four years in
prison for torturing a suspect in a murder case.
	   Carrera Fuentes was director of Mexico's Federal Judicial
Police, a major anti-drug agency, in 1992 and 1993. He admitted
receiving some dlrs 1 million in bribes from cocaine trafficker
Amado Carrillo Fuentes. The two men are not related.
	   At one point, Carrera Fuentes said, he received dlrs 1,500 for
each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of Colombian cocaine that passed through
Mexico undetected. Carrera Fuentes said he even offered to post
federal policeman as bodyguards for Carrillo Fuentes, who died in
1997 during botched plastic surgery.
	   Carrera Fuentes said he used the money to set up more than a
dozen floor-tile stores.
	   The New York Times reported in July that Mexican officials
brought Carrera Fuentes to Houston to testify before a grand jury.
	   Two unidentified officials familiar with the testimony told the
Times that Carrera Fuentes said he had turned over some bribe money
to former Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu, who is under
house arrest in New Jersey while fighting extradition to Mexico.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces attacked an ethnic
Albanian village in Kosovo after residents ignored a warning
Tuesday to surrender weapons following an ambush on a Serb patrol,
according to sources on both sides.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said the attack began
Tuesday morning on the village of Tusus, about 40 miles (60
kilometers) southwest of Pristina. Smoke could be seen rising from
four other villages in the area, near the border with Macedonia.
	   Fighting has continued in the rebellious Serbian province
despite U.S. and European efforts to reach a cease-fire and begin
talks between the government and the Albanian leadership on
Kosovo's future.
	   A source in the party of Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova, told The Associated Press the attack
began after villagers ignored a warning by Serb police to hand over
their weapons or face attack.
	   The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Serb sources, also
asking not to be identified by name, confirmed ``skirmishes'' were
under way around the village, located near the town of Prizren.
	   According to the Serb sources, the operation began after
Albanian militants ambushed a Serb police patrol earlier in the
day.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the main province of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has promised to discuss autonomy _ favored by
the Americans and Europeans _ which he revoked in 1989.
	   But he has refused to grant independence, although Albanians
outnumber Serbs in the province by 9-to-one.
	   On Tuesday, a close Milosevic aide, Dragan Tomic, urged Kosovo
Albanian politicians to ``stop the agony of their own people'' and
open talks with the government.
	   The government accuses the ethnic Albanians of foot-dragging on
talks, but the Albanians have insisted that the Serbs first halt
military operations against the KLA.
	   However, recent allegations that Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo
killed and incinerated the bodies of 22 Serb civilians have
prompted calls for even tougher action against the rebels and
rallied Serbs behind Milosevic.
	   The allegations, reported extensively by Serbian media, have
further deepened enmities and likely diminished prospects for a
compromise between the government and the rebels.
	   More than ever since Serbian security forces launched a
crackdown against the secessionist Albanian guerrillas in February,
Milosevic's government is intent on crushing the rebellion.

Suspects in killings of four U.N. workers brought to Tajik capital

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Three people suspected of killing
four U.N. workers were brought to the Tajik capital on Tuesday for
interrogation.
	   The suspects had been transferred from opposition-controlled
territory, where they were arrested last week by opposition forces.
They were to be interrogated in the presence of both government and
opposition representatives.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed July 20 while patrolling
mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of the capital
Dushanbe. All were shot in the head.
	   Tajikistan is plagued by periodic clashes between the hard-line
government and the mostly Islamic opposition. About 70 U.N.
observers have been stationed in Tajikistan to monitor the 1997
peace deal that ended the former Soviet republic's five-year civil
war.

Montenegrin president predicts breakup of present Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 5 grafs at end with background on relationship
between leaders. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro's president predicted
Tuesday that his republic and Serbia, which together make up
Yugoslavia, would someday dissolve their union because of federal
President Slobodan Milosevic's disregard for its much smaller
partner.
	   In an interview with Vijesti daily, the Milo Djukanovic accused
Milosevic of autocratic rule and disregard of Montenegro in the
Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Yugoslavia will break up, not because of Montenegrin
separatism, but because of political and economic rotting, which
began long ago because of the autocratic rule of one man,''
Djukanovic said.
	   Djukanovic, a pro-Western politician who became president of
Montenegro this year, is at odds with Milosevic over many issues.
	   Their rift culminated earlier this year when Milosevic appointed
his protege in Montenegro, Momir Bulatovic, to the post of the
federal premier without the approval of Montenegrin officials.
	   Bulatovic, a former president of Montenegro, lost elections this
spring to Djukanovic.
	   Serbia and Montenegro, which remained in Yugoslavia after other
republics seceded, should share power on a federal level, although
Montenegro is much smaller.
	   Djukanovic said Milosevic can save Yugoslavia if he replaces
Bulatovic and lets Djukanovic's camp name the federal premier.
	   ``If the contrary happens, Montenegro will not accept the
decisions of the so-called federal government ... and that would
lead directly to the breakup of the federal state,'' he said.
	   The Montenegrin leader first turned against Milosevic during
mass protests in the winter of 1996-7, condemning his autocratic
rule and attempts to rig local elections.
	   He has since won strong U.S. and west European support.
	   Djukanovic also clashed with Milosevic over several economic and
other issues.
	   His efforts to bring about prosperity through privatization of
state companies in his small republic were criticized in Serbia's
state-run media, which branded Djukanovic a criminal.
	   Djukanovic's government also has condemned Milosevic's handling
of the Kosovo crisis.

Kohl: May have overrated Russia's ability to reform

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl admitted Tuesday
that he may have overrated Moscow's ability for market reform, but
he portrayed the Russia's financial crisis as a temporary setback.
	   Kohl, who is running for a record fifth term partly on his
experience as a statesman, defended the West's policy of pumping
billions into Russia to bring about capitalism. He said the change
could not happen overnight.
	   ``From a German perspective, there was no alternative,'' he told
a news conference. ``It was in our elementary interest that Russia
finds its way.''
	   But asked whether he had overestimated Russia's capacity to
reform, he said, ``That may be.''
	   Kohl's attempt to capitalize on global instability to promote
himself as a reliable leader for Sept. 27 national elections drew
scorn from the opposition Social Democrats, whose candidate Gerhard
Schroeder leads in the polls.
	   The party's general manager called it ``a sign of helplessness''
and said Kohl was trying to distract from his failure to tackle
Germany's own problems, such as unemployment.
	   Kohl's staunch backing of his ``sauna friend'' Boris Yeltsin was
``a poor argument'' for the chancellor's competence, Franz
Muentefering said in an interview in Tuesday's Berliner Morgenpost
daily.
	   Undaunted, Kohl and his Christian Democrats unveiled a series of
TV ads and new campaign posters with a slogan: ``Security, not
risk.''
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel also sought to calm fears about the
effect of Russia's instability and turmoil in global markets,
saying the German economy is fundamentally sound.
	   In Frankfurt, German share prices fell sharply early in the day
but rebounded to close higher Tuesday as Wall Street bounced back
from Monday's steep loss. The blue-chip Xetra DAX index closed at
4,855.9, up 44.62 or 0.9 percent.

Police arrest more peace activists in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police on Tuesday detained about 200
activists marking World Peace Day in the southeastern city of
Diyarbakir, the independent Human Rights Association said.
	   Police also turned back another six buses carrying people who
planned to take part in the Diyarbakir peace ceremony on the
outskirts of the city, said Nazmi Gur, the association's secretary
general.
	   It was the second wave of arrests aimed at blocking the
ceremony, which the government insists is a propaganda ploy
engineered by Kurdish rebels. Organizers say they are trying to
promote a peaceful solution to the government's 15-year war with
autonomy seeking Kurds.
	   On Monday, police rounded up a group of activists who planned to
take part in the ceremony. They also stopped several buses of peace
activists from Istanbul.
	   The conflict in southeastern Turkey has claimed about 37,000
lives and stained Turkey's human rights image. Diyarbakir is 923
kilometers (553 miles) southeast of Ankara, the capital.

Chemical traces in whale bodies warn of contaminated ocean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Traces of toxic chemicals found in
the bodies of whales indicate that manmade pollution is spilling
deep into the Atlantic, a Dutch scientist said Tuesday.
	   Researchers at three Dutch marine research institutes discovered
polybrominated chemical compounds in the bodies of 13 whales that
washed up on the Dutch coast in recent years.
	   The toxic compounds, similar to the banned DDT, are used as
flame retardants in goods including television sets and car seats.
	   Among the aquatic mammals checked for the compounds were minke
and sperm whales, which feed on fish and squid at depths down to
3,000 feet (900 meters) in the Atlantic Ocean.
	   Researcher Jan Boon of the Netherlands Institute for Marine
Research said the findings demonstrated that such industrial
pollution had spread further than previously thought into the
ocean's food chain.
	   Although similar chemicals have previously been found in the
bodies of sea life found closer to the shore, the Dutch findings,
published in a July issue of Nature magazine, mark the first time
such pollution has been discovered in creatures that normally
frequent the depths of the Atlantic.
	   ``This was quite a shock for a lot of people,'' said Jolle
Landman of Greenpeace Netherlands.

EBRD pledges to continue lending to Ukraine despite crisis in

Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development does not intend to reduce its aid to Ukraine because of
the financial crisis in neighboring Russia, a bank official said
Tuesday.
	   The EBRD will continue financing the projects already signed and
plans to attract new investors to the former Soviet republic, said
Jaroslav Kinach, the chief of the EBRD mission in Kiev.
	   He added that the bank would, in particular, consider projects
that would help increase Ukraine's economic independence.
	   ``In the time of the crisis in Russia, which also influences
Ukraine, (the EBRD) will support projects that envisage production
of export-oriented commodities and import-substituting goods,''
Kinach said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992, the bank has approved 27
projects for the country, which collectively amount to ECU 660
million (dlrs 725 million).
	   The latest loan _ an ECU 80 million (dlrs 88 million) credit
line for support of small- and medium-sized businesses _ was
approved in May.

Left flexes its influence in Swedish campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Left Party's leader on Tuesday
promised support to the struggling governing Social Democrats, but
said the party's backing isn't absolute.
	   With national elections less than three weeks away, polls show
the Social Democrats far short of winning a majority of seats in
parliament, leaving its prospects for staying in power depending on
smaller parties' support.
	   That gives the Left Party, the former Communists, a potentially
critical role. The Social Democrats' previous coalition partner,
the Center Party, is expected to switch its support to conservative
parties after the Sept. 20 election.
	   The Left Party is firmly opposed to Sweden's membership in the
European Union and favors radical measures such as a six-hour
workday. Relying on the Left in order to hold on to power could
hinder the Social Democrats' capacity to compromise.
	   The Left does not want to bring down a Social Democrat
government, but ``we cannot have an approacch where we accept just
anything,'' party leader leader Gudrun Schyman said in a speech in
Helsingborg, according to the Swedish news agency TT.
	   A poll released this weekend by the Sifo organization showed the
Social Democrats receiving 39.1 percent support, a rise of 2.8
percentage points from the previous week but far short of the 46
percent the party received in the 1994 elections.
	   The Left showed 9.7 percent support, a decline from the previous
week, but still 3.5 percentage points higher than in 1994.
	   The main opposition party, the Moderates, showed 26.1 percent
support. Three smaller conservative parties together polled 20
percent.
	   The Greens and several fringe parties accounted for the rest of
the votes in the poll, based on questioning of 1,440 people Aug.
24-27.

French ``royalists'' seize British flag; ``prince'' protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French protesters claiming to represent the South
American ``Kingdom of Patagonia'' have seized the British flag off
an island in the English Channel they claimed in retaliation for
British possession of the Falkland Islands.
	   Flamboyant French author Jean Raspail, who claims to be a consul
for ``the kingdom'' claimed by a 19th century French adventurer,
was to hand the Union Jack back to the British Embassy in Paris
this week, a spokesman for the writer said Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile the ``Prince Philippe d'Araucanie,'' a relative of the
adventurer, rejected the stunt as ``burlesque'' and dissociated
himself from it. But he said he continues to defend the rights of
the Mapuche ethnic group in Patagonia, a region spanning Argentina
and Chile.
	   Raspail led a seven-member group _ ``a light division of the
Fleet of Patagonia'' _ that landed Sunday at dawn on Minquiers, an
uninhabited pile of rocks near the island of Jersey, said a
statement by the ``Consulate General of Patagonia.''
	   In the daylong operation, the ``volunteer Navy fuseliers''
raised its blue, white and green flag and painted the colors on
several rocks, the statement said, ``to reaffirm the sovereignty of
the kingdom on its colony of Minquiers.''
	   The group noted it ``took possession'' of Minquiers on June 1,
1984, two years after Britain repelled Argentina's invasion of the
Falkland Islands, which the group claims is part of the ``Kingdom
of Patagonia.''
	   At the British Embassy in Paris, spokesman Tim Livesy said
officials were ``very pleased to hear that a British yachtsman,''
who sailed to the island for a picnic with his wife, ``duly lowered
said foreign flag and raised in its place the rightful Union
flag.''
	   Livesy said British officials took the incident in
``good-humored'' fashion.
	   The French government declined to comment, saying it was a
British affair.
	   Raspail claims to represent the ``Kingdom of Araucania and
Patagonia.'' French lawyer-adventurer Orelie-Antoine de Tounens
declared himself king there in 1861 but was captured by Chilean
troops a year later and deported to France.
	   Among Raspail's 20 books is ``I, Orelie-Antoine, King of
Araucania.'' He also wrote ``The Camp of Saints,'' a futuristic
novel about Europe threatened by non-white immigrants.
	   The spokesman for Raspail, speaking on condition of anonymity,
denied the stunt was aimed at gaining publicity for Raspail.
	   A distant relative of de Tounens, Philippe Boiry, contended he
allowed former friend Raspail to take the title ``consul'' until
the author started taking the title too seriously.
	   ``It's burlesque,'' Boiry, a teacher and legal expert, said of
the weekend incident. ``It's amusing, but it doesn't defend Indian
rights.''
	   Boiry calls himself ``Prince Philippe d'Araucanie'' and
maintains the Museum of the Kings of Araucania in the southwestern
Perigord town of Chourgnac d'Ans. Boiry said a Paris court granted
him the title of heir to de Tounens in 1971.

Zimbabwe civic group protests government backing of Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL HARTNACK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A group of civilian organizations that
includes churches, trade unions and human rights activists Tuesday
called for the Zimbabwe government to bring home troops from Congo.
	   The group, calling itself the National Constitutional Assembly,
called for immediate withdrawal ``to cut our losses and limit
further waste of life.''
	   Mugabe's dispatch of troops to help Congolese leader Laurent
Kabila quell an insurrection had serious constitutional flaws
because he did not inform Parliament, said Morgan Tsvangirai,
secretary general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trades Unions in a
statement that spoke for the protest group.
	   Zimbabwean, Namibian and Angolan troops are backing Kabila, who
claims Uganda and Rwanda have invaded his country to support the
rebels and undermine his year-old government.
	   The conflict is the most serious threat to security in central
Africa in years.
	   The Congo issue dominated state controlled media on Tuesday,
with the Herald reporting that two more Zimbabwe soldiers had been
killed in Congo, bringing the total to four.
	   Reports that Zimbabwe troops participated in atrocities against
captured rebel soldiers in Congo appeared in Johannesburg, South
Africa's, Business Day on Tuesday.
	   The government told The Associated Press that it would look into
the allegations and consider commenting at a later date.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street tried Tuesday to bounce back sharply
from a rout that knocked 512 points off the Dow industrials Monday,
more than wiping out the rest of this year's gains.
	   In another day of wide swings, the Dow Jones industrial average
jumped 143.41 as trading began, but soon retreated to a loss of
138.77 before turning higher again. The Dow, which has fallen
nearly 1,000 points in the past three sessions alone, was up 222.19
at 7,761.26 by early afternoon.
	   Broader indicators were also rising, including the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which plunged a record
140.43 points on Monday.
	   At least two prominent strategists seized upon Monday's decline
as a buying opportunity.
	   Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief market strategist at Goldman Sachs
and Co. and the most noted ``bull'' on Wall Street, recommended
that investors shift available cash into stocks. Prudential
Securities chief investment strategist Greg Smith also raised his
suggested stock allocation.
	   President Clinton Tuesday added his voice to efforts to restore
calm to shaken markets. ``We believe our fundamental economic
policy is sound,'' he said, echoing comments Monday by Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin.
	   Stock markets in Asia and Europe gave more ground Tuesday in the
aftermath of Monday's slide on Wall Street. But Japan's stock
market closed sharply higher and European markets were cutting
their losses by this afternoon.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed down 80.3 points, or 1.5 percent, at 5169.1.
	   In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra DAX index finished with a
gain of 0.9 percent, rising 44.62 points to 4,855.90 after shaking
off early losses of about 3.3 percent.
	   In Paris, the CAC 40 closed with little change, down 5.56
points, or 0.15 percent at 3,651.85. The CAC 40 overcame early
losses of about 3.7 percent.
	   Analysts said they were concerned further declines may scare
away investors _ and drive down share prices even further over the
short term.
	   ``The more money is withdrawn and the more the indices fall,
then the worse the problem becomes. And it's difficult to see where
the floor is going to be in that sort of situation,'' said Richard
Jeffrey, chief economist at the London brokerage Charterhouse
Tilney.
	   In Russia, where the most recent round of selling began, trading
in the ruble was suspended for a fifth day, helping drive down
Russian stocks even further amid continuing political uncertainty.
	   Despite the second straight Japanese stock rise, many analysts
saw no sign of an extended recovery _ given how wildly the stocks
gyrated _ and some pointed to a temporary intervention by
government-linked pension funds.
	   At the same time, Japan's chief economic planner sounded far
shakier than Clinton.
	   Japan's economy is ``now going through one of its darkest
stages,'' said Taichi Sakaiya.
	   Key indicators fell 2.9 percent in Hong Kong and 3.8 percent in
Singapore, which dropped to a 12-year low.
	   But Japan's main index gained 1.86 percent, continuing to
recover from Friday's swoon to a 12-year low. Many analysts
dismissed this week's recovery as a short technical rebound,
pointing out that many of the major problems weighing on Japan's
economy and stocks remained in place.
	   Even in Asia _ where financial crisis has become commonplace for
more than a year _ Wall Street's tumble, Russia's political and
economic crisis, and the shakiness of some Latin American markets
seem to be heightening the sense of panic.
	   ``There is a feeling that there is no easy way out of this mess
because it has deepened and broadened to the point that authorities
have been overwhelmed by the markets, not just in Asia but in the
West,'' said Cameron Umetsu, a senior currency strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   To make matters worse, more bad news surfaced in Asia.
	   In Japan, the government sharply criticized communist North
Korea for firing a long-range ballistic missile over Japan's main
island and into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
	   Like U.S. officials, the Japanese government sees the test as a
dangerous development for the region's security.
	   In Hong Kong, investors found out that Standard and Poor's in
New York had just lowered the credit rating of the territory's
ability to repay its debt, both in local and foreign currency.
	   Standard and Poor's cited the severity of Hong Kong's recession
and the government's recent round of intervention in the stock and
stock futures markets, which it called ``an increasingly complex
and risky strategy'' to defend the territory's currency.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of its dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves to prop up the stock market in a
two-week battle with speculators. On Monday, when the government
stopped its buying, the stock index plunged 7.1 percent.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government _
well-known for its criticism of free markets and its feuding with
Singapore _ took a step that could hurt its neighbor's market.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on Monday effectively banned the
trading of Malaysian shares outside the country.
	   That could scare off foreign investors.

Germany rejects U.S. criticism of Bosnia refugee policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday rejected
U.S. criticism of Germany's efforts to send Bosnian refugees home.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged European allies
Monday to recognize that it is ``irresponsible'' to force refugees
``to return where there is no security, no housing and no jobs.''
Aides said her remarks in Sarajevo were addressed to Germany.
	   In reply, Kohl said Germany had welcomed twice as many refugees
during the Bosnian war as other European countries combined.
	   ``I can do without criticism from American officials, even if it
comes from a lady,'' he said at a news conference.
	   A key German goal in seeking to end the fighting in Serbia's
Kosovo province is to prevent a new flow of refugees, he said.
	   Germany took in 350,000 Bosnian refugees after the war broke out
in 1992 and has spent more than dlrs 11 billion providing for them.
	   Some 75,000 refugees have returned voluntarily from Germany this
year, some through economic incentives offered by state
governments. About 1,200 were deported, most because they had
criminal records.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Interior Ministry will join forces with
the global police agency Interpol to fight the laundering of
Russian money abroad, a Russian news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Experts from Interpol will travel to Russia and train their
counterparts on various detection methods, Interfax said, citing
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin.
	   The Interior Ministry's efforts to combat money crimes abroad
will be impeded by its failure to sign a number of European
conventions, limiting cooperation, Stepashin said, according to
Interfax.
	   The report did not specify what those conventions are.

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was wounded Tuesday in a
mortar attack by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   The Israeli army confirmed that a soldier was ``very lightly
wounded in the attack, which apparently occurred while he was on
patrol. The army said no one was hurt in a second mortar barrage on
a fortified Israeli position.
	   The mortar attacks triggered retaliatory fire from Israeli
forces, the Lebanese officials said.
	   The incidents occurred near the village of Blatt, which is 5
kilometers (3 miles) from the Israeli border. Hezbollah issued a
statement claiming responsibility.
	   The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon said that during the
hostilities, several Katyusha rockets crashed near a post manned by
Nepalese soldiers, causing slight damage but no injuries.
	   Earlier, a woman was hit by shrapnel when shells fired by
Israeli-backed militiamen exploded near her home in Mashghara, the
security officials said.
	   They said Fatmeh Hijazi, 45, was treated at a local hospital and
released. The officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
Several houses also were damaged in the shelling.
	   It was not immediate clear what prompted the early morning
shelling, which the officials blamed on the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia.
	   Israeli shells exploded in Mashghara last Tuesday, injuring six
Lebanese civilians, including a 6-year-old boy. The incident
triggered a rocket barrage on northern Israeli towns and
settlements by Hezbollah in which 19 civilians were injured.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from Israel's
self-styled ``security zone'' in south Lebanon. Israel set up the
zone in 1985 to try to protect its northern settlements from
cross-border guerrilla raids.

Russia's main electricity company cuts supply to debtors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's electricity monopoly has decided to get
tough on consumers who don't pay their bills, a news agency said
Tuesday.
	   The giant Unified Energy Systems, which controls most of
Russia's electricity grid, said if consumers don't pay their debts,
regional electricity companies will have the right to cut power to
them by 20 percent, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The limits are ``liberal,'' according to the company's deputy
director, Vladimir Dorofeyev.
	   Dorofeyev said consumers owed Unified Energy Systems a total of
124 billion rubles by Tuesday, up 34 billion rubles from the start
of the year.
	   More than 40 percent of that debt comes from the government,
monopoly officials say.
	   The decision follows government threats earlier this summer to
seize company assets unless the monopoly pays up its enormous tax
debts. Unified Energy Systems says it cannot pay taxes if consumers
do not pay their bills.

London shares plunge in wake of Dow's dive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices finished lower at the London Stock Exchange
on Tuesday _ after a rebound on Wall Street failed to fuel much
buying interest.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed with a
loss of 80.3 points, or 1.5 percent, at 5,169.1. Early in the
session, the so-called ``footsie'' had been down by nearly 3.3
percent.
	   Markets were jittery around the world, following Monday's loss
of 512 points by the Dow Jones industrial average. Although the Dow
had rallied by midday Tuesday in New York, London shares did not
recover as well as those elsewhere in Europe.
	   The London exchange had been closed Monday for a holiday, and
traders said prices had some catching up to do on the downside
after missing out on Monday's widespread selloffs.
	   Preliminary volume came to 772.4 million shares, compared with
892.8 million shares in Friday's session.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amid economic turmoil sweeping Russia, security
agents on Tuesday detained the country's acting first deputy
finance minister on suspicion of corruption.
	   Vladimir Petrov, who was involved in the government's
negotiations on a massive International Monetary Fund bailout
package, is suspected of taking bribes ``on a grand scale'' and of
using his position to benefit a commercial bank, the state
prosecutor's office said.
	   Russian television said Federal Security Service agents and the
chief prosecutor's office had been investigating the case for some
time.
	   Petrov's detention is expected to further undermine the
credibility of the interim government, which has done little to
stop the economic chaos. The crisis has been deepened by
uncertainty about the government's future after parliament on
Monday refused to confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   President Boris Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin last week, just
five months after replacing him with the young Sergei Kiriyenko.
Yeltsin dismissed Kiriyenko on Aug. 23.
	   Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that Russia had paid all its dues on
foreign government debt in August and would do the same in
September, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Several major Western banks said last week that some of the
government's payments on its coupon-bearing paper were late. These
issues weren't covered by the debt restructuring plan announced
Aug. 17.
	   Chernomyrdin also reiterated that the acting government was
considering different options to improve the terms of the
government's debt restructuring, which was announced Aug. 17.
	   The terms wiped out over tens of billions of dollars foreign
holdings, and angered the investor community. Consequently, Russia
will be unable to borrow on the international markets for a long
time to come, market participants say.

Tyson scuffles with motorist after minor accident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with UPDATED police description of incident,
details of scuffle, Tyson manager refuses comment. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson punched one man in the
chest and kicked another in the groin after a minor traffic
accident, police said Tuesdaay.
	   There were no serious injuries. Tyson later complained of chest
pains and was treated at a hospital emergency room and released.
	   In an updated report, police said the car in which Tyson was
riding, driven by his wife, Monica, was struck Monday afternoon in
a three-car, chain-reaction accident in this Washington suburb
northwest of the capital. Earlier, police had said Tyson's wife had
struck the rear of another car.
	   Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel refused to comment on the accident,
which came about three weeks before the fighter reapplies for his
boxing license in western American state of Nevada. He was
suspended last year for biting Evander Holyfield during a
heavyweight title fight.
	   After the car accident, the drivers of the other two cars were
talking when Tyson walked up and began arguing with them, said
Montgomery County police spokesman Derek Baliles.
	   Witnesses told police that the former heavyweight champion
punched one of the drivers in the chest and kicked the other in the
groin.
	   The witnesses said Tyson's bodyguards restrained him, according
to Baliles. The bodyguards were in a car traveling behind the
others in heavy traffic.
	   Police recorded the day's events as ``a misdemeanor assault''
with no charges filed.
	   ``In the state of Maryland, if a misdemeanor occurs and it's not
in the presence of a police officer, we can't place charges or
place anyone under arrest,'' Baliles said.
	   It is up to the other drivers to decide whether to make a
complaint to police, and it was unclear if either wanted to,
Baliles said. They have up to a year to do so.
	   Tyson and his wife declined to make a statement, police said.
	   Because passers-by called police, officers stopped Tyson after
he and his wife drove off after the accident.
	   ``Because of the reports of a fight, we wanted to be sure
everyone was OK,'' Baliles said. ``While we were speaking to Mr.
Tyson, he requested an ambulance, complaining of chest pains.''
	   Tyson is to appear Sept. 19 at a hearing before the Nevada
Athletic Commission to determine if the state will let him box
again.
	   Tyson was suspended by the commission in July 1997 for biting
Holyfield's ears. His license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3
million.
	   He was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada on July 9,
but bypassed the state and went through the licensing process in
New Jersey. On the eve of that licensing decision, he abruptly
withdrew the application in New Jersey and said he would seek
licensing in Nevada.

Yeltsin, Duma stay on collision course as Clinton arrives

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and the Communist-led parliament
refused to budge Tuesday in their standoff over who should lead
Russia's government during its time of turmoil, edging the nation
closer to possible early elections.
	   Yeltsin reassured U.S. President Clinton, who arrived for a
summit with Russia paralyzed by the worst financial crisis since
the Soviet era, that he won't abandon democratic reforms.
	   ``The country will continue building a market economy and a
democratic society,'' the Kremlin quoted the Russian president as
saying.
	   Yeltsin also insisted he wouldn't give up Viktor Chernomyrdin as
his choice for prime minister, despite the risk of months' more
uncertainty if that strategy fails. Russians are anxious about the
growing crisis, but there have been few signs of panic on the
streets.
	   Visiting a Moscow school on the first day of classes, Yeltsin
said he believed the new government could be formed within a week
despite Parliament's overwhelming rejection Monday of
Chernomyrdin's candidacy.
	   ``Chernomyrdin is the candidate I have chosen for prime minister
and I will insist upon it,'' he said matter-of-factly.
	   If lawmakers vote down Yeltsin's choice twice more, the
president must dissolve the State Duma, Parliament's lower house,
and call new parliamentary elections within three months. That
would leave the country to be steered through crisis by Yeltsin
decrees and a stand-in government.
	   While Yeltsin seemed to be enjoying the pomp of a two-day visit
by Clinton, whom he greeted with a bear hug in the Kremlin's
presidential study, the summit held little promise of significant
achievement. The Russian crisis remained the real drama.
	   Top Communist lawmakers showed no signs of backing down. A
second vote is likely next Monday, though it could come as early as
Friday, said the speaker of the parliament's lower house, Gennady
Seleznyov.
	   ``He doesn't have a chance,'' Seleznyov declared of
Chernomyrdin.
	   Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has hurled such invectives at
Yeltsin, calling him a drunk among other things, that it seemed
unlikely he could reverse course, as Communist lawmakers have done
in past showdowns to save their jobs.
	   ``He decided to rape the State Duma and the whole nation,''
Zyuganov told reporters, referring to Yeltsin's renomination of the
rejected Chernomyrdin. ``That is an insult to all people of Russia.
	   ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war,'' said
the Communist leader, who meets with Clinton on Wednesday.
	   Parliament's upper house, the Federation Council, has
traditionally supported Yeltsin, and may try to broker a compromise
when it holds a session Friday.
	   Among names circulated as possible compromise candidates are
Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's nationalist mayor, and Yegor Stroyev, a
Yeltsin loyalist who is the Federation Council speaker.
	   Chernomyrdin, who could head an interim government for months if
new elections are called, laid out a plan for addressing the crisis
at a meeting of the holdover Cabinet.
	   ``We have used up our allowance for mistakes,'' he told the
ministers in footage aired later on television. ``We are walking
along a narrow plank. A step to the right, a step to the left _ and
it's all over.''

British, Irish present planned anti-terror laws to parliaments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British and Irish
governments unveiled their joint crackdown plans Tuesday against
IRA dissidents, which they expect to be approved by emergency
parliamentary sessions this week.
	   Also, in a carefully worded statement tied to Thursday's visit
of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Belfast, Sinn Fein party leader
Gerry Adams proclaimed that ``the violence we have seen must be for
all of us now a thing of the past, over, done with and gone.''
	   The statement represented a significant rhetorical shift for his
IRA-allied party and received warm welcomes from the British and
Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern.
	   But it fell short of demands from Protestant politicians for the
Irish Republican Army to declare specifically that its ``war'' to
destabilize Northern Ireland was over _ and for the outlawed group
to prove it by starting to disarm, a goal contained in April's
peace agreement.
	   In London, Blair published the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and
Conspiracy) Bill, hastily drafted in response to the Aug. 15 car
bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland, that killed 28 people and wounded
more than 330.
	   That attack _ the deadliest in Northern Ireland's three decades
of conflict _ was committed by IRA dissidents opposed to the parent
organization's July 1997 truce.
	   In his statement, Adams appealed for Northern Ireland leaders
``to work politically to make the Omagh bombing the last violent
incident in our country.''
	   Blair expects his Labor Party and opposition Conservatives to
unite in approval of the bill, which will be debated and voted on
Wednesday in the House of Commons, sent to the upper House of
Lords, then voted on a second time in the Commons late Thursday
before receiving royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The bill proposes restricting the right to silence for terrorist
suspects, allowing courts to convict suspects based chiefly on
testimony from senior detectives, and empowering authorities to
seize property from people who lend support to truce-defying
paramilitary groups.
	   In Dublin, Ahern expects similarly easy passage for his
complementary anti-terrorist bill, which includes provisions for a
beefed-up witness protection program and powers to allow police to
interrogate suspects for up to four days without charge.
	   A handful of lawmakers in both London and Dublin complained that
the proposals flew in the face of the peace agreement, which
emphasized the need to phase out anti-terrorist measures in
response to the truces being observed by the IRA and Northern
Ireland's two major pro-British paramilitary groups.
	   Labor lawmaker Robin Corbett said he was likely to vote against
the bill. He noted that he had been a member of Parliament in 1974
when Britain enacted major anti-terrorist laws in the wake of the
IRA's worst atrocity, Birmingham pub bombings that killed 21.
	   Corbett said he was ``very sad this government has not learned
the lessons of what was done in a rush that night,'' and called
Blair's ``iron fist'' reaction unnecessary to deal with a small
group of IRA dissidents.
	   But a British government minister, Jack Cunningham, said the
small size of the dissidents made the proposed laws particularly
useful.
	   The laws, he said, would allow the United Kingdom ``to work more
effectively than ever before with the government of the Irish
Republic in dealing with these tiny minority groups who refuse to
accept the overwhelming will of the people.''

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Beitar Jerusalem's preparation for its

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Citing a continued strong job market and a
balanced budget, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that
despite turmoil in the stock market ``we believe our fundamental
economic policy is sound.''
	   Clinton added his voice to the U.S. administration's efforts to
reassure nervous investor after Monday's dramatic declines on Wall
Street.
	   Noting that he had consulted with Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin during Monday's stock sell-off, Clinton told students at
Moscow State University that market gyrations are not unexpected.
	   ``We believe our fundamental economic policy is sound,'' he
said, with employment levels at records levels and the U.S.
government about to record its first budget surplus in nearly three
decades.
	   Throughout the day, Clinton kept close watch on U.S. stock
trading. At a Kremlin dinner, Clinton and Yeltsin were chatting in
a receiving line with Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White
House's National Economic Council. As Sperling moved away, Clinton
informed him, ``The market's up.'' Clinton gave a thumbs up sign.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli soldier was wounded Tuesday in a
mortar attack by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   The Israeli army confirmed that a soldier was ``very lightly
wounded in the attack, which apparently occurred while he was on
patrol.'' The army said no one was hurt in a second mortar barrage
on a fortified Israeli position.
	   The mortar attacks triggered retaliatory fire from Israeli
forces, the Lebanese officials said.
	   The incidents occurred near the village of Blatt, which is five
kilometers (three miles) from the Israeli border. Hezbollah issued
a statement claiming responsibility.
	   The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon said that during the
hostilities, several Katyusha rockets crashed near a post manned by
Nepalese soldiers, causing slight damage but no injuries.

Englnd Cricket Board: Lloyd's comments ``inappropriate''.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England coach David Lloyd was called to task by
the England Cricket Board on Tuesday for his criticism of Sri
Lankan off-spinner Muthiah Muriltharan's bowling technique.
	   Lloyd's questioning of Muriltharan's bowling action came as the
prolific off-breaker snared 16 wickets for the match as Sri Lanka
cruised to a 10-wicket victory over England in a one-off test at
the Oval.
	   But Tuesday, in the wake of a humiliating defeat and as his
Ashes touring party was announced, Lloyd was being called to face
the repercussions of the comments he made on Sunday.
	   ECB chief executive Tim Lamb said Lloyd's comments were
``inappropriate and insensitive'' and senior officials expected an
explanation from him at ``the earliest opportunity.''
	   Lloyd said he had certain ``opinions'' about the bent arm action
of Muriltharan and promised to inform ``the proper authorities.''
	   He also had a heated public argument with television commentator
and former England captain Geoffrey Boycott, who said Lloyd should
have ``kept his mouth shut''.
	   Lamb said Lloyd's remarks were his own and not in line with the
ECB position, which is to abide by the International Cricket
Council's ruling on Muriltharan's action.
	   ``We are taking this, and his public argument with a television
presenter, very seriously,'' he said.
	   Muralitharan's unusual double-jointed wrist action has created
controversy in the past, which prompted the ICC to rule on his
technique.
	   The 26-year-old was no-balled seven times by Australian umpire
Darrell Hair during Sri Lanka's second test against Australia at
Melbourne on Boxing Day 1995.
	   But Muralitharan, who is the leading bowler in international
cricket this year with 68 wickets, has since been cleared after
medical evidence confirmed a physical deformity on both his arms.
	   Muralitharan, bowls with a bent right arm that cannot be
straightened and, therefore, cannot be called for ``throwing''.
	   Sri Lanka Board of Cricket Control president Thilanga
Sumathipala said if Lloyd had concerns, he should have taken them
to the match referee.
	   ``We are disappointed with the way (Lloyd) handled the whole
issue as there is a set procedure _ and we have made our views
known to the ECB,'' he said.
	   ``I want to know what concerns he has _ it was all highly
uncalled for.''
	   Lloyd has been in trouble with the ECB in the past over comments
he made regarding a game in Zimbabwe.
	   He was given an unofficial reprimand by the ECB for claiming
``we bloody murdered them'' after England's contentious draw with
scores level against Zimbabwe two years ago.

England names Ashes squad in wake of 10-wicket loss to Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England cricket selectors have purged spin-bowlers
Ian Salisbury and Ashley Giles in favor of veteran Peter Such for
the Ashes tour to Australia starting in October.
	   The 17-man England Ashes squad, announced Tuesday in the wake of
a humiliating 10-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka at the Oval, where
off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan took 16 for 220, contains two
spinners and one all-rounder.
	   Such, the 34-year-old who played the last of his eight tests in
1994, was picked to partner Robert Croft after Salisbury and Giles
managed to take just two wickets in six tests over the summer.
	   Such took six for 67 on debut against Australia at Old Trafford
n 1993 but has not played a test for four years and was the
surprise selection in the squad.
	   The England selectors have been desperate to find an effective
spin-bowling combination to counter the impact of Australia's Shane
Warne, who has destroyed England in the last two Ashes series.
	   But in the process, England's spin-bowling stocks have been
almost nullified while its batsmen have proved susceptible to spin
bowling.
	   Ben Hollioake was selected as the sole all-rounder in the squad
ahead of 20-year-old Andrew Flintoff, who made his test debut in
England's fourth test victory against South Africa this summer.
	   Wicketkeeper Alec Stewart, who steered England to its first
major series win in 12 years in his first series as captain against
South Africa this summer, will lead his first Ashes campaign.
	   The selectors chose seven batsman, including regulars Mike
Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Mark Ramprakash and Graham
Thorpe.
	   Graeme Hick was the unlucky ommission after scoring a century in
England's first innings against Sri Lanka.
	   Hick, who also scored two half-centuries in the recent
limited-overs international series after failing in two tests
against South Africa, was dropped in favor of John Crawley, who
also scored a century against Sri Lanka.
	   Seam bowler Dean Headley, overlooked since England's defeat by
South Africa at Lord's earlier this summer, has been selected on
the basis of his success against the Australian left handers in
last season's Ashes series.
	   Headley will compete with Alan Mullally and test regulars Darren
Gough, Dominic Cork and Angus Fraser for a Test place.
	   Emerging Surrey fast bowler Alex Tudor, who suffered the
ignominy of being hit for 34 runs in one over during a domestic
game earlier this summer, was also selected in the squad, where he
is expected to work with specialist pace bowling coach Bob Cottam.
	   England chairman of selectors David Graveney said the squad
comprised a very experience batting line-up.
	   ``While our choice of bowlers reflects the areas we believe we
can exploit in Australia,'' he said.
	   ``The summer has seen us enjoy success in a series against South
Africa but our defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka shows we still have
some way to go in our quest to become a top Test-playing side once
more.''
	   Selectors named a separate squad for the International
tournament in Bangladesh. The side will be captained by Adam
Hollioke, replaced by Alex Stewart as England's limited-overs
captain this season, and will include Graeme Hick, Jack Russell and
Graeme Lloyd _ son of England coach David.
	   The England squad for the Ashes tour is:
	   Alex Stewart (Surrey, Capt), Nasser Hussain (Essex, vice-capt),
Michael Atherton (Lancashire), Mark Butcher (Surrey), Dominic Cork
(Derbyshire), John Crawley (Lancashire), Robert Croft (Glamorgan),
Angus Fraser (Middlesex), Darren Gough (Yorksshire), Dean Headley
(Kent), Warren Hegg (Lancashire), Ben Hollioake (Surrey), Alan
Mullally (Leicestershire), Mark Ramprakash (Middlesex), Peter Such
(Essex), Graham Thorpe (Surrey), Alex Tudor (Surrey).

Struggling Romario to get another chance against Boca
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Romario will get another chance to
break out of his slump when Flamengo faces Boca Juniors of
Argentina in the Copa Mercosur on Wednesday.
	   The 32-year-old striker hasn't regained his form since a leg
injury caused him to be dropped from the Brazilian team on the eve
of the World Cup in June.
	   Slow and tentative, Romario has played poorly in the Brazilian
national championship. Last Sunday, he missed what would have been
the winning goal in Flamengo's 1-1 draw with archrival Vasco, and
jeers rained down from the grandstands.
	   Flamengo's coaching staff is divided over the cause of Romario's
problems, and what to do about it.
	   ``Pulling Romario from the team isn't the solution for
anybody,'' team director Washington Rodrigues said. ``The only way
he'll regain his form is with a series of games.''
	   Playing with what is considered a mediocre team, Romario is the
exception. Even when he's less than 100 percent, expectations run
high.
	   ``What complicates things for the coach is that Romario, in a
flash, can decide the game at any moment,'' Rodrigues said.
	   But coach Toninho Barroso said his star striker won't get
favored treatment.
	   ``If he's not producing all he can, I can easily pull him off
the field,'' he said.
	   Still, Barroso doesn't have many options. Of the 25 players
Flamengo had signed up for the Copa Mercosur, seven are injured and
one, William, is suspended.
	   Flamengo is in second place in Group D with three points, three
behind Velez Sarsfield of Argentina. Boca has two losses in two
games and trails the standings with zero points.

Italian federation institutes surprise blood, urine tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Players in Italy's top soccer league will be
subjected to surprise, blood and urine anti-doping tests in the new
season, Italian soccer federation president Luciano Nizzola said
Tuesday.
	   Nizzola made the announcement after meeting with the Italian
Olympic Committe's ruling council, which approved new testing for
10 different sports.
	   Last season, some Serie A players were randomly selected to
provide urine samples after weekend league games. Under the new
guidelines, blood and urine tests for banned performance-enhancing
substances can be carried out unannounced at any time during the
week.
	   The International Olympic Committee relies only on urine tests
because it says blood tests are less reliable.
	   ``We'll try to do the tests from the beginning of the season.
Maybe we won't have them right from the first game but we will soon
after that,'' Nizzola said.
	   Representatives of sports doctors, the players' association and
the coaches' association will meet Monday to discuss specifics of
the new testing.
	   The Serie A season opens Sept. 12.
	   The Italian soccer world was shaken last month by three separate
investigations _ two by city prosecutors and one by the Italian
Olympic Committee's anti-doping commission _ into possible use of
banned substances after AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman remarked he was
``amazed'' by the sudden muscular growth of some players.

Owen rewarded with starting jersey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Owen has given Glenn Hoddle no choice but
to name him in England's starting team for its opening European
Championship qualifier against Sweden at Stockholm on Saturday.
	   The 18-year-old striker scored three goals in Liverpool's 4-1
win over Newcastle in a Premier League game Sunday, forcing Hoddle
to concede Owen was the No. 1 striker in England.
	   Owen's feat was splashed across the headlines of every major
newspaper in England on Tuesday.
	   ``He was sensational on Sunday...he is an automatic choice when
he puts in performances like that,'' Hoddle was quoted as saying in
the Sun.
	   Hoddle was widely criticized for leaving Owen out of his
starting team for the early matches at the France 98 World Cup,
saying he was not ``a natural goalscorer.''
	   However, Owen proved him wrong by scoring one of the goals of
the tournament and starring against Argentina during England's
elimination from the World Cup. He has already scored four goals in
three Premier League games for Liverpool and leads the scoring
table.
	   His new mentor at Liverpool, co-coach Gerard Houllier, said Owen
had room to improve on his left foot and his shooting but Hoddle is
apparently convinced that Owen can be paired with England captain
Alan Shearer for a winning combination.
	   Hoddle said Owen had earned the respect of the soccer world
after the World Cup.
	   ``The way (Owen) has performed since the World Cup, he's done
everything right. His finishing at the moment is second to none in
the country,'' Hoddle said.
	   In the build-up to Saturday's game in Stockholm, Owen had a
warning for any team planning to focus too much defense on him.
	   ``If three players want to put me out of the game then that will
mean we've got two spare ones somewhere else and they can do the
business instead,'' he said.

Indian court denies bail to former British army officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ An Indian court refused Tuesday to
release on bail a former British army officer charged with waging
war against India by dropping arms to an insurgent group.
	   Judge G.R. Bhattacharya and Judge Vidya Nanda of the Calcutta
High Court rejected Peter Bleach's bail petition. This was Bleach's
second attempt to seek his release in the past six months.
	   Bleach, who is defending himself in the court, said he should be
freed on bail since his trial was expected to take a long time to
complete.
	   Amiya Talukdar, attorney for India's federal investigating
agency, opposed the bail petition, saying the trial of Bleach and
other accused already has started in Calcutta, the capital of West
Bengal state.
	   Bleach and five Latvians have been in jail since their arrest in
1995 for allegedly parachuting wooden crates containing assault
rifles, antitank missiles, rocket launchers, grenades and thousands
of rounds of ammunition from an AN-26 cargo plane in India's West
Bengal state.
	   Police said the arms and ammunition were meant for an insurgency
against the West Bengal state government by a cult called Ananda
Marg (Happy Path), based in Purulia town, near where the boxes were
dropped.
	   All six accused have denied the allegations. If convicted, they
could face life imprisonment or the death penalty.
	   Indian air force jets intercepted the cargo plane when it
returned to India a week later and arrested the six at Bombay
airport.
	   The plane belonged to the Hong Kong-based Carol Airlines owned
by New Zealander Kim Peter Day, who fled after the plane landed.

Middlesbrough striker questioned in fraud probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Italian striker Marco Branca, currently with
English club Middlesbrough, is a target of a prosecutor's
investigation into tax evasion at Serie A club Udinese, the ANSA
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Branca was brought in for questioning Monday but employed his
right to refuse to answer ``because he was not familiar with the
evidence and the reasons for the accusations,'' ANSA quoted the
player's lawyer as saying.
	   Branca, who had three different stints with Udinese between 1986
and 1994, allegedly evaded 694 million lire (about dlrs 400,000) in
taxes.
	   Udine prosecutor Paolo Alessio Verni has been conducting an
inquiry into whether Udinese evaded taxes in transfer deals.

Germany gets new soccer captain, Oliver Bierhoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Striker Oliver Bierhoff on Tuesday became the
captain of Germany's new-look national team, replacing Juergen
Klinsmann who retired after the World Cup.
	   ``I have decided for Oliver Bierhoff because he has a close link
to me,'' coach Berti Vogts said in Malta, where the Germans are
playing two exhibition games this week.
	   Bierhoff, 30, was the top scorer last season in the Italian
league, where he played for Udinese. He has transferred to AC
Milan.
	   The job went to Bierhoff although he angered Vogts recently by
publicly criticizing the coach's leadership style.
	   ``We've spoken about it, I gave him my point of view and there
are no problems,'' Bierhoff said. ``The captain has to have trust
in the coach and the other way around. This should not be shaken if
you have a different opinion once in a while.''
	   After getting eliminated in the quarterfinals of the World Cup,
Vogts is rebuilding the German team and has called up eight rookies
for the matches against Malta and Romania this week.
	   Vogts also plans to try out a new system by scrapping the
sweeper, or libero, position, which has been a key role in the
German team for more than 20 years.
	   ``At the World Cup, all four semifinalists played with a
four-man back line,'' Vogts said.

All-Ireland match for Omagh bombing victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ireland could meet Northern Ireland in a
rare international soccer series to raise money for the victims of
the Omagh bomb tragedy.
	   The Football Association of Ireland, based in Dublin, said
Tuesday it had joint plans with Northern Ireland's Irish Football
Assocation for a two-match series to be played in Dublin and
Belfast.
	   FAI chief executive Bernard O'Byrne said an agreement had been
reached between the two organizations and only dates, probably in
November and February, had to be confirmed.
	   Ireland manager Mick McCarthy, currently in Dublin preparing his
side for its European Championship qualifier against Croatia on
Saturday, has already backed the proposal and his Northern Ireland
conterpart, Lawrie McMenemy, is also expected to agree.
	   ``I cannot imagine anybody who wouldn't help such a cause,''
McCarthy said Tuesday.
	   ``We must all pull together at international and club level to
make sure that these games go ahead to help the victims of the
bombing and their families.''
	   The political divide which separates the two countries has meant
the two sides have met only eight times since 1978, the last match
resulting in a 1-1 draw at Dublin in March 1995.
	   Northern Ireland canceled an international match against Malta
scheduled on Aug. 19 as a sign of respect for the victims of
Northern Ireland's single worst terrorist attack in 30 years.
	   A car bomb killed 28 people and injured more than 220 when it
exploded in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, 70 miles west of
Belfast, on Aug. 15.
	   Northern Ireland plays its opening European Championship
qualifying match against Turkey on Saturday.

Netanyahu says deal was close as negotiator confirms secret talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday he has made concessions and taken a personal
political risk for a deal that could turn over more West Bank land
to Palestinian control.
	   But Netanyahu charged that Palestinian backpedaling was
scuttling chances for agreement on the long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal.
	   Palestinian officials have not reported any recent progress.
	   Negotiators have not met formerly for weeks, but a senior
Palestinian official said Tuesday that a secret channel was still
actively engaged in trying to find agreement over the scope of a
withdrawal which would move the stalled peace process forward.
	   Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmed Qureia,
said he was holding the low-key talks with Yitzhak Molcho, an
attorney and confidant of Netanyahu.
	   ``There are contacts, but there is no agreement,'' Qureia told
The Associated Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger its security. Israel then countered with a
proposal to turn 3 percent of that land into a nature reserve which
would limit Palestinian control in the area.
	   ``We were very close, very close to an agreement on the
negotiations with the Palestinians a few days ago,'' Netanyahu told
a conference on Middle East affairs. ``There has been a retreat on
the Palestinian side and I think it's important that the
Palestinians come back to the table and restore and move on
understandings that were achieved in the negotiations,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu did not disclose what had been agreed upon but said
that he had taken personal risks to work out a deal which members
of his own party oppose.
	   ``I pay a political price. But it cannot be that while I am
indicating my willingness to risk political concession and
political attacks, the Palestinian side takes no risks, and they
only address one side of the equation,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from the far right-wing in his
coalition and the influential Jewish settler lobby to cede as
little land as possible.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that in the future they will take
full control of areas designated nature reserves. They also want
Palestinian police to be able to operate in those areas.
	   In a sign of some U.S. involvement, CIA officials met recently
with Arafat's security chiefs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, to review understandings about
security cooperation and the Palestinians' war against terrorism
that were worked out in December.
	   The understandings _ negotiated at the time by Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. security officials _ specify, for example,
that the United States would have a say in whether Islamic
militants could be released from Palestinian jails.
	   But the understandings were never put into practice because
Netanyahu refused to approve them, arguing at the time that Israel
should have a bigger role in monitoring Palestinian compliance.
	   Rajoub said Tuesday that the Palestinians would not agree to
changes in the document. ``It stands as it is,'' he said.

England captain against money driven Super League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England soccer captain Alan Shearer has come out
against the proposed breakaway European Super League, saying the
concept was motivated by money and contrary to the traditions of
the game.
	   The Newcastle striker weighed into the Super League debate
Tuesday, days after European soccer's governing body UEFA vowed to
fight the breakaway competition by revitalizing its own
tournaments.
	   The 20,000 pounds-per-week (dlrs 32,800) player was quoted in
the Guardian newspaper as saying that if Super League was created,
then ``a lot of (Premier League) romance would be taken away.''
	   Shearer said for reasons of tradition, a Newcastle or Manchester
United versus Wimbeldon match would alway matter more than
Newcastle playing Milan twice a season.
	   ``From what I can gather there wouldn't be any relegation or
promotion, yet that's what football is all about,'' he said. ``The
uncertainty of how the season unfolds is the great thing about
football.''
	   Shearer said the game of soccer was in tremendous shape at the
moment, particularly in England.
	   ``To change all that for the sake of money....for one or two or
three, or however many clubs to break away, it would, in my
opinion, be wrong,'' he said.
	   Rudolfo Hecht, whose Milan-based marketing company Media
Partners is behind plans to create the European Super League, said
after meetings with representatives of Europe's leading clubs last
week that he was confident the competition would kick off by 2000.
	   The proposed competition would incorporate 32 teams in two
divisions.
	   The top 16 teams would include clubs of the calibre of
Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United from England's Premier
League, plus Juventus, Inter and AC Milan of Italy, Dutch giants
Ajax and Germany's Bayern Munich.
	   However, UEFA's governing Executive Committee met in Monaco on
Saturday to discuss measures to avoid the possibility of a
breakaway league and decided to form a taskforce.
	   UEFA announced a new 14-man task force, due to make initial
recommendations before Christmas, which includes representatives
from five clubs _ Ajax Amsterdam, Bayern Munich, Juventus,
Liverpool, and Marseille.
	   It will be the first time that clubs have ever sat on a UEFA
committee.

Age limit may be eased for soccer at Sydney Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Eligibility rules may be eased to
allow more players over the age of 23 to compete in the soccer
tournament at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the IOC and FIFA said
Tuesday.
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
met Monday night with Joseph ``Sepp'' Blatter, the new president of
world soccer's governing body.
	   A joint IOC-FIFA statement said Blatter wants soccer ``given
greater prominence'' in the Olympic Games.
	   Under current FIFA rules, which are intended to guard the
supremacy of the World Cup, teams in Olympic competition may field
only three players over the age of 23.
	   But the statement said the age limit question ``may be
reopened'' and the number of over-23 players could be increased to
five for the Sydney Games.
	   Samaranch has pushed for a higher-level Olympic soccer
tournament and expressed hope the restrictions could be dropped
altogether.
	   ``The fact remains that to ensure that top players take part in
the Olympic football tournament, the competition dates are an
essential issue,'' the statement said.
	   The two organizations said, for the 2004 Athens Olympics, there
are plans to increase the number of women's soccer teams from eight
to 12.
	   Samaranch and Blatter agreed to meet on a regular basis and
strengthen contacts between the executive boards of the two
organizations.
	   A study will be conducted to see whether soccer's Football
Arbitration Tribunal could work with the IOC-backed Court of
Arbitration for Sport while retaining its independence.
	   The statement said FIFA supports the IOC's campaign against
doping.
	   Samaranch had endorsed Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president
of the European soccer body UEFA, for the post of FIFA president
after the retirement of his friend Joao Havelange of Brazil.
	   But Samaranch, who has described FIFA as the world's most
important international sports federation, now is determined to
forge close ties with Blatter.

Largest UN convoy delivering supplies to Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency mounted its
biggest relief convoy in Kosovo to date Tuesday, sending out 16
trucks of humanitarian aid to refugees displaced by fighting in the
southern Yugoslav province.
	   The supplies are intended for more than 55,000 people in central
and western Kosovo, primarily the Malisevo and Pec areas, the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement.
	   The UNHCR has complained that the fighting has disrupted efforts
to reach the estimated 240,000 people made homeless by the clashes
between ethnic Albanians and Serb police in the province.
	   ``We are extremely concerned about the condition of tens of
thousands of people in the woods without shelter as winter
approaches,'' the statement said.
	   On Saturday, UNHCR staff found 47 people, mostly women and
children, shivering in the woods under pieces of tarpaulin thrown
over carts in the Kula woods, 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside the
capital, Pristina. A women gave birth that day, UNHCR said.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence from
Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes up what's left of
Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has promised to discuss
autonomy, which he revoked in 1989, but has refused to grant
independence to the Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in the province
by 9-1.

Left flexes its influence in Swedish campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The leader of Sweden's Left Party
promised to support the struggling governing Social Democrats, but
said Tuesday that the party's backing isn't absolute.
	   With national elections less than three weeks away, polls show
the Social Democrats far short of a majority of seats in
parliament, leaving its prospects for staying in power dependent on
smaller parties' support.
	   That gives the Left Party, the former Communists, a potentially
critical role. The Social Democrats' previous coalition partner,
the Center Party, is expected to switch its support to conservative
parties after the Sept. 20 election.
	   The Left Party is firmly opposed to Sweden's membership in the
European Union and favors measures such as a six-hour workday.
Relying on the Left in order to hold on to power could hinder the
Social Democrats' capacity to compromise.
	   The Left does not want to bring down a Social Democrat
government, but ``we cannot have an approach where we accept just
anything,'' party leader leader Gudrun Schyman said in a speech in
Helsingborg, according to the Swedish news agency TT.

Adams continues the war of words
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England defender Tony Adams' criticism of coach
Glenn Hoddle in his recently published book have created ``no
problems'' within the England team, the Football Association said
Tuesday.
	   In his book ``Addicted,'' currently being serialized in the Sun
newspaper, Adams accuses Hoddle of treating his World Cup players
like children.
	   Adams was in camp with Hoddle and the England team preparing for
Saturday's European Championship qualifier against Sweden in
Stockholm when the excerpts were published in the Sun.
	   The Arsenal captain's book is being released just weeks after
Hoddle's own World Cup diary, which was also serialized in the Sun
and sparked a massive controversy.
	   Hoddle was accused of betraying the confidences of his players
by revealing information about them in his account of the World Cup
campaign.
	   David Davies, FA director of public affairs _ also ghost writer
of Hoddle's book _ said Adams was ``perfectly entitled'' to express
his views.
	   He said Adams' book should be read in full and not in headlines
or single sentences.
	   The Sun reported that Adams believed he should have been
England's World Cup captain instead of Alan Shearer and that the
national coach humiliated David Beckham in front of the players.
	   Adams also suggested that Hoddle encouraged Paul Gascoigne to
drink the night before he axed him from the France 98 squad.
	   Davies released a statement Tuesday saying Adams' book will not
affect his international career.
	   ``Glenn and Tony have talked together. There is no problem
between them. Both are dedicated to England's next objective _
victory in Euro 2000,'' he said.
	   ``We are living in 1998, not 1939, and Tony has expressed his
honestly held views at particular times over the past year.
	   ``He is perfectly entitled to them.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces battled secessionist
Albanian rebels in two Kosovo areas Tuesday, and a U.S. envoy urged
Yugoslavia's president to ease restrictions on relief groups trying
to help civilians displaced by the fighting.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb police
launched an attack Tuesday on the village of Tusus, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of here.
	   A source in the party of Kosovo's main Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, said the attack began after ethnic Albanian
villagers ignored a warning by Serb police to hand over their
weapons.
	   The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Serb sources, who
also demanded anonymity, said the attack was launched after
Albanian militants ambushed a Serb police patrol earlier in the
day.
	   In Belgrade, the state-run Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported
fighting in a second area _ near the village of Rakos, 55
kilometers (35 miles) northwest of here.
	   Tanjug said Albanian ``terrorists'' opened fire on police and
Serb civilians but were driven off after an hour-long gunbattle.
	   Fighting has continued in this rebellious Serbian province
despite U.S. and European efforts to reach a cease-fire and begin
talks between the government and the Albanian leadership on
Kosovo's future.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the main province of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has promised to discuss autonomy -- favored by
the Americans and Europeans -- which he revoked in 1989.
	   But he has refused to grant independence, although Albanians
outnumber Serbs here by 9-to-one.
	   Rugova formed a panel Aug. 13 to negotiate with the government.
But so far, no face-to-face talks have been held. The government
accuses the Albanians of foot-dragging.
	   The Albanians have insisted that the Serbs first halt military
operations, which began Feb. 28 to destroy the KLA.
	   On Tuesday, a close Milosevic aide, Dragan Tomic, urged Kosovo
Albanian politicians to ``stop the agony of their own people'' and
open talks with the government.
	   In Belgrade, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met again
Tuesday with Milosevic as part of the American effort to resolve
the conflict.
	   Hill told reporters he urged Milosevic of the need for ``better
coordination'' between the government and international relief
organizations, some of whom have complained of problems receiving
visas for staffers.
	   ``There have been access problems for humanitarian
organizations,'' Hill said, adding that there had been ``some
improvement'' recently. But Hill said the estimated 230,000 people
who have fled their homes will not return unless they feel safe
from reprisals by Serb police.

Commentators ask if Norwegian PM weak or wise for taking depression
</HEADLINE>
leave &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ With Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik on
sick leave for depression, newspapers on Tuesday questioned whether
he's up to the job of leading Norway.
	   The prime minister's office announced Monday that he was taking
a week off because of a depression caused by overwork. Initial
reaction after the announcement was sympathetic, suggesting that
Bondevik was wise to recognize the symptoms.
	   But on Tuesday others questioned whether he was weak.
	   ``Is Bondevik unable to stand the pressure that comes with being
prime minister?'' the Oslo daily Dagsavisen's editor asked in a
commentary. And the newspaper VG reminded its readers of U.S.
President Harry Truman's aphorism: if you can't stand the heat, get
out of the kitchen.
	   ``But let's hope that Bondevik can put to shame the current fear
that he can't stand the heat. He deserves goodwill,'' the VG
commentary concluded.
	   Others suggested that Bondevik, as head of a fragile three-party
minority coalition government, has been subject to unusually severe
pressure.
	   The newspaper Dagbladet quoted an unnamed member of Bondevik's
Christian People's Party as criticizing former Prime Minister
Torbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik unseated last year, for bombarding
Bondevik with ``unreasonable criticism.''
	   ``We must tolerate debate in a democracy. Otherwise we're in
trouble,'' Jagland countered, according to Dagbladet.
	   Bondevik, in office less than a year, has been under intense
pressure recently as Norway's economy falters due to low oil prices
and the shockwaves of the Asian economic crisis.
	   The Central Bank had to raise interest rates twice in the past
month to protect the Norwegian currency, the krone.
	   The ecconomic troubles have forced Bondevik to postpone his
government's favorite cause, a plan to give cash support to mothers
of small children who stay home to take of them rather than putting
them in day-care.
	   The postponement raised criticism that Bondevik was breaking his
promises.
	   Although Bondevik's sick leave is supposed to be for a week,
some psychiatrists believe recovery could take much longer.
	   ``It could take from a week to several months to recover from a
slam like this,'' psychiatrist Hans Olav Tungesvik, a former
parliament member from Bondevik's party, was quoted as saying by
the news agency NTB.
	   Minister of Cultural Affairs Anne Enger Lahnstein has taken over
as acting prime minister while Bondevik is away.
	   This week she is presiding over tough budget negotiations within
the often-squabbling coalition.
	   Bondevik has not been hospitalized and is spending his leave at
home in an Oslo suburb.

Rebels denied safe passage in western Congo

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel fighters holed up in western Congo
have been refused safe passage out of the area by government-allied
troops, a government official said Tuesday.
	   An unspecified number of rebels near the town of Songololo about
250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of the capital are
``effectively considered prisoners of war,'' Deputy Interior
Minister Faustin Munene said on state radio.
	   ``They will not be given safe passage until all Rwanda and
Uganda forces withdraw from the east,'' he said.
	   While a recent government offensive has largely purged the
rebels from their positions in the west, the insurgents still
control several key cities in eastern Congo and have vowed to press
on with their fight to topple President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both the government and the rebels have relied on foreign
support during their month-long war: The government has received
military help from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia; at the same time,
Congo accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading the eastern border and
masterminding the rebel campaign.
	   Rwanda denies it has troops in Congo, but says it may intervene
in the country's civil war to protect its interests. Uganda says it
has troops inside Congo as part of a joint border defense agreement
and not in support of the rebels.
	   About 50 war prisoners that the government said were from Uganda
and Rwanda were put on display before the press Tuesday.
	   ``We're presenting these men as evidence that Congo has been the
victim of aggression,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said.
	   The prisoners wore plain khaki clothing provided by the
Congolese government and showed no military or national markings.
	   A Ugandan military spokesman on Tuesday said his country's army
will keep troops in eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels there.
	   ``We cannot pull out of Congo now,'' said Capt. Shaban
Bantariza. ``We have to maintain a buffer zone against the rebels.
It is both tactical and strategic.''
	   The rebels, a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
members of Kabila's army, lost their last strongholds in western
Congo over the weekend when Angolan troops marched into the river
port town of Matadi. For now, the rebels have virtually abandoned
their effort to take the capital.
	   Although Kinshasa still was without electricity today, life was
slowly returning to normal after pitched battles on the eastern and
western outskirts last week left scores of bodies on the streets
and sent thousands of civilians into hiding.
	   Civilians and government troops went on a rampage last week,
lynching dozens of suspected rebels. More than 37 bodies have been
spotted in recent days in various parts of the city.
	   Troops continue to staff checkpoints, but traffic on the streets
is gradually picking up.
	   At least eight journalists from state-controlled Voice of the
People radio were suspended Tuesday and accused of sympathizing
with the rebels, a journalist at the broadcasting service said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The government also moved to maintain tighter control over
telecommunication facilities in Kinshasa.
	   The government seized 50 percent control of Telecel, Kinshasa's
first and largest cellular telephone company. The phone service was
a joint venture owned by Congolese, Canadian and American
investors.
	   About 10 percent of Telecel was owned by ethnic Tutsi Congolese,
state television reported.
	   Tutsis in Kinshasa, whose Rwandan brethren have been accused of
leading the rebellion, have been rounded up and on occasion beaten.
	   Having pushed back rebel gunmen that just weeks ago were poised
to capture Kinshasa, Kabila on Monday said the war's focus would
now turn to the east.
	   The president said his army and its allies would launch
offensives to recapture rebel-held cities in eastern Congo,
including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, has returned to his former rebel stronghold
in the southern city of Lubumbashi after meeting in Namibia with
that country's president, state television said Tuesday. He has
spent much of his time in Lubumbashi since the war broke out.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's tourism ministry has granted
approval to 375 climbers from 17 countries to climb Himalayan peaks
in the fall mountaineering season that began Tuesday.

 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has banned officials from squandering money
that could be used in helping the nation recover from devastating
floods. That means feasting and living it up at public expense are
out.
	   The order appeared to reflect government concerns that officials
could trigger public resentment by living high on the hog while
millions of people remain homeless from China's worst flooding in
decades.
	   Another surge of high water barreling down the Yangtze River has
dashed hopes for an early end to the floods. The surge, the river's
eighth flood peak this year, was expected to put added pressure on
flood-weakened dikes and meant water levels on the Yangtze's middle
and lower reaches would remain high ``for a long time,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday.
	   By government count, the floods have already killed more than
3,000 people nationwide and caused 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20
billion) in losses.
	   Tuesday was the first day of a new ban on logging on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze in western Sichuan province. The ban
reflects concerns that this year's floods were exacerbated by
widespread deforestation along the river. Rain falling on denuded
hillsides washed soil into the river and its tributaries, raising
river beds and worsening flooding.
	   State television showed one villager hammering in a sign that
read ``Going into the hills to cut trees is strictly forbidden.''
	   With millions of homes, schools and factories inundated,
families and officials are getting by as best they can. For
education officials that meant turning tents into classrooms in
time for the new school year that started this week.
	   In Hubei, a province in central China that has been among the
worst hit by flooding, some children were having classes aboard
small boats. Children also were being taught in tents set up on
dikes that held back floodwaters.
	   With millions of people living in difficult conditions, many in
cramped lean-tos on high ground, officials were told to tighten
their belts and apply themselves to helping with the nation's
recovery.
	   ``Resolutely stop all extravagant and wasteful activities,'' the
ruling Communist Party and the State Council, or Cabinet, said in
an order published by Xinhua.
	   It reminded officials that they were banned from using public
funds to travel, to feast or to party, and told them not to buy new
cars this year. Officials also were warned off using public money
to buy mobile phones _ a favorite accessory for many Chinese
bureaucrats.
	   Chinese officials' penchant for lengthy, frequent meetings also
came in for attack. They were ordered to hold meetings only when
necessary and to keep them short and to the point.

Liberia's president accuses rivals of planning invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ President Charles Taylor on Tuesday
accused several former warlords of plotting to topple his
government.
	   Taylor, who himself was once Liberia's most powerful warlord,
told reporters that his intelligence service had uncovered a plot
being hatched by several former rebel leaders living in exile,
including Prince Johnson, Alhaji Kromah and Laveli Supuwood.
	   Also involved were several Liberian government officials, Taylor
claimed, without giving names. The plotters allegedly met secretly
in Sierra Leone and the United States in recent weeks, the
president said without elaborating.
	   ``We've followed it (the plot) in Liberia, to Sierra Leone and
America, where the groups have been meeting,'' Taylor said.
	   Johnson's forces are perhaps best known for capturing and
cutting the ears off former President Samuel Doe before killing him
in 1990, during the early days of Liberia's seven-year civil war.
Johnson has lived in Nigeria since 1992, while Kromah and Supuwood
_ leaders of two other former rebel factions _ are believed to be
in the U.S. and Sierra Leone respectively.
	   Taylor vowed to repel his enemies.
	   ``Wrestling power from my government will take more than they
think,'' Taylor said. ``We are watching these individuals with the
eyes of an eagle.''
	   One Taylor foes who was not mentioned Tuesday is Roosevelt
Johnson, whose supporters have clashed with Taylor's personal
military guard on several occasions in recent months. Roosevelt
Johnson, who is unrelated to Prince Johnson, accuses Taylor of
trying to kidnap and assassinate him, while the president's forces
have allegedly uncovered illegal weapons hidden by Roosevelt
Johnson's supporters.
	   Taylor won national elections last year after trading his
rebel's gun for a politician's platform. Nigerian-led West African
peacekeepers helped contain the civil war, in which more than
150,000 people died.

Court rules against financier who sued bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Stockholm's District Court on Tuesday
ruled against Swedish financier Erik Penser who had sued banking
group Nordbanken for 3.4 billion kronor (dlrs 425 million).
	   The court also said that Penser's Yggdrasil company must
Nordbanken's court costs of nearly 33 million kronor (dlrs 4.1
million).
	   The case dates from Sweden's financial crisis of the early
1990s, at which time Nordbanken took over certain holdings
controlled by Penser that had been pledged as collateral against
loans.
	   Among those holdings was a stake in Nobel Industries, which
Nordbanken bought for 1 kronor and later sold for around 4 billion
kronor.
	   Penser contended the bank owes him for forcing him to hand over
the Nobel shares after he defaulted on a loan.
	   He said he would appeal Tuesday's ruling.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces battled ethnic Albanian
rebels Tuesday in two areas of the Kosovo province, and a U.S.
envoy urged Yugoslavia's president to ease restrictions on relief
groups trying to help civilians displaced by the fighting.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb police
launched an attack Tuesday on the village of Tusus, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of here.
	   A source in the party of Kosovo's main Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, said the attack began after ethnic Albanian
villagers ignored a warning by Serb police to hand over their
weapons.
	   The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Serb sources, who
also demanded anonymity, said the attack was launched after
Albanian militants ambushed a Serb police patrol earlier in the
day.
	   In Belgrade, the state-run Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported
fighting in a second area _ near the village of Rakos, 55
kilometers (35 miles) northwest of here.
	   Tanjug said Albanian ``terrorists'' opened fire on police and
Serb civilians but were driven off after an hour-long gunbattle.
	   Fighting has continued in this rebellious Serbian province
despite U.S. and European efforts to reach a cease-fire and begin
talks between the government and the Albanian leadership on
Kosovo's future.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the main province of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has promised to discuss autonomy -- favored by
the Americans and Europeans -- which he revoked in 1989.
	   But he has refused to grant independence, although Albanians
outnumber Serbs here by 9-to-one.
	   Rugova formed a panel Aug. 13 to negotiate with the government.
But so far, no face-to-face talks have been held. The government
accuses the Albanians of foot-dragging.
	   The Albanians have insisted that the Serbs first halt military
operations, which began Feb. 28 to destroy the KLA.
	   On Tuesday, a close Milosevic aide, Dragan Tomic, urged Kosovo
Albanian politicians to ``stop the agony of their own people'' and
open talks with the government.
	   In Belgrade, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met again
Tuesday with Milosevic as part of the American effort to resolve
the conflict.
	   Hill told reporters he urged Milosevic of the need for ``better
coordination'' between the government and international relief
organizations, some of whom have complained of problems receiving
visas for staffers.
	   ``There have been access problems for humanitarian
organizations,'' Hill said, adding that there had been ``some
improvement'' recently. But Hill said the estimated 230,000 people
who have fled their homes will not return unless they feel safe
from reprisals by Serb police.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Stockholm's District Court on Tuesday
ruled against Swedish financier Erik Penser who had sued banking
group Nordbanken for 3.4 billion kronor (dlrs 425 million).
	   The court also said that Penser's Yggdrasil company must pay
Nordbanken's court costs of nearly 33 million kronor (dlrs 4.1
million).
	   The case dates from Sweden's financial crisis of the early
1990s, at which time Nordbanken took over certain holdings
controlled by Penser that had been pledged as collateral against
loans.
	   Among those holdings was a stake in Nobel Industries, which
Nordbanken bought for 1 kronor and later sold for around 4 billion
kronor.
	   Penser contended the bank owes him for forcing him to hand over
the Nobel shares after he defaulted on a loan.
	   He said he would appeal Tuesday's ruling.

Mass trial of suspected Islamic extremists gets under way
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense lawyers walking out, quote, color

<TEXT>
	   FLEURY-MEROGIS, France (AP) _ The trial of nearly 140 suspected
Islamic militants accused of aiding Islamic insurgents in Algeria
opened Tuesday in a prison gym, but almost all the defense lawyers
walked out hours later in protest.
	   The lawyers, who contest the conditions of the trial, had
immediately sought a postponement. They also asked for freedom for
27 of the defendants who have been jailed since their arrests in
1994 and 1995.
	   Early evening, almost all of the 138 defense lawyers walked out,
describing the trial as ``shameful'' and ``a masquerade.''
	   They contend the proceedings are a ``political trial'' for
France to show support for Algeria's military-backed regime. They
had indicated they would walk out after the first day.
	   The lawyers contest the size of the trial and the site, a
gymnasium of the National School of Penitentiary Administration at
the Fleury-Merogis Prison outside Paris, renovated for the
proceedings at a cost of more than 10 million francs (dlrs 1.7
million).
	   The defendants are accused of belonging to three separate but
overlapping networks that served as support bases for the Islamic
insurgency in Algeria, now in its seventh year.
	   They are accused of sending arms and medicine, recruiting
fighters and providing safe havens in France for insurgents and
funds for the cause.
	   Charged with ``criminal association with a terrorist
enterprise,'' they risk up to 10 years in prison.
	   The remainder of the 138 defendants being judged in the
two-month trial have been free on their own recognizance.
	   The hardcore of alleged leaders sat Monday in a bullet-proof box
during questioning.
	   Mohamed Chalabi, one of the alleged leaders, was asked if he was
Algerian.
	   ``No. I'm Muslim,'' he replied. ``The military authorities are
Algerian. I'm Muslim.''
	   A notable absentee at the trial was Mohamed Kerrouche,
considered the network's ideologue. He was extradited in December
from Britain, but has refused to attend the trial.
	   The gym replaces the Palais de Justice in central Paris, where
courtrooms are too small to accommodate the proceedings.
	   Defense lawyers claim most of the defendants have but a passing
connection to the three leaders of the networks, who they say
should be tried separately.
	   Kerrouch is accused of organizing support networks and
provisions for the Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the
now-banned Algerian political party the Islamic Salvation Front.
He's accused of then continuing the same work for the Armed Islamic
Group, the radical insurgency movement accused of numerous
massacres.
	   Chalabi is accused of setting up a group to collect arms,
medicine and clothing for insurgents.
	   Another leading suspect, Mourad Tacine, is accused of heading a
third group that allegedly provided false documents and lodging for
insurgents who took refuge in France.

Like old times: Graf wins at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Tuesday's early play. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With her confidence rising and her forehand
strong, Steffi Graf won a match at the U.S. Open for the first time
since 1996.
	   She beat American Corina Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 on Tuesday to
advance to the second round as the U.S. Open began Day 2.
	   After winning the year's final Grand Slam tournament in 1995 and
'96, Graf missed last year's U.S. Open because of knee surgery. Her
victory today ran her consecutive match winning streak at the Open
to 15.
	   ``It's been two years. I don't look back on what happened
before,'' Graf said. ``I look at now as a new start.''
	   In another early match, Mark Philippoussis of Australia defeated
Norway's Christian Ruud 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.
	   The forehand that once ruled women's tennis made only occasional
appearances against Morariu. But it was there everytime Graf needed
it.
	   It was in the second set, when she made 15 of her 28 unforced
errors on the day, that the eighth-seeded German appeared in danger
of matching her 1992 U.S. Open result. That was the only time she
has failed to make it out of the opening round.
	   Graf, making her debut in Arthur Ashe Stadium, grabbed a 3-0
lead in the opening set. She held her last two service games in the
set at love and appeared headed for a straight-set victory.
	   Morariu had other ideas. The Floridian, hitting as hard and as
deep as her opponent, broke Graf at love in the sixth game and
pulled even at one set apiece.
	   Graf then tightened her game, setting up a second-round match
against compatriot Marlene Weingartner.
	   On Monday night, Andre Agassi, hoping to cap his rise from the
satellite tour with his second U.S. Open title, found the Ashe
Stadium court to his liking as he overpowered Sebastien Grosjean of
France 6-4, 6-1, 6-4.
	   ``The court is definitely quicker, no question bout it,'' he
said.
	   Also advancing into the second round Monday were the two No. 1
seeds, Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis.
	   No. 9 Karol Kucera and No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic won in men's
singles and No. 6 Monica Seles, No. 9 Irina Spirlea, No. 11 Patty
Schnyder, No. 14 Dominique Van Roost and No. 16 Ai Sugiyama were
winners among the women.
	   The only seed ousted on the first day was No. 15 Alberto
Berasategui of Spain, who fell to Thomas Muster of Austria 7-6
(7-1), 6-2, 6-3.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo prepared to give
his state of the nation address Tuesday night to a nervous Mexico
rattled by rising crime, a falling peso and a bitter debate over a
dlrs 55 billion bank bailout plan.
	   Opposition parties criticized the president's handling of
Mexico's problems, even calling for his resignation as he prepared
his annual speech to a Congress that is finishing its first year
with an opposition majority.
	   ``The president has headed an administration of permanent
crisis,'' said Carlos Medina Plascencia, who leads lawmakers from
the center-right National Action Party, or PAN.
	   Quoted Tuesday in the Mexico City daily La Jornada, Medina
criticized Zedillo's handling of the proposed bank bailout. ``The
only clear thing up to now is that the government does not know
where it is going.''
	   PAN national president Felipe Calderon proposed Monday night in
a radio debate that Zedillo step down.
	   Mexican presidents had it easier in past years, when Congress
was controlled by the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
But Zedillo faces a newly critical audience as he finishes the
fourth year of his six-year term.
	   Opposition parties last year won control of Congress, ending 68
years of single party domination. Zedillo claims credit for reforms
that have made Mexican elections fairer.
	   Among his biggest challenges is gaining approval for his
proposal to assume the debts of the bank savings protection fund.
Most of the debts, now worth about dlrs 55 billion, were caused by
a collapse of the peso in December 1994.
	   Opposition parties oppose the bailout proposal, saying that
taxpayers are being asked to pay the debts of still-wealthy
millionaires.
	   Last weekend, the center-left Democratic Revolution Party
organized an informal referendum in which almost 3 million people
cast ballots against Zedillo's plan.
	   Global economic conditions also have taken a toll.
	   Plunging prices for oil, which funds much of the federal budget,
have forced the government to make wide-ranging spending cuts.
	   Worldwide turmoil in stock and currency markets have dropped the
Mexican stock market to levels not seen since 1995 _ including a 5
percent drop Monday.
	   The peso has lost about 27 percent of its value over the past
year, renewing fears of inflation and of growth-stifling
interest-rake hikes.
	   Zedillo's government also has been criticized for failure to
reach peace with the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which
rebelled in the southern state of Chiapas in 1994.
	   Talks have been stalled for several years and tensions remain
high between Zapatista sympathizers and government supporters.

Britain surrenders its traditions at a v-e-r-y stately pace

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Lord Chancellor, head of Britain's judiciary,
is tired of wearing a 17th-century costume to work and has asked
Parliament if he could, please, wear a suit for everyday and save
the knee breeches, silk stockings and buckled shoes for special.
	   Shock, horror!?
	   No, not really. Even in Britain, things do change, eventually.
	   Why, only three months ago, the very same Lord Chancellor
learned that, in the interest of safety and comfort, he no longer
would have to walk backwards in front of Queen Elizabeth II during
the annual opening of Parliament.
	   The queen has let it be known that no one is obliged to bow or
curtsy to her. Her husband, Prince Philip, gets around town in his
own taxi. And the monarchy has a Web site.
	   Change has been very much in the air since Prime Minister Tony
Blair swept into power 15 months ago at the head of a revamped
Labor Party, promising a new vision of Britain for the 21st
century.
	   ``Cool Britannia'' it's called now _ home of top fashion
designers, the Spice Girls and a prime minister who walks around in
his shirtsleeves.
	   It hasn't come a moment too soon for some who feared the country
was becoming an endless theme park for tourists who want to see the
Britain they've always read about _ in Shakespeare, Austen and
Dickens.
	   Two years ago, when Blair was still in the wings and the
Conservatives were in power, The Independent tackled the subject in
an editorial.
	   ``In Kansas City, as in Osaka, Britain lives still in the
public's imagination as Jane Austen country,'' the newspaper said.
``In such a country soldiers should, as they do ... parade outside
Horse Guards as if George II were still on the throne, the cottages
should be thatched and the castle moats deep.''
	   To some Britons, this is just plain embarrassing _ grown men and
women dressing up in silly costumes and clanking around corridors
in ceremonial swords in this age of the microchip and the cruise
missile.
	   To others, the fancy clothes are a reassuring reminder of the
country's long history and the days when Britain became Great.
	   ``It's just traditionally English, isn't it?'' said Ruth Madden,
57, an office worker at Lincoln's Inn, the green and leafy 14th
century enclave of lawyers' offices in the heart of London.
	   The legal establishment, against the wishes of young rebels in
the ranks, has decided to keep the flowing black robes and white
horsehair wigs that distinguish barristers in the courtroom.
	   ``I want to keep them in their wigs,'' agreed accountant Pat
Turner, 61. ``I think people need ritual, and these things
encompass ritual.''
	   Merisha Aldrich, 25, laughed and said her favorite tradition was
``a roast dinner, Yorkshire pudding and all that. And everyone else
thinks so, too.''
	   The Sunday roast and all the trimmings seem safe for now, but
some traditional sights of the recent past are nearly extinct.
	   Take the pinstriped, bowler-hatted businessman with tightly
furled umbrella. He occasionally can be spotted in the financial
district. But once, he was as much a symbol of London as Big Ben,
the Buckingham Palace guards in scarlet tunics, and red telephone
booths.
	   Ah, those phone booths. Thousands were scrapped in the 1980s, or
taken away to foreign lands, or turned into quaint showers and
garden planters. Only the cries of an outraged citizenry saved some
of the oldest ones to brighten dull city corners.
	   ``Some tradition is a good thing, really,'' said motorcycle
courier Chris Hines-Randle, 39, still annoyed at government changes
to ancient English county borders in the 1970s.
	   ``It's a shame about breaking the continuity,'' he said. ``What
other country can boast something 1,000 years old?''
	   Courtesy is one British tradition holding its own against the
tides of social change. People still line up uncomplainingly in
orderly queues at the bus stop and the post office, and clear their
throats murderously at anyone who tries to elbow in.
	   Businessman Mike Harris, 51, ranks courtesy second only to the
royal family as things worth keeping. But he takes a pragmatic view
of the whole ornate edifice of tradition.
	   ``I'd like to see it updated,'' he said, ``but we would lose out
on a lot of tourism. We need to find the balance between the two.''

Netanyahu says deal was close as negotiator confirms secret talks

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday he has made concessions and taken a personal
political risk for a deal that could turn over more West Bank land
to Palestinian control.
	   But Netanyahu charged that Palestinian backpedaling was
scuttling chances for agreement on the long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal.
	   ``We were very close, very close to an agreement on the
negotiations with the Palestinians a few days ago,'' Netanyahu told
a conference on Middle East affairs. ``There has been a retreat on
the Palestinian side and I think it's important that the
Palestinians come back to the table and restore and move on
understandings that were achieved in the negotiations,'' he said.
	   Palestinian officials have not reported any recent progress.
	   Negotiators have not met formally for weeks, but a senior
Palestinian official said Tuesday that a secret channel was still
actively engaged in trying to find agreement over the scope of a
withdrawal which would move the stalled peace process forward.
	   Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmed Qureia,
said he was holding the low-key talks with Yitzhak Molcho, an
attorney and confidant of Netanyahu.
	   ``There are contacts, but there is no agreement,'' Qureia told
The Associated Press.
	   The basis for the negotiations is a U.S. proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
agreed to the plan, while Israel initially said handing over 13
percent would endanger its security. Israel then countered with a
proposal to turn 3 percent of that land into a nature reserve which
would limit Palestinian control in the area.
	   Netanyahu did not disclose what had been agreed upon but said
that he had taken personal risks to work out a deal which members
of his own party oppose.
	   ``I pay a political price. But it cannot be that while I am
indicating my willingness to risk political concession and
political attacks, the Palestinian side takes no risks, and they
only address one side of the equation,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from the far right-wing in his
coalition and the influential Jewish settler lobby to cede as
little land as possible.
	   The Palestinians have not objected to land use restrictions in
principle, but want assurances that in the future they will take
full control of areas designated nature reserves. They also want
Palestinian police to be able to operate in those areas.
	   In a sign of some U.S. involvement, CIA officials met recently
with Arafat's security chiefs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, to review understandings about
security cooperation and the Palestinians' war against terrorism
that were worked out in December.
	   The understandings _ negotiated at the time by Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. security officials _ specify, for example,
that the United States would have a say in whether Islamic
militants could be released from Palestinian jails.
	   But the understandings were never put into practice because
Netanyahu refused to approve them, arguing at the time that Israel
should have a bigger role in monitoring Palestinian compliance.
	   Rajoub said Tuesday that the Palestinians would not agree to
changes in the document. ``It stands as it is,'' he said.

Germany deports Bosnian refugees, despite U.S. criticism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Despite recent criticism
from the United States, German authorities sent a group of 69
refugees back to Bosnia Tuesday.
	   On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
European allies to recognize it was ``irresponsible'' to force
people ``to return where there is no security, no housing and no
jobs.''
	   In Bonn, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl rejected the criticism,
saying Germany had welcomed twice as many refugees during the
Bosnian war as other European countries combined.
	   ``I can do without criticism from American officials, even if it
comes from a lady,'' he said at a news conference.
	   Germany harbored 350,000 Bosnian refugees during the 1992-95
war. According to German officials, some 75,000 of them have
returned to Bosnia voluntarily and another 1,200 have been deported
since the war's end.
	   But United Nations official in Bosnia, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said that Germany had deported up to 2,244
refugees since 1995. Many of them, he said, were Muslims or Croats
who cannot return to their homes under Bosnian Serb control.
	   Of the 69 refugees arriving in Sarajevo Tuesday from the German
states of and Lower Saxony, only two had criminal records,
according to Silke Handfelder, an official from the North
Rhine-Westphalia central authorities for foreigners who accompanied
the group.
	   ``All the refugees are obliged to leave the country (Germany),''
Handfelder said. ``The government of Bosnia obliged itself to take
care of those who have nowhere to go.''
	   All but six of the returnees had either relatives who could
house them, or could return to their own homes. The Bosnian
government was bringing those with nowhere to go to a U.N. refugee
transit center, which is now hosting Kosovo refugees from
neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   Jusuf Sprecic, 54, a Muslim from a predominately Muslim area
near Gracanica said his house was not destroyed, but he had spent
the last seven years in Germany because the ``living was good from
social help.''

Clinton says U.S. economy is sound, despite stock slide

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hoping to reassure investors at home and abroad,
President Bill Clinton said Tuesday the U.S. economy is on solid
footing despite the stock market's stunning recent losses.
	   ``I want to reiterate the point I think is important for Russia,
for America, for every country: We believe our fundamental economic
policy is sound,'' Clinton said during a speech at Moscow State
University.
	   Clinton said it should be no surprise that markets are jittery
at a time when Russia, Japan and other major industrial nations are
suffering economic and financial woes.
	   ``When there are problems in Russia or in Japan or questions
about the economy of China,'' there are reactions across the world,
Clinton said. ``You see, the last two days, we've had big drops in
the American stock market.''
	   Throughout the day Clinton kept close watch on stock trading. At
a Kremlin dinner Tuesday night, he and Yeltsin were chatting in a
receiving line with Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White
House's National Economic Council. As Sperling moved away, Clinton
informed him, ``The market's up,'' and gave a thumbs-up sign.
	   Weaving his reassurances about the U.S. economy into a broader
theme of global interdependence, Clinton said market gyrations are
not unexpected in an era of faster communications, shrinking trade
barriers and increasing multinational commerce.
	   ``Now in terms of what has happened in America, obviously it's
always more enjoyable when our stock market goes up than when it
goes down,'' the president said. Even so, there is no reason to
worry, he asserted.
	   ``We believe our people are working at record rates, and we are
determined to stay on a path of fiscal discipline that brought us
to where we are.''
	   In remarks later to reporters, Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said the Clinton administration is confident it
should stick to its current economic strategy, based in part on
promoting more exports of U.S. goods.
	   ``With that strategy in place, I don't see any reason why these
market developments should interfere with the basic momentum of
economic expansion, although they will have -- obviously, they'll
have effects on certain sectors of the economy,'' Summers said.
	   The deputy treasury secretary said the slide in U.S. stocks was
due in large measure to economic problems in Russia and other
nations. That shows, he said, why it is important for Congress to
approve a renewal of financing for the International Monetary Fund,
which is in the process of providing billions of dollars to Russia.

US-Russia accords to trim plutonium, warn of missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite their political and economic problems,
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin are on course at their
summit to ease jangled nuclear nerves.
	   Two agreements are due to be signed. One aims to reduce their
arsenals of plutonium and the other to share information on missile
launch tests.
	   Also, Britain is pledging to provide five days' notice of all
test launches of its Trident submarine missile systems.
	   The accord on uranium was the first to trickle out of the summit
meetings.
	   Sen. Pete Domenici, who flew here with Clinton, said the two
presidents would sign an agreement to get rid of about 50 metric
tons of plutonium on each side and break down the material so it
cannot be used for military purposes.
	   ``We both have way more than we need,'' Domenici said.
	   More specifically, Gary Samore of the National Security Council
told reporters enough plutonium for thousands of nuclear weapons
would be transformed, possibly for use as fuel for nuclear power
reactors.
	   ``This is likely to be a very expensive program, running into
hundreds of millions of dollars in both countries,'' he said.
	   Financial arrangements with Russia are to be worked out later in
the year.
	   Samore appealed to other countries to contribute if they ``share
our interest in arms control.''
	   On a second front, Clinton and Yeltsin will commit their
countries to share early warning data on launches of ballistic
missiles and space launch vehicles.
	   They also will announce agreement to establish a system for
other nations to provide advance warning, said Robert Bell, who is
Clinton's special assistant for national security affairs.
	   U.S. and Russian satellites and ground-based radar will be used
to gather information on other countries' launches and share it.
	   Bell recalled the tensions raised in Russia three years ago when
a scientific missile launch by Norway was interpreted as an attack.
The Russian missile command had begun preparations to respond
before the misreading was detected.
	   Bell said the agreement was especially relevant at a time when
Russia's early warning system is under stress from budget
difficulties.

Kenya struggles to cope with dozens blinded from embassy bomb

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Douglas Siadolo is slipping into darkness.
	   Despite the best efforts of a team of German eye specialists,
the 27-year-old Kenyan is unlikely to regain the sight he lost in
the U.S. Embassy bomb blast, when glass from a shattered car window
shot into both eyes.
	   After several operations, he can see a little light from the one
eye that doctors were able to save, but it is dimming. There is
almost no chance, his doctor says sadly, that he will recover any
useful vision.
	   ``I had hoped at first that my sight might somehow come back to
me,'' Siadolo, a husband and the father of a baby girl, said
Tuesday as he lay flat on his back on a metal-framed cot in
Kenyatta National Hospital's clean but austere eye ward. ``Now I
have to think about a different kind of life.''
	   Nearly a month after the devastating Aug. 7 explosion, which
killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000 others, the heavy
burden of having dozens blinded is only now beginning to be fully
felt.
	   Twenty people were blinded outright in the bombing and up to 50
others probably face something akin to the Western definition of
legal blindness, with the perception of light and motion but
serious impairment of their vision, hospital and other officials
said.
	   Hundreds of others have varying degrees of impaired vision, and
many of them will need follow-up treatment to prevent their sight
from deteriorating further.
	   Because recovery is extremely slow and prognosis difficult with
injuries of this nature, it may be weeks or months before the true
toll of blindness is known, doctors say.
	   Kenya's single national rehabilitation center for the blind is
already struggling to accommodate the surge in demand. And patients
like Siadolo are trying to come to grips with their disability.
	   Before the bombing, he worked as a data processor in Nairobi
while his schoolteacher wife stayed in their home village. Now he
may have to abandon his fledgling career and return there.
	   ``Going home would be the end of me,'' he said bleakly.
	   In the chaotic aftermath of the blast, doctors said up to half
of those wounded suffered some kind of eye injury. The enormous
percussive impact sent a tornado of glass whirling through
congested city streets surrounding the embassy.
	   Razor-sharp shards, many from sheer glass walls of an adjacent
bank building, caused horrific eye injuries, mainly in the form of
deep horizontal slices that damaged all parts of victims' eyes _
retina, iris, cornea, eyelid. Some people had their eyeballs cut
completely in half.
	   Also devastating were so-called perforation injuries, caused
when debris or glass pellets from bus and car windows were driven
deep into people's eyes.
	   Treating the most serious eye injuries was a race against time.
Chances of restoring vision drop off sharply if the victim does not
receive specialized surgery within the first three weeks, according
to Dr. Martin Kollmann, a German citizen working at Kenyatta
hospital's eye ward.
	   A surgical team from Munich University arrived 11 days after the
bombing and labored daily from 7:30 a.m. to midnight for more than
a week on the most critical cases. Kollmann said more than three
dozen patients were saved from blindness.
	   ``It was almost like war medicine,'' he said.
	   Before the bombing, the hospital's eye ward saw only one or two
serious eye injuries a week, drawn from throughout Kenya _
typically patients like a boy whose eye was pierced by a thorn as
he herded cattle in the bush, or car-crash victims.
	   The rush of activity has dwindled now. Half the eye patients
from the bombing have been discharged; nearly all will be sent home
by week's end.
	   The focus now is shifting from the physical emergency to the
psychological one, to helping the victims deal with disbelief and
desperation.
	   ``At first, we were afraid some of them would have jumped if
they could have found a way to do so,'' said Kollmann, gesturing
toward the ward's seventh-floor windows.
	   Those left blinded face a difficult future in Kenya, where
seeing-eye dogs are unheard of _ most families could not afford to
feed one _ and where there are almost no public facilities to aid
the blind, such as pavement guidebumps or sounding traffic signals.
	   The Kenya Society for the Blind, the country's principal
rehabilitation center, said it cannot help everyone at once: Some
will have a long wait for learning Braille and simply how to get
around.
	   ``This is definitely the biggest disaster at one go. It's a very
great stress on our resources,'' said Wilfon Noreh, the society's
director.
	   Despite the scope of tragedy, some stories ended on a note of
hope.
	   One of the most poignant cases was that of 19-year-old Benson
Atema, who has been deaf from birth. Riding in a communal taxi, or
matatu, near the embassy as the bomb went off, he was badly cut by
flying glass, and slivers embedded themselves in his eyes.
	   At the hospital, doctors at first paid more attention to his
serious head wound, not realizing his eyes were hurt as well.
Because he could not speak, he could not tell them his vision was
darkening, but eye doctors canvassing other wards recognized his
plight and swiftly sent him into surgery.
	   Asked what his emotions had been while he waited to learn
whether he would be able to see again, he wailed aloud to
demonstrate.
	   Doctors now say his prognosis is excellent. Said Kollmann: ``I
think he's the happiest man in Kenya.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kids tear around outside and the
noise is deafening as proud parents slick down the hair of their
first-graders while others crowd to read posted class lists.
	   But this is Kosovo, and Tuesday's happy bustle of school
starting up again after summer break is deceptive.
	   There are two doors to this schoolhouse, and the school is split
by concrete. One side of the wall is Serb, the other is Albanian.
Like a microscopic mirror image of Kosovo itself, two worlds exist
side-by-side in this building _ hostile, mistrustful, uncomfortably
close but seldom overlapping.
	   In one half, grade-schoolers learn about Dusan, the medieval
king who extended Serbia's boundaries further than any ruler before
or since. They hear about Kosovo's loss to the Turks after Dusan's
death, and the threat to Kosovo now from independence-minded ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population.
	   Above all, they hear that Kosovo was, is and will remain Serb.
Period.
	   On the other side, kids are taught about Skander Beg, who gave
Albanians fleeting independence in the 15th century before hundreds
of years of enslavement by Turks, Serbs and others.
	   The first inhabitants of Kosovo were descendants of Albanians,
they are told, as part of the explanation of their birthright to
the province.
	   Even the school's name depends on who you are. For Serbs, it's
Milos Crnjanski; for Albanians, Dardania.
	   There's a common schoolyard, but fear dictates caution.
	   Graffiti on the main gate reads ``This is Serbia,'' but most
Serb kids, outnumbered four to one at the school, opt for another
gate. Those who don't make a wide detour around their ethnic
Albanian schoolmates.
	   The wall, too, is explained differently according to whom one
asks.
	   English teacher Tanja Popovic says Serb authorities put it up
five years ago to protect kids from attacks by Albanian students.
Now, she says, the violence has moved outside.

Spain praises France for anti-terrorism cooperation in latest raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Interior minister praised France
for the arrest early Tuesday of 14 suspected Basque separatists in
the neighboring country.
	   French anti-terrorist police, in collaboration with Spain,
arrested nine men and five women in the southern French towns of
Bayonne and Hendaye, who are suspected of giving support to the
Spanish Basque separatist group ETA, Interior Jaime Mayor Oreja
told reporters.
	   ``The Spanish-French cooperation in anti-terrorism will grow and
grow,'' Mayor said.
	   Juan Delgado, a spokesman for the Spanish Interior Minister said
French police said those arrested were suspected members of ETA,
which stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty. He did not say
whether they would be charged.
	   Spanish Basques have traditionally used French Basque territory
as a place of refuge. But French authorities _ under pressure from
Spain _ have begun to crack down on their activities and are
extraditing many of those arrested.
	   Nearly 800 people have been killed since Basque separatists
began fighting in 1968 for an independent state in Spain's northern
Basque provinces.

10 Syrians rescued after cargo ship sinks off Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ British Royal Air Force and Cyprus police
helicopters carried out a joint rescue operation on Tuesday to
retrieve 10 sailors who abandoned a cargo ship sinking off the
coast.
	   The Belise-registered 2,000-ton Finder I was reported sinking 48
kilometers (30 miles) south of Cape Akrotiri, the Cyprus Rescue
Coordination Center reported.
	   A center official said the 10 crew members, who abandoned the
ship in life boats, were all brought to shore by the helicopters.
	   ``All crewmen have been flown to Paphos hospital in west Cyprus
and all are reported safe,'' said Mervyn Wynne Jones, spokesman for
the British bases on the island.
	   The ship left Cyprus' Limassol harbor on Monday night bound for
Turkey, developed engine trouble and started sinking, the crew told
police in Paphos.
	   There was no immediate word on what cargo it was carrying.

	   ----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has estimated it
will cost dlrs 156.1 million to recover all private and public
losses suffered by the U.S. Embassy bomb blast in Nairobi, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   In a report released Monday the government said it needed about
1.8 billion shillings (dlrs 30.3 million) for health, business and
social recovery in the wake of the blast, the independent Daily
Nation said.
	   Another 7.5 billion shillings (dlrs 125.8 million) is needed for
investments in long term projects for the same sectors, the report
said.
	   The Aug. 7 bomb blast targeting the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
killed 247 people and wounded more than 5,400.
	   Gideon Ndambuki, a minister of state in the office of President
Daniel arap Moi, said 250 businesses located near the embassy had
suffered major damage, resulting in losses of jobs and services.
	   ``Worse still, our image abroad as a tourist destination has
been tainted,'' the newspaper quoted Ndambuki as saying.
	   The report, released to Kenyan businessmen, politicians,
international aid organizations and diplomats, proposed
establishing a trust fund guarded by representatives of all the
bodies.
	   Kenya has been harshly criticized by members of the
international community and monetary institutions for corruption
reaching into high levels of government.

Copa Mercosur struggles to attract fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The money from television is
plentiful. The fans are not.
	   The Copa Mercosur features some of the top 20 club teams from
the southern cone of South America. Yet the first-round games have
struggled to attract fans.
	   One game, between Brazil's Vasco de Gama and Gremio only drew
700 people. Another, matching up Palmeiras of Brazil with
Independiente of Argentina, was played before 800 people. And only
1,000 people turned up to see Paraguay's Olimpia take on Brazil's
Corinthians.
	   Argentina's Boca Juniors and Paraguay's Cerro Porteno played to
the tournament's largest crowd of 30,000 in Asuncion.
	   The tournament was established with funding from Brazilian
television concern Traffic and an Argentine counterpart, Torneos
and Compentcias.
	   It offers dlrs 200,000 per team per game, and dlrs 3 million to
the champion. With that kind of money, the Copa Mercosur has
attracted teams from all of the nations of the South American
common market, or Mercosur: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
	   Part of the problem attracting fans may be most teams are
leaving their top players on the bench, choosing instead to use the
tournament as a chance to give substitutes more playing time.
	   Copa Mercosur comes at a time when most teams are in the early
part of championship play in their own county _ perhaps another
reason top players aren't seeing action.

Fourteen Turks found in minivan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Fourteen illegal immigrants from Turkey
were found in a Ford Transit minivan in southeastern Hungary close
to the Romanian border, a border guard spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The border guards followed the van, which was moving
suspiciously, from Nagykereki, 240 kilometers (150 miles) southwest
of Budapest, Col. Attila Krisan said by telephone.
	   The Hungarian driver tried to elude officers when he noticed
they were following the van, but was stopped by police.
	   ``Most probably the 13 men and one woman arrived from Romania,
although there's no hard evidence to prove this,'' Krisan said,
adding that ``it will be difficult to send them back to Romania.''
	   Turkish citizens need visa to enter Hungary.

UN report: small loans aren't only answer to poverty eradication
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A new U.N. report questions recent
widespread support for ``microcredit loans'' as a primary tool to
help eradicate poverty, saying many recipients simply aren't in a
position to use the money effectively.
	   The report questions a widely held belief _ including within the
United Nations _ that the loans, amounting to several hundred
dollars each, can effectively empower the world's poor with a
minimum of cost and bureaucracy.
	   The report, released by the U.N. department of economic and
social affairs on Tuesday, acknowledges that a few lending
institutions have had great success with the loans _ including the
Gramman Bank in Bangladesh and Accion International, which has lent
dlrs 1 billion to Latin America over the last five years.
	   But it cites studies which show there are ``limits to the use of
credit as an instrument for poverty eradication.''
	   ``Many people, especially the poorest of the poor, are usually
not in a position to undertake an economic activity, partly because
they lack business skills, and even the motivation for business,''
the study says.
	   The report also notes that the relatively high interest rates in
many developing nations make the loans' addiction chargesr. Poor
administrative structures can also incur extra costs.
	   ``If the transaction costs, combined with high interests rates,
require that the operation in question generate profit margins of
the order of 30 percent to 50 percent, it is not clear that this
would be economically very beneficial,'' the report said.
	   The report recommends that administrative structures be
strengthened, and that loans be provided in the context of access
to land, appropriate technology, markets, self-help solidarity
groups and counselling.
	   It also stressed that the loans should be conceived of as only
one component of an overall strategy to foster small business
enterprise.
	   Microcredit programs came to prominence in the last decade as
expectations for public financing diminished. At a ``Microcredit
Summit'' held last year in Washington, donors agreed to a plan that
would extend small loans to 100 million poor households by 2005.

Copa Merconorte to go on without Mexican teams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ CONMEBOL cancelled it once, but now
the South American confederation says it will go ahead with the
Copa Merconorte, just without the participation of teams from the
Mexico and the United States.
	   The confusion stemmed from a spat between CONMEBOL, which had
invited America, Guadalajara and Cruz Azul, and the Mexican
federation, which wanted to send Touluca, Necaxa and a third team
to be decided in a playoff.
	   When the issue couldn't be settled, the Mexican teams withdrew
and CONMEBOL announced it was cancelling the tournament. But at the
prodding of the South American teams that initially were invited,
CONMEBOL decided to forge ahead with the event _ and not invited
the CONCACAF teams.
	   ``In the next couple of days there will be more details
including a game schedule and a list of invited teams,'' a CONMEBOL
official said.
	   Besides the three Mexican teams, the original list of invitees
included Deportivo Cali, America, Millonarios and Atletico Nacional
of Colombia; Emelec, El Nacional and Barcelona of Ecuador; Peru's
Sporting Cristal, Universitario, and Alianza Lima; Bolivia's The
Stronguest; Venezuela's Caracas; and the United States' DC United
and Los Angeles Galaxy.
	   Officials from CONMEBOL say Mexico's decision to withdraw could
affect whether its teams are invited to the Copa Libertadores and
Copa America. Mexico has played in the Copa America since 1993 and
its teams played in the Copa Libertadores for the first time this
year.
	   ``The Mexicans have asked to be more involved in South American
championships and now they have a chance, they block the
participation of their teams,'' an official said.

Russian climber rescued with long homemade rope
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rescuers in southern Russia hauled a stranded
climber to safety with a 140-meter (460-foot) rope they fashioned
from parachute cords, a Russian news agency said Tuesday.
	   The rescue took place Monday night after a 24-year-old man
became frightened and stuck while climbing a mountain near the
Black Sea town of Anapa, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   A medical team summoned by the man's wife made the rope from
parachute cords borrowed from paratroopers stationed nearby. Then a
physician climbed down and tied it around him, enabling him to be
lifted out, the report said.

UN agency: El Nino, Asian crisis slow growth in Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Economic growth in Latin America will
slow down in 1998 as a result of the financial turmoil in Asia and
damage caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, a United Nations
agency said Tuesday.
	   The Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin America, or
ECLA, predicted that the region will post an average economic
growth of 3 percent this year, down from 5.3 percent in 1997.
	   Last year's good performance was coupled with the lowest
regional average inflation rate in five decades _ 10.4 percent _
and booming exports, ECLA said in its ``Economic report on Latin
America and the Caribbean, 1997-1998.''
	   The report said that effects of those ``external shocks'' on the
region ``are still moderate thanks to prompt and energetic measures
taken by most governments in the region.''
	   The measures, however, included inevitable ``financial and
budgetary restrictions'' that further slow down economic growth.
	   Regional inflation is nearing 10.9 percent and unemployment is
expected to climb, ECLA said.
	   It said inflation was mainly fueled by El Nino _ the seasonal
warming of the Pacific Ocean waters _ which triggered flooding and
droughts in many countries, with devastating effects on fishing and
agricultural activities that have sent food prices up.
	   Inflation is likely to slow down during the second half of the
year as effects on El Nino have faded.
	   But most of the consequences of the Asian crisis on the region
are yet to be seen, according to the report.
	   Main effects so far have been on the Latin countries' exports,
as their sales to Asia have dropped steeply, a situation worsened
by the competition of cheaper Asian exports to the developed
nations.
	   ``This situation is also affecting the financial area, through
speculative pressures on regional currencies, stock markets
collapses and scarcer and more expensive external credit,'' the
report said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After a meeting Tuesday with a
special U.S. envoy, President Slobodan Milosevic proposed a
``degree of self-rule'' for Kosovo province which appeared to fall
short of demands by major powers and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Meanwhile, Albanian and Serb sources reported new fighting
Tuesday in the Serbian province, where the Kosovo Liberation Army
is battling for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said at least four
Albanians, including a woman, were killed.
	   In Belgrade, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Tuesday
with Milosevic as part of the American effort to bring an end to
six months of fighting, which has killed hundreds and driven an
estimated 265,000 people from their homes.
	   Afterward, the government's Tanjug news agency said a dialogue
between Serbs and Albanians should begin as soon as possible ``so
that an agreement can be reached providing for an appropriate
degree on self-rule which would include equality for all living in
Kosovo.''
	   The statement said that after an interim period of three to five
years, the two sides could meet again to ``analyze the functioning
of the agreement'' and ``improve it on issues they mutually agree
upon.''
	   That would fall short of the Albanian demand for complete
independence. It also appeared to be less than the guarantee of
``substantial autonomy'' demanded by the U.N. Security Council in a
resolution approved unanimously March 31.
	   Hill's spokesman, Philip Reeker, the statement was positive and
generally reflected discussions. But he told The Associated Press
that the comments on self rule were ``very nebulous'' and meant
different things to Serbs and Albanians.
	   ``It's just another indication that there are negotiations, and
that they are saying they want to see some progress,'' he said.
Hill has been shuttling between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian
officials.
	   Washington and the Europeans oppose full independence, fearing
it would lead the a redrawing of borders in neighboring countries
with large Albanian populations. As a minimum, they want Milosevic
to restore the autonomy to Kosovo which he revoked in 1989.
	   Kosovo's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, formed a
panel Aug. 13 to negotiate the future of the majority Albanian
province with the government. But no face-to-face talks have been
held, and the government accuses the Albanians of foot-dragging.
	   The Albanians have insisted that the Serbs first halt military
operations, which began Feb. 28 to destroy the KLA.
	   Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, made no
mention of the Yugoslav president's formula when he spoke with
reporters after the meeting. But Hill described his talks as
``good.''
	   Hill said he urged Milosevic to provide ``better coordination''
between the government and international relief organizations
trying to aid Kosovo refugees. Some organizations have complained
of delays receiving visas for staffers.
	   ``There have been access problems for humanitarian
organizations,'' Hill said, adding that there had been ``some
improvement'' recently. But Hill said refugees will not return
unless they feel safe from reprisals by Serb police.
	   In Kosovo, Hugh Q. Parmer, a senior official with the U.S.
Agency for International Development, toured some of the areas
where refugees have set up camp in the open. Afterward, he promised
a substantial increase in American aid.
	   ``Those suffering the most ... are innocent women, children, old
people,'' he said.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the Albanian center said three
Albanian men and one woman were killed and seven people wounded
when Serb police shelled the village Rusinovce, 15 kilometers (9
miles) to the south. The Albanians also said police launched an
attack Tuesday on another village, Tusus, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) southwest of Pristina, after villagers ignored a warning to
hand over their weapons.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attack was launched after Albanian militants ambushed a Serb police
patrol earlier in the day.

Phonemaker Ericsson pulls business out of Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish telecommunications giant LM
Ericsson on Tuesday said it would give in to pressure from
activists and stop doing business in Myanmar.
	   Ericsson, which makes mobile telephones and switching equipment,
along with a wide array of other communications goods, has come
under increasing pressure to pull out of Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   Human-rights groups said doing business in the country provided
support to Myanmar's military rulers, who have cracked down on
democracy activists including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung Sann
Suu Kyi.
	   Among the groups' actions was launching a protest of Ericsson's
sponsorship of the current concert tour by pop singer Celine Dion.
	   Ericsson had argued that improving communications in Myanmar
gave democracy activists improved capability to pursue their
campaign.
	   Company spokesman Lars Staalberg said ``We don't think the
decision (to pull out) will make the situation there any better''
but said the company was concerned that protests would damage the
company's business.
	   Ericsson reported doing about 20 million kronor (dlrs 2.5
million) of business in Myanmar last year.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street was roaring back Tuesday, with the
Dow industrials rising more than 315 points in a late buying spree
that followed a 512-point rout Monday that more than wiped out the
rest of this year's gains.
	   In another day of wide swings, the Dow Jones industrial average
jumped 143.41 as trading began, soon retreated to a loss of 138.77,
then shot up in spurts, with the buying accelerating in the closing
hour. The Dow, which has fallen nearly 1,000 points in the past
three sessions alone, was up 315.39 at 7,854.46, a 4.2 percent
surge, in extremely heavy trading by late afternoon.

U.S. envoy condemns massacres of Serb civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A special U.S. envoy condemned the
alleged killings of Serb civilians Tuesday and said international
experts mat be sent to determine who was responsible for their
deaths.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting Yugoslav president Slobodan
Milosevic, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill expressed his shock and
condemnation at the killings of 22 Serb civilians that Serbian
officials say were carried out by ethnic Albanian militants.
	   Ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence of Serbia's
southern Kosovo province. Serbia is the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   ``I can assure you that we are shocked by this type of brutality
and we feel that whoever did this has to be caught, tried and
punished,'' he said.
	   Serbian officials and media have likened the state of the bodies
unearthed last week in Klecka, a village in Kosovo, to Nazi
persecutions during World War II. Television footage showed human
bones and lime-covered remains in what was called a
``crematorium.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has denied the killings.
	   ``There is a possibility the international community will send a
forensic team to help with identification of the remains in
Klecka,'' Hill said, but did not elaborate.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel fighters holed up in western Congo
have been refused safe passage out of the area by government-allied
troops, a government official said Tuesday.
	   An unspecified number of rebels near the town of Songololo about
250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of the capital are
``effectively considered prisoners of war,'' Deputy Interior
Minister Faustin Munene said on state radio.
	   ``They will not be given safe passage until all Rwanda and
Uganda forces withdraw from the east,'' he said.
	   While a recent government offensive has largely purged the
rebels from their positions in the west, the insurgents still
control several key cities in eastern Congo and have vowed to press
on with their fight to topple President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both the government and the rebels have relied on foreign
support during their month-long war: The government has received
military help from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia; at the same time,
Congo accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading the eastern border and
masterminding the rebel campaign.
	   Rwanda denies it has troops in Congo, but says it may intervene
in the country's civil war to protect its interests. Uganda says it
has troops inside Congo as part of a joint border defense agreement
and not in support of the rebels.
	   About 50 war prisoners that the government said were from Uganda
and Rwanda were put on display before the press Tuesday.
	   ``We're presenting these men as evidence that Congo has been the
victim of aggression,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said.
	   The prisoners wore plain khaki clothing provided by the
Congolese government and showed no military or national markings.
	   A Ugandan military spokesman on Tuesday said his country's army
will keep troops in eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels there.
	   ``We cannot pull out of Congo now,'' said Capt. Shaban
Bantariza. ``We have to maintain a buffer zone against the rebels.
It is both tactical and strategic.''
	   In South Africa, where heads of state were gathering for the
Nonaligned Movement summit in the coastal city of Durban, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for the withdrawal of all
foreign troops.
	   ``We need to find a way of getting everybody to talk,'' he told
reporters.
	   Deputy South African President Thabo Mbeki told SABC radio he
was ``confident'' the parties would reach an agreement on a
ceasefire.
	   But peace talks, at least up until now, have gone nowhere.

World Food Program launches dlrs 20.5 million Cuba appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The World Food Program on Tuesday launched
a dlrs 20.5 million appeal for food to help Cubans suffering from
the worst drought in decades.
	   An estimated 615,000 people in five eastern provinces _ Holguin,
Las Tunas, Granma, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo _ urgently need
food to carry them through the next harvest in May, WFP said in a
statement.
	   A second year of abnormally dry weather, blamed on the El Nino
weather phenomenon, has caused crop losses that are expected to
total at least dlrs 267 million if the drought continues through
September, WFP said. Livestock and milk losses are valued at dlrs 8
million.
	   ``These people need help, and they need it as soon as
possible,'' said the WFP executive director, Catherine Bertini.
``The situation is worsening, and it is clear the country confronts
a serious shortfall in food.''
	   In addition to donor countries, the WFP was targeting
corporations, private organizations and Cuban groups off the island
for money.
	   The Cuban government requested the aid because of crop losses
and lack of hard currency for food imports, WFP said. The WFP aid
would complement the government's rations with rice, beans, oil,
canned fish and flour.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Armed civilians took over a stretch of
the country's main north-south road Tuesday, staving off police
attempts to reopen the road.
	   The civilians blocked about 3 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the main
north-south road near the southern town of Gjirokastra, 90 miles
(145 kilometers) south of the capital Tirana, state news agency ATA
reported.
	   ATA quoted the Gjirokastra police chief Edmond Stepa, as saying
that other armed civilians had taken up fighting positions in the
hills on the street sides and were shooting with different weapons.
	   Stepa was quoted saying that police troops from neighboring
towns arrived in Gjorokastra to help regain control of the road.
	   No motive for the incident was immediately given.
	   The same road was blocked for half an hour on Monday, after some
2,000 demonstrators broke through police lines an marched on the
prime minister's office, but police quickly regained control.

Congo war tackled at Nonaligned summit

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Efforts to stop a Congolese civil
war that threatens regional security went into high gear on Tuesday
as United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for the
withdrawal of all foreign troops.
	   Annan met for 20 minutes with South African President Nelson
Mandela, saying afterwards that the key goal was to have dialogue,
not conflict.
	   ``We need to find a way of getting everybody to talk,'' Annan
told reporters at the Nonaligned Movement summit.
	   Mandela, who has been criticized by some of his neighbors for
trying to negotiate a settlement of the month-old conflict, earlier
met Organization of African Unity head Salim Ahmed Salim. Details
of the discussion were not available.
	   Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have sent troops to back Congo
President Laurent Kabila, who claims Rwanda and Uganda are backing
rebels trying to unseat his year-old government.
	   Annan told a news conference earlier Tuesday in Johannesburg
that all foreign forces should leave the vast and mineral rich
Central African country.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, Kabila's staunchest backer,
arrived Tuesday for the global heads of state summit that begins
Wednesday.
	   He was quoted by Zimbabwe state media on Tuesday as saying the
``invading forces'' _ referring to Uganda and Rwanda, who have
denied their involvement _ had requested safe passage home for
soldiers trapped behind government lines.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told SABC radio on Tuesday that he
was ``confident'' the parties would reach an agreement on a
ceasefire.
	   Contentiousness on the issue developed into a shouted outburst
by a Congolese official angry with a member of an opposition group
_ Raphael Amici _ that held a news conference at the Nonaligned
summit.
	   The group _ the Council for a Federal Democratic Congo _
described its plans to rebuild Congo and help form an interim
government, although it said it was not connected to the rebels.
	   CFDC's 15 members are exiles representing each of Congo's 15
provinces and have met with United Nations and South African
officials, SABC-TV reported Tuesday.
	   The group's advisor was a Canadian businessman Stewart Sanford
who said he worked in the mining business in Congo until Kabila's
officials demanded bribes for copper investments.

Greene wins a fast 100, Jones stays unbeaten in women's dash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Maurice Greene of the United States overcame cool
conditions and blasted home in the 100-meter sprint at the ISTAF
Golden League track and field meet Tuesday to win in 9.94 seconds,
a meet record.
	   Greene, the world champion, led a 1-2 American finish and paced
three sprinters under 10 seconds. Jon Drummond was second in 9.98,
while Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago was third in 9.99.
	   ``I am happy, 9.94 is a good time with these temperatures,''
Greene said. ``Too cold for the sprint but I know that I can run a
world record if it's warmer.''
	   Marion Jones of the United States won the women's 100 in 10.81,
a meet record. Unbeaten this year, Jones stayed in contention for
at least a share of the dlrs 1 million jackpot to be given to
athletes who win their events in all seven Golden League meets.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco also remained in contention by
cruising home in the men's 1,500-meter race.
	   The Moroccan ran unchallenged and clocked a time of three
minutes, 30.23 seconds, more than four seconds outside his world
record.
	   ``I didn't want to risk anything,'' El Guerrouj said. ``The time
is OK, it was too cold to be really relaxed.''
	   ``Now I can see that house I want to build for my parents,'' he
said.
	   El Guerrouj beat Noah Ngeny of Kenya by more than three seconds.
Ngeny clocked 3:33.54, while his countryman Laban Rotich finished
third in 3:33.81.
	   Another athlete with a shot at the lucrative jackpot, Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, stayed alive by winning the 5,000 in a
slow time of 12:56.52. His world record, which he regained this
summer, is 12:39.36.
	   Bryan Bronson of the United States kept alive his hopes of
sharing the biggest prize in athletics, but just barely.
	   Bronson caught up with Stephane Diagana of France at the last
hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles and won in a photo finish, clocking
48.03, one second off his personal best. Diagana, the world
champion, was second in 48.04, while Eric Thomas of the United
States placed third in 48.67.
	   Michael Johnson, the world and Olympic champion, cruised home in
44.62 to win the 400 and lead an American sweep. Johnson's time,
however, was nearly a second off his best for the year.
	   ``I am very proud of this year because I was able to come from
ground zero and still be ranked No. 1 in he world,'' said Johnson,
who battled injuries at the start of the season. This was Johnson's
final event of the season.
	   Jerome Young was second in 45.18, while Tyree Washington
finished third in 45.36.
	   Another Olympic and world champion, Allen Johnson of the United
States, beat world record holder Colin Jackson of Britain in the
110-meter hurdles, winning in 13.12. Jackson was second in 13.20.

India tests surface-to-air missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Tuesday tested a surface-to-air
missile that can carry conventional explosives up to a range of 25
kilometers (15 miles), Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   The test of the indigenous 650-kilogram (1,444-pound) missile
was postponed three times during the day for technical reasons, PTI
said. It gave no details.
	   It was fired later in the night at a test site in India's
eastern Orissa state. The missile has been named ``Akash,'' which
means sky. An earlier test was held in August.
	   India tested five underground nuclear devices May 11-13 and is
perfecting a delivery system.
	   The Indian government plans to increase the range of the
intermediate-range Agni missile, which it had previously tested up
to of 1,550 miles (2,480 kilometers). Its test firing was halted
two years ago following pressure from the United States.
	   India says it needs a nuclear defense against China and its
other neighbor Pakistan, both nuclear powers. India has fought
three wars with Pakistan since 1948 and one with China in 1962.
	   In the last two years, India also has tested a short-range
ballistic Prithvi (Earth) missile with a range of 150 kilometers
(95 miles).

Speeches, songs, dance mark anniversary of Gadhafi rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Thousands of Libyans gathered in Martyrs
Square in the Libyan capital on Tuesday to mark the anniversary of
the coup that brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   As in previous years, Gadhafi did not attend the ceremony, which
was broadcast live on Libyan television.
	   It began with a 30-member band clad in green uniforms playing
the national anthem and continued with speeches and a parade that
included boy scouts in uniform, dance troops and singers.
	   One of the dancers sashayed through the square balancing a clay
pot on his head.
	   Gadhafi came to power in a military coup on Sept. 1, 1969. The
coup occurred while the last Libyan king, Idris, was in Turkey for
medical treatment. The king died in exile in Egypt in 1983.
	   Gadhafi, who was 27 at the time of the coup, now is 56.
	   Front-row seats were reserved for members of a Sudanese
delegation, which flew to Tripoli on Tuesday in violation of U.N.
sanctions.
	   The sanctions, which ban air travel to and from the country,
were imposed in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two
Libyans suspected of involvement in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The television showed members of the Sudanese delegation leaving
the Sudan Airways plane shouting anti-American slogans. ``We will
not obey the Americans,'' they chanted as welcoming Libyans
responded with the same words.
	   During Tuesday night's ceremony, the announcer described the
anniversary as ``a great, historic day where the will of this
people proved that it is greater than all the conspiracies,
American fleets and the schemes of imperialism.''
	   He bragged that ``Arab and African guests have challenged the
unjust blockade and the air travel ban'' to arrive for the
celebrations, which generally last for several days.
	   Most of the speakers pledged their allegiance to Gadhafi. A
trade union representative called Gadhafi ``the destroyer of
chains, leader of freedom.''
	   Martyrs Square was lit with stadium-like floodlights for the
celebration, and huge portraits of Gadhafi hung from buildings that
front the square.
	   Amid the crowd were members of a youth group, all wearing green
headbands and chanting: ``We don't care about America. Gadhafi is
our leader.''
	   Among those in the parade were men and women in Kurdish national
dress carrying the red flag of the Turkish guerrilla group
Kurdistan Workers Party, which is known by the initials PKK.
	   Libyan men and women in Bedouin dress performed a folk dance in
which they waved sticks in the air.
	   A number of floats celebrated Libya's economic achievements.
One, in the shape of a train engine, heralded local soft drinks.
Another carried paper products, including baby diapers and toilet
tissues.
	   In an effort to resolve the Lockerbie impasse, the United States
and Britain last month said they would accept a trial of the
suspects before a Scottish tribunal in the Netherlands.
	   Gadhafi has accepted that in principle, but has called for
negotiations with the two countries on the details of the trial and
the suspects' care once they have been transferred to Dutch
custody.

World Food Program launches dlrs 20.5 million Cuba appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The World Food Program on Tuesday launched
a dlrs 20.5 million appeal for food to help Cubans suffering from
the worst drought in decades.
	   An estimated 615,000 people in five eastern provinces _ Holguin,
Las Tunas, Granma, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo _ urgently need
food to carry them through the next harvest in May, WFP said in a
statement.
	   A second year of abnormally dry weather, blamed on the El Nino
weather phenomenon, has caused crop losses that are expected to
total at least dlrs 267 million if the drought continues through
September, WFP said. Livestock and milk losses are valued at dlrs 8
million.
	   ``These people need help, and they need it as soon as
possible,'' said the WFP executive director, Catherine Bertini.
``The situation is worsening, and it is clear the country confronts
a serious shortfall in food.''
	   In addition to donor countries, the WFP was targeting
corporations, private organizations and Cuban groups off the island
for money.
	   The Cuban government requested the aid because of crop losses
and lack of hard currency for food imports, WFP said. The WFP aid
would complement the government's rations with rice, beans, oil,
canned fish and flour.

maneuvers. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran began wide-scale military exercises
Tuesday with a parade near the border with Afghanistan, where
Tehran claims that the Taliban militia is holding 47 Iranians.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers kicked off the maneuvers,
codenamed Ashura 3, with a parade in Torbat-e Jam in northeastern
Khorasan province.
	   The actual exercises are to begin Wednesday, and ground and air
troops from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the
volunteer Basij Resistance Forces will take part.
	   The three-day maneuvers, the largest this year, are the first
near the border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. They are named
``Ashura'' for the holiday marking the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's
most revered figure, Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Mohammed.
	   The Guard Corps commander, Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, told
the assembled troops that ``Iran will not tolerate foreign
interference at its borders ... and will defend its territorial
integrity,'' according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
	   State-run Iranian television later quoted Safavi as saying that
medium-range Sam-6 missiles would be used during the exercises. The
broadcast was monitored by the BBC in London.

Pakistani journalist struggles for permission to accept U.S. human
</HEADLINE>
rights fellowship &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani journalist Zafaryab Ahmed's
reports on slave-like working conditions for children won him a
human rights fellowship in the United States at the cost at home of
a jail term, sedition charges and his right to travel.
	   After months of badgering his government and courts, the
44-year-old freelance reporter on Tuesday said he hopes for word
this week on whether he can travel to the United States to accept
the first-ever Oak Human Rights Fellowship at Colby College, in
Portland, Maine.
	   ``I am trying to remain optimistic, but I don't know what will
happen,'' Ahmed said by telephone. On Tuesday, a Pakistani court
again postponed a decision on returning his seized passport and
restoring his right to travel abroad.
	   Ahmed was arrested in 1995 and charged with sedition for his
reports about the murder of 12-year-old Iqbal Masih, an activist
against Pakistan's bonded labor system. Under that system, the poor
borrow money from an employer against a pledge to work off the
debt. Human rights groups say that can mean a lifetime in virtual
slavery.
	   The boy Masih escaped at age 10, six years after his parents
sold his services to a carpet factory. He fled to United States and
then Sweden, began to campaign against the system, and was shot to
death by unknown assailants in Pakistan.
	   Ahmed's probe of the murder and bonded labor brought charges of
sedition and allegations that he worked for neighboring India, the
arch-enemy of this southern Asian nation, to taint Pakistan's
reputation.

 &UR; Cell test could identify aggressive prostate cancer &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Testing tumor cells for a specific type of
protein may identify prostate cancer patients who need aggressive
treatment and save others from unnecessary surgery and radiation,
U.S. researchers say.
	   There are two types of prostate cancer _ one is fast-acting and
one grows very slowly _ and the difference may be signaled by the
level of a protein called p27, according to researchers with the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute in New York.
	   A report on their study will appear Wednesday in the Journal of
the National Cancer Institute.
	   The protein p27 is abundant in normal prostate glands and acts
as a tumor suppressor, said Dr. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, a
Sloan-Kettering researcher and first author of the study.
	   ``P27 is like a brake on a car,'' he said. ``It stops cells from
proliferating.''
	   Dr. Richard G. Middleton of the University of Utah, co-chairman
of a committee developing prostate cancer treatment guidelines for
the American Urological Association, said that finding biological
markers that will identify aggressive prostate cancers would be
``enormously important.''
	   But Middleton cautioned that developing enough confidence in
such markers to actually influence treatment decisions ``will be
very difficult and may take a long period of time.''
	   ``I hope they are on to something,'' Middleton said of the
Sloan-Kettering study. ``There is a lot of effort under way in the
field to find ways to identify patients at risk of the aggressive
carcinoma.''
	   The p27 marker is different from prostate specific antigen, or
PSA, which is a protein in the blood used to help identify prostate
problems. Elevated PSA counts suggest that a prostate gland is
enlarged, but does not give definitive evidence of cancer.
	   Prostate cancer, however, does directly affect the level of p27,
said Cordon-Cardo. Some cancers have near-normal levels of the
protein and others have low to undetectable levels.
	   ``Some cancers seem to chew up and destroy the expression of
p27,'' said Cordon-Cardo. ``We see it being destroyed by some
mechanism that we don't yet understand.''
	   In an analysis of 130 prostate cancer specimens, Cordon-Cardo
said his team found that those cancers with little or no expression
of p27 were very aggressive, growing and spreading rapidly.
	   But in cancers where the p27 was still being expressed, the
cancer was less dangerous, he said.
	   ``Normal levels of p27 seems to suggest that the chances for a
benign course of disease is very high,'' said Cordon-Cardo. ``If
that is the case, then these patients could be given a better
quality of life by being less aggressive in the therapy.''
	   Treating prostate cancer with surgery or intensive radiation
often can cause impotence and incontinence.
	   Prostate cancer often develops late in life and can be very slow
growing. In many cases, patients die of other causes long before
the prostate disease becomes life-threatening. This means that for
some patients just ``watchful waiting'' or mild radiation can be
the appropriate treatment.
	   But in other cases, prostate cancer can move very rapidly,
seeding into other organs and leading to death. Control of these
types of cancers requires surgery followed by radiation and
chemotherapy.
	   The clinical challenge, said Cordon-Cardo, is identifying which
therapy is appropriate for which patient. Being too aggressive in
treatment may lead to unnecessary surgery and possibly to side
effects such as incontinence or impotence. Not being aggressive
enough, however, can allow the cancer to become deadly.
	   ``In the field of prostate cancer, we desperately need markers
that will help with prognostication,'' he said. ``If we had such
markers, then we could tailor the therapy for each patient and
improve the chances for a cure.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo prepared to give
his state of the nation address Tuesday night to a nervous Mexico
rattled by rising crime, a falling peso and a bitter debate over a
dlrs 55 billion bank bailout plan.
	   Opposition parties criticized the president's handling of
Mexico's problems, even calling for his resignation as he prepared
his annual speech to a Congress that is finishing its first year
with an opposition majority.
	   ``The president has headed an administration of permanent
crisis,'' said Carlos Medina Plascencia, who leads lawmakers from
the center-right National Action Party, or PAN.
	   Quoted Tuesday in the Mexico City daily La Jornada, Medina
criticized Zedillo's handling of the proposed bank bailout. ``The
only clear thing up to now is that the government does not know
where it is going.''
	   PAN national president Felipe Calderon proposed Monday night in
a radio debate that Zedillo step down.
	   Mexican presidents had it easier in past years, when Congress
was controlled by the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
But Zedillo faces a newly critical audience as he finishes the
fourth year of his six-year term.
	   Opposition parties last year won control of Congress, ending 68
years of single party domination. Zedillo claims credit for reforms
that have made Mexican elections fairer.
	   Among his biggest challenges is gaining approval for his
proposal to assume the debts of the bank savings protection fund.
Most of the debts, now worth about dlrs 55 billion, were caused by
a collapse of the peso in December 1994.
	   Opposition parties oppose the bailout proposal, saying that
taxpayers are being asked to pay the debts of still-wealthy
millionaires.
	   Last weekend, the center-left Democratic Revolution Party
organized an informal referendum in which almost 3 million people
cast ballots against Zedillo's plan.
	   Global economic conditions also have taken a toll.
	   Plunging prices for oil, which funds much of the federal budget,
have forced the government to make wide-ranging spending cuts.
	   Worldwide turmoil in stock and currency markets have dropped the
Mexican stock market to levels not seen since 1995 _ including a 5
percent drop Monday.
	   The peso has lost about 27 percent of its value over the past
year, renewing fears of inflation and of growth-stifling
interest-rake hikes.
	   Zedillo's government also has been criticized for failure to
reach peace with the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which
rebelled in the southern state of Chiapas in 1994.
	   Talks have been stalled for several years and tensions remain
high between Zapatista sympathizers and government supporters.

Brazil announces new coaching staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The housecleaning has begun on the
Brazilian soccer team in the wake of its World Cup debacle,
starting with the coaching staff.
	   The Brazilian Soccer Confederation has 15 new assistants for
coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, who replaced veteran Mario Zagallo
after Brazil lost the Cup final 3-0 to France.
	   His top aide will be Candinho, now coach of Portuguesa de
Desportos. A former coach of Saudi Arabia, Candinho qualified the
team for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
	   A novelty on the staff is the addition of a full-time
psychologist, Suzy Fleury. She also is the first woman named to the
Brazilian technical commission.
	   Eight of the 15 members are from Corinthians, the Sao Paulo club
where Luxemburgo will coach until December.
	   On Friday, Luxemburgo is expected to announce the team that will
face Yugoslavia in an exhibition game in Sao Luis on Sept. 23.
	   Luxemburgo said he planned to call many young players who will
qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Earlier, he cited Pedrinho
and Felipe of Copa Libertadores champion Vasco da Gama.
	   Brazil also is to play exhibition games against Mexico on Oct.
14 in Mexico; Russia, Nov. 18 in Fortaleza; Italy or the
Netherlands, Dec. 10 in Sao Paulo; and Croatia, next April at a
site to be announced.

Tigers fire manager Buddy Bell
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Buddy Bell was fired Tuesday as manager of the
Detroit Tigers, and bench coach Larry Parrish was appointed interim
manager for the rest of the season.
	   Detroit has lost 22 of its last 27 games and at 52-85 has the
worst record in the American League.
	   Bell, 47, had two years left on his contract, and finished with
a 185-277 record. His winning percentage of .400 is the worst of
any Tigers manager since Frank Dwyer had a .385 percentage in going
52-83 in 1902.
	   The Tigers won 79 games last season, an improvement of 26 games
over 1996 and expected to be more competitive this season. But
Detroit started 4-17 and never recovered.
	   In Bell's first season, 1996, the Tigers lost 109 games. Their
1997 was record, 79-83, was the best ever bounce back among the 19
teams with 109-loss seasons.
	   General manager Randy Smith on Friday gave Bell a vote of
confidence, saying he knew of no reason why Bell wouldn't be back
in 1999.
	   ``I know Buddy's not being evaluated strictly on wins and
losses,'' Smith said. ``I think our relationship is great.''

Stores for the Rich Link in Bond Street
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The two biggest names in British luxury goods and
jewelry, both founded in the 18th century, opened for the first
time on Tuesday in London's Bond Street as the united business of
Asprey and Garrard.
	   A military band played as a horse-drawn coach with a mounted
police escort drew up outside the store with four craftsmen bearing
a suite of diamond jewelry set in platinum worth two million pounds
(dlrs 3.2 million), a gold coffee pot, a silver dish engraved with
the first Asprey and Garrard hallmark and an alligator suitcase.
	   Although both companies have been owned for several years by
Amedeo Crown, the family trust of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, younger
brother of the Sultan of Brunei, Garrard had continued to operate
in Regent Street a few hundred yards (meters) away until a month
ago.
	   ``It made absolute business and commonsense logic to come
together and to have our sales and workshops under one roof in Bond
Street,'' said Ian Dahl, chairman and chief executive.
	   ``Regent Street is not what it was, more a tourist center these
days, and almost a continuation of Oxford Street,'' he said in an
interview.
	   The newly named ``corner shop'' where Asprey has traded since
1847 occupies what were once nine Georgian houses, one of which was
the last London home of nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale.
	   Asprey and Garrard has total sales in excess of 200 million
pounds (dlrs 320 million) a year.
	   Dahl believes the combination should reinforce the brand name in
the world marketplace, see developing sales in the United States,
Asia and the Pacific and make it ``much more able to take on any
flexing of the market'' due to current international financial
strains.
	   Garrard was founded in 1735 and made Crown Jeweler by Queen
Victoria in 1843. Since then it has been responsible for the crown
jewels housed at the Tower of London and does any work needed on
them.
	   Asprey, founded in 1781, built its reputation for design and
craftsmanship on dressing cases and leather luggage, often to order
from the royal family. It is internationally known for creating
exclusive gifts for the rich.
	   Garrard made Princess Diana's engagement ring in 1981 while
Asprey is the last store she was seen to visit before she went to
Paris and was killed there in an auto crash a year ago.

Holocaust survivors welcome government involvement in claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Holocaust survivor groups in Israel welcomed
Tuesday the establishment of a government committee to monitor
negotiations on restitution of World War II-era assets and the
distribution of Swiss funds to needy survivors.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the decision for a
ministerial committee Monday at a meeting with leaders of the
groups.
	   The committee will oversee distribution of money from a Swiss
fund to needy survivors in Israel. It will also receive reports on
negotiations between Jewish groups and European governments, banks
and insurance companies on the restitution of Jewish property and
assets.
	   The Israeli government has mostly taken a back seat on the
issues, leaving the work up to large Jewish umbrella organizations
in Israel and abroad.
	   Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan said the government was
becoming more involved to ensure accountability in the distribution
of the funds earmarked for Israel.
	   ``A government is by nature more open to public scrutiny than
private organizations. The establishment of this committee will
ensure transparency,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   The involvement was welcomed by Yoram Dori, Israeli spokesman of
the World Jewish Restitution Organization, which has been actively
involved in claims negotiations.
	   ``The struggle for the restitution of the Jewish property
plundered by the Nazis has been going on for more than 50 years,
and anything the government can do to help is useful,'' he said.
	   Moshe Sanbar, chairman of The Center of Organizations of
Holocaust Survivors in Israel, accused some leaders negotiating
with governments and financial institutions, of failing to include
Israeli survivor groups in the decision-making process.
	   ``We have been asked to approve agreements signed in New York
without seeing the texts,'' he said. ``I think it will be more
difficult for them to keep the government in the dark, or at least
I hope so.''
	   Six million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust. After the
war, many survivors came to pre-state Palestine and helped
establish the Jewish state.
	   Money from a Swiss humanitarian fund, a recent settlement of
dlrs 1.25 billion from Swiss banks over dormant accounts plus at
least dlrs 100,000 from several European insurance companies for
unpaid policies are already promised to survivors. Plus there are
suits pending against German corporations who used Jews as slave
labor during World War II.

Most U.S. medical schools now teaching alternative therapies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Almost two-thirds of traditional U.S. medical
schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic,
acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine, a survey
found.
	   With millions of Americans visiting alternative practitioners
yearly, educators whose job is to prepare doctors of the future
have no choice but to ``respond to this relentless challenge to
evolve,'' researchers said.
	   The survey of the nation's 125 medical schools was published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   The survey, conducted last fall, found that 75 of the 117
responding schools offered elective courses in alternative medicine
or included those topics in required courses. Less than two years
before, an AMA poll of the same schools found that only 46 were
teaching such topics.
	   ``That's an extraordinary rise for a very traditional and
conservative area,'' said lead author Miriam S. Wetzel, a
curriculum coordinator at Harvard Medical School.
	   ``Now, these things are being taught in Western medical schools,
not necessarily the techniques of how to do them, but certainly
about them.''
	   Dr. David Spiegel, medical director of the Complementary
Medicine Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center, said he was
not surprised by the survey's findings.
	   ``There has been sort of a sea change,'' he said. ``Traditional
doctors are seeing that people are voting with their feet and with
their pocketbooks.''
	   A 1993 survey suggested that Americans spent dlrs 14 billion
yearly on alternative care, much of it out of their own pockets.
	   Health insurers in the past have refused to pay for alternative
therapies, but that also is changing as insurers realize they can
save money.
	   For example, unconventional treatment might call for exercise or
chiropractic or acupuncture for back pain, while the traditional
approach might be surgery.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Maurice Greene of the United States overcame cool
conditions and blasted home in the 100-meter sprint at the ISTAF
Golden League track and field meet Tuesday to win in 9.94 seconds,
a meet record.
	   Greene, the world champion, led a 1-2 American finish and paced
three sprinters under 10 seconds. Jon Drummond was second in 9.98,
while Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago was third in 9.99.
	   ``I am happy, 9.94 is a good time with these temperatures,''
Greene said. ``Too cold for the sprint but I know that I can run a
world record if it's warmer.''
	   Marion Jones of the United States won the women's 100 in 10.81,
a meet record. Unbeaten this year, Jones stayed in contention for
at least a share of the dlrs 1 million jackpot to be given to
athletes who win their events in all seven Golden League meets.
	   The series ends Sept. 5 in Moscow, and four athletes still have
a chance of sharing the jackpot.
	   Jones beat Sevatheda Fynes of Bahamas, who clocked 11.07. Irina
Privalova of Russia was third in 11.12.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco also remained in contention for
the jackpot by cruising home in the men's 1,500-meter race.
	   The Moroccan ran unchallenged and clocked a time of three
minutes, 30.23 seconds, more than four seconds outside his world
record.
	   ``I didn't want to risk anything,'' El Guerrouj said. ``The time
is OK, it was too cold to be really relaxed.''
	   ``Now I can see that house I want to build for my parents,'' he
said.
	   El Guerrouj beat Noah Ngeny of Kenya by more than three seconds.
Ngeny clocked 3:33.54, while his countryman Laban Rotich finished
third in 3:33.81.
	   Another athlete with a shot at the lucrative jackpot, Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, stayed alive by winning the 5,000 in a
slow time of 12:56.52. His world record, which he regained this
summer, is 12:39.36.
	   ``In this weather, it was a good race,'' he said.
	   Bryan Bronson of the United States, the fourth athlete seeking
the jackpot, kept alive his hopes of sharing the biggest prize in
athletics, but just barely.
	   Bronson caught up with Stephane Diagana of France at the last
hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles and won in a photo finish, clocking
48.03, one second off his personal best. Diagana, the world
champion, was second in 48.04, while Eric Thomas of the United
States placed third in 48.67.
	   Michael Johnson, the world and Olympic champion, cruised home in
44.62 to win the 400 and lead an American sweep. Johnson's time,
however, was nearly a second off his best for the year.
	   ``I am very proud of this year because I was able to come from
ground zero and still be ranked No. 1 in he world,'' said Johnson,
who battled injuries at the start of the season. This was Johnson's
final event of the season.
	   Jerome Young was second in 45.18, while Tyree Washington
finished third in 45.36.
	   Another Olympic and world champion, Allen Johnson of the United
States, beat world record holder Colin Jackson of Britain in the
110-meter hurdles, winning in 13.12. Jackson was second in 13.20.
	   Johnson, Greene and some other athletes have dropped out of the
Moscow meet, saying they were worried about their safety because of
the economic and political turmoil in Russia.
	   But Primo Nebiolo, the president of the IAAF, said security was
not a problem.
	   ``If Clinton can go to Moscow, I don't see why they have a
problem,'' Nebiolo said.
	   Gabriela Szabo or Romania, the world champion, posted the
fastest time this year in the world in winning the women's 5,000 in
14:31.48. Szabo shaved nearly 10 seconds off her personal best.
	   Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco was second in 14:32.08, while Gete Wami
of Ethiopia was third in 14:36.08. All three were faster than the
previous best for the year, 14:40.19 by Ouaziz.
	   Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland, who won both the 5,000 and 10,000
titles at the European Championship in Budapest last month, had to
settle for fourth place in 14:51.61.
	   Linford Christie of Britain, the former Olympic champion, came
out of the retirement briefly to run in the 4x100 relay, but his
Commonwealth team finished only sixth.
	   The foursome of Greene, Boldon, Drummond and Curtis Perry of the
United States won in 38.15.

Myanmar pro-democracy leader to meet foreign diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Suu Kyi interview; new thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The democratic opposition in Myanmar is
more united than at any time since the country's abortive elections
in 1990, dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Tuesday.
	   In an interview with foreign journalists, she said the decision
of her National League for Democracy to try to unilaterally convene
parliament had the support of students and other democratic forces.
	   Suu Kyi is locked in a battle with the junta which took power in
1988 because it refuses to hand authority to her party, winners of
1990 elections.
	   The league last week announced it would convene parliament on
its own, drawing strong warnings from the government that this
would be illegal and cause the league to be banned and its members
jailed.
	   Speaking at the home of Tin Oo, a deputy leader of her party,
Suu Kyi said Tuesday it was ``quite possible'' the government would
ban her party and put its leaders in jail, but that there was
nothing illegal in its plan.
	   ``This government always believes in violence and the use of
force to resolve problems,'' she said. ``They never think of
resolving problems through negotiations, through reasonable give
and take,'' she said.
	   Noting that five of her party's would-be members of parliament
had been detained in the past two weeks for no obvious violations
of the law, she said the military ``accuse us of confrontation, but
I can't think of anything more confrontational than putting people
in prison simply because they have expressed a different point of
view.''
	   Nevertheless, she said there was strong support_including from
ethnic minorities and students_for the NLD's call to open
parliament.
	   ``I find there's a greater cohesion among all the democratic
forces now than there has been probably since 1990, since the
elections,'' said Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize.
	   The relatively meager turnout at student demonstrations in the
capital did not disappoint her, she said.
	   ``Considering the amount of repression and the amount of
surveillance to which the students are subjected, the fact that
they managed to get these demonstrations going one after the other
showed a certain amount of organization and resolve,'' she said.
	   She accused the junta of being insincere in its expressed
willingness to hold a dialogue and criticized it for mismanaging
the economy, which she described as ``disastrous'' and getting
worse.
	   ``The only way we can achieve economic progress and stability is
through political reform because the political situation is so
wrong we cannot make any progress on the economic side,'' she said.
``The legal and political framework for sustained development does
not exist in Burma. ''
	   Suu Kyi is scheduled to meet Wednesday with foreign diplomats, a
move which may antagonize her country's military rulers.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman described the get-together as a routine
meeting of diplomats with Suu Kyi to discuss relations between her
party, the National League for Democracy, and the government.
	   The meeting was also intended ``to foster dialogue, national
reconciliation and a peaceful transition to democracy,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity by telephone with
The Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   Authorities have occasionally prevented Suu Kyi from attending
meetings with foreign diplomats, but it was unclear what they would
do this time.

Greene wins a fast 100, Jones stays unbeaten in women's dash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to show Szabo also setting European record &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Maurice Greene of the United States overcame cool
conditions and blasted home in the 100-meter sprint at the ISTAF
Golden League track and field meet Tuesday to win in 9.94 seconds,
a meet record.
	   Greene, the world champion, led a 1-2 American finish and paced
three sprinters under 10 seconds. Jon Drummond was second in 9.98,
while Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago was third in 9.99.
	   ``I am happy, 9.94 is a good time with these temperatures,''
Greene said. ``Too cold for the sprint but I know that I can run a
world record if it's warmer.''
	   Marion Jones of the United States won the women's 100 in 10.81,
a meet record. Unbeaten this year, Jones stayed in contention for
at least a share of the dlrs 1 million jackpot to be given to
athletes who win their events in all seven Golden League meets.
	   The series ends Sept. 5 in Moscow, and four athletes still have
a chance of sharing the jackpot.
	   Jones beat Sevatheda Fynes of Bahamas, who clocked 11.07. Irina
Privalova of Russia was third in 11.12.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco also remained in contention for
the jackpot by cruising home in the men's 1,500-meter race.
	   The Moroccan ran unchallenged and clocked a time of three
minutes, 30.23 seconds, more than four seconds outside his world
record.
	   ``I didn't want to risk anything,'' El Guerrouj said. ``The time
is OK, it was too cold to be really relaxed.''
	   ``Now I can see that house I want to build for my parents,'' he
said.
	   El Guerrouj beat Noah Ngeny of Kenya by more than three seconds.
Ngeny clocked 3:33.54, while his countryman Laban Rotich finished
third in 3:33.81.
	   Another athlete with a shot at the lucrative jackpot, Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, stayed alive by winning the 5,000 in a
slow time of 12:56.52. His world record, which he regained this
summer, is 12:39.36.
	   ``In this weather, it was a good race,'' he said.
	   Bryan Bronson of the United States, the fourth athlete seeking
the jackpot, kept alive his hopes of sharing the biggest prize in
athletics, but just barely.
	   Bronson caught up with Stephane Diagana of France at the last
hurdle in the 400-meter hurdles and won in a photo finish, clocking
48.03, one second off his personal best. Diagana, the world
champion, was second in 48.04, while Eric Thomas of the United
States placed third in 48.67.
	   Michael Johnson, the world and Olympic champion, cruised home in
44.62 to win the 400 and lead an American sweep. Johnson's time,
however, was nearly a second off his best for the year.
	   ``I am very proud of this year because I was able to come from
ground zero and still be ranked No. 1 in he world,'' said Johnson,
who battled injuries at the start of the season. This was Johnson's
final event of the season.
	   Jerome Young was second in 45.18, while Tyree Washington
finished third in 45.36.
	   Another Olympic and world champion, Allen Johnson of the United
States, beat world record holder Colin Jackson of Britain in the
110-meter hurdles, winning in 13.12. Jackson was second in 13.20.
	   Johnson, Greene and some other athletes have dropped out of the
Moscow meet, saying they were worried about their safety because of
the economic and political turmoil in Russia.
	   But Primo Nebiolo, the president of the IAAF, said security was
not a problem.
	   ``If Clinton can go to Moscow, I don't see why they have a
problem,'' Nebiolo said.
	   Gabriela Szabo or Romania, the world champion, posted the
fastest time this year in the world in winning the women's 5,000 in
14:31.48. Szabo shaved nearly 10 seconds off her personal best and
set a European record. The old record of 14:36.45 was set by
Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal in 1995.

Graf survives to lead rush into second round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Novotna, Pierce victories; ADDS other scores &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf rode her new-found confidence and
her forehand Tuesday to overcome an upset bid by American Corina
Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 and advance to the second round of the U.S.
Open.
	   Also advancing on the tournament's second day were Wimbledon
champion Jana Novotna, a 6-4, 6-3 winner over Jennifer Capriati,
and No. 12 Mary Pierce, who ousted Germany's Meike Babel 6-1, 4-6,
6-2.
	   The first men's seed to win Tuesday was No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman,
who beat Cedric Pioline of France 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2. In
another match, Mark Philippoussis of Australia defeated Norway's
Christian Ruud 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.
	   Graf's victory was her first at the National Tennis Center since
1996, but ran her consecutive match winning streak to 15. After
winning the year's final Grand Slam tournament in both 1995 and
'96, she missed last year's tournament after undergoing knee
surgery.
	   ``It's been two years. I don't look back on what happened
before,'' Graf said. ``I look at now as a new start.''
	   The forehand that once ruled women's tennis made only occasional
appearances against Morariu. But it was there every time Graf
really needed it. It was only in the second set, when she made 15
of her 28 unforced errors on the day, that the eighth-seeded German
appeared to be in danger of matching her 1992 U.S. Open result, the
only time she has failed to make it out of the opening round.
	   Graf, making her debut in Arthur Ashe Stadium, grabbed a 3-0
lead in the opening set. She held her last two service games in the
set at love and appeared to be on her way to a straight-set
victory.
	   Morariu had other ideas.
	   Hitting as hard and as deep as her opponent, Morariu broke the
suddenly error-prone Graf at love in the sixth game and eventually
pulled even at one set apiece.
	   Graf showed why she dominated for so long. She tightened her
game and simply overpowered Morariu to set up a second-round
matchup against fellow German Marlene Weingartner.
	   Capriati, once considered a shoo-in to eventually win a Grand
Slam title before personal problems interrupted her career, broke
Novotna to take a 4-3 lead in the opening set. Novotna tightened up
her net game and ripped off the next eight games to lead 6-4, 5-0
before Capriati made a mini-comeback by winning three consecutive
games.
	   Novotna, known for squandering big leads, is riding a burst of
confidence since winning Wimbledon. She pulled her game together,
kept up the pressure and advanced to the second round when Capriati
buried a backhand in the bottom of the net.
	   Andre Agassi, who hopes to cap his rise from the ranks of the
satellite tour with his second U.S. Open men's title, found the
Ashe Stadium court to his liking as he overpowered young Frenchman
Sebastien Grosjean 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 on Monday night.
	   ``The court is definitely quicker, no question bout it,'' he
said after capping the first day of the year's final Grand Slam
tournament. ``Forty-two percent quicker than last year.''
	   Also advancing into the second round Monday were the two No. 1
seeds, Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis.
	   No. 9 Karol Kucera and No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic won in men's
singles and No. 6 Monica Seles, No. 9 Irina Spirlea, No. 11 Patty
Schnyder, No. 14 Dominique Van Roost and No. 16 Ai Sugiyama were
winners in the women's field.
	   The only seeded player to be ousted on the first day was No. 15
Alberto Berasategui of Spain, who fell to Thomas Muster of Austria
7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-3.
	   On Tuesday night, defending men's champion Patrick Rafter met
Hicham Arazi of Morocco after fifth-seeded Venus Williams, the
surprising women's finalist a year ago, faced Germany's Elena
Wagner.
	   In 1997, Agassi's ranking bottomed out at 141, even after he
surprisingly reached the fourth round at the National Tennis
Center. He began the climb back to respectability in Challenger and
satellite tournaments _ the minor leagues of tennis.
	   Even after suffering early round losses at the French Open and
Wimbledon, Agassi pulled his game back together on his favorite
surface, hardcourts. And the hardcourts at the U.S. Open are
perfect for a number of top players, to hear Agassi talk about it.
	   Grosjean, the world junior champion in both singles and doubles
two years ago, has a game that's quite a bit like Agassi's: big
groundstrokes, seemingly impossible angles, always aggressive.
	   It took Agassi eight games to get rolling. After that, the
outcome was never in doubt.

Tyson's boxing future grows more clouded after traffic altercation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson picked the wrong time to get into a
fight.
	   Tyson's boxing future became even more clouded Tuesday after
police in a Washington, D.C., suburb said he punched one man in the
chest and kicked another in the groin after a minor traffic
accident a day earlier.
	   The incident came less than three weeks before Nevada boxing
authorities meet to decide whether Tyson has learned to behave
himself enough to be licensed again to resume his career as a
heavyweight fighter.
	   ``This complicates matters,'' a source close to the Nevada
commission said.
	   There were no serious injuries in Monday's altercation _ though
Tyson later complained of chest pains and was treated at a hospital
emergency room _ and no arrests were made. Police classified it as
a ``misdemeanor assault'' and said it would be up to the other
drivers if they wanted to seek charges.
	   Members of the Nevada Athletic Commission said they will want an
explanation when Tyson appears before them Sept. 19 seeking a
license to replace the one revoked when he bit Evander Holyfield's
ears during their June 28, 1997, heavyweight title fight.
	   ``I would suspect it will be discussed,'' commission member Dr.
James Nave said. ``It's certainly an area where the commission will
want to look at.''
	   Nave and other commissioners were notified of the altercation
Monday night by Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission.
	   ``I really don't know what to say anymore,'' Ratner said. ``I'm
just trying to get as many facts together for the commission as I
can.''
	   Tyson's adviser, Shelly Finkel, said he was also waiting for
details on the incident. Finkel said that when all the facts are
in, Tyson could be cleared.
	   ``It's never good if it is correct, but I've been told it's not
correct and I'm waiting to see,'' Finkel said.
	   While the incident may threaten Tyson's chances to get back his
boxing license, it was not clear whether it would have an effect on
the probation he is still serving following his release from prison
in 1995 for a rape conviction.
	   Officials in Marion County, Indiana were not immediately
available for comment. Tyson is on probation through mid-1999.
	   Police in Gaithersburg, Maryland said the car in which Tyson was
riding, driven by his wife, Monica, was struck Monday afternoon in
a three-car, chain-reaction accident in the suburb northwest of
Washington. Earlier, police had said Tyson's wife had struck the
rear of another car.
	   After the car accident, the drivers of the other two cars were
talking when Tyson walked up and began arguing with them, said
Montgomery County police spokesman Derek Baliles.
	   Witnesses told police that the former heavyweight champion
punched one of the drivers in the chest and kicked the other in the
groin.
	   The witnesses said Tyson's bodyguards restrained him, according
to Baliles. The bodyguards were in a car traveling behind the
others in heavy traffic.
	   It is up to the other drivers to decide whether to make a
complaint to police, and it was unclear if either wanted to,
Baliles said. They have up to a year to do so.
	   ``In the state of Maryland, if a misdemeanor occurs and it's not
in the presence of a police officer, we can't place charges or
place anyone under arrest,'' Baliles said.
	   Because passers-by called police, officers stopped Tyson after
he and his wife drove off after the accident.
	   ``Because of the reports of a fight, we wanted to be sure
everyone was OK,'' Baliles said. ``While we were speaking to Mr.
Tyson, he requested an ambulance, complaining of chest pains.''
	   Tyson changed his mind about the ambulance but showed up at a
hospital emergency room later complaining of chest pains. He was
treated and released.
	   Tyson was suspended by the commission in July 1997 for biting
Holyfield's ears. His license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3
million.
	   He was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada on July 9,
but bypassed the state and went through the licensing process in
New Jersey. On the eve of that licensing decision, he abruptly
withdrew the application in New Jersey and said he would seek
licensing in Nevada.
	   During his licensing hearing in New Jersey, Tyson became angry
under questioning and cursed.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Yeltsin pledging not to abandon fere market

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a message of support but offering no
financial help, President Bill Clinton urged Russians Tuesday to
``reject the failed policies of the past'' in coping with their
current economic crisis.
	   ``Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions,'' Clinton told a new
generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State University of
International Relations.
	   Clinton met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the first
session of a two-day summit unlikely to deliver sweeping agreements
from the politically wounded presidents.
	   Yeltsin, despite pressure from the Communist-dominated
parliament, pledged not to abandon the free-market course on which
Russia embarked seven years ago.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks. ``Soon there were disappointments,
too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost the conviction in
the necessity of the transformations we're carrying out.''

Panamanian accepts referendum loss, vows to help canal handover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Shrugging off a personal setback, President
Ernesto Perez Balladares said Tuesday that a national vote against
re-election proved the strength of democracy as the country nears
final takeover of the Panama Canal.
	   The national referendum on Sunday destroyed Perez Balladares'
hopes of overseeing the U.S. handover of the canal on Dec. 31,
1999, and some analysts said it transformed him into a lame duck as
he enters the final year of his presidency.
	   But in delivering his annual state of the nation speech Tuesday,
the president showed no bitterness and he promised to avoid
``political sectarianism'' in helping his successor prepare for the
handover:
	   ``Our nation will be prepared to assume full control of the
canal and its adjacent areas; and overall, it will have a country
reconciled in peace and ready to enter the next millennium without
the presence of foreign military bases and with a modern and
prosperous economy.''
	   Panamanians voted by about 2-1 on Sunday against a
constitutional amendment that would have allowed consecutive
presidential terms.
	   ``The voice of the people ... is the supreme authority of a
nation,'' said the president, who said that democracy was key to
hopes strengthening national unity and reducing the chasm between
rich and poor.
	   Opponents had accused Perez Balladares of trying to hold onto
power to put his allies in the best position to profit from the
handover of the canal and U.S. military land, which will occur four
months after his term ends.
	   The president is due to host the Group of Rio summit, which
opens Thursday with presidents and foreign ministers from 14 Latin
American nations.
	   Perez Balladares' ruling party, meanwhile, is working on
selecting a candidate to succeed him. The resignations Monday of
Foreign Minister Ricardo Alberto Arias and Labor Minister Mitchell
Doens were widely believed linked to the upcoming campaign.
	   Doens said he wanted to devote himself to organization work in
the party. Arias did not specify his reason for leaving, but his
departure had been expected and there is speculation he plans to
seek the nomination.
	   Perez Balladares nominated Jorge Eduardo Ritter, minister for
canal affairs, to replace Arias.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After meeting Tuesday with a
special U.S. envoy, President Slobodan Milosevic proposed a
``degree of self-rule'' for Kosovo province which appeared to fall
short of demands by major powers and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Meanwhile, Albanian and Serb sources reported new fighting
Tuesday in the Serbian province, where the Kosovo Liberation Army
is battling for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said at least four
Albanians, including a woman, were killed.
	   In Belgrade, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Tuesday
with Milosevic as part of the American effort to end to six months
fighting which has killed hundreds and driven some 265,000 people
from their houses.
	   Afterward, the government's Tanjug news agency said a dialogue
between Serbs and Albanians should begin as soon as possible ``so
that an agreement can be reached providing for an appropriate
degree on self-rule which would include equality for all living in
Kosovo.''
	   The statement said that after an interim period of three to five
years, the two sides could meet again to ``analyze the functioning
of the agreement'' and ``improve it on issues they mutually agree
upon.''
	   That would fall short of the Albanian demand for complete
independence. It also appeared to be less than the guarantee of
``substantial autonomy'' demanded by the U.N. Security Council in a
resolution approved unanimously March 31.
	   Hill's spokesman, Philip Reeker, the statement was positive and
generally reflected discussions. But he told The Associated Press
that the comments on self rule were ``very nebulous'' and meant
different things to Serbs and Albanians.
	   ``It's just another indication that there are negotiations, and
that they are saying they want to see some progress,'' he said.
Hill has been shuttling between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian
officials.
	   Washington and the Europeans oppose full independence, fearing
it would lead the a redrawing of borders in neighboring countries
with large Albanian populations. As a minimum, they want Milosevic
to restore the autonomy to Kosovo which he revoked in 1989.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the Albanian center said three
Albanian men and one woman were killed and seven people wounded
when Serb police shelled the village Rusinovce, 15 kilometers (9
miles) to the south.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attack was launched after Albanian militants ambushed a Serb police
patrol earlier in the day.

Graf, Capriati on different comeback trails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two tennis comebacks following vastly different
paths passed each other Tuesday in the U.S. Open, one celebrated by
the crowd in defeat, the other greeted matter-of-factly in victory.
	   Jennifer Capriati lost to Jana Novotna 6-4, 6-3 and came away
from the match feeling like a winner. Steffi Graf defeated Corina
Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, pleased that she could use some newfound
resolve to sidestep trouble.
	   Capriati fought hard against Novotna, nearly taking control of
the first set on a couple of occasions, then winning three straight
games to delay defeat in the second. When she was done, the sellout
crowd at what once was center court of the National Tennis Center
gave her a standing ovation.
	   Graf won her first set comfortably, then had to bounce back
after dropping the second. There was a time, she said, when she
wasn't certain she'd be able to do that.
	   Capriati displayed the same resolve, even though it came up
short. The fans certainly appreciated it, cheering for her at the
end.
	   ``It felt like I won,'' she said. ``I didn't expect the whole
crowd to be so into it. I was a little surprised. It made me feel
real good. It just makes me feel really good that they are still
like that.''
	   Capriati was here on a wild card, a courtesy call from the USTA
for the past successes of a player who's still just 22 years old
and trying to scramble her way back into mainstream tennis.
	   She appreciated the fan support.
	   ``It makes me feel good,'' she said. ``Sometimes, it is a little
sad in a way but mostly it is good.''
	   The sadness comes from the troubles Capriati created for
herself, personal problems that took her off the pro tour for over
two years at a time when she should have been at the top of her
game. She said she has put the bad times behind her and feels like
she still has plenty of good tennis left.
	   ``I think I'm playing a lot better,'' she said. ``If I can just
keep it up, hopefully soon I can have some good results. I have no
timetable. I am just going to keep going the way I have been
because I think I have just improved a lot and I think I can only
get better from here.
	   ``I think it just has to come with confidence more than
anything.''
	   Graf's confidence was shaken by a knee injury that forced her to
miss much of last season, including the U.S. Open, an event she has
won five times.
	   She has worked her way back slowly, sending a signal with a
victory in a warmup tournament a week ago in which she beat Novotna
and Lindsay Davenport, the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the world.
	   Graf said that victory pumped her up for the Open.
	   ``I definitely feel it has changed my attitude,'' she said. ``In
the second set, I obviously didn't play very well. I just sat down
after that second set and told myself, `Well, you know this is not
the way to continue. You know you have done so well the last few
weeks and you worked so hard. Just have a better attitude.'
	   ``It really changed. From then on, I just played better again. I
cut down on the mistakes. I think just sitting there and looking
back ... that helped.''
	   Graf said the more she plays, the better she feels about her
comeback.
	   ``Lately, I have been able to step into matches with a much
better attitude,'' she said. ``A couple of weeks ago, I didn't have
that because I felt I hadn't played enough and I didn't feel so
confident about the way my game was heading. But I am slowly
getting more used to playing better. I am getting stronger and
stronger and that obviously gives me a positive attitude.''
	   Capriati understands the importance of that.
	   ``I just try to think positive on everything,'' she said.
``Actually, it is more like, I know it is going to get better.''

Clinton says U.S. economy is sound, despite stock slide

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hoping to reassure investors at home and abroad,
President Bill Clinton said Tuesday the U.S. economy is on solid
footing despite the stock market's stunning recent losses.
	   ``I want to reiterate the point I think is important for Russia,
for America, for every country: We believe our fundamental economic
policy is sound,'' Clinton said during a speech at Moscow State
University.
	   After Monday's 500-point plunge, the Dow Jones industrial
average regained 288 points in roller-coaster trading Tuesday.
	   Clinton said it should be no surprise that markets are jittery
at a time when Russia, Japan and other major industrial nations are
suffering economic and financial woes.
	   ``When there are problems in Russia or in Japan or questions
about the economy of China,'' there are reactions across the world,
Clinton said. ``You see, the last two days, we've had big drops in
the American stock market.''
	   Throughout the day Clinton kept close watch on stock trading. At
a Kremlin dinner Tuesday night, he and Yeltsin were chatting in a
receiving line with Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White
House's National Economic Council. As Sperling moved away, Clinton
informed him, ``The market's up,'' and gave a thumbs-up sign.
	   Weaving his reassurances about the U.S. economy into a broader
theme of global interdependence, Clinton said market gyrations are
not unexpected in an era of faster communications, shrinking trade
barriers and increasing multinational commerce.
	   ``Now in terms of what has happened in America, obviously it's
always more enjoyable when our stock market goes up than when it
goes down,'' the president said. Even so, there is no reason to
worry, he asserted.
	   ``We believe our people are working at record rates, and we are
determined to stay on a path of fiscal discipline that brought us
to where we are.''
	   In remarks later to reporters, Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said the Clinton administration is confident it
should stick to its current economic strategy, based in part on
promoting more exports of U.S. goods.
	   ``With that strategy in place, I don't see any reason why these
market developments should interfere with the basic momentum of
economic expansion, although they will have -- obviously, they'll
have effects on certain sectors of the economy,'' Summers said.
	   The deputy treasury secretary said the slide in U.S. stocks was
due in large measure to economic problems in Russia and other
nations. That shows, he said, why it is important for Congress to
approve a renewal of financing for the International Monetary Fund,
which is in the process of providing billions of dollars to Russia.
	   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin renewed his
campaign for congressional passage of dlrs 18 billion in additional
U.S. support to replenish IMF coffers. The money has been approved
by the Senate but has been blocked by a coalition of House
opponents.
	   ``Events over the last eight months _ not to mention the last
few days and weeks _ underscore the impact on the U.S. economy of
developments abroad, including in Asia and Russia,'' Rubin said in
a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
	   ``We simply cannot afford any further delay in providing the IMF
with the resources it requires to help contain the threat of
further financial and political instability around the world.''

Wellington to bid for 2006 Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The New Zealand government
announced Wednesday it would support the city of Wellington's bid
to host the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
	   Sports Minister Murray McCully said the government recognized
the national, economic and social benefits of the event and would
lend financial support for the bid to boost the contribution the
region's local authorities and private sector would make.
	   ``We're satisfied that the Wellington 2006 bid for the
Commonwealth Games can win, and we are willing to put our full
support behind it,'' he said.
	   A delegation led by Commonwealth Games Society chairwoman Kerry
Prendergast will travel to the Kuala Lumpur games this week to
lobby for the Wellington bid.
	   Melbourne, Australia is the only other contender for the 2006
Games. (djp)

Trainer T.J. Smith suffers stroke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian thoroughbred racehorse
trainer T.J. Smith was resting comfortably but critically ill in
hospital Wednesday after suffering a stroke, his family said.
	   ``He's resting comfortably and going as well as can be
expected,'' his wife Val said. Officials at St. Vincents Private
Hospital said his condition was critical.
	   Newspaper reports said the stroke had paralyzed Smith's right
side and that he had been given the last rites in hospital.
	   Smith's daughter Gai Waterhouse, herself a leading thoroughbred
trainer, flew from Cairns in north Queensland state to be at her
father's bedside. It is her 46th birthday Wednesday.
	   Smith dominated Sydney racing for four decades, winning a
world-record 33 consecutive trainers' premierships between 1952 and
1985.
	   He has trained more than 4,000 winners, and won virtually all of
Australia's greatest races, including nine AJC (Australian Jockey
Club) Derbies, a further 26 Derbies in other states, six Golden
Slippers, two Melbourne Cups and seven Cox Plates.
	   He is perhaps best known for training leading gallopers Tulloch,
Kingston Town and Gunsynd.
	   Smith, who turns 80 Thursday, was rushed to hospital Tuesday
morning. Mrs. Smith said her husband collapsed at the family's
Point Piper home in Sydney. (djp)

Mentally tougher Rusedski overcomes flub to win match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Greg Rusedski stood at the net, preparing for
the overhead that promised to give him match point. The court was
wide open, with opponent Wayne Ferreira way out of position after
running down a lob.
	   Rusedski slammed the ball right into the net, prolonging a U.S.
Open match Tuesday that had already passed the three-hour mark.
	   Instead of dwelling on the blown opportunity, the sixth-seeded
Rusedski calmly wrapped up the match four points later. The 4-6,
7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 victory moved him into a
second-round match against Bohdan Ulihrach.
	   ``I think it's just being mentally stronger and being
experienced,'' said Rusedski, the Canadian-turned-Briton who saved
two match points in the fourth set. ``I should have never missed
that overhead, but I guess I made all the club players in the world
feel good.''
	   Reaching the final of the U.S. Open last year as an unseeded
player has had a lot to do with that confidence. Before last year's
tournament, Rusedski had lost in the first round of the U.S. Open
in all three of his appearances.
	   Rusedski looked as though he was about to make another quick
exit Tuesday, but regained control with his big serve in the final
two sets. He finished the match with 19 aces, while Ferreira had
13.
	   ``I wasn't really pleased the way I started, but I was pleased
the way I fought today and stayed in the match,'' said Rusedski,
who had a blister popped during the match and has been fighting a
left ankle problem all summer.
	   Rusedski lost in the first round at Wimbledon and didn't play
again until mid-August at Indianapolis while the ankle healed. He
said it was not a problem Tuesday, and he removed tape from the
ankle midway through the match.
	   In fact, Rusedski showed his fitness by hurdling the net while
going for a volley during the match. The point was awarded to
Ferreira because a player is not allowed to cross the net while the
ball remains in play, but it showed the ankle's strength.
	   ``I got rid of the bandage,'' Rusedski said. ``It was hindering
my movement a little bit, so I just sliced it off and played
without anything on today.''
	   Ferreira, who also has been bothered by severe ankle injuries
the last two years, said Rusedski's game has not changed that much
_ though he's developed a different attitude since becoming the
first British man in 61 years to reach the U.S. Open final.
	   ``I'm sure he is more confident now than he has been winning a
lot more matches,'' Ferreira said. ``Geez, if I had that serve, I'd
also go far. I mean, if you don't do well with a serve like that,
then there is something wrong.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose Tuesday after two sessions of
punishing sell-offs, but the Dow Jones industrials had recovered
less than a third of the its 1,000-point loss over the previous
four trading days. The Dow industrial average rose 288.36 _ or 3.8
percent _ at 7,827.43, the second-biggest point gain in history.
Broad indexes were also higher, as many of the big losers of Monday
came roaring back, including technology and consumer stocks. Volume
was very high, with about 1 billion shares changing hands on the
New York Stock Exchange. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stock markets in Asia and Europe gave more
ground Tuesday in the aftermath of Monday's slide on Wall Street.
But Japan's stock market closed sharply higher and European markets
cut their losses by the afternoon. In London, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 80.3 points, or
1.5 percent, at 5169.1. In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra DAX
index finished with a gain of 0.9 percent, rising 44.62 points to
4,855.90 after shaking off early losses of about 3.3 percent. In
Paris, the CAC 40 closed with little change, down 5.56 points, or
0.15 percent at 3,651.85. The CAC 40 overcame early losses of about
3.7 percent. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The manufacturing sector slowed in August for
the third month in a row, although a key gauge of future economic
activity rose 0.4 percent in July. The National Association of
Purchasing Management reported Tuesday its widely monitored index
of business activity stood at 49.4 percent in August, a slight
increase from the previous month but still a sign of a slower
manufacturing economy. A reading below 50 is a sign of a
contraction in the economy's important industrial sector. The
overall economy, meanwhile, grew for the 88th straight month,
according to the NAPM survey. In a separate report, the Conference
Board, a private research group, reported its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators advanced to 105.4 in July, well ahead of
economists' expectations. (US-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As gloomy financial news piled up
around the world, Europe's central bankers met Tuesday to discuss
their continent's planned monetary union. Belgian central bank
chief Alfons Verplaetse told reporters after the meeting that
financial turbulence in Russia would have no impact on the European
Central Bank's monetary policy being drawn up for the launch of the
single currency in four months. Verplaetse spoke after a regular
meeting of the inner circle of the European Central Bank, which
will run the unified monetary policy for the 11 European countries
adopting the single currency, or euro, on Jan. 1. (GERMANY-EUROPEAN
BANK)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amid economic turmoil sweeping Russia, security
agents on Tuesday detained the country's acting first deputy
finance minister on suspicion of corruption. Vladimir Petrov, who
was involved in the government's negotiations on a massive
International Monetary Fund bailout package, is suspected of taking
bribes ``on a grand scale'' and of using his position to benefit a
commercial bank, the state prosecutor's office said. Russian
television said Federal Security Service agents and the chief
prosecutor's office had been investigating the case for some time.
Petrov's detention is expected to further undermine the credibility
of the interim government, which has done little to stop the
economic chaos. The crisis has been deepened by uncertainty about
the government's future after parliament on Monday refused to
confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Economic growth in Latin America will
slow down in 1998 as a result of the financial turmoil in Asia and
damage caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, a United Nations
agency said Tuesday. The Santiago-based Economic Commission for
Latin America, or ECLA, predicted that the region will post an
average economic growth of 3 percent this year, down from 5.3
percent in 1997. Last year's good performance was coupled with the
lowest regional average inflation rate in five decades _ 10.4
percent _ and booming exports, ECLA said in its ``Economic report
on Latin America and the Caribbean, 1997-1998.'' (LATIN ECONOMIES)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a message of support but offering no
financial help, President Bill Clinton urged Russians Tuesday to
``reject the failed policies of the past'' in coping with their
current economic crisis. ``Given the facts before you, I have to
tell you that I do not believe there are any painless solutions,''
Clinton told a new generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State
University of International Relations. Clinton met earlier with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the first session of a two-day
summit unlikely to deliver sweeping agreements from the politically
wounded presidents. Despite the poor outlook, Yeltsin declared just
before meeting with Clinton that ``Russian-American relations are
developing successfully.'' (RUSSIA-SUMMIT)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin and the Communist-led parliament
refused to budge Tuesday in their standoff over who should lead
Russia's government during its time of turmoil, edging the nation
closer to possible early elections. Yeltsin reassured U.S.
President Clinton, who arrived for a summit with Russia paralyzed
by the worst financial crisis since the Soviet era, that he won't
abandon democratic reforms. ``The country will continue building a
market economy and a democratic society,'' the Kremlin quoted the
Russian president as saying. Yeltsin also insisted he wouldn't give
up Viktor Chernomyrdin as his choice for prime minister, despite
the risk of months' more uncertainty if that strategy fails.
Russians are anxious about the growing crisis, but there have been
few signs of panic on the streets. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British and Irish
governments unveiled their joint crackdown plans Tuesday against
IRA dissidents, which they expect to be approved by emergency
parliamentary sessions this week. Also, in a carefully worded
statement tied to Thursday's visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton
to Belfast, Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams proclaimed that
``the violence we have seen must be for all of us now a thing of
the past, over, done with and gone.'' The statement represented a
significant rhetorical shift for his IRA-allied party and received
warm welcomes from the British and Irish prime ministers, Tony
Blair and Bertie Ahern. But it fell short of demands from
Protestant politicians for the Irish Republican Army to declare
specifically that its ``war'' to destabilize Northern Ireland was
over _ and for the outlawed group to prove it by starting to
disarm, a goal contained in April's peace agreement. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Chinese fled a
northern Indonesian town Tuesday after stone-throwing mobs attacked
their shops and homes in a second day of rioting. Riot officers
shot and killed two people, residents said. Looters rampaged
through the business district of Lhokseumawe, grabbing anything
they could: sacks of rice and bottles of soybean ketchup, boxes of
noodles, fans and electrical wiring. Many shops were empty,
abandoned by their owners. The rioters, some of them shouting
separatist slogans, roamed the streets after nightfall. In some
areas, soldiers mingled with the looters, apparently willing to let
the mobs vent their anger. Ninety fugitives, meanwhile, were on the
run after crowds stormed a prison Monday in Lhokseumawe in the
biggest riots since deadly unrest in May helped oust former
President Suharto. Mobs burned buildings and stoned military
trucks. (INDONESIA-RIOTS)
	   ITAUNJA, India (AP) _ Cobras and vipers slithered across deep
floodwaters Tuesday as raging rivers smothered new areas across the
stark countryside of northern India. Officials said the death toll
climbed to 1,118. Nearly 10 million people in 23,300 villages in
Uttar Pradesh _ India's most populous state with 150 million people
_ were displaced or lost their livelihood in the past three weeks,
said Ashok Kumar, the state relief commissioner. The dead included
120 people who died of waterborne diseases. Relief volunteers said
the number was expected to go up once the floodwaters started
receding. Next, they said, malnutrition will follow. Villagers
stranded in relief camps have little or no access to drinking water
and often used the same muddy water for bathing and washing
clothes. (INDIA-FLOODS)

Xingu Indians pay highest homage to pioneering Indian defenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY314-317, Graphic ALTO XINGU BRAZIL &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALTO XINGU, Brazil (AP) _ It was a bittersweet moment for
Orlando Villas Boas when he stepped off the small, propeller plane
and onto the reservation where he lived among the Xingu Indians for
three decades.
	   Indians, naked except for belts of brightly colored cotton and
red body paint, rushed to greet him at the landing strip on the
edge of the village _ a ring of grass-thatched longhouses around a
sandy circle carved out of the jungle.
	   Villas Boas hadn't been back in 14 years and there was a lot of
hugging and catching up to do. But it was a sad occasion.
	   The 84-year-old Indian rights activist was back, possibly for
the last time, to attend a ``Kuarup'' _ the highest tribute the
Xingu Indians pay the dead.
	   ``I couldn't miss this homage to my brothers. Claudio and Alvaro
were younger than me _ they shouldn't have died before I did,''
Villas-Boas said, his faced smeared red from hugging so many
painted Indians.
	   Orlando and Claudio Villas-Boas, the most famous of four
Brazilian brothers who fought for Indian rights, first traveled to
this region in 1943 as part of an expedition to seek out
uncontacted Amazon tribes.
	   During that trip, the brothers witnessed the damage that roads
and airstrips were causing the Indians and they became outspoken
advocates of protecting the tribes from contact with whites.
Orlando and Claudio eventually moved in with Indians, staying for
32 years.
	   More than a thousand Indians from nine tribes attended the
recent two-day Kuarup, the biggest festival still celebrated by
indigenous peoples in Brazil.
	   It was only the second time white men had been honored with a
Kuarup. The first was when Orlando's brother Leonardo died in 1961.
	   At this Kuarup, Claudio, who died in March of heart failure, and
Alvaro, who briefly ran the Federal Indian Bureau and who died in
1996, were honored alongside the Xingu warrior Marika, who died
last year.
	   ``The Kuarup is reserved for chiefs and warriors; this is what
we consider Claudio,'' said Aritana, the chief of a neighboring
village and a friend of the Villas Boas for 40 years.
	   In 1961, the brothers persuaded the government to create its
first, and probably most successful, reservation _ Xingu National
Park.
	   Seventeen Indian nations were transferred from ancestral lands
to the 2.3 million-hectare (5.6 million-acre) park in northern Mato
Grosso state, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
	   Today, more than 3,000 Indians live in relative isolation from
the influences of white culture.
	   But more than any governmental action, the park's success stems
from the brutal methods the Indians sometimes resorted to keep
outsiders away.
	   ``We tried to limit indiscriminate contact as much as possible.
We taught them if they wanted to survive, if they wanted their
children to survive, not to let anyone in,'' Orlando said. ``We
told them if anyone came, to fight them.''
	   On at least one occasion, that advice led the Indians to kill 11
loggers who refused to leave, he said. ``No one even thought of
coming here after that.''
	   For the Kuarup, three tree trunks decorated with paint and
feathers representing the dead were placed in the middle of the
village.
	   Women gathered at the foot of the trunks, chanting a plaintive
lament while Orlando reminisced with the warriors and chiefs.
	   ``Claudio told us the white man's things were no good,''
recalled Tacuman, the village's chief. ``He wouldn't let us wear
sandals. He told us about the civilization of the whites and I
perceived what was good and what wasn't.''
	   Throughout the night, a shaman stoked fires burning by each of
the trunks.
	   Sporadically, dozens of Indians, hooting like macaws, filed out
of the longhouses and into the central area, then grabbed sticks
from the fires and ran off.
	   Unfazed, the shaman rebuilt the fires over and over again.
	   In the morning there was a ``huka-huka'' _ a wrestling
competition between the young warriors.
	   To close the festival, a pair of men ran in tandem, with a young
virgin trailing behind, visiting each longhouse, blowing ``urua'' _
2-meter-long (6-foot-long) wooden flutes _ to welcome the good
spirits.
	   The tree trunks were taken to the river set afloat, sending
their spirits to heaven.
	   ``We don't want to become like civilized whites, we want to be
beautiful, decorated and all dancing,'' said Aywupu, a Kamayura
warrior watching the logs float away.

	   BUBONIDZE, Russia (AP) _ Bear hunting season in Russia opened
Aug. 1, and it might seem an inauspicious time to release two
motherless bear cubs into the wild.
	   But father-and-son gamekeepers Valentin and Sergei Pazhetnov are
former hunters, and they specialize in training bear orphans to
survive all the dangers of Russia's deep forests, especially
predators on two legs.
	   The sister cubs, Prima and Dina, were found by a game warden in
April. Apparently, a woman had disturbed their den, provoking an
attack by the mother bear which then ran off and abandoned the
3-month-old cubs.
	   For four months, they have lived at the bear orphanage that the
Pazhetnov family runs as part of an animal sanctuary in Bubonidze,
a remote settlement 450 kilometers (280 miles) west of Moscow.
	   With the help of international donations, the Pazhetnovs have
raised and released 64 bear orphans in the last eight years. The
facility is the only one of its type in Russia.
	   What sets it apart is that the regimen is not warm and friendly.
Here, the bears are taught with ``tough love,'' and contact with
humans is kept to a minimum. Any gesture of friendliness by the
bears is met with a swift slap on a tender nose.
	   The reason? Bear cubs raised by humans often become too
trusting, even running up to hunters as if to make friends. So
Valentin, who studied animal behavior at Moscow State University,
has developed a program to care for young bears without letting
them get too attached.
	   ``What they're doing is making sure these bears retain their
biological fear of humans,'' says Simon Pope of the Britain-based
International Fund for Animal Welfare, which helps finance the
orphanage.
	   However, affection flows freely in the other direction.
	   ``It's exactly the same emotion as if our children had left
home,'' says Sergei. ``We looked after them for so long and now
we've released them. But I'm sure they'll survive.''
	   Bears are plentiful in Russia, and hunting is considered part of
the national heritage.
	   Soviet leaders like Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev showed
off their prowess with a hunting rifle in front of visiting
dignitaries. And there were only a few voices of protest last year
when then Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin killed a bear and her
cubs on a hunting trip.
	   Ironically, most cubs are brought to the orphanage by hunters
who have killed a mother bear. Female bears tend to stay in their
lairs in January when nursing their cubs, making them sitting
targets.
	   Cubs younger than 3 months have little sight, hearing or sense
of smell, and they can live inside the wooden cottage with Valentin
and his wife, Svetlana.
	   But once their senses are active, they are moved to an enclosure
deep in an animal sanctuary where they can learn to climb trees,
dig dens and scavenge for food.
	   The Pazhetnovs provide food and veterinary care, but limit
contact as much as possible, touching the bears only with gloves
and rebuffing any overtures of friendship.
	   After four months, Valentin decided the cubs Prima and Dina were
ready to return to the woods. Even though bear season is open, most
hunters wait until winter when it's easier to find bears in their
dens. So the cubs will have a few months to get used to being on
their own, dig a den and settle in for winter.
	   The cubs, sedated for the car trip, are tagged on the ear and
then awakened when they reach an area near their former den. As
they amble off, they pause for a moment, their heads poking above
the tall grass, and look back toward the humans.
	   But just briefly. Within moments, their brown coats fade into
the darkness among the trees.

Spanish language guardians turn to computers to spread the
</HEADLINE>
language &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The guardians of Spanish are turning to
computers and the Internet to propel the language into the 21st
century as one of the world's most widely spoken tongues.
	   Spain's 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy is
converting index cards crammed with material dating back centuries
into a 250 million-word computerized reference site on the
Internet.
	   English already has a 100 million-word British National Corpus,
a data base that academics consider the standard reference for the
British branch of the most important language in international
discourse. French and German have more modest data banks.
	   ``It's imperative that we do not fall behind in the trend of
computerization and the Internet,'' says Fernando Lazaro Carreter,
the Royal Academy's director. ``The (Spanish) language and its
unity depend on it.''
	   The academy has the backing of the Cervantes Institute, which
promotes the language outside the more than 20 Spanish-speaking
nations.
	   ``The times can be compared to the 16th century with the advent
of the printing press,'' says Santiago de Mora-Figueroa, director
of the Cervantes Institute. ``We are witnessing a revolution in
communications and we must make the most of it.''
	   Ten centuries after people first began using it, Spanish is
spoken by an estimated 350 million people around the world.
English, the world's lingua franca, has some 500 million speakers.
	   Chinese has the most speakers, but few use it outside China.
French, once the language of diplomacy and social elites around the
globe, is dwindling in importance and has some 100 million
speakers.
	   ``Spanish is growing not just in the numbers of speakers but
also the economic weight of the countries that use it,'' de
Mora-Figueroa says.
	   The aggressive promotion of Spanish coincides with Spain's
expanding involvement abroad, both economically and culturally,
since the ending in 1978 of the straitjacket isolation imposed by
decades of dictatorship.
	   The Cervantes Institute, founded in 1991 and named after Miguel
de Cervantes, author of the Spanish language's most famous novel,
``Don Quixote,'' now operates 35 centers around the world and has a
Web page.
	   The institute published a report this year calling for the use
of Spanish in all international forums, including the scientific
and technological world traditionally dominated by English.
	   ``In all of this we will be betting heavily on the Internet,''
de Mora-Figueroa says.
	   The language crusaders don't fear Spanish is being overwhelmed
by English, but say they must keep abreast of the times to avoid
the disintegration of Spanish into many dialects and the loss of
international ranking.
	   Computers were a rarity just three years ago at the Royal
Spanish Language Academy, which was founded in 1790 with the
mission ``to clean, establish and give splendor'' to the Spanish
language.
	   Its nearly 50 members, including such authors as Camilo Jose
Cela and the Peruvian-born Mario Vargas Llosa, have traditionally
relied on 12 million handwritten index cards, some dating back
centuries, to compile reference works regulating the language.
	   Today, the basement of the academy's grandiose 19th century
building has been converted into a computerized beehive, where 60
specialists are keying in tens of thousands of texts for the
reference bank for the new millennium.
	   Compiled with the aid of affiliate academies in Latin America,
samples range from notes jotted in the margins of books by 10th
century Spanish monks to recent editions of Latin American
newspapers and transcribed radio and street conversations.
	   The data bank will be a complete representation of the language,
says Guillermo Rojo, a linguistics professor in charge of the
effort.
	   ``People who have a word or phrase they want to check will just
have to key it into their computer on the Internet and within
seconds the corpus (data bank) will be able to tell you where and
when it has been used, with what frequency and connotations.''
	   The computerization of the academy isn't without skeptics.
	   Colombian novelist Garbriel Garcia Marquez, winner of the Nobel
Prize in literature, visited the academy last year. With evident
doubt, he challenged his hosts to use the computer to find the word
``avorazar'' _ to be voracious.
	   Within seconds, it not only found the word but also offered
textual references of its usage, including examples from Garcia
Marquez's own works.

With African titans Mugabe and Mandela, it's getting personal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When civil war broke out in
their neighborhood, southern Africa's regional giants _ Robert
Mugabe and Nelson Mandela _ didn't even show up at each other's
summits.
	   The war in Congo has laid wide open the increasingly bitter
rivalry between two of the continent's most prominent leaders.
	   Zimbabwean President Mugabe ignored South African President
Mandela's call for negotiations and peace emissaries to solve the
fighting between Congolese government troops and rebels. Instead,
he has sent about 3,000 troops to back President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``There is a personal jealousy (by Mugabe) which has turned into
a vendetta,'' said Hermann Hanekom, a former high-level diplomat at
South Africa's Foreign Affairs Ministry.
	   Both men started out as revolutionaries who struggled to end
white rule in their countries. Both were jailed by white minority
governments.
	   After Zimbabwe's liberation in 1980, Mugabe as president early
on served as a symbol of reconciliation between blacks and whites,
and the West had a new darling in Africa.
	   But things turned sour for the ascetic former teacher the day
Mandela walked out of his cell in 1990 after 27 years as a prisoner
of apartheid.
	   Suddenly, not just the region but the world had a new hero.
	   Mugabe ``is deeply sensitive to Mandela's international
stature,'' said Greg Mills, director of the South African Institute
of International Affairs. ``He feels his position has been usurped
with the advent of democracy in South Africa.''
	   Mandela has taken up the mantle of grand conciliator, seeking
harmony among the races at home and mediating abroad, whether in
the Sudanese civil war or between Libya and the United States.
	   Meanwhile, Mugabe over the years has become increasingly
authoritarian. He recently suspended one of his party officials for
dissenting, called local whites ``as mean as Jews'' and campaigned
against homosexuals.
	   With the war in Congo, ``It is quite clear that personal pride
is playing a major role in Mugabe's conduct and attitude toward
President Mandela at the moment,'' Hanekom said.
	   Last week, Mugabe indirectly called Mandela a hypocrite for
advocating peace while supporting Kabila's opponents _ a charge
South Africa denies.
	   Early on in the fighting, which started in July, Mugabe did not
invite Mandela to a meeting of regional leaders in Zimbabwe. Two
weeks later, he spurned an invitation to a similar meeting in South
Africa.
	   On Tuesday, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki sought to
downplay any policy differences over Congo, saying both sides want
a cease-fire.
	   Mandela is chairman of the Southern African Development
Community, a mainly economic grouping of 14 countries dominated by
South Africa. But Mugabe heads the community's security organ,
using the pulpit to promote his own stature, a source of irritation
to Mandela, sources say.
	   The rivalry has consequences.
	   A desire to raise his stature in the region may have contributed
to Mugabe's dispatch of troops to Congo, some Africa watchers say.
	   The rivalry also has distracted the community from accomplishing
anything substantial _ such as lowering tariffs and other economic
cooperation, Mills said.
	   Other factors figure into the rift, such as South Africa's
economy, which dwarfs that of its northern neighbor.
	   Zimbabwean business leaders who met with Mugabe last year
described how the president pounded a fist on his desk and said,
``I won't have it. I won't have them treating me like a province of
South Africa.''
	   Even the presidents' styles are different.
	   Mugabe, 74, wears conservative dark suits and rides through town
in 30-car motorcades, emerging unsmiling for awkward handshakes at
election time. Mandela, 80, rarely fails to greet children through
the fence behind the presidential gardens when foreign dignitaries
come to town.
	   In public, the two men put up a good show of friendliness.
Foreign Ministry officials claim they talk frequently on the phone.
	   When Mugabe married two years ago, Mandela attended.
	   While the groom wore white gloves and tails, Mandela sported one
of his floral, African-style shirts.
	   Mandela was married in July in a private ceremony attended by
family and friends. Neither Mugabe nor other foreign dignitaries
were invited.

Veteran explorer vows to continue sea expedition despite shipwreck
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MONTE HAYES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A 70-year-old American explorer lost all his
belongings and nearly his life in a shipwreck in shark-infested
South Pacific waters, but he says that won't stop his sea
expedition.
	   In surprisingly good spirits despite the loss of his ship two
weeks ago, Gene Savoy from Nevada said he plans to raising funds
for a new replica of an ancient Peruvian vessel for his voyage
around the world.
	   ``Just because you lose a ship, you don't give up. You keep
going,'' said Savoy, who has discovered 43 lost cities in Peru's
remote rain forests since he began exploring in 1957.
	   Savoy and his crew were on the second leg of what he hoped would
be an around-the-world voyage in a double-hulled, 73-foot
(22-meter) mahogany vessel that was designed based on images found
on pre-Incan pottery from Peru's northern desert.
	   The explorer was trying to prove his controversial theory that
pre-Columbian Peru had contact with civilizations as far away as
Japan and the Middle East. Most anthropologists do not believe that
they did.
	   Speaking Tuesday in a telephone interview from the Ever Victory,
the Taiwanese cargo ship that pulled him and his crew from the
water on Aug. 20, the day after the shipwreck, Savoy said, ``This
doesn't stop the expedition.''
	   Savoy set off from Callao, Lima's port, on Dec. 17, in the
Feathered Serpent III. He arrived in Hawaii on Jan. 28 after a
6,000-mile (9,655-kilometer) voyage that represented the first leg
of his planned seven-year expedition. He set out Aug. 5 for
Brisbane, Australia, on the second leg.
	   ``We just got hit by a freak storm,'' he said, describing his
shipwreck. ``That can happen to anyone. It's an interruption but
it's not a failure.''
	   Savoy said 15-foot (4.5-meter) high ``rogue waves'' crumpled the
crossbeams that held together the dragon-headed hulls of his
catamaran.
	   As the boat began to break apart in the darkness, Savoy and his
crew _ four Americans and two Japanese _ had only half an hour to
inflate a life raft and retrieve drinking water and other emergency
supplies.
	   One crew member, Peter Foust, risked his life to free Savoy from
his cabin as the ship went down. Savoy had gone to get his money
and passport, but water rushed in and forced the hatch door shut,
trapping him.
	   Amid the wreckage, the dragon head on the starboard side of the
vessel remained upright. Savoy kept the lifeboat tethered to the
hull because he felt the dragon head would draw the attention of
rescuers and make it easier to find them.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 rescue plane spotted them hours after
the shipwreck and radioed that a ship would pick them up. But the
hours dragged by and Savoy began to worry when large fish appeared,
a sign that sharks were probably in the area.
	   The next morning the Ever Victory, a 743-foot (226-meter)
freighter, appeared through the mist. ``It was the greatest sight I
ever saw in my life,'' Savoy said.
	   Savoy admits fearing for his own life and the lives of his crew
members.
	   ``But you overcome that and you think of survival,'' he said.
``Man is a survival species. We survive.''

With eye on Clinton visit, Sinn Fein says violence must be `done

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein party leader Gerry
Adams' declaration that political violence in Northern Ireland must
be ``a thing of the past'' has received a broad welcome from the
British and Irish governments and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Adams' statement in advance of Clinton's arrival here Thursday
marked another rhetorical step away from the Irish Republican
Army's once-unshakeable determination to bomb and shoot until
Northern Ireland was abolished.
	   Instead, his IRA-allied party is now angling to help govern the
77-year-old state alongside British Protestant politicians in a new
administration envisioned in April's peace agreement.
	   The Protestant head of the embryonic government, David Trimble,
has repeatedly demanded that Sinn Fein declare on behalf of the IRA
that ``their war is over'' before he would talk with Adams about
Sinn Fein's role in the new administration.
	   ``We have to work politically to make the Omagh bombing the last
violent incident in our country, the last incident of this kind,''
Adams said, referring to the car bomb detonated by IRA dissidents
in defiance of the outlawed group's July 1997 truce.
	   The Aug. 15 attack in Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast,
was the deadliest since Northern Ireland's conflict began in the
late 1960s. It claimed 28 lives and wounded more than 330.
	   ``Sinn Fein believe the violence we have seen must be for all of
us now a thing of the past, over, done with and gone,'' Adams said
in a deliberate effort to match the sentiments, but avoid the
precise words, contained in Trimble's demand.
	   In response, Trimble announced he would meet the leaders of
several pro-agreement parties _ including Adams _ on Monday, a week
before the new Northern Ireland legislative Assembly is scheduled
to convene. But Trimble's aide, David Kerr, said a handshake
between the two leaders would be impossible.
	   ``Carefully crafted words alone are not enough. The people of
Northern Ireland will now judge Sinn Fein on their actions over the
coming days,'' Trimble said, emphasizing that Sinn Fein's
acceptance of the agreement included a promise to get the IRA to
disarm within two years.
	   ``An end to the war means the weapons of terrorism must be
destroyed and all forms of paramilitary violence must cease for
good,'' Trimble said, noting that the IRA had meted out more than
30 so-called ``punishment'' shootings and beatings within its
Catholic power bases since Sinn Fein accepted the accord.
	   But in a well-choreographed push to build momentum before
Clinton arrives, the British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair
and Bertie Ahern, immediately welcomed Adams' statement.
	   Blair said it was ``significant'' and designed ``to break down
barriers of mistrust.''
	   And in Moscow, Clinton said Adams had made ``an important
contribution to building the trust and confidence necessary to make
the Good Friday accord a reality.''
	   Meanwhile, Blair and Ahern are determined this week to enact new
anti-terrorist laws against the IRA dissidents responsible for the
Omagh bombing. Civil-rights activists and a handful of lawmakers
complain they flout the spirit of the Belfast agreement.
	   The bills _ being debated Wednesday in emergency sessions of
London's House of Commons and Dublin's lower house of parliament _
propose restricting a suspect's right to silence during
interrogation and in court, making police testimony more important
to secure convictions, and allowing authorities to impound the
property of convicted terrorists.
	   John Wadham, director of the British civil liberties lobbying
group Liberty, called Blair's bill ``the single most draconian
piece of legislation that has emerged from any government _ Labor
or Conservative _ since the Second World War.''
	   One of Britain's leading legal crusaders, lawyer Michael
Mansfield, said the proposed laws would mean ``evidence will be
supplanted by opinion'' in anti-terrorist courts.
	   Also Wednesday, Belfast awaited the arrival of the American
first lady, Hillary Clinton, one day ahead of her husband, to
address a women's rights conference in the city's gleaming new
riverside concert hall.

Notes and quotes from Tuesday's U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When 12th-seeded Mary Pierce took on Meike Babel
of Germany in a first-round match at the U.S. Open, the French
woman was sporting a tattoo on her left shoulder.
	   It turns out it's not a permanent tattoo but it is an
advertisement for a new Givenchy perfume called ``Extravagance.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOWN AND OUT: &LR;  Being a tennis professional is not an easy life.
	   Four players retired from their men's singles matches on Monday
and another did Tuesday. Dr. Brain Hainline, the tournament's chief
medical officer, described the reasons as ``a mixed bag.''
	   Ankle and shoulder problems were listed by the ATP Tour as the
reason that Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi dropped out of his match
against Adrian Voinea in the fourth set.
	   American Justin Gimelstob retired in the third set of his match
against Zimbabwe's Wayne Black with severe cramping. At one point,
Gimelstob attempted to serve underhand. And when he decided he
couldn't play any longer, the muscles in his right hand spasmed so
severely he had to shake hands with his left.
	   ``A couple of weeks ago, I was diagnosed as being anemic. My
iron count is very low,'' Gimelstob said. ``I just think my body is
going through some stuff and I don't know what it is. We're still
trying to figure it out.''
	   Andrew Ilie of Australia called it quits against American Paul
Goldstein because of a stomach virus, and an upper respiratory
infection forced Germany's Alex Radulescu to retire during his
match with American Taylor Dent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MOVING UP THE LIST: &LR;  When Mary Pierce captured her first-round
match Tuesday, it was the 300th victory of her career.
	   Leading the active leaders is Steffi Graf, who has won 854
matches, followed by Arantxa Sanchez Vicario with 619 and Jana
Novotna with 538.
	   The last player to reach 300 career match victories before
Pierce was Larisa Neiland of Latvia.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; JUMPING INTO THE ACTION: &LR;  With the ball bouncing high in his
first-round match against South African Wayne Ferreira,
sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski raced to the net. In order to avoid
running into the net, which would cost him the point, Rusedski
hurdled the net as he punched the volley.
	   Despite his acrobatics, Rusedski lost the point when he landed
on Ferreira's side of the net before the ball had bounced twice.
Since the ball was still in play, Rusedski was guilty of
``invasion.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOME SWEET HOME: &LR;  Russian teen-ager Anna Kournikova says
there's a lot of overreaction about the recent problems in her
homeland.
	   ``I don't really follow up with the stuff that is going on there
... politically,'' she said after defeating Lea Ghirardi of France
6-1, 6-3 in a first-round match. ``I know that all that they show
on TV and write in the newspaper, it is a little bit exaggerated
and the people are living normal there as we lived before.''
	   Asked if she was worried about the decline of the ruble,
Kournikova said:
	   ``It is just people are overreacting. Always I think that
everybody else in the world (believes) that Russia is so poor and
there is nothing. But it's a normal life there just like anywhere
else.''

Rwanda tribunal to deliver first-ever genocide judgment

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Nearly 4 1/2 years after Rwandan Hutus
armed with machetes hacked to death more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis in one of the swiftest genocides in history, a U.N.
tribunal's first verdict in the killing frenzy was due Wednesday.
	   The judgment against an ex-mayor also is the first by an
international court on the crime of genocide, created after World
War II.
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, former mayor of the central village of Taba,
pleaded innocent to 15 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity,
torture and rape in a trial that began Jan. 9, 1997.
	   He was charged with ordering the killings of 2,000 Tutsis who
had sought his protection.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Prosper, in closing arguments in March, argued
that Akayesu, born in 1953, knew of crimes against Tutsis, ``and at
times, was present during their commission, but failed to prevent
them, and actually aided and abetted their commission.''
	   On Friday, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was
scheduled to sentence former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, who led
Rwanda's government during the 1994 genocide. Kambanda pleaded
guilty May 1 and promised to testify against other alleged
ringleaders of the slaughter.
	   The United Nations said Kambanda was the first person ever to
plead guilty to genocide charges before an international tribunal,
and the judgment on Akayesu will be the first for the crime of
genocide by an international court under a 1948 U.N. treaty.
	   It also will be the first time an international court rules on
sexual violence _ the indictment against Akayesu was amended
mid-trial to include charges of rape.
	   In addition, it will be the tribunal's first verdict since it
was set up in November 1994, long gap criticized by Rwandans, who
also are unhappy that the maximum penalty the tribunal can impose
is life imprisonment.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg and Tokyo
trials pleaded innocent to charges that included murder and
extermination. Nineteen people were sentenced to death.
	   In July, the United Nations agreed to establish a permanent
International Criminal Court, building on the work of the Rwanda
tribunal as well as the International Criminal Tribunal for
Yugoslavia.
	   Rwandan Hutu extremists plotted the genocide carried out for 90
days beginning April 7, 1994, mostly by peasants wielding machetes
or nail-studded clubs. Tutsi-led rebels ousted the Hutu government
in July 1994 and ended the killings.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha, four of whom are on
trial. Another person is in custody in Texas. Eight others have
been indicted, but not apprehended.
	   Rwandan courts _ in trials condemned by foreign lawyers as often
unjust _ have tried at least 330 people for involvement in the
genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. More than 125,000
people are imprisoned and awaiting trial.
	   On April 24, the Rwandan government executed 22 genocide
convicts by firing squad, the first executions for the slaughter.
	   If found guilty, Akayesu will not be sentenced immediately, the
tribunal said. European countries including Belgium, Sweden,
Switzerland and Norway have volunteered to incarcerate the
tribunal's convicts. The tribunal would prefer, however, that its
convicts serve their sentences in African countries.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ As heads of state of developing
countries gather for a Nonaligned Movement summit, last-ditch talks
to end fighting in Congo involving troops from as many as six
countries were stealing the spotlight.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew into Durban on Tuesday,
where he planned to hold talks with regional leaders on a peace
plan. Notably absent from the summit was Congo President Laurent
Kabila, who appears to have the upper hand on the battlefield and
has refused to participate in peace talks.
	   ``We need to find a way of getting everybody to talk,'' Annan
said in comments to The Associated Press Tuesday night after he met
with President Nelson Mandela.
	   Mandela's peace initiatives have stalled and Annan's
participation could provide a much-needed boost. Annan's agenda for
Wednesday, the opening day of the heads of state summit, was
unclear, but he could meet on the sideline of the summit with the
leaders of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda, who were
all expected at the summit.
	   Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops are fighting alongside
Kabila's forces. Kabila says Rwandan and Ugandan troops are
supporting Congolese rebels, although the leaders of the two
countries deny it.
	   About 50 heads of state, including South African President
Nelson Mandela, Cuban President Fidel Castro and Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, arrived in the humid Indian Ocean
city of Durban for the summit.
	   Dancers and drummers greeted the leaders as they flew into
Durban's small airport.
	   Castro, forgoing the business suit he has worn in recent years
to international conferences in favor of his customary green
military fatigues, saluted an honor guard as he moved slowly down a
red carpet.
	   The summit will focus on how to redirect the movement's energies
into helping poor countries gain influence and wealth, and on
bilateral talks on the Congo war, nuclear proliferation in South
Asia, and other issues.
	   There are disagreements aplenty among the group's 113 members,
who often have divergent interests
	   At talks held by foreign ministers and other delegates behind
closed doors, India was calling on the movement to declare it a
nuclear power, said a source attending the summit.
	   ``Such a stance would be against NAM principles'' which call for
nuclear disarmament, said the source on condition of anonymity.
	   At its last summit in Cartagena, Colombia, the Nonaligned
Movement called for poor countries to have a greater voice in the
UN Security Council, for relief of overwhelming foreign debt and
for fairer trade relationships with the West.
	   But little has been accomplished in the intervening three years.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin warned
that the country was on a precipitous course and could not afford
more mistakes, while President Boris Yeltsin insisted on
Chernomyrdin's swift confirmation by the fractious parliament as a
step toward ending Russia's crisis.
	   ``We have used up our allowance for mistakes,'' Chernomyrdin
told the acting Cabinet on Tuesday. ``We are walking along a narrow
plank. A step to the right, a step to the left _ and it's all
over.''
	   Yeltsin insisted he wouldn't give up Chernomyrdin as his choice
for prime minister, despite the risk of months' more uncertainty if
that strategy fails.
	   He nominated Chernomyrdin last week, just five months after
replacing him with the young Sergei Kiriyenko. Yeltsin dismissed
Kiriyenko on Aug. 23.
	   The lower house of parliament, or State Duma, overwhelmingly
voted down Chernomyrdin's candidacy on Monday. If lawmakers reject
Yeltsin's choice two more times, the president must dissolve the
Duma and call new parliamentary elections within three months. That
would leave the country to be steered through crisis by Yeltsin
decrees and a stand-in government.
	   Yeltsin assured U.S. President Bill Clinton, who arrived Tuesday
in the midst of Russia's worst financial crisis since the Soviet
era, that he wouldn't abandon democratic and market reforms.
	   ``Russia's strategic course of reform is inevitable,'' he
declared in a speech at the state dinner honoring Clinton on
Tuesday evening.
	   As Yeltsin used his public appearances on the first day of
school and in meetings with Clinton to drive home his commitment to
Chernomyrdin's candidacy, the acting prime minister outlined
several planks of his plan to battle the country's economic crisis.
	   He demanded immediate proposals to radically overhaul a taxation
system that he oversaw during five turbulent years as premier. Very
few Russians and Russian companies pay taxes, leaving the
government unable to pay state workers and pensioners.
	   ``Without tax reform, which would stimulate production, we won't
survive,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Chernomyrdin also reiterated that the acting government was
considering different options to improve the terms of the
government's debt restructuring, which was announced Aug. 17.
	   The terms wiped out over tens of billions of dollars foreign
holdings, and angered the investor community. Consequently, Russia
will be unable to borrow on the international markets for a long
time to come, market participants say.
	   Top Communist lawmakers showed no signs of backing down. A
second vote is likely next Monday, though it could come as early as
Friday, said the speaker of the parliament's lower house, Gennady
Seleznyov.
	   ``He doesn't have a chance,'' Seleznyov declared of
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war,'' said
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, due to meet with Clinton
on Wednesday.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Economic growth in Latin America and the
Caribbean is slowing this year as a result of the financial turmoil
in Asia and damage caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, a
United Nations agency said Tuesday.
	   The Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin America, or
ECLA, predicted that the region will post an average economic
growth of 3 percent this year, down from 5.3 percent in 1997.
	   Last year's performance resulted from the booming exports and
the lowest regional inflation average in half a century, 10.4
percent, ECLA said in its biannual report on the economies of Latin
American and Caribbean nations.
	   The report said that effects of the ``external shocks'' on the
region ``are still moderate thanks to prompt and energetic measures
taken by most governments in the region.''
	   The measures, however, included inevitable ``financial and
budgetary restrictions'' that further slow down economic growth.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A radical activist has been cleared of murder
charges and released after eight years behind bars, newspapers
reported Tuesday.
	   ``I am not going to take up the rifle or the pistol now,'' said
David Cabanas, 53, as he left a Mexico City prison Monday night.
``Now I am going to take up the pen.''
	   Cabanas fought in the rebel group the Party of the Poor in
southern Guerrero state in the early 1970s. He later became the
leader of the communist Revolutionary Worker Clandestine Union of
the People Party, known by its initials as Procup, which officials
accused of carrying out bombings, kidnappings and robberies.
	   Federal officials claim Procup played a major role in forming
the Popular Revolutionary Army that emerged in Guerrero state in
1996 and has since attacked police and troops in at least six
states.
	   Cabanas was arrested in June 1990 on charges of killing two
guards at the newspaper La Jornada, which had refused to print one
of the group's communiques. He was held eight years without being
convicted.
	   His freedom came a month after Mexico City officials granted
early release to the man convicted of masterminding the La Jornada
killings, 71-year-old Felipe Martinez Soriano, a former rector of
Oaxaca state's main university.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Protesters clashed with
police during a regional general strike in the northern Dominican
Republic, leaving one striker dead and eight injured, radio
stations reported Tuesday.
	   Demonstrators demanding more spending on public works projects
clashed with police Monday in the cities of Salcedo and Moca,
situated 90 miles and 70 miles, respectively, north of Santo
Domingo.
	   Ramon Orlando Camilo, 18, died Tuesday when a bomb exploded
during a confrontation with police in Salcedo, the Santo Domingo
stations said. Police said they had no information on the incident.
	   At least eight people were hurt during demonstrations near Moca.
	   Labor and political organizations had called a general strike
Monday.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ About 1,100 doctors at public
hospitals in Caracas walked off the job Tuesday, but nearly the
same number crossed the picket line to work.
	   Union officials said several hospitals were forced to shut their
emergency rooms and turn away patients.
	   ``We have economic needs, but we can't walk over the cadavers of
patients to achieve a just salary,'' said one doctor who asked not
to be identified for fear of union reprisals.
	   Union officials said many of the remaining 26,000 public sector
doctors throughout the country may join the strike.
	   Doctors want their salaries increased to dlrs 1,030 a month from
the current dlrs 378. The government estimates it takes dlrs 378 a
month to keep a family of five above the poverty line.

TV channel fined for racist remarks by sports commentator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - A television station was fined 500,000
pesos (dlrs. 1,200) after a sports commentator made racist remarks
against the referee from the African nation of Niger who officiated
in the Chile vs. Italy match in the soccer World Cup in France last
June.
	   Commentator Eduardo Bonvallet of La Red TV station blasted
referee Lucien Buchardeau after he granted a penalty kick that
assured Italy a 2-2 with Chile.
	   The National Television Council announced the fine today saying
it took the case after a private citizen complained of Bonvallet*s
remarks.
	   La Red did not immediately announce whether it will appeal.
	   Bonvallet, a former professiuonal soccer player, was not
available for comment.

Verdict overturned against Paraguayan general accused of rebellion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A military court on Tuesday overturned
the guilty verdict of another court against a former army
chief-of-staff acccused of a 1996 rebellion.
	   Retired Gen. Lino Oviedo, whose 10-year sentence for rebellion
had been commuted by President Raul Cubas to the three months
served, also recovered his civil rights, said army press official
Col. Salvador Diaz.
	   Prosecuting attorney Julio Vasconcellos called the ruling
``incredible.''
	   ``Oviedo was condemned by a military court and the verdict was
confirmed by the supreme court. It cannot be changed,''
Vasconcellos said.
	   Oviedo was sentenced to 10 years last March. The conviction
followed an April 1996 political crisis when he initially refused
then-President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's order to step down as army
chief of staff.

Guatemala tries Swiss citizens, German on cocaine charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Trials started Tuesday here against three
Swiss citizens, a German and three Guatemalans on cocaine smuggling
charges in what has become known as the ``German Connection'' case.
	   The defendants _ including the Swiss former director of a Nestle
plant in Guatemala _ are accused of drug trafficking. All seven
defendants were led into court in handcuffs in the city of Puerto
Barrios, 160 miles (260 kilometers) northeast of Guatemala City.
	   The Swiss and German ambassadors to Guatemala attended the first
day of the trial, which is being held under tight security with
about 100 anti-drug police guarding the court building.
	   The seven are accused of smuggling cocaine out of Guatemala in
shipping containers and shipments of crafts bound for Germany.
Trials in Guatemala are based on oral arguments presented before a
judge, not a jury.
	   The alleged scheme was uncovered in November 1996 when police in
Duesseldorf, Germany, found 170 kilograms (375 pounds) of cocaine
hidden in plastic bags in a shipment of Guatemalan hammocks.
	   In August 1997, Guatemalan police caught a truck driver carrying
13 kilograms of cocaine in a shipping container presumably bound
for Germany.
	   Those seizures led to the arrest of Swiss citizen Andreas
Heanggi Wyndler, 60, the then-director of the Nestle plant in
Antigua, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) west of the capital.
	   Also arrested and currently on trial were his son, Nicholas
Heanggie Chalandrian, 22, and Silvio Geovanolli, 30.
	   Franz Joachin Schilling, 52, of Germany was arrested last
September in Antigua. Three Guatemalans, including a former
assistant police chief in Antigua, are also on trial.

Argentine minister involved in illegal arms sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A federal judge on Tuesday
accused a former defense minister, now labor minister, of
involvement in 1991 weapons sales to Croatia in violation of a U.N.
embargo.
	   Federal Judge Jorge Urso accused then-Defense Minister Antonio
Gonzalez of authorizing in 1991 the sale of 6,500 tons of weapons
to Panama with the knowledge that the weapons would be diverted to
Croatia.
	   Urso also investigates a sale of weapons to Bolivia, authorized
by a 1992 executive decree, that never was realized.
	   Gonzalez, now labor minister, denied any wrongdoing and said he
would reply to the charges ``in writing.''
	   Argentine public officials enjoy immunity from prosecution,
which can be revoked by the congress or waived by the accused.
	   A former defense minister, Oscar Camilion, was forced to resign
in 1996 and faces charges in a sale of 75 tons of weapons to
Ecuador during its 1995 border war with Peru.

Committee chair rejects Iraqi complaints about contract delays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraqi complaints that the United States
and Britain were delaying contracts for spare parts to improve its
oil industry are no longer valid, Portugal's ambassador said.
	   Contracts are moving more quickly now and are expected to be
approved even faster in the future, said Antonio Monteiro, who
chairs the U.N. committee which oversees sanctions on Iraq.
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil _ its economic mainstay _
on the open market since sanctions were imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990. A unique U.N. program, called oil-for-food,
allows Iraq to sell its oil in exchange for badly needed food and
medicine.
	   The Security Council agreed earlier this year to let Baghdad buy
dlrs 300 million in spare parts to help boost its oil output. Low
prices for oil and production limits have prevented Baghdad from
reaching the dlrs 5.2 billion in oil it is allowed to sell over six
months.
	   At a meeting Tuesday, the U.N. sanctions committee discussed
complaints from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that spare
parts contracts were being delayed unnecessarily by the United
States and Britain.
	   ``The number of contracts on hold cited in the complaints from
Tariq Aziz are no longer valid,'' he said. ``We have improved the
process already and the numbers are better.''
	   He said approvals could be even faster now that two outside oil
industry experts had been hired to help expedite the process.
	   ``The U.S. said they put some contracts on hold because they
want to know exactly what the products are that are being
approved,'' Monteiro told reporters.
	   The head of the oil-for-food program, Benon Sevan, was scheduled
to brief the Security Council on Friday about the contract approval
process.

U. N. report: Population explosion isn't over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 1200 GMT after scheduled news conference
in London. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The largest-ever generation of young people in
every continent except Europe will ensure that the human race will
continue to grow until at least the middle of the next century, the
U.N. Population Fund said Wednesday.
	   While falling fertility, smaller families, and improved health
care have slowed the annual rate of population growth, the legacy
of past high fertility is an unprecedented number of teenagers
approaching their childbearing years, the agency said in its annual
report.
	   Global population will pass 6 billion in 1999 and it will reach
somewhere between 7.7 billion and 11.1 billion by 2050 _ most
likely 9.4 billion, according to U.N. projections.
	   ``This means population may grow as much or more in the next 50
years than in the past 50 years,'' the report said, noting that
there were only 2.5 billion people in 1950.
	   The composition of the world's population is also changing.
	   Over 1 billion young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are
entering their most fertile years at the same time that the number
and proportion of adults over the age of 65 is increasing at an
unprecedented rate, the Population Fund said.
	   ``The rapid growth of young and old `new generations' is
challenging societies' ability to provide education and health care
for the young, and social, medical and financial support for the
elderly,'' the report said.
	   Over 90 percent of the world's population growth in the next 50
years will take place in today's developing countries, the report
said.
	   During the next two decades, lower birth rates in these
countries offer the prospect of a ``bulge'' of young people coming
into the workforce while fewer children are born, the U.N. agency
said.
	   If jobs can be found for them, the workforce ``bulge'' can be an
engine for greater productivity, investment and economic
development, the U.N. agency said.
	   ``This will generate revenues for social investments like
health, education and social security, to meet the needs of both
old and young and secure the basis for future development,'' it
said.
	   East Asia was the first developing region to experience the
bonus of a working-age ``bulge,'' and it helped build the region's
prosperity into the 1990s, the report said.
	   ``A similar window of opportunity is opening in Southeast Asia
and South Asia,'' it said.
	   While the proportion of the world's population aged 15-24 will
decline from 19 percent to 14 percent by 2050, the actual numbers
will grow from 863 million to 1.16 billion, the report said.
	   The Population Fund urged reproductive health programs to
``address adolescents and their sexuality openly and honestly,
provide more options, sensitive counseling and better information
to promote effective use of the most appropriate means of
contraception.''
	   While the percentage of young people declines, the proportion of
people over the age of 65 will more than double in the next 50
years from 6.8 percent to 15.1 percent, the report said.
	   That means a record 1.42 billion people will live beyond their
65th birthday, 3 1/2 times the number today and over 10 times as
many as in 1950, it said.
	   Within 35 years, the fund said, the elderly will approach or
exceed 40 percent of the populations in Japan, Germany and Italy.

UNICEF provides dlrs 800,000 for Bangladesh flood victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ UNICEF said Tuesday it has provided dlrs
800,000 in emergency medicine and food to Bangladesh following the
floods that have killed hundreds of people and submerged much of
the country.
	   Most of the aid is oral rehydration therapies, intravenous fluid
bags and water purification tablets, the U.N. Children's Fund said
in a statement. High-protein biscuits and other food, sanitary
supplies and corrugated iron sheets for shelter are also being
provided.
	   Rice paddy crops have been wiped out by floods that submerged
two-thirds of Bangladesh, leaving more than 600 people drowned or
killed by collapsing homes, a foreign ministry official said
Tuesday.
	   Torrential rains in the Himalayas since July have swollen rivers
that burst their embankments.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen in
early trading Wednesday amid lingering concern over the recent
volatility on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks advanced.
	   The U.S. currency bought 137.68 yen in early trading, down 0.54
yen from late in Tokyo on Tuesday and also below its level of
139.25 yen in late New York trading overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 188.16 points,
or 1.31 percent, to 14,557.79 in the first half hour of trading. It
had gained 261.74 points, or 1.86 percent, the previous day.
	   The dollar fell as low as 135 yen in New York Tuesday on
nervousness about the plunge in U.S. stock prices Monday, but then
strengthened as the Dow Jones industrial average staged a recovery,
traders said.
	   ``The rebound of the U.S. stock prices Tuesday was a relief for
the recent bearish sentiment toward the dollar,'' said Yoshihiro
Nomura, a currency trader at Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
	   The Dow industrial average rose 288.36, or 3.8 percent, to
7,827.43 _ the second-biggest point gain in history.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's
Ministry of Finance welcomed the more robust yen, saying the
Japanese currency was turning the tide against the dollar.
	   ``I think a trend of correction has begun,'' Kuroda said.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, meanwhile, share prices climbed
Wednesday following the gains on Wall Street, traders said.
	   A report that an opposition party backs a ruling party plan for
dealing with troubled banks also buoyed the market, they said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange advanced 14.85 points, or 1.34
percent, to 1,125. On Tuesday, it rose 3.66 points, or 0.33
percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.100 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.060 percent,
driving its price down to 112.40 yen from 112.71 yen.

Clinton urges Yeltin to stay with reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At a Kremlin summit darkened by economic and
political upheaval, President Bill Clinton offered Boris Yeltsin a
prescription of tough reforms to lift Russia from crisis. ``You
have to play by the rules'' of international economics, Clinton
said.
	   Yeltsin, despite pressure from the Communist-dominated
parliament, pledged not to abandon the free-market course on which
Russia embarked seven years ago.
	   ``The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,''
Yeltsin said Tuesday in dinner remarks. ``Soon there were
disappointments, too, and unfulfilled hopes. But we've never lost
the conviction in the necessity of the transformations we're
carrying out.''
	   With Russia gripped in a power struggle, U.S. officials said the
situation was too uncertain to predict what kind of economic
remedies would be embraced. They said Yeltsin and his acting prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, indicated there were areas requiring
more government involvement, such as social safety nets and steps
to pay back wages.
	   Striding into the Russian leader's presidential study from
separate doors, Clinton and Yeltsin met in the middle of the room
with big smiles, a handshake and a bear hug at the opening of two
days of talks.
	   They signed off on preset deals to reduce their arsenals of
military-grade plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and to
share information on missile launch tests. The agreements will be
formally sealed at a concluding news conference Wednesday.
	   The summit, their seventh, comes at a troublesome time for both
leaders. Humiliated by his admission of an extramarital affair,
Clinton is struggling to recapture his political credibility.
Yeltsin, discredited by broken promises and policy changes, has
devalued the Russian currency, stopped repaying foreign loans and
watched the stock market crumble.
	   In a politically safe move, both Clinton and Yeltsin visited
schools on the first day of classes. In a chilly rain, Clinton also
placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, honoring the
millions of Russians killed in World War II.
	   The president also kept an eye on Wall Street after Monday's
512-point tumble. ``The market's up,'' Clinton happily said with a
thumbs-up sign to Gene Sperling, a senior economic adviser, during
a Kremlin dinner. The market regained 288 points Tuesday.
	   In an afternoon speech to university students after talking with
Yeltsin, Clinton said he came to Russia ``because I believe someone
has to tell the truth to the people, so that you're not skeptical
when your political leaders tell you things that are hard to
hear.''
	   Amid calls here for a return to Soviet-era economic controls,
Clinton said the government must instead toughen its
loophole-ridden tax-collection system to raise money for bills,
salaries, pensions and health care. Further, he warned the
government would force inflation higher and cause more pain if it
simply printed more money to meet expenses and help faltering
banks.
	   In addition, he warned that ``special bailouts for a privileged
few come at the expense of the whole nation.'' And he said that
investors will not return to Russia unless there is ``fair,
equitable treatment of creditors.''
	   Before reciting those points publicly, Clinton presented the
same arguments to Yeltsin, in a 90-minute meeting, and to
Chernomyrdin, in a 35-minute limousine ride into town from the
airport, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said.
	   Again and again, Clinton stressed the theme that Russia must
play by the rules of international economics and not slide
backwards to its old ways. He said Russia must restore investor
confidence to reverse the flight of money out of the country.
	   ``To get your fair share of investment, you have to play by the
rules that everyone else has to play by,'' the president said in
his speech at the Moscow University of International Relations.
``That's what this whole crisis is all about. No one could ever
have expected your country to be able to make this transition
without pain.''
	   ``There is no way out of playing by the rules of the
international economy if you wish to be a part of it,'' the
president said.
	   Clinton and Yeltsin concluded the day over a dinner that ran
just over an hour, about half its scheduled time. Clinton was
overheard saying he was jet-lagged.
	   In his dinner remarks, Yeltsin spoke optimistically about
Russia's economic future.
	   ``I'm far from the assertions that all the difficulties are
already behind us,'' Yeltsin said. ``The great social costs of
reform. And time is necessary for the government's stabilization
program to bring results. But as the president declared: Russia's
strategic course of reform is inevitable.''
	   At a U.S. briefing, Treasury Deputy Secretary Larry Summers
refused to rule out the possibility that Yeltsin would make a deal
with Communists that undercut economic reforms.
	   ``I think that things are very much in flux,'' Summers said.
``It's clear that there is a lot of discussion back and forth about
the course that will be followed and I think it's clear that there
are enormous stakes both for Russia and the United States in the
outcome. But I wouldn't want to be in the position of hazarding a
prediction at this point.''

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The Detroit Tigers, losers of 22 of their last 27
games and owners of the worst record in the American League, fired
Buddy Bell as manager Tuesday. Bench coach Larry Parrish was named
interim manager for the rest of the season.
	   With a dlrs 28 million payroll, one of the lowest in baseball,
the Tigers went into Tuesday night's game just 15 games shy of
their second 100-loss season in three years.
	   There had been speculation of the move for nearly a week, after
team owner Mike Ilitch publicly gave glowing praise to the job
general manager Randy Smith was doing but stopped short of praising
Bell.
	   ``He's had a difficult job in terms of mixing very young players
with veterans and being able to deal with it when it's not going
well,'' Ilitch said Friday.
	   Bell said his relationship with Smith, once warm, had grown
cold.
	   ``Our relationship hasn't been good for a while,'' Bell said.
``I think it was just the losing and we both got tired of it. At
the end, there was no communication at all.''
	   Smith, who hired Bell to replace Sparky Anderson following the
1995 season, said that Bell brought the situation to a head when he
insisted on knowing now exactly where he stood. Smith said if Bell
had not forced the issue he would have been kept through this
season, and possibly the start of next season.
	   It was the first managing job for Bell, 47, who finished with a
184-277 record. His winning percentage of .399 is the third worst
of any Tigers manager since 1901.
	   The Tigers won 79 games last season, an improvement of 26 games
over 1996 and expected to be more competitive this season. But
Detroit got off to a 4-17 start and never recovered.
	   In Bell's first season, 1996, the Tigers lost 109 games. Their
improvement in 1997 to 79-83 was the best ever among the 19 teams
with 109-loss seasons.
	   Parrish, 44, is in his seventh season with the Detroit
organization. He has managed at four minor league stops. The last
was in 1996 when he took over Double A Jacksonville for the second
half of the season and led the Suns to the second-half title and
the Southern League championship.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A British police detective dispatched to the
Bahamas to investigate the murder of a British tourist was robbed
at gunpoint within hours of arriving, Scotland Yard said Wednesday.
	   Detective Superintendent Brian Morris, from Scotland Yard's
organised crime group, was threatened in Nassau after arriving last
week to help local police investigate the murder of Joanne Clarke,
a 24-year-old British tourist whose body was found Aug. 22 in
bushes on Cabbage Beach in Paradise Island, an upscale resort near
Nassau.
	   A post-mortem found Clarke, from Oxfordshire in England, had
been strangled and sexually assaulted.
	   Hours after her body was found, a second corpse was discovered
nearby, thought to be that of 32-year-old Lori Fogleman, a
second-grade teacher from Richmond, Virginia. She disappeared July
20.
	   Investigators believe the two deaths may be related.
	   The Bahamas government had asked U.S. and British experts to
help with the investigation.
	   A Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said Morris' watch and ``some cash'' were stolen, but
that he was not harmed.
	   ``Like anyone would be, he was a bit shaken, but he has a job to
do and carried on as normal,'' added Bahamas Deputy High
Commissioner Phil Culligan.

Venus Williams breezes into second round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Williams victory; will be UPDATED with Rafter
match. &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For 40 minutes, Venus Williams blistered the
court with serves, volleys and groundstrokes, just about all of
them winners.
	   Finally Elena Wagner cracked.
	   Losing 11 straight games to go from a 1-0 lead to two points
away from U.S. Open elimination can make a woman do desperate
things. So Wagner, down 1-6, 0-5, 0-30, took a gamble _ she served
underhand.
	   It didn't work.
	   On Tuesday night, with Williams across the net in
off-the-shoulder, yellow-and-blue splendor, matching hair beads
bouncing and an all-star crowd including Olympic track icon Carl
Lewis cheering, not much did.
	   Williams, the runner-up a year ago and a favorite this time to
score her first Grand Slam singles success, eased into the second
round with a 6-1, 6-0 victory, converting her sixth match point
eight minutes after Wagner's underhand service try plopped into the
bottom of the net.
	   ``I don't think that's ever happened before,'' the 18-year-old
fifth seed said. ``I don't know what I would have done if it had
been in _ probably taken it and come in behind it.
	   ``I was laughing, she was laughing, everybody was laughing.
There was no other alternative for her at that moment in time.''
	   At this moment, in the year's final Grand Slam event, Williams
owns perhaps the most glittering victory, an all-court, all-out
presentation of tennis skills.
	   It far surpassed the performance on Stadium Court earlier in the
day of another player with eyes on her first Slam, even though that
was a lopsided victory as well.
	   Lindsay Davenport showed a muscle game in a 6-0, 6-2 victory
over Catalina Cristea.
	   The hottest player on the women's tour with three straight West
Coast victories this summer and the Open's No. 2 seed, Davenport
had no problems against the world's 75th-ranked player, only
moments when things could have gone a bit better.
	   Davenport took just 16 minutes to complete a first-set shutout.
	   In the second set she had some hiccups _ six wasted break
points, for instance, and an embarrassing volley into the net on a
rare venture from the baseline _ but nothing worth more than a
frustrated squeal.
	   Cristea, a 22-year-old from Romania, tried to punch it out with
Davenport, but she was badly overmatched. Davenport's shots started
high and hard, clipping the lines and corners and skittering away
from Cristea. Davenport saved the only break point against her and
allowed just eight points on her serve.
	   Williams held serve and more, never facing break point and
almost doubling Wagner's 31 points. Even her bad shots seemed to
turn into winners, bad choices into miraculous recoveries.
	   And then came the underhand serve, reminiscent of Michael
Chang's tactics against a heavily favored Ivan Lendl on the way to
the French Open championship in 1989, with Chang cramping so badly
he could hardly walk.
	   It was Wagner's first serve at 0-30, and the second _ more
conventional, except for direction _ sailed wide, giving Williams
triple-match point. It took five deuces and some of the best tennis
of the night by Wagner, a 26-year-old German ranked 68th, before
the inevitable came. A forehand winner wrapped it up.
	   Williams said the best was yet to come, from her and other young
players.
	   ``In five years, I'll be 23,'' she said with a grin. ``All the
players are improving, getting faster and stronger, and those who
don't will be passed by. It's just going to keep improving.''
	   Davenport, who won the Olympic gold medal as a 20-year-old in
1996, and Williams are top challengers to No. 1 Martina Hingis'
attempt to repeat as Open champion.
	   But the women's field is loaded, as a glance around the National
Tennis Center showed on a perfect late-summer afternoon.
	   Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, seeded third, scored a 6-4, 6-3
victory over Jennifer Capriati, who is in the midst of another
comeback from personal wanderings.
	   French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the fourth seed,
won 6-2, 6-2 over Kristina Brandi.
	   Eighth-seeded Steffi Graf, a five-time champion trying to find
the spark that gave her a Grand Slam sweep a decade ago, survived a
second-set blip to beat Corina Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
	   Former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce, the 12th seed, also
needed three sets before beating Meike Babel 6-1, 4-6, 6-2. And
Anna Kournikova, seeded 15th, beat Lea Ghirardi 6-1, 6-3.
	   Things were tighter in the men's draw, but still stayed mostly
on form, with power ruling, too, on courts the players say are
juiced up from a year ago.
	   Greg Rusedski, last year's runner-up and the sixth seed this
time, survived a five-set battle of 120-mph serves with Wayne
Ferreira, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4.
	   Fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champ, had 16
aces as he beat Arnaud Clement 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. Jonas Bjorkman, the
12th seed, defeated Cedric Pioline 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (3-7) 6-2.
And Australia's ``Scud Stud,'' Mark Philippoussis, controlled his
big serves enough to beat Christian Ruud 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.
	   ``It was quick,'' Philippoussis said of the court surface. ``The
ball was bouncing up high. It's great for me, so I'm not
complaining.''

Mexican president makes major speech amid economic jitters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, UPDATING throughout with end of speech, Zedillo
addressing bank bailout, financial issues, no mention of Chiapas
problems
 &UR; AP photos staffing. XMO105-109

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo delivered his state
of the nation address Tuesday night, assuring a nervous country
that his government is taking steps to control rising crime and
economic turmoil.
	   Zedillo also defended the government's bank bailout proposal,
which has become Mexico's hottest political issue. And he
criticized ``cynical displays of impunity'' by financiers accused
of looting the nation's banking system.
	   In a wide-ranging speech to an increasingly critical
opposition-led Congress, Zedillo also defended his administration's
record in education, health care, environmental and other issues.
	   He called on Mexicans to combat the nation's problems through
cooperation and democracy.
	   ``We Mexicans have fought for democracy because this is the
system that allows us to confront challenges,'' he said.
	   He outlined his government's economic achievements since the
1994 peso crisis: steady growth with unemployment falling and
inflation kept under control.
	   Zedillo also promised to propose tough judicial reforms aimed at
both common crimes such as robbery and financial crimes.
	   ``The citizens are rightfully demanding laws that protect
them,'' he said. ``Public security is something the state owes to
its citizens.''
	   ``I will propose punishments much more severe for crimes of a
financial and fiscal character, which have grave repercussions for
the country,'' Zedillo said of the bankers accused of fraud.
	   Zedillo's 1-hour, 40-minute speech lacked some of the fanfare of
previous addresses. Unlike in other years, the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, didn't bus in supporters
to rally in behalf of the president.
	   He spoke to a Congress that has just completed its first year in
opposition control and has angrily fought his proposal to assume
the debts of the bank savings protection fund. Most of the debts,
now worth about dlrs 55 billion, followed the 1994 peso crisis. At
the time, Zedillo's government, without Congress' approval, agreed
to take responsiblity for the debt.
	   Zedillo said if the government hadn't acted then, the results
would have been devastating.
	   ``With the collapse of the banking and payment system, the
entire nation's economy would have been paralyzed,'' he said.
``That would have meant the immediate unemployment of millions of
people and many other serious social consequences.''
	   Opposition parties say taxpayers are being asked to pay the
debts of still-wealthy millionaires. Sen. Gabriel Jimenez Renus of
the center-right National Action Party said in a speech before the
presidential address that the proposal reflects ``the brazen
arrogance'' of Zedillo's presidency.
	   Zedillo's speech came as global economic conditions have taken a
toll on the country. Plunging prices for oil, which funds much of
the federal budget, have forced the government to cut spending.
	   Worldwide turmoil in stock and currency markets have dropped the
Mexican stock market to levels not seen since 1995.
	   The peso has lost about 27 percent of its value over the past
year, renewing fears of inflation and of growth-stifling
interest-rake hikes.
	   Zedillo said the government has done the best it can to cope
with the problems and that he expected it to grow an average of 5
percent from 1996 to 2000.
	   In his speech, Zedillo never mentioned the problems in the
southern state of Chiapas, where the Zapatista National Liberation
Army staged an uprising in January 1994 in the name of greater
democracy and Indian rights.
	   Talks have been stalled for two years and tensions remain high
between Zapatista sympathizers and government supporters. The
government has been criticized for failing to reach a peace.

McGwire breaks Hack Wilson's NL record with two homers

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mark McGwire broke Hack Wilson's 68-year-old
National League record for home runs in a season, hitting his 56th
and 57th Tuesday night against the Florida Marlins.
	   McGwire homered against Livan Hernandez leading off the seventh
inning, sending a 1-1 pitch an estimated 450 feet (135 meters) onto
the tarp in center field to give the St. Louis Cardinals a 5-1
lead.
	   Two innings later, McGwire hit the first pitch from Donn Pall to
almost the same spot. This time the estimated distance was 472 feet
(141 meters).
	   McGwire began the night tied with Sammy Sosa at 55 homers in
their race to break Roger Maris' major-league record of 61.
	   The crowd gave McGwire a standing ovation each time, and he
responded with a pair of curtain calls in front of the dugout.
	   It was McGwire's seventh multihomer game this season and the
50th of his career.
	   Wilson's home run record was set in 1930 for the Chicago Cubs.
He also had 190 runs batted in that season, still the major league
record. McGwire's latest homers gave him 121 RBIs.
	   McGwire flied out, singled and grounded out in his first three
at-bats. Before he homered in the seventh, he was batting just .222
(6-for-27) this season against the Marlins, who have the worst
pitching staff in the National League.
	   But McGwire hit a 545-foot (163-meter) homer, his longest of the
season, against Hernandez in St. Louis on May 16. The Marlins'
right-hander has allowed 31 homers this season _ third-most in the
National League.
	   Entering the game, McGwire led the majors with 141 walks, a .724
slugging percentage and .472 on-base percentage.

World Cup event canceled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A round of the World Cup aerial
skiing event at Mt. Buller has been canceled because of a lack of
snow, an event official said Wednesday.
	   Warm weather conditions have produced below average falls
throughout the southern hemisphere.
	   Buller Ski Lifts general manager Laurie Blampied it was a
reluctant decision to call off the Sept. 12-13 event.
	   ``It's very disappointing that the event won't be held but
unfortunately this is not a problem unique to Australia,'' Blampied
said. ``Last year's World Cup season in Europe saw seven events
moved or canceled.''
	   The slopes have remained open for recreational skiers but were
not considered up to par for a World Cup event, Blampied said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo delivered his state

	   Zedillo also defended the government's bank bailout proposal,

	   He outlined his government's economic achievements since the

sacrifice.
	   Plunging prices for oil, which finances much of the federal

currency markets in turmoil, the Mexican stock market has fallen to
levels not seen since 1995, and the peso's value has dropped about

	   '' I must be the first to warn the circumstances in which our
economy will operate in the near future will be difficult,'' said

	   ``We had no choice but to confront the economic emergency,'' he
said. ``The only responsible course was to take the measures
necessary to solve the economic crisis, despite the high political
cost to the government.''
	   But he promised to crack down on bankers, executives and
stockholders who, through negligence or fraud, contributed to the
crisis.
	   ``Those individuals have wronged depositors, the banks that have
acted with professionalism, stockholders who in good faith invested
in the defrauded banks and above all, the Mexican people,'' he
said.
	   Zedillo said he would propose judicial reforms aimed at both
financial crimes and common crime.
	   He never mentioned the problems in the southern Chiapas state,

	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ They seemed like such a perfect fit for
the Old Course at St. Andrews, a stacked deck for the United States
at the Alfred Dunhill Cup.
	   The American team has Tiger Woods, perhaps the most gifted
player in golf and No. 1 in the world rankings the past 11 weeks,
and Mark O'Meara, winner of the Masters and British Open and a
shoo-in for player of the year.
	   And then there's John Daly. Right now, who knows which Daly will
show up when the 16-nation Dunhill Cup begins Oct. 8.
	   Will it be the Daly whose awesome length off the tee and
surprisingly soft touch around the greens gave him his second major
championship at St. Andrews in the 1995 British Open? The Daly
whose last six tournaments _ four missed cuts, one withdrawal and
one disqualification _ make him look like a Q-school graduate
struggling to keep his card?
	   Or the Daly so overcome by the shakes and chills from his
ongoing battle to stay sober that he began crying on the 15th hole
last week in Vancouver, British Columbia, and finished the first
round wearing two jackets in summer weather?
	   Will Daly even be there?
	   At Pebble Beach last month, after rushing through a round of
2-over-74, Daly suggested it might be best for him to bail out of
the Dunhill.
	   ``I wouldn't help Tiger and Mark right now,'' he said at the
time, frustrated that hours he had invested in practice had not
paid off. ``I'd only be hurting the team.''
	   That hasn't been lost on International Management Group, one of
chief organizers of the Dunhill Cup and the agency that represents
Woods and O'Meara.
	   ``Only John can determine what's in his best interest,'' said
Alistair Johnston, head of IMG's golf division. ``His performance _
one way or the other _ will impact the other two players on his
team. I've got to believe that Woods and O'Meara are not playing
the Alfred Dunhill Cup without any sense but the ambition to win
it, and they would hope John will do the right thing.''
	   IMG sounds as if its idea of the ``right thing'' would be for
Daly to pull out. The Dunhill Cup is by invitation, although
Johnston said Daly's invitation will not be withdrawn ``at this
point.''
	   And Daly's camp doesn't expect that he will take himself off the
team.
	   ``I don't see why he would withdraw, unless he felt personally
not able to help the team,'' said his agent, John Mascatello.
``John has played St. Andrews twice. He believes the venue is one
he is comfortable at. And he feels his game is close.''
	   Daly joined Fred Couples and Payne Stewart for the Dunhill Cup
in 1993, winning four of his five matches in a U.S. victory. Three
of those wins came against members of Europe's Ryder Cup team that
year.
	   ``He thinks it would be an honor to play with Mark, who has won
two majors this year, and Tiger, who is still No. 1 in the world,''
Mascatello said. ``Now, he's got something even more to fight for,
and he's looking forward to it.''
	   Ely Callaway, who signed Daly to an endorsement deal last year
after he emerged from alcohol rehabilitation, plans to meet with
him this week.
	   ``If anything, we encourage him to get into competition only
when he's in physically very good shape,'' Callaway said. ``We're
urging him to get in good shape, and then play.''
	   Despite the 18 he took on one hole at the Bay Hill Invitational,
the 10 he took from a greenside bunker on the 18th at Royal
Birkdale to miss the cut at the British Open and the snapped
5-iron, scorecard-tearing incident in Memphis, Tenn., Daly has
shown more fight than quit this year _ even if the score doesn't
reflect it.
	   He believes his best golf is in front of him, although at times
he has trouble seeing it.
	   ``I hit it great and nothing happens,'' Daly said. ``I finally
start caring and it hurts even more.''
	   In 17 of his last 48 rounds, Daly has shot a 75 or worse,
including an 80 in the first round of the PGA Championship. But he
keeps bombing away from the tee and staying away from the bars. He
was scared and fractured at Vancouver, but never considered walking
off the course as he had done before in situations much less dire.
	   ``When I finished the 18th in the first round, I was just so
happy that I was going to be playing (Friday),'' Daly said. He went
out and shot a 1-under 70.
	   The Dunhill Cup, featuring five rounds of match play, is five
weeks away, and Daly wants to be there. In his two previous trips
to St. Andrews, he felt like a winner on the course and a loser off
it.
	   This time, he would like nothing more than to prove he can have
it both ways.

Players Association taking root; Tear Drop tries to acquire Lynx
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ The Tour Players Association is gaining
momentum.
	   It started with questionnaires left in players' lockers,
followed by two meetings during the Sprint International. The next
step? Leonard Decof, hired to represent the fledgling group, said
he expects federal paperwork to officially create the TPA to be
filed this week.
	   ``This is not a confrontational situation,'' said Decof, who
represented Ping in its successful lawsuit against the PGA Tour and
who now is working for Callaway Golf in its equipment battle with
the USGA.
	   The issues are the usual suspects _ power and money. A small
group of players behind the association want a stronger voice in
forming PGA Tour policy. They also want to know how much money is
coming into PGA Tour coffers and where it is going.
	   ``Is this about power?'' said Mark Brooks, who along with Larry
Rinker and Danny Edwards is spearheading the effort. ``In a way it
is. It's about being more involved.''
	   The development comes at a critical juncture in tour history.
	   A network deal kicks in next year that will increase prize money
from dlrs 96.4 million this year to dlrs 129.8 million in 1999.
Next year is also the start of the World Championship of Golf
series, which some players view as the rich getting richer. The
limited-field events each offer a dlrs 5 million purse, which will
count as official money.
	   And the power?
	   The PGA Tour Policy Board consists of four players, four
corporate representatives and a PGA of America official. To amend
Tour bylaws, however, it takes a two-thirds vote of the board of
directors.
	   Among the TPA's goals are to ``promote and protect the common
interests'' of players; to acquire ``for the benefit of its members
financial and other information'' concerning Tour operation; to
negotiate for matters such as ``playing conditions, rights and
privileges,'' and to ``promote the welfare of its members.''
	   Tom Lehman, for one, believes players should be paid a stipend
just for showing up, regardless if they make the cut. Mark O'Meara
has campaigned recently to pay Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup players
for their services _ although a dlrs 5 million event for only those
players should take care of that.
	   How fast _ and how strong _ the association grows could be
determined by the end of the year. Two dozen players attended the
meetings in Colorado, and more meetings are scheduled for the
Greater Milwaukee Open and the Canadian Open.
	   ``I'm surprised how quickly it has begun to pick up steam,''
Decof said.
	   Among those opposed to the group are Davis Love III, a Policy
Board member, and Brad Faxon, a former member. Love says he
wouldn't be surprised if the plan eventually was ignored.
	   ``There are probably 10 or 15 guys on that side and 10 or 15
guys that are adamant on the sensible side, the tour side,'' Love
said. ``The rest of the guys don't care.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DUVAL ROLLS ON: &LR;  Just 11 months ago, David Duval was fielding
questions about whether he would ever win on the PGA Tour. Six
victories later, Duval has joined an exclusive class of players who
have won three tournaments in consecutive years.
	   Since 1960, the only other eight players who have accomplished
that are in the Hall of Fame or headed there _ Jack Nicklaus,
Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Raymond Floyd, Tom Watson, Lee
Trevino, Johnny Miller and Nick Price.
	   The dlrs 2,070,283 he has made this year is a tour record,
although there are eight tournaments left before the Tour
Championship, which offers dlrs 720,000 to the winner. Still, if
Duval can repeat his October heroics of last year, the chance to be
golf's first dlrs 3 million man is not out of the question.
	   At a time when most players are scaling back, Duval will
probably play a little more; after playing the Lancome Trophy in
Paris, he plans to enter the Buick Challenge in Georgia. Then he
has three titles to defend _ the Michelob Championship, the
National Rental Car Disney Classic and the Tour Championship.
	   ``I'd have to win at the Tour Championship,'' he said of topping
dlrs 3 million. ``And then, obviously I'd have to play real well in
the other events. It's a possibility.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIGER TAMERS: &LR;  Tiger Woods says it's time for him to be treated
like every other player on the PGA Tour _ and that starts with his
pre-tournament appearances in the media center.
	   Since he turned pro in Milwaukee two years ago, Woods has never
played a PGA Tour event without holding a 30-minute session _
usually longer _ with reporters.
	   ``That's going to stop, because it makes no sense for me to do
this every single week when I'm not the defending champ and I've
already been to the site before,'' Woods said. ``To be obligated to
have to do it, where some of the other top pros don't have to do it
every single week they play, then I think that's a problem that
we're going to have to try to address.''

Venus Williams forces opponent into desperate serve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For 40 minutes, Venus Williams blistered the
court with serves, volleys and groundstrokes, all of them going a
gazillion miles (kilometers) an hour and all of them winners.
	   That's when Elena Wagner cracked.
	   Losing 11 straight games to go from a 1-0 lead to two points
away from U.S. Open elimination can make a woman do desperate
things. So Wagner, down 1-6, 0-5, 0-30, took a gamble _ she served
underhand.
	   It didn't work.
	   On Tuesday night, with Williams across the net in
off-the-shoulder, yellow-and-blue splendor, matching hair beads
bouncing and an all-star crowd including Olympic track icon Carl
Lewis cheering, not much did.
	   Williams, the runner-up a year ago and a favorite this time to
score her first Grand Slam singles success, eased into the second
round with a 6-1, 6-0 victory, converting her sixth match point
eight minutes after Wagner's underhand service try plopped into the
bottom of the net.
	   ``I don't think that's ever happened before,'' the 18-year-old
fifth seed said. ``I don't know what I would have done if it had
been in _ probably taken it and come in behind it.
	   ``I was laughing, she was laughing, everybody was laughing.
There was no other alternative for her at that moment in time.''
	   At this moment, in the year's final Grand Slam event, Williams
owns perhaps the most glittering victory, an all-court, all-out
presentation of tennis skills.
	   Williams held serve and more, never facing break point and
almost doubling Wagner's 31 points. Even her bad shots seemed to
turn into winners, bad choices into miraculous recoveries.
	   And then came the underhand serve, reminiscent of Michael
Chang's tactics against a heavily favored Ivan Lendl on the way to
the French Open championship in 1989, with Chang cramping so badly
he could hardly walk.
	   It was Wagner's first serve at 0-30, and the second _ more
conventional, except for direction _ sailed wide, giving Williams
triple-match point. It took five deuces and some of the best tennis
of the night by Wagner, a 26-year-old German ranked 68th, before
the inevitable came. A forehand winner wrapped it up.
	   Williams said the best was yet to come, from her and other young
players.
	   ``In five years, I'll be 23,'' she said with a grin. ``All the
players are improving, getting faster and stronger, and those who
don't will be passed by. It's just going to keep improving.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo delivered his state
of the nation address, assuring a nervous country that his
government is taking steps to control rising crime and economic
turmoil.
	   Zedillo also defended the government's bank bailout proposal,
which has become Mexico's hottest political issue, and criticized
the ``cynical displays of impunity'' by unscrupulous financiers
accused of looting the nation's banking system.
	   In a wide-ranging speech Tuesday night to an increasingly
critical opposition-led Congress, Zedillo also defended his
administration's record in education, health care, environmental
and other issues.
	   He outlined his government's economic achievements since the
1994 peso crisis: steady growth with unemployment falling and
inflation kept under control. But he predicted more hardships and
sacrifice.
	   Plunging prices for oil, which finances much of the federal
budget, have forced the government to cut spending. With stock and
currency markets in turmoil, the Mexican stock market has fallen to
levels not seen since 1995, and the peso's value has dropped about
27 percent.
	   '' I must be the first to warn the circumstances in which our
economy will operate in the near future will be difficult,'' said
Zedillo, whose 1-hour, 40-minute speech lacked some of the fanfare
of previous addresses, when the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, bused in supporters to rally on behalf
of the president.
	   Zedillo spoke to a Congress that has just completed its first
year in opposition control and has angrily fought his proposal to
assume the debts of the bank savings protection fund. Most of the
debts, now worth about dlrs 55 billion, followed the 1994 peso
crisis. At the time, Zedillo's government, without Congress'
approval, agreed to take responsibility for the debt.
	   Opposition parties say taxpayers are being asked to pay the
debts of still-wealthy millionaires. Sen. Gabriel Jimenez Remus of
the center-right National Action Party said in an earlier speech
that the proposal reflects ``the brazen arrogance'' of Zedillo's
presidency.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Mark McGwire homered twice, raising his season
total to 57 and breaking Hack Wilson's 68-year-old NL record as the
St. Louis Cardinals beat the Florida Marlins 7-1 Tuesday night.
	   McGwire hit a 450-foot (137-meter) drive off Livan Hernandez
(10-11) leading off the seventh, then hit a 472-foot (144-meter)
shot to nearly the same spot off Done Pall leading off the ninth.
	   It was McGwire's seventh multihomer game this season and the
50th of his career, leaving him four short of Roger Maris' record
with 24 games left. He began the night tied with Sammy Sosa at 55
homers in their race to break Maris' 37-year-old record.
	   Matt Morris (5-4) allowed one run in seven innings.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Reds 5
	   In Chicago, Sosa went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts, but Mark
Grace hit a go-ahead homer in the eighth off Gabe White (5-4).
	   Matt Karchner (2-0) worked one inning for the win and Rod Beck
got three outs for his 41st save.
 &UR; Braves 6, Astros 4
	   In Atlanta, Javy Lopez kept up a torrid pace by homering in his
fourth straight game.
	   Lopez's three-run homer highlighted a four-run fourth inning.
After Houston rallied to the game at 4, Ozzie Guillen drove in the
winning run with a two-out single in the sixth off Scott Elarton
(1-1)
	   The Braves, who squandered a two-run lead in the ninth inning on
Monday, got three scoreless innings from their bullpen, capped off
by Kerry Ligtenberg's 25th save. Denny Neagle (14-11) got the win
despite allowing 10 hits and all four runs in six innings.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 4, Pirates 3
	   In Pittsburgh, Omar Daal (7-9) struck out a franchise-record 12
batters in eight innings and Arizona scored all of its runs in the
first two innings.
	   Playing in Pittsburgh for the first time, the Diamondbacks won
their fourth in a row to match the longest winning streak in their
brief history. They had two other four-game streaks earlier this
season.
	   Gregg Olson finished up for his 24th save. Chris Peters (7-9)
was the loser.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Wednesday morning amid lingering concern over the recent volatility
on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks gained moderately.
	   The U.S. currency bought 137.17 yen at late morning, down 1.05
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 139.25 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 103.65 points,
or 0.72 percent, ending the morning session at 14,473.28. It had
gained 261.74 points, or 1.86 percent, the previous day.
	   The dollar fell as low as 135 yen in New York Tuesday on
nervousness about the plunge in U.S. stock prices Monday, but then
strengthened as the Dow Jones industrial average recovered, traders
said.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow rose 288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, to
7,827.43 _ the second-biggest point gain in history.
	   Still, on Wednesday in Tokyo, U.S. hedge funds were selling the
dollar on remaining uncertainty over the direction of U.S. stock
prices, traders said.
	   While most Japanese investors bought it on the notion the recent
falls in the Dow may have ended with Wall Street's rebound Tuesday,
some U.S. hedge funds sold the currency on sentiment to the
contrary.
	   The two forces thus offset each other to hold the dollar just
above 137 yen, traders said.
	   ``U.S. investors seem still worried about U.S. stock prices,''
said Tetsu Aikawa, senior trader at Sanwa Bank. ``Some of them are
continuing to unwind their dollar-long positions on a large
scale.''
	   The Japanese government welcomed the more robust yen, with a top
official saying the currency was turning the tide against the
dollar.
	   ``I think a trend of correction has begun,'' said Haruhiko
Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's Ministry of
Finance.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices advanced as investors were
reassured by Tuesday's hefty gains on Wall Street.
	   A report that an opposition party backs a ruling party plan for
dealing with troubled banks also buoyed the market, they said.
	   Naoto Kan, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, said in an
interview published Wednesday by the Mainichi newspaper that his
party won't block a plan to inject public funds into sickly banks
if they fully disclose the extent of their financial woes.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was up 13.90 points, or 1.25 percent,
to 1,124.05. On Tuesday, it rose 3.66 points, or 0.33 percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.100 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.075 percent,
driving its price down to 112.40 yen from 112.60 yen.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Wells almost did it again.
	   Wells flirted with his second perfect game of the year as the
New York Yankees defeated the Oakland Athletics 7-0 Tuesday night.
	   There have never been two perfect games in the same season. But
for six innings, it looked like Wells (17-2) might push Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa out of the headlines for a night.
	   Wells, who retired all 27 Minnesota Twins on May 17 at Yankee
Stadium, retired his first 20 batters in order. With two outs in
the seventh, he hung an 0-2 breaking ball that Jason Giambi hit
softly into center field for a single.
	   Wells, 11-0 at home this season, finished with a two-hitter and
struck out a season-high 13. He has five shutouts this year, tying
Atlanta's Greg Maddux for the major league lead, and has seven
complete games.
	   Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez homered for the Yankees, who
got their 99th win in their 136th game. The 1954 Cleveland Indians
hold the AL record for reaching 100 wins fastest, getting No. 100
in their 140th game.
	   Tom Candiotti (10-15) allowed seven runs and 12 hits in seven
innings.
 &UR; White Sox 9, Orioles 5
	   In Baltimore, Albert Belle set a club record with his 42nd home
run and drove in four runs as the Chicago White Sox sent the
Baltimore Orioles to their ninth straight defeat.
	   Belle's fourth-inning solo shot off Doug Drabek broke the White
Sox single-season mark, set in 1993 by Frank Thomas. His three-run
double in the ninth gave him 337 total bases, breaking the club
record of 336 set by Joe Jackson in 1920.
	   Belle, who went 2-for-2 with three walks, has homered in two
straight games and has 23 since the All-Star break. He has already
set the Chicago single-season record for extra-base hits.
	   Rookie Jim Parque (5-5) allowed three runs in six innings to
help Chicago to its seventh win in nine games.
	   Drabek (6-10), activated from the disabled list before the game,
allowed five runs and four hits in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Mariners 7, Red Sox 3
	   In, Boston, reliever Derek Lowe's throwing error led to two
unearned runs to put Seattle ahead in the seventh inning as the
Mariners got their first road victory this season over the Boston
Red Sox, 7-3 on Tuesday night.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. went 1-for-3 with a single and remained at 47
homers, most in the AL.
	   Jay Buhner walked in the seventh and took second on Russ Davis'
single. Lowe (3-8) fielded Dan Wilson's sacrifice bunt and threw
wildly past second baseman Donnie Sadler, who was covering first.
Buhner scored, Davis reached second and Wilson took third.
	   David Bell broke the 3-3 tie with a groundout to score Wilson.
	   Seattle added three runs in the eighth for its first win in five
games at Fenway Park this year as Jamie Moyer (12-8) improved to
4-0 since his last loss on Aug. 1.
 &UR; Tigers 12, Rangers 8
	   In Detroit, Deivi Cruz broke a tie with his first grand slam as
Detroit beat Texas a few hours after Tigers manager Buddy Bell was
fired and replaced on an interim basis by coach Larry Parrish.
	   Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez homered for the Rangers, who
remained 2 1/2 games behind Anaheim for the AL West lead. Juan
Gonzalez raised his RBI total to 144, tying the team record he set
two years ago.
	   Cruz, who also tripled, drove in a career-high four runs to back
Matt Anderson (3-1).
	   Tim Crabtree (4-1), who was responsible for two of the three
runners Cruz drove in, was the loser.
 &UR; Indians 7, Angels 6
	   In Cleveland, Mark Whiten had an RBI single in the ninth off
Omar Olivares to give Cleveland the victory.
	   After rookie Richie Sexson failed for the second time in the
game to sacrifice with runners at first and second, Whiten lined
the game-winning hit to left-center to score David Justice.
	   Steve Reed (2-2) got four outs for the win as the Indians got
their 14th last at-bat victory and eighth at home.
	   Rich DeLucia (2-5) allowed one run on two hits in two innings of
relief.
 &UR; Blue Jays 2, Royals 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Alex Gonzalez and Shannon Stewart
homered and Chris Carpenter allowed four hits in seven innings as
Toronto won its fifth straight.
	   Jose Offerman's triple and two doubles accounted for three of
the hits off Carpenter (10-7), who won for the fourth time in five
decisions. The Blue Jays (72-66) are a season-high six games over
.500.
	   Tim Belcher (12-11), who beat Carpenter 7-2 in Toronto last
Wednesday with a three-hitter, allowed 10 hits in eight innings.
Belcher has given up 30 home runs, second in the AL to Cleveland's
Charles Nagy, who has 33.
